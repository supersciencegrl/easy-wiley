         <title>Prussian Blue Nanozyme as a Pyroptosis Inhibitor Alleviates Neurodegeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent intrinsic reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging properties, intra&#8208;cerebroventricular injection of Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) reduces the production of mitochondrial ROS induced by 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), inhibits the activation of microglial nucleotide&#8208;binding domain and leucine&#8208;rich repeat family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and downstream pyroptosis of microglia, and further rescues the loss of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP&#8208;induced cell and mouse models of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Current pharmacological interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unsatisfactory in clinical settings. Inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis represents a potential therapeutic target for the alleviation of neurodegenerative diseases. The development of inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis agonists or antagonists may transform the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the identification of specific compounds that inhibit pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) is revealed as a pyroptosis inhibitor to alleviate the neurodegeneration in mouse and cell models of PD. PBzyme protects the microglia and neurons against 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). PBzyme alleviates motor deficits, attenuates the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential, and rescues dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, intra&#8208;cerebroventricular injection of PBzyme reduces dopaminergic degeneration and inhibits neuroinflammation in an MPTP&#8208;induced PD mouse model. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that PBzyme reduces the activation of microglial nucleotide&#8208;binding domain and leucine&#8208;rich repeat family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes and caspase&#8208;1 by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thereby downregulating gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage as well as inflammatory factor production, and eventually leading to the inhibition of microglia pyroptosis. Overall, this work highlights the neuroprotective effects of PBzyme as a pyroptosis inhibitor and provides valuable mechanistic insights and a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Synthetic Strategies to Advanced Optical&#8208;Electrical&#8208;Magnetic Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the synthesis of 2D COF powders, single crystals, and thin films, as well as their advanced optical, electrical, and magnetic functionalities are systematically summarized. The challenging issues and potential opportunities are also proposed for further inspiring their development in structure, synthesis, and functionalities.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), an emerging class of organic crystalline polymers with highly oriented structures and permanent porosity, can adopt 2D or 3D architectures depending on the different topological diagrams of the monomers. Notably, 2D COFs have particularly gained much attention due to the extraordinary merits of their extended in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation and topologically ordered columnar &#960;&#8208;arrays. These properties together with high crystallinity, large surface area, and tunable porosity distinguish 2D COFs as an ideal candidate for the fabrication of functional materials. Herein, this review surveys the recent research advances in 2D COFs with special emphasis on the preparation of 2D COF powders, single crystals, and thin films, as well as their advanced optical, electrical, and magnetic functionalities. Some challenging issues and potential research outlook for 2D COFs are also provided for promoting their development in terms of structure, synthesis, and functionalities.

         <title>Harnessing Plasma&#8208;Assisted Doping Engineering to Stabilize Metallic Phase MoSe2 for Fast and Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adopting a novel plasma&#8208;assisted doping&#8208;triggered phase&#8208;transition engineering, stabilized P&#8208;doped metallic phase selenide molybdenum (MoSe2) nanoflower composites (P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs) with expanded interlayer spacing, metallic electronic conductivity, facilitated Na+ adsorption, and reduced Na+ diffusion barrier are fabricated for high&#8208;performance sodium storage. The underlying mechanism analysis provides informative guide for designing advanced materials for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.








Abstract
Metallic&#8208;phase selenide molybdenum (1T&#8208;MoSe2) has become a rising star for sodium storage in comparison with its semiconductor phase (2H&#8208;MoSe2) owing to the intrinsic metallic electronic conductivity and unimpeded Na+ diffusion structure. However, the thermodynamically unstable nature of 1T phase renders it an unprecedented challenge to realize its phase control and stabilization. Herein, a plasma&#8208;assisted P&#8208;doping&#8208;triggered phase&#8208;transition engineering is proposed to synthesize stabilized P&#8208;doped 1T phase MoSe2 nanoflower composites (P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs). Mechanism analysis reveals significantly decreased phase&#8208;transition energy barriers of the plasma&#8208;induced Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich MoSe2 from 2H to 1T owing to its low crystallinity and reduced structure stability. The vacancy&#8208;rich structure promotes highly concentrated P doping, which manipulates the electronic structure of the MoSe2 and urges its phase transition, acquiring a high transition efficiency of 91% accompanied with ultrahigh phase stability. As a result, the P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs deliver an exceptional high reversible capacity of 510.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with no capacity fading over 1000 cycles at 5000&#160;mA g&#8722;1 for sodium storage. The underlying mechanism of this phase&#8208;transition engineering verified by profound analysis provides informative guide for designing advanced materials for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>A 3D Hierarchical Host with Enhanced Sodiophilicity Enabling Anode&#8208;Free Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous carbon particles with open channels allow rapid Na&#8208;ion flux, and evenly distributed carbon&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles on the carbon surface induce uniform Na deposition owing to the enhanced Na binding energy. The hierarchical host enables superior cycling performance as Na&#8208;metal anodes under extremely high current conditions as well as demonstration of anode&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered as a compliment to lithium&#8208;metal batteries for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries because of their low cost and the abundance of sodium (Na). Herein, a 3D nanostructured porous carbon particle containing carbon&#8208;shell&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles (PC&#8208;CFe) is employed as a highly reversible Na&#8208;metal host. PC&#8208;CFe has a unique 3D hierarchy based on sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized carbon particles, ordered open channels, and evenly distributed carbon&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles (CFe) on the surface. PC&#8208;CFe achieves high reversibility of Na plating/stripping processes over 500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 with 10 mAh cm&#8211;2 in Na//Cu asymmetric cells, as well as over 14&#160;400 cycles at 60&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in Na//Na symmetric cells. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior cycling performance of PC&#8208;CFe stems from the stronger adsorption of Na on the surface of the CFe, providing initial nucleation sites more favorable to Na deposition. Moreover, the full cell with a PC&#8208;CFe host without Na metal and a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (10&#160;mg cm&#8211;2) maintains a high capacity of 103 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 even after 100 cycles, demonstrating the operation of anode&#8208;free SMBs.

         <title>Searching for an Optimal Multi&#8208;metallic Alloy Catalyst by Active Learning Combined with Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Searching for an optimal component and composition of multi&#8208;metallic alloy catalysts, comprising two or more elements, is one of the key issues in catalysis research. Due to the exhaustive data requirement of conventional machine learning (ML) models and the high cost of experimental trials, current approaches rely mainly on the combination of density functional theory (DFT) and ML techniques. In this study, a significant step was taken toward overcoming limitations by the interplay of experiment and active learning to effectively search for an optimal component and composition of multi&#8208;metallic alloy catalysts. The active learning model is iteratively updated using by examining electro&#8208;catalytic performance of fabricated solid&#8208;solution nanoparticles for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). An optimal metal precursor composition of Pt0.65Ru0.30Ni0.05 exhibited an HER overpotential of 54.2&#160;mV, which is superior to that of a pure Pt catalyst. This result indicates the successful construction of the model by only utilizing the precursor mixture composition as input data, thereby improving the overpotential by searching for an optimal catalyst. This method appears to be widely applicable since it was able to determine an optimal component and composition of electrocatalyst without obvious restriction to the types of catalysts to which it can be applied.

         <title>Highly Efficient Cellular Acoustic Absorber of Graphene Ultrathin Drums</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient acoustic absorber is realized by integrating ultrathin graphene membranes into commercial polymer sponges, to fulfill the outstanding resonance properties of 2D graphene sheets in acoustic absorption and satisfy the urgent demands in acoustic absorption from noise protection, instruments to building design, and acoustic devices.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D graphene sheets exhibit unparalleled in&#8208;plane stiffness and large out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elasticity, thereby providing strong mechanical resonance for nanomechanical devices. The exceptional resonance behavior of ultrathin graphene, which promises the fabrication of superior acoustic absorption materials, however, remains unfulfilled for the lack of applicable form and assembly methods. Here, a highly efficient acoustic absorber is presented, wherein cellular networks of ultrathin graphene membranes are constructed into polymer foams. The ultrathin graphene drums exhibit strong resonances and efficiently dissipate sound waves in a broad frequency range. A record specific noise reduction coefficient (51.3 at 30&#160;mm) is achieved in the graphene&#8208;based acoustic absorber, fully realizing the superior resonance properties of graphene sheets. The scalable method facilely transforms commercial polymer foams to superior acoustic absorbers with a &#8776;320% enhancement in average absorption coefficient across wide frequencies from 200 to 6000&#160;Hz. The graphene acoustic absorber offers a convenient method to exploit the extraordinary resonance properties of 2D sheets, opening extensive new applications in noise protection, building design, instruments and acoustic devices.

         <title>Mulberry Leaves Derived Red Emissive Carbon Dots for Feeding Silkworms to Produce Brightly Fluorescent Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fluorescent silk has promising applications in dazzling textiles, biological engineering and medical products, but the natural bombyx mori silk has almost no fluorescence. Here carbon dots (CDs) made from mulberry leaves are reported, which have a strong near infrared fluorescence with absolute quantum yield (QY) of 73% and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 20&#160;nm. After feeding with such CDs, silkworms exhibit bright red fluorescence, grow healthily, cocoon normally and turn to moths finally. The cocoons are pink in daylight and show bright red fluorescence under ultraviolet (UV) light. After breaking out of such cocoons, the red emissive moths can mate and lay fluorescent eggs which would hatch normally. The growth cycle of the second generation of the test silkworm is the same as that of the control group, which means such CDs have excellent biocompatiblility. Dissection and analyses on both the test silkworms and cocoons disclose the metabolic route of CDs, i.e., the fluorescent CDs are absorbed by silkworms from alimentary canals, then transferred to silk glands, and finally to cocoons, while those unabsorbed CDs are excreted with the feces. All experimental results confirm the excellent biocompatibility and fluorescence stability of such CDs.

         <title>A gradient pH&#8208;sensitive polymer&#8208;based antiviral strategy via viroporin&#8208;induced membrane acidification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, lipid membrane&#8208;targeting strategies hold great promise for development of broad&#8208;spectrum antivirals. However, it remains a big challenge to identify novel membrane&#8208;based targets of viruses and virus&#8208;infected cells for development of precision targeted approaches. Here, we discover that viroporins, viral&#8208;encoded ion channels which have been reported to mediate release of hydrogen ions, trigger membrane acidification of virus&#8208;infected cells. Through development of a fine&#8208;scale library of gradient pH&#8208;sensitive (GPS) polymeric nanoprobes, we measure the cellular membrane pH transition from pH 6.8&#8208;7.1 (un&#8208;infection) to pH 6.5&#8208;6.8 (virus&#8208;infection). In response to the subtle pH alterations, the GPS polymer with sharp response at pH 6.8 (GPS6.8) selectively binds to virus&#8208;infected cell membranes or viral envelope, and even completely disrupts viral envelope. Accordingly, GPS6.8 treatment exerts suppressive effects on a wide variety of viruses including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 through triggering viral envelope lysis rather than affecting immune pathway or viability of host cells. Murine viral infection models exhibit that supplementation of GPS6.8 decreases viral titers and ameliorates inflammatory damage. Thus, the gradient pH&#8208;sensitive nanotechnology offers a promising strategy for accurate detection of biological pH environments and robust interference with viruses.

         <title>Patterning of Wafer&#8208;scale MXene Films for High&#8208;performance Image Sensor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As a rapidly growing family of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, MXenes have been recognized as promising materials for the development of future electronics and optoelectronics. So far, the reported patterning methods for MXene films lack efficiency, resolution and compatibility, resulting in limited device integration and performance. Here we report a high&#8208;performance MXene image sensor array fabricated by a wafer&#8208;scale combination patterning method of a MXene film. This method combines MXene centrifugation, spin&#8208;coating, photolithography and dry&#8208;etching and is highly compatible with mainstream semiconductor processing, with a resolution up to 2&#160;&#956;m, which is at least 100 times higher than other large&#8208;area patterning methods reported previously. As a result, we fabricated a high&#8208;density integrated array of 1024&#8208;pixel Ti3C2Tx/Si photodetectors with a detectivity of 7.73 &#215; 1014 Jones and a light&#8208;dark current ratio (Ilight/Idark) of 6.22 &#215; 106, which is the ultrahigh value among all reported MXene&#8208;based photodetectors. This patterning technique paves a way for large&#8208;scale high&#8208;performance MXetronics compatible with mainstream semiconductor processes.

         <title>Ultrahigh Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Efficiency and Selectivity Manipulation by Single&#8208;Tungsten&#8208;Atom Oxide at the Atomic Step of TiO2</title>

Abstract
The photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a sustainable route to the direct conversion of greenhouse gases into chemicals without additional energy consumption. Given the vast amount of greenhouse gas, numerous efforts have been devoted to developing inorganic photocatalysts, e.g., titanium dioxide (TiO2), due to their stability, low cost and environmentally friendly properties. However, a more efficient TiO2 photocatalyst without noble metals is highly desirable for CO2 reduction, and it is both difficult and urgent to produce selectively valuable compounds, including industrial chemicals and fuels, from TiO2. Here, we develop a novel &#8220;single&#8208;atom site at the atomic step&#8221; strategy by anchoring a single tungsten (W) atom site with oxygen&#8208;coordination at the intrinsic steps of classic TiO2 nanoparticle. The composition of active sites for CO2RR can be controlled by tuning the additional W5+, resulting in both significant CO2 reduction efficiency and selectivity for methane (CH4) over carbon monoxide (CO). The W5+&#8208;O&#8208;Ti3+&#8208;anchored catalysts achieved an ultrahigh photocatalytic CH4 production rate of 60.6 &#956;mol/g/h (86.5% selectivity), while the Ti3+&#8208;dominated catalysts achieved a CO production rate of 182.1 &#956;mol/g/h (88.2% selectivity); both exceed those of pristine TiO2 by more than one order of magnitude. The mechanism relies on the accurate control of the single&#8208;atom sites at step with 22.8% coverage of surface sites and the subsequent excellent electron&#8208;hole separation along with the favorable adsorption&#8208;desorption of intermediates at the sites. This approach not only provides a novel strategy for fabricating single inorganic catalytic sites with superior performance but also identifies the rational design mechanisms of efficient sites that can promote controllable production.

         <title>Engineering Macrophage Exosome Disguised Biodegradable Nanoplatform for Enhanced Sonodynamic Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biodegradable glioblastoma&#8208;tumor&#8208;targeted delivery system CSI@Ex&#8208;A is successfully fabricated for enhanced sonodynamic therapy. The AS1411 engineered macrophage exosome endows CSI@Ex&#8208;A with efficient BBB penetration and good cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting capability. The GSH depletion and O2&#8208;self&#8208;supplying enhanced sonodynamic therapy is achieved.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) exhibits high tissue penetration and negligible radiation damage to normal tissues, and thus emerges as a promising cancer therapeutic modality for glioblastoma (GBM). However, the blood&#8722;brain barrier (BBB) and hypoxic microenvironment greatly limit the SDT efficiency. In this work, a biodegradable nanoplatform (termed as CSI) is fabricated by encapsulating catalase (CAT) into silica nanoparticles (CAT@SiO2) for tumor hypoxia relief, and then loaded with the sonosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG). Inspired by the ability of macrophages to cross the BBB, CSI is further coated with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified macrophage exosomes to form CSI@Ex&#8208;A, which possesses efficient BBB penetration and good cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting capability. After tumor cell endocytosis, highly expressed glutathione (GSH) triggeres biodegradation of the nanoplatform and the released CAT catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia. The GSH depletion and O2 self&#8208;supplying effectively enhances the SDT efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the resulting CSI@Ex&#8208;A exhibits good biocompatibility and long circulation time. These findings demonstrate that CSI@Ex&#8208;A may serve as a competent nanoplatform for GBM therapy, with potential for clinical translation.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Mo2C Electrocatalyst Promoting the Polysulfide Redox Kinetics for Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient electrocatalytic conversion and adsorption of polysulfides are realized by combining a metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived porous carbon structure and introducing a conductive catalyst Mo2C. The synergistic effect of physical confinement and electrocatalysis improves the utilization rate and stability of S. It shows the excellent rate performance (483 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycle life (503 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles).








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries, as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage candidates, are drawing more and more attention due to the high energy density and abundant elements reserved in the earth. However, the native downsides of RT Na&#8208;S batteries (i.e., enormous volume changes, the polysulfide shuttle, and the insulation and low reactivity of S) impede their further application. To conquer these challenges, hierarchical porous hollow carbon polyhedrons embedded with uniform Mo2C nanoparticles are designed deliberately as the host for S. The micro&#8208; and&#160;mesoporous hollow carbon indeed dramatically enhances the reactivity of the S cathodes and&#160;accommodates the volume changes. Meanwhile, the highly conductive dispersed Mo2C has a strong chemical adsorption to polysulfides and catalyzes the transformation of polysulfides, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides and accelerate the reaction kinetics. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared S cathode can display a high reversible capacity (1098 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 120 cycles) and superior rate performance (483 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a new method to boost the performance of RT Na&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Future&#8208;Oriented Advanced Diarylethene Photoswitches: From Molecular Design to Spontaneous Assembly Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diarylethenes are a new type of photochromic molecules with attractive photofatigue resistance and reversibility. The result of a lot of effort has led to the rapid development of photoresponsive diarylethylenes for smart material applications. The recent advances in the design and assembly of diarylethylene as a multifunctional photoresponsive trigger unit are reviewed.








Abstract
Diarylethene (DAE) photoswitch is a new and promising family of photochromic molecules and has shown superior performance as a smart trigger in stimulus&#8208;responsive materials. During the past few decades, the DAE family has achieved a leap from simple molecules to functional molecules and developed toward validity as a universal switching building block. In recent years, the introduction of DAE into an assembly system has been an attractive strategy that enables the photochromic behavior of the building blocks to be manifested at the level of the entire system, beyond the DAE unit itself. This assembly&#8208;based strategy will bring many unexpected results that promote the design and manufacture of a new generation of advanced materials. Here, recent advances in the design and fabrication of diarylethene as a trigger in materials science, chemistry, and biomedicine are reviewed.

         <title>All&#8208;Dielectric Metasurface&#8208;Enabled Multiple Vortex Emissions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining an orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing metalens array and semiconductor microlasers, the simultaneous generation of a vortex emission array with versatile topological charges is experimentally demonstrated, paving an essential step toward on&#8208;chip integrated OAM sources.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integrated micro&#8208; and nanoscale vortex lasers are key elements for addressing the exponentially growing demand for information capacity. Although tunable vortex microlasers have been reported, each laser pulse still possesses one particular topological charge and requires additional multiplexing. In this study, the simultaneous generation of coherent laser arrays with different topological charges by combining metalenses with semiconductor microlasers is demonstrated. A TiO2 vortex metalens converts two orbital angular momentum beams into the same diffraction&#8208;limit spot with opposite circular polarizations through spin&#8208;to&#8208;orbital conversion. Consequently, the microlaser emission at the focal spot, which can be decomposed into two circularly polarized beams, is collimated into vortex microlaser beams with two different topological charges through a time&#8208;reversal process. This concept is extended to a 2 &#215; 2 metalens array by introducing off&#8208;axis terms, and eight topological charges are produced simultaneously. This research is a significant step toward the on&#8208;chip integration of micro&#8208; and nanolasers.

In this study, the simultaneous generation of coherent laser arrays with different topological charges by combining metalenses with semiconductor microlasers is demonstrated. A TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; vortex metalens converts two orbital angular momentum beams into the same diffraction-limit spot with opposite circular polarizations through spin-to-orbital conversion. Consequently, the microlaser emission at the focal spot, which can be decomposed into two circularly polarized beams, is collimated into vortex microlaser beams with two different topological charges through a time-reversal process. This concept is extended to a 2 &#215; 2 metalens array by introducing off-axis terms, and eight topological charges are produced simultaneously. This research is a significant step toward the on-chip integration of micro- and nanolasers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Organic Logic Gates: A Promising Perspective on a Dual&#8208;Gate Antiambipolar Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable logic circuits are achieved using a dual&#8208;gate organic antiambipolar transistor. Suitable top&#8208; and bottom&#8208;gate voltages demonstrate five logic gate operations: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR. Additionally, by varying the drain voltage, it is possible to electrically switch two logic gates. Thus, the proposed device concept provides a way of realizing multifunctional logic circuits using a simple circuit design.








Abstract
Electrically reconfigurable organic logic circuits are promising candidates for realizing new computation architectures, such as artificial intelligence and neuromorphic devices. In this study, multiple logic gate operations are attained based on a dual&#8208;gate organic antiambipolar transistor (DG&#8208;OAAT). The transistor exhibits a &#923;&#8208;shaped transfer curve, namely, a negative differential transconductance at room temperature. It is important to note that the peak voltage of the drain current is precisely tuned by three input signals: bottom&#8208;gate, top&#8208;gate, and drain voltages. This distinctive feature enables multiple logic gate operations with &#8220;only a single DG&#8208;OAAT,&#8221; which are not obtainable in conventional transistors. Five logic gate operations, which correspond to AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR, are demonstrated by adjusting the bottom&#8208;gate and top&#8208;gate voltages. Moreover, varying the drain voltage makes it possible to reversibly switch two logic gates, e.g., NAND/NOR and OR/XOR. In addition, the DG&#8208;OAATs show a high degree of stability and reliability. The logic gate operations are observed even months later. The hysteresis in the transfer curves is also negligible. Thus, the device concept is promising for realizing multifunctional logic circuits with a simple transistor configuration. Hence, these findings are expected to surpass the current limitations in complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor devices.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells: Progressive Deposition Techniques and Future Prospects on Large&#8208;Area Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The possibilities of different deposition techniques which can bring quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based solar cells to the industrial level are assessed. With perovskite QDs showing dramatic improvements in photovoltaics, the discussions on the challenges particularly for perovskite QD solar cells are given in an attempt to achieve large&#8208;area fabrication solving pivotal energy and environmental issues.








Abstract
Colloidally grown nanosized semiconductors yield extremely high&#8208;quality optoelectronic materials. Many examples have pointed to near perfect photoluminescence quantum yields, allowing for technology&#8208;leading materials such as high purity color centers in display technology. Furthermore, because of high chemical yield, and improved understanding of the surfaces, these materials, particularly colloidal quantum dots (QDs) can also be ideal candidates for other optoelectronic applications. Given the urgent necessity toward carbon neutrality, electricity from solar photovoltaics will play a large role in the power generation sector. QDs are developed and shown dramatic improvements over the past 15 years as photoactive materials in photovoltaics with various innovative deposition properties which can lead to exceptionally low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance devices. Once the key issues related to charge transport in optically thick arrays are addressed, QD&#8208;based photovoltaic technology can become a better candidate for practical application. In this article, the authors show how the possibilities of different deposition techniques can bring QD&#8208;based solar cells to the industrial level and discuss the challenges for perovskite QD solar cells in particular, to achieve large&#8208;area fabrication for further advancing technology to solve pivotal energy and environmental issues.

         <title>Reunderstanding the Reaction Mechanism of Aqueous Zn&#8211;Mn Batteries with Sulfate Electrolytes: Role of the Zinc Sulfate Hydroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;new Zn4SO4&#183;(OH)6&#183;xH2O (ZSH)&#8208;assisted deposition and dissolution reaction model is proposed and validated for aqueous Zn&#8211;Mn batteries in mild sulfate electrolytes. It is shown that MnO2 is not a compulsory cathode; and various metal oxides, including ZSH, ZnO, MgO, and CaO, can be used as the cathode materials for aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8211;Mn batteries have garnered extensive attention for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;safety energy storage. However, the charge&#8208;storage chemistry of Zn&#8211;Mn batteries remains controversial. Prevailing mechanisms include conversion reaction and cation (de)intercalation in mild acid or neutral electrolytes, and a MnO2/Mn2+ dissolution&#8722;deposition reaction in strong acidic electrolytes. Herein, a Zn4SO4&#183;(OH)6&#183;xH2O (ZSH)&#8208;assisted deposition&#8722;dissolution model is proposed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and capacity origin in Zn&#8211;Mn batteries based on mild acidic sulfate electrolytes. In this new model, the reversible capacity originates from a reversible conversion reaction between ZSH and ZnxMnO(OH)2 nanosheets in which the MnO2 initiates the formation of ZSH but contributes negligibly to the apparent capacity. The role of ZSH in this new model is confirmed by a series of operando characterizations and by constructing Zn batteries using other cathode materials (including ZSH, ZnO, MgO, and CaO). This research may refresh the understanding of the most promising Zn&#8211;Mn batteries and guide the design of high&#8208;capacity aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Urine&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Initiated Composite Hydrogel Patch Reconfiguration Propels Scarless Memory Repair and Reinvigoration of the Urethra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A urine&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel patch featuring robust antiswelling is engineered, which can respond to Ca2+ in urine to trigger structure reconfiguration and antiswelling for enhancing mechanical stiffness and realizing scarless memory repair via enhancing collagen deposition, recalling mechanical memory, inhibiting fibrosis and inflammation, and accelerating angiogenesis especially when combining with moderate photo&#8208;provoked reactive oxygen species birth.








Abstract
The harsh urine microenvironment (UME), as an inherent hurdle, endangers and renders urethral repair unreachable. Innovatively, the unfavorable UME is utilized as the design source to construct a UME&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel patch for realizing scarless memory repair, wherein laser&#8208;excited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mechanical strength elevation using chemically crosslinked silicon quantum dots are accessible. Intriguingly, the proposed composite scaffolds can respond to Ca2+ in urine, cause structure reconfiguration, and repress swelling to further enhance scaffold stiffness. Systematic experiments validate that ROS birth and unexpected stiffness elevation in such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds can realize scarless memory repair of the urethra in vivo. Comprehensive mechanism explorations uncover that the activations of cell proliferation and collagen&#8208;related genes (e.g., MMP&#8208;1 and COL3A1) and the dampening of fibrosis&#8208;related (e.g., TGF&#8208;&#946;/Smad) and mechanosensitive genes (e.g., YAP/TAZ) are responsible for the scarless memory repair of such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds via enhancing collagen deposition, recalling mechanical memory, decreasing fibrosis and inflammation, and accelerating angiogenesis. The design rationales (e.g., UME&#8208;initiated structure reconfiguration and antiswelling) can serve as an instructive and general approach for urethra repair.

         <title>Collagen Fiber&#8208;Based Advanced Separation Materials: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen fibers (CFs), the structural proteins ubiquitously existing in animal skins, feature unique hierarchically fibrous structure, amphiphilicity&#8208;enabled surface wetting behaviors, and versatile reactivity. Owing to the intrinsic merits of CFs, progressive successes have been achieved in developing CFs&#8208;based advanced separation materials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent development of CFs&#8208;based separation materials and their future perspectives.








Abstract
Separation plays a critical role in a broad range of industrial applications. Developing advanced separation materials is of great significance for the future development of separation technology. Collagen fibers (CFs), the typical structural proteins, exhibit unique structural hierarchy, amphiphilic wettability, and versatile chemical reactivity. These distinctive properties provide infinite possibilities for the rational design of advanced separation materials. During the past 2 decades, many progressive achievements in the development of CFs&#8208;derived advanced separation materials have been witnessed already. Herein, the CFs&#8208;based separation materials are focused on and the recent progresses in this topic are reviewed. CFs widely existing in animal skins display unique hierarchically fibrous structure, amphiphilicity&#8208;enabled surface wetting behaviors, multi&#8208;functionality guaranteed covalent/non&#8208;covalent reaction versatility. These outstanding merits of CFs bring great opportunities for realizing rational design of a variety of advanced separation materials that were&#160;capable of achieving high&#8208;performance separations to diverse specific targets, including oily pollutants, natural products, metal ions, anionic contaminants and proteins, etc. Besides, the important issues for the further development of CFs&#8208;based advanced separation materials are also discussed.

         <title>High&#8208;Polarizability Organic Ferroelectric Materials Doping for Enhancing the Built&#8208;In Electric Field of Perovskite Solar Cells Realizing Efficiency over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic ferroelectric material poly(vinylidene fluoride):dabcoHReO4 as a perovskite dopant can be partially polarized by the built&#8208;in electric field of perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) itself, which produces an additional electric field, thus promoting the charge&#8208;carrier transportation. A promising 24.23% power conversion efficiency (PCE) (certified PCE of 23.45%) and robust operational stability are obtained.








Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) intensity of silicon heterojunction solar cells can be easily enhanced by selective doping to obtain high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), while it is challenging for perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) because of the difficulty in doping perovskites in a controllable way. Herein, an effective method is reported to enhance the BEF of FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 perovskite by doping an organic ferroelectric material, poly(vinylidene fluoride):dabcoHReO4 (PVDF:DH) with high polarizability, that can be driven even by the BEF of the device itself. The polarization of PVDF:DH produces an additional electric field, which is maintained permanently, in a direction consistent with that of the BEF of the pero&#8208;SC. The BEF superposition&#160;can more sufficiently drive the charge&#8208;carrier transport and extraction, thus suppressing the nonradiative recombination occurring in the pero&#8208;SCs. Moreover, the PVDF:DH dopant benefits the formation of a mesoporous PbI2 film, via a typical two&#8208;step processing method, thereby promoting perovskite growth with high crystallinity and a few defects. The resulting pero&#8208;SC shows a promising PCE of 24.23% for a 0.062 cm2 device (certified PCE of 23.45%), and a remarkable PCE of 22.69% for a 1 cm2 device, along with significantly improved moisture resistances and operational stabilities.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Scale Auxetic Hierarchical Mechanical Metamaterials for Shape Morphing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents novel 2D and 3D microscopic hierarchical mechanical metamaterials capable of exhibiting a broad range of the highly unusual auxetic behavior that can be fully controlled through design parameters. The proposed hierarchical systems can also form composites capable of shape morphing where the initial structures can assume arbitrary predefined shapes.








Abstract
Shape morphing and the possibility of having control over mechanical properties via designed deformations have attracted a lot of attention in the materials community and led to a variety of applications with an emphasis on the space industry. However, current materials normally do not allow to have a full control over the deformation pattern and often fail to replicate such behavior at low scales which is essential in flexible electronics. Thus, in this paper, novel 2D&#160;and 3D microscopic hierarchical mechanical metamaterials using mutually&#8208;competing substructures within the system that are capable of exhibiting a broad range of the highly unusual auxetic behavior are proposed. Using experiments (3D microprinted polymers) supported by computer simulations, it is shown that such ability can be controlled through geometric design parameters. Finally it is demonstrated that the considered structure can form a composite capable of shape morphing allowing it to deform to a predefined shape.

         <title>Advanced Flame&#8208;Retardant Methods for Polymeric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flame&#8208;retardant methods for polymeric materials are reviewed with particular focus on advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods developed in recent years. Both the advantages and drawbacks of these methods are discussed, and prospects for the future development of flame&#8208;retardant methods are presented. It is hope that this review will guide the development of flame&#8208;retardant polymeric materials.








Abstract
Most organic polymeric materials have high flammability, for which the large amounts of smoke, toxic gases, heat, and melt drips produced during their burning cause immeasurable damages to human life and property every year. Despite some desirable results having been achieved by conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods, their application is encountering more and more difficulties with the ever&#8208;increasing high flame&#8208;retardant requirements such as high flame&#8208;retardant efficiency, great persistence, low release of heat, smoke, and toxic gases, and more importantly not deteriorating or even enhancing the overall properties of polymers. Under such condition, some advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods have been developed in the past years based on &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; intumescence, nanotechnology, in situ reinforcement, intrinsic char formation, plasma treatment, biomimetic coatings, etc., which have provided potential solutions to the dilemma of conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods. This review briefly outlines the development, application, and problems of conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods, including bulk&#8208;additive, bulk&#8208;copolymerization, and surface treatment, and focuses on the raise, development, and potential application of advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods. The future development of flame&#8208;retardant methods is further discussed.

         <title>Polymerized Small Molecular Acceptor with Branched Side Chains for All Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency over 16.7%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polymer acceptors named PY&#8208;X have been synthesized. By optimizing the length of branched alkyl chains, PY&#8208;HD (2&#8208;hexyldecyl substitution)&#8208;based all polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) delivers a high efficiency of 16.76%, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.949&#160;V, and an extremely low non&#8208;radiative voltage loss of 0.18&#160;V, representing the highest efficiency for binary all&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of small molecule acceptor (SMA)&#8208;based organic solar cells have already exceeded 18%. However, the development of polymer acceptors still lags far behind their SMA counterparts mainly due to the lack of efficient polymer acceptors. Herein, a series of polymer acceptors named PY&#8208;X (with X being the branched alkyl chain) are&#160;designed and synthesized by employing the same central core with the SMA L8&#8208;BO but with different branched alkyl chains on the pyrrole motif. It is found that the molecular packing of SMA&#8208;HD featuring 2&#8208;hexyldecyl side chain used in the synthesis of PY&#8208;HD is similar to L8&#8208;BO, in which the branched alkyl chains lead to condensed and high&#8208;order molecular assembly in SMA&#8208;HD molecules. When combined with PM6, PY&#8208;HD&#8208;based all polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) exhibits a high PCE of 16.41%, representing the highest efficiency for the binary all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, the side&#8208;chain modification on the pyrrole site position further improves the performance of the all&#8208;PSCs, and the PY&#8208;DT&#8208;based device delivers a new record high efficiency of 16.76% (certified as 16.3%). The work provides new insights for understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship of polymer acceptors and paves a feasible avenue to develop efficient conjugated polymer acceptors.

         <title>Critical Review on Low&#8208;Temperature Li&#8208;Ion/Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A timely and critical review on fundamental mechanisms, recent advances, and design strategies of electrolytes, electrodes, and battery structures for low&#8208;temperature Li batteries is provided.








Abstract
With the highest energy density ever among all sorts of commercialized rechargeable batteries, Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have stimulated an upsurge utilization in 3C devices, electric vehicles, and stationary energy&#8208;storage systems. However, a high performance of commercial LIBs based on ethylene carbonate electrolytes and graphite anodes can only be achieved at above &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, which restricts their applications in harsh environments. Here, a comprehensive research progress and in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors leading to the poor low&#8208;temperature performance of LIBs is provided; the distinctive challenges on the anodes, electrolytes, cathodes, and electrolyte&#8211;electrodes interphases are sorted out, with a special focus on Li&#8208;ion transport mechanism therein. Finally, promising strategies and solutions for improving low&#8208;temperature performance are highlighted to maximize the working&#8208;temperature range of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion/metal batteries.

         <title>A MOF&#8208;Derivative Decorated Hierarchical Porous Host Enabling Ultrahigh Rates and Superior Long&#8208;Term Cycling of Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elaborate design is reported to fabricate novel 3D host for Zn metal anodes by assembling carbon nanotubes and graphene into a hierarchical porous structure, followed by decorating with Zn&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework derivatives, which enables a significant boost on both charging/discharging rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance for Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries have attracted much attention due to their high intrinsic capacity, high safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, uncontrollable dendrite growth and adverse side reactions of Zn anodes seriously hinder their further application. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous graphene&#8208;carbon nanotubes scaffold decorated with metal&#8211;organic framework derived ZnO/C nanoparticles (3D&#8208;ZGC) is fabricated as the host for dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal composite anodes. The zincophilic ZnO/C nanoparticles act as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to induce homogeneous Zn deposition. The mechanically robust 3D scaffold with high conductivity not only suppresses the formation of dendritic Zn by reducing the local current density and homogenizing Zn2+ ion flux, but also inhibits volume changes during the long&#8208;term plating/stripping process. As a result, the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anodes afford unprecedented Zn plating&#8208;stripping stability at an ultrahigh current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 for 1500 cycles with low overpotential (&lt;65&#160;mV) when used in a symmetric cell. When coupled with MnO2 cathodes, the assembled Zn@3D&#8208;ZGC//MnO2 full batteries deliver an enhanced cycling stability for up to 6000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8208;1, demonstrating the potential of the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anode for advanced Zn metal batteries.

         <title>Mechanistically Scoping Cell&#8208;Free and Cell&#8208;Dependent Artificial Scaffolds in Rebuilding Skeletal and Dental Hard Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rebuilding mineralized structures in tooth and bone is always the supreme goal in fields of regenerative dentistry and orthopedics. Mechanistic understandings of artificial scaffolds in rebuilding skeletal and dental hard tissues are reviewed, by which better clinical choices and research directions may be approached.








Abstract
Rebuilding mineralized tissues in skeletal and dental systems remains costly and challenging. Despite numerous demands and heavy clinical burden over the world, sources of autografts, allografts, and xenografts are far limited, along with massive risks including viral infections, ethic crisis, and so on. Per such dilemma, artificial scaffolds have emerged to provide efficient alternatives. To date, cell&#8208;free biomimetic mineralization (BM) and cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds have both demonstrated promising capabilities of regenerating mineralized tissues. However, BM and cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds have distinctive mechanisms for mineral genesis, which makes them methodically, synthetically, and functionally disparate. Herein, these two strategies in regenerative dentistry and orthopedics are systematically summarized at the level of mechanisms. For BM, methodological and theoretical advances are focused upon; and meanwhile, for cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds, it is demonstrated how scaffolds orchestrate osteogenic cell fate. The summary of the experimental advances and clinical progress will endow researchers with mechanistic understandings of artificial scaffolds in rebuilding hard tissues, by which better clinical choices and research directions may be approached.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Dual&#8208;Type Signal Vector Sensor for Smart Robotics and Automatic Vehicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered dual&#8208;type signal vector sensor is designed by integrating an alternating&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and a direct&#8208;current TENG, which achieves a high sensing precision and stability, and provides an effective movement direction recognition method by self&#8208;powered switching of signal type in real&#8208;time motion monitoring of a mechanical arm and automatic steering wheel.








Abstract
Automatic control systems are the most efficient technology for reducing labor cost while improving work efficiency. Vector motion monitoring is indispensable for the normal operation of automatic control systems. Here, a self&#8208;powered dual&#8208;type signal triboelectric nanogenerator (DS&#8208;TENG) is designed through integrating an alternating&#8208;current TENG and a direct&#8208;current TENG, which can monitor vector movement in real time based on pulse signal counts. As a result, the DS&#8208;TENG avoids the shortcoming of traditional self&#8208;powered sensors based on signal amplitude that is sensitive to the working environment, achieves a high sensing precision, and maintains stability after reciprocating motion of 500&#160;000 cycles. Moreover, it realizes effective movement direction recognition by self&#8208;powered switching of signal type in reverse movement. This dual&#8208;type signal TENG exhibits high precision and automatic direction recognition in vector motion monitor and trajectory tracker, paving the way for the application of the self&#8208;powered TENG sensor in automatic control systems in the future.

         <title>2D Materials for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces current progress of 2D materials (2DM) application in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLB) to deal with the limitation of ASSLBs. 2DMs are applied in the different composition of the ASSLBs to enhance its performance. By summarizing the properties, synthesis, application, and characterization, this review points out the future development direction of 2DMs application in ASSLBs.








Abstract
Although one of the most mature battery technologies, lithium&#8208;ion batteries still have many aspects that have not reached the desired requirements, such as energy density, current density, safety, environmental compatibility, and price. To solve these problems, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLB) based on lithium metal anodes with high energy density and safety have been proposed and become a research hotpot in recent years. Due to the advanced electrochemical properties of 2D materials (2DM), they have been applied to mitigate some of the current problems of ASSLBs, such as high interface impedance and low electrolyte ionic conductivity. In this work, the background and fabrication method of 2DMs are reviewed initially. The improvement strategies of 2DMs are categorized based on their application in the three main components of ASSLBs: The anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Finally, to elucidate the mechanisms of 2DMs in ASSLBs, the role of in situ characterization, synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques, and other advanced characterization are discussed.

         <title>The molecular ordering and double channel carrier generation of non&#8208;fullerene photovoltaics within multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale morphology</title>

Abstract
The success of non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) solar cells lies in their unique physical properties beyond the extended absorption and suitable energy levels. The current study investigates the morphology and photo physical behavior of PM6 donor blending with ITIC, 4TIC, and 6TIC acceptors. Single crystal study shows that the pi&#8208;pi stacking and side&#8208;chain interaction dictate molecular assembly, which can be carried to blended films, forming a multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale morphology. Spontaneous carrier generation is seen in ITIC, 4TIC and 6TIC neat films and their blended thin films using PBDB&#8208;T donor, providing a new avenue of zero energy loss carrier formation. The molecular packing associated with specific contacts and geometry is key in influencing the photo physics, as demonstrated by the charge transfer and carrier lifetime results. We see the 2D layer of 6TIC that facilitates the exciton to polaron conversion and obtains the largest photo&#8208;generated polaron yield. The new mechanism in together with the highly efficient blending region carrier generation prospect the fundamental advantage for NFA solar cells, from molecular assembly to thin film morphology.

         <title>Terahertz chiral metamaterials enabled by textile manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Easy&#8208;to&#8208;fabricate, large&#8208;area, and inexpensive microstructures that realize control of the polarization of terahertz (THz) radiation are of fundamental importance to the development of the field of THz wave photonics. However, due to the lack of natural materials which can facilitate strong THz radiation&#8208;matter interactions, THz polarization components remain an undeveloped technology. Strong resonance&#8208;based responses offered by THz metamaterials have led to the recent development of THz metadevices, whereas, for polarization control devices, micrometer&#8208;scale fabrication techniques including aligned photolithography are generally required to create multilayer microstructures. In this work, leveraging a two&#8208;step textile manufacturing approach, a chiral metamaterial capable of exhibiting strong chiroptical responses at THz frequencies is demonstrated. Chiral&#8208;selective transmission and pronounced optical activity are experimentally observed. In sharp contrast to smart clothing related devices (e.g., textile antennas), the investigated chiral metamaterials gain their THz properties directly from the yarn&#8208;twisting enabled micro&#8208;helical strings. We envision that the interplay between meta&#8208;atom designs and textile manufacturing technology will lead to a new family of metadevices for complete control over the phase, amplitude, and polarization of THz radiation.

         <title>Bioinspired Lipoproteins of Furoxans&#8211;Oxaliplatin Remodel Physical Barriers in Tumor to Potentiate T&#8208;Cell Infiltration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The abnormal tumor vasculature and dense tumor stroma constitute a formidable physical barrier that strikingly limits the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors. Herein, a stromal&#8208;cell&#8208;accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system loading a reduction&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8211;oxaliplatin is designed, which profoundly paves the way for CTL infiltration in tumors and synergizes immune&#8208;checkpoint&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;mediated anticancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors is critically challenged by the intricate intratumor physical barriers, which is emerging as an important issue of anticancer immunotherapy. Herein, a reduction&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8211;oxaliplatin is synthesized and a stroma&#8208;cell&#8208;accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system (S&#8208;LFO) is designed, aiming to facilitate CTL infiltration in tumors for anticancer immunotherapy. S&#8208;LFO treatment significantly promotes tumor vessel normalization and eliminates multiple components of tumor stroma, ultimately producing a 2.96&#8208;fold, 5.02&#8208;fold, and 8.65&#8208;fold increase of CD3+CD8+ T cells, their interferon&#8208;&#947;&#8208; and granzyme B&#8208;expressing subtypes when comparing to the negative control, and considerably facilitating their trafficking to the cancer cell regions in tumors. Moreover, the combination of S&#8208;LFO with an antiprogrammed death ligand&#8208;1 produces notable therapeutic benefits of retarded tumor growth and extends survivals in three murine tumor models. Therefore, this study provides an encouraging strategy of remodeling the intratumor physical barriers to potentiate CTL infiltration for anticancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Twin&#8208;structured Graphene Metamaterials with Anomalous Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Typically, solid materials exhibit transverse contraction in response to stretching in the orthogonal direction and transverse expansion under compression conditions. However, when flexible graphene nanosheets are assembled into three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous architecture, the orientation arrangement delivered directional deformation of micro&#8208;nanosheets may induce anomalous mechanical properties. In this study, a 3D hierarchical graphene metamaterial (GTM) with twin&#8208;structured morphologies is assembled by manipulating the temperature gradient for the ice growth during in situ freeze&#8208;casting procedures. GTM has demonstrated anomalous anisotropic compression performance with programable Poisson's ratios (PRs) and improved mechanical properties (e.g., elasticity, strength, modulus and fatigue resistance) along different directions. Owing to the designed three&#8208;phase deformation (elastic bending, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane buckling, and large deflection) of two&#8208;dimensional graphene sheets as basic elements in the microscale, the twin&#8208;structure GTM delivers distinctive characteristics of compressive curves with an apparent stress plateau and follows a strengthening tendency. This multiscale deformation behavior facilitates the enhancement of energy loss coefficient under large compression. In addition, a finite element theory based numerical model is established to optimize the structural design, and validate the multiscale tunable PR mechanism and oriented structural evolution. The mechanical and thermal applications of GTM indicate that the rational manipulation&#8208;driven design of meta&#8208;structures paves the way for exploring graphene&#8208;based multifunctional materials with anomalous properties.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;diffusion induced Capacity Losses in Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;based batteries generally exhibit gradual capacity losses resulting in decreasing energy and power densities. For negative electrode materials the capacity losses are largely attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and volume expansion effects. For positive electrode materials, the capacity losses are, instead, mainly ascribed to structural changes and metal ion dissolution. This Review focuses on another, so far largely unrecognized, type of capacity loss stemming from diffusion of lithium atoms or ions as a result of concentration gradients present in the electrode. An incomplete delithiation step is then seen for a negative electrode material while an incomplete lithiation step is obtained for a positive electrode material. Evidence for diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity losses is presented based on published experimental data and results obtained in recent studies focusing on this trapping effect. The implications of the diffusion&#8208;controlled Li&#8208;trapping induced capacity losses, which are discussed using a straightforward diffusion&#8208;based model, are compared with those of other phenomena expected to give capacity losses. Approaches that can be used to identify and circumvent the diffusion&#8208;controlled Li&#8208;trapping problem (e.g., regeneration of cycled batteries) are discussed, in addition to remaining challenges and proposed future research directions within this important research area.

Hardware implementation for reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is demonstrated with a unique 2T synaptic cell structure, which realizes the functions of both STDP and anti&#8208;STDP using a simple hardware structure. The total synaptic weight is increased (decreased) by applying feedback signal to gate1 or gate2 when, respectively, a positive or negative reward signal comes.








Abstract
Reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is a brain&#8208;inspired reinforcement learning (RL) rule, exhibiting potential for decision&#8208;making tasks and artificial general intelligence. However, the hardware implementation of the reward&#8208;modulation process in R&#8208;STDP usually requires complicated Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) circuit design that causes high power consumption and large footprint. Here, a design with two synaptic transistors (2T) connected in a parallel structure is experimentally demonstrated. The 2T unit based on WSe2 ferroelectric transistors exhibits reconfigurable polarity behavior, where one channel can be tuned as n&#8208;type and the other as p&#8208;type due to nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization. In this way, opposite synaptic weight update behaviors with multilevel (&gt;6 bit) conductance states, ultralow nonlinearity (0.56/&#8722;1.23), and large Gmax/Gmin ratio of 30 are realized. By applying positive/negative reward to (anti&#8208;)STDP component of 2T cell, R&#8208;STDP learning rules are realized for training the spiking neural network and demonstrated to solve the classical cart&#8211;pole problem, exhibiting a way for realizing low&#8208;power (32 pJ per forward process) and highly area&#8208;efficient (100 &#181;m2) hardware chip for reinforcement learning.

         <title>Heterojunction Annealing Enabling Record Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage in Antimony Triselenide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterojunction post&#8208;annealing treatment is utilized to suppress the nonradiative recombination for a highly competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 520&#160;mV in Sb2Se3 thin&#8208;film solar cells. The VOC deficit of the device is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cells.








Abstract
Despite the fact that antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) thin&#8208;film solar cells have undergone rapid development in recent years, the large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit still remains as the biggest bottleneck, as even the world&#8208;record device suffers from a large VOC deficit of 0.59&#160;V. Here, an effective interface engineering approach is reported where the Sb2Se3/CdS heterojunction (HTJ) is subjected to a post&#8208;annealing treatment using a rapid thermal process. It is found that nonradiative recombination near the Sb2Se3/CdS HTJ, including interface recombination and space charge region recombination, is greatly suppressed after the HTJ annealing treatment. Ultimately, a substrate Sb2Se3/CdS thin&#8208;film solar cell with a competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record VOC of 0.52&#160;V is successfully fabricated. The device exhibits a much mitigated VOC deficit of 0.49&#160;V, which is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cell.

         <title>Antifreezing Hydrogel Electrolyte with Ternary Hydrogen Bonding for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible and antifreezing polysaccharide hydrogel is realized in situ with Zn(ClO4)2 salts through the Hofmeister effect. The chaotropic ClO4&#8722; anions can form weak hydrogen bonds with both water and polymer chains to decrease the electrolyte freezing point and endow the hydrogel with good mechanical flexibility, thus enabling the zinc&#8208;ion batteries with high performance ranging from &#8722;30 to 50&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The new&#8208;generation flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries require enhanced mechanical properties and ionic conductivities at low temperature for practical applications. This fundamentally means that it is desired that the hydrogel electrolyte possesses antifreezing merits to resist flexibility loss and performance decrease at subzero temperatures. Herein, a highly flexible polysaccharide hydrogel is realized in situ and is regulated in zinc&#8208;ion batteries through the Hofmeister effect with low&#8208;concentration Zn(ClO4)2 salts to satisfy the abovementioned requirements. The chaotropic ClO4&#8722; anions, water, and polymer chains can form ternary and weak hydrogen bonding (HB), which enables the polymer chains to have improved mechanical properties, breaks the HB of water to remarkably decrease the electrolyte freezing point, and reduces the amounts of free water for effective side reactions and dendrite inhibition. Consequently, even at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C, the Zn(ClO4)2 in situ optimized hydrogel electrolyte features a high ionic conductivity of 7.8 mS cm&#8722;1 and excellent flexibility, which enables a Zn/polyaniline (PANI) battery with a reversible capacity of 70&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 under 5 A g&#8722;1 for 2500 cycles, and renderd the flexible full battery with excellent cycling performances under different bending angles. This work provides a new pathway for designing high&#8208;performance antifreezing flexible batteries via the Hofmeister effect.

Abstract
Fullerenes are a molecular form of carbon allotrope and bear certain solubility, which allow the supramolecular assembly of fullerene molecules &#8211; also together with other complementary compound classes &#8211; via solution&#8208;based wet processes. By well&#8208;programmed organizing these building blocks and precisely modulating over the assembly process, supramolecularly assembled fullerene micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;architectures (FMNAs) are obtained. These FMNAs exhibit remarkably enhanced functions as well as tuneable morphologies and dimensions at different size scales, leading to their applications in diverse fields. In this review, both traditional and newly developed assembly strategies are reviewed, with an emphasis on the morphological evolution mechanism of FMNAs. The discussion is then focused on how to precisely regulate the dimensions and morphologies to generate functional FMNAs through solvent engineering, co&#8208;crystallization, surfactant incorporation, or post&#8208;fabrication treatment. In addition to C60&#8208;based FMNAs, this review particularly focuses on recently fabricated FMNAs comprising higher fullerenes (e.g., C70) and metallofullerenes. Meanwhile, an overview of the property modulation is presented and multidisciplinary applications of FMNAs in various fields are summarized, including sensors, optoelectronics, biomedicines, and energy. At the end, the prospects for future research, application opportunities, and challenges associated with FMNAs are proposed.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Uniform 1&#8208;nm&#8208;Level Amorphous Carbon Layers from 3D Conformal Polymer Brushes. A &#8220;Next&#8208;Generation&#8221; Cu Diffusion Barrier?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A uniform 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level of amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) layer as a diffusion barrier for Cu interconnects is obtained by the &#8220;self&#8208;limited&#8221; grafting of a polystyrene brush on oxide dielectric followed by UV crosslinking then carbonization. This approach for generating large area, ultra&#8208;uniform, and ultrathin polymer coatings shows promise for many new research directions and for a broad array of applications.








Abstract
A reliable method for preparing a conformal amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) layer with a thickness of 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level, is tested as a possible Cu diffusion barrier layer for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;density semiconductor device miniaturization. A polystyrene brush of uniform thickness is grafted onto 4&#8208;inch SiO2/Si wafer substrates with &#8220;self&#8208;limiting&#8221; chemistry favoring such a uniform layer. UV crosslinking and subsequent carbonization transforms this polymer film into an ultrathin a&#8208;C layer without pinholes or hillocks. The uniform coating of nonplanar regions or surfaces is also possible. The Cu diffusion &#8220;blocking ability&#8221; is evaluated by time&#8208;dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) tests using a metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (MOS) capacitor structure. A 0.82&#160;nm&#8208;thick a&#8208;C barrier gives TDDB lifetimes 3.3&#215; longer than that obtained using the conventional 1.0&#160;nm&#8208;thick TaNx diffusion barrier. In addition, this exceptionally uniform ultrathin polymer and a&#8208;C film layers hold promise for selective ion permeable membranes, electrically and thermally insulating films in electronics, slits of angstrom&#8208;scale thickness, and, when appropriately functionalized, as a robust ultrathin coating with many other potential applications.

     alt="Large-Area Uniform 1-nm-Level Amorphous Carbon Layers from 3D Conformal Polymer Brushes. A &#8220;Next-Generation&#8221; Cu Diffusion Barrier?"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A uniform 1-nm-level of amorphous carbon (a-C) layer as a diffusion barrier for Cu interconnects is obtained by the &#8220;self-limited&#8221; grafting of a polystyrene brush on oxide dielectric followed by UV crosslinking then carbonization. This approach for generating large area, ultra-uniform, and ultrathin polymer coatings shows promise for many new research directions and for a broad array of applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A reliable method for preparing a conformal amorphous carbon (a-C) layer with a thickness of 1-nm-level, is tested as a possible Cu diffusion barrier layer for next-generation ultrahigh-density semiconductor device miniaturization. A polystyrene brush of uniform thickness is grafted onto 4-inch SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Si wafer substrates with &#8220;self-limiting&#8221; chemistry favoring such a uniform layer. UV crosslinking and subsequent carbonization transforms this polymer film into an ultrathin a-C layer without pinholes or hillocks. The uniform coating of nonplanar regions or surfaces is also possible. The Cu diffusion &#8220;blocking ability&#8221; is evaluated by time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) tests using a metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (MOS) capacitor structure. A 0.82&#160;nm-thick a-C barrier gives TDDB lifetimes 3.3&#215; longer than that obtained using the conventional 1.0&#160;nm-thick TaN&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; diffusion barrier. In addition, this exceptionally uniform ultrathin polymer and a-C film layers hold promise for selective ion permeable membranes, electrically and thermally insulating films in electronics, slits of angstrom-scale thickness, and, when appropriately functionalized, as a robust ultrathin coating with many other potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interpretation of Rubidium&#8208;Based Perovskite Recipes toward Electronic Passivation and Ion&#8208;Diffusion Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rb+&#8208;based perovskite recipes are widely adopted in a large amount of significant advancements regarding perovskite solar cells with several performance records. Combining seminal theoretical calculations with cutting&#8208;edge experimental characterizations, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in doping concentration on electronic defects, ion migration, and phase stability is thoroughly investigated.








Abstract
Rubidium cation (Rb+) addition is witnessed to play a pivotal role in boosting the comprehensive performance of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. However, the origin of such success derived from irreplaceable superiorities brought by Rb+ remains ambiguous. Herein, grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;including atomic models are adopted for the accurate theoretical analysis of practical Rb+ distribution in perovskite structures. The spatial distribution, covering both the grain interiors and boundaries, is thoroughly identified by virtue of synchrotron&#8208;based grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction. On this basis, the prominent elevation of the halogen vacancy formation energy, improved charge&#8208;carrier dynamics, and the electronic passivation mechanism in the grain interior are expounded. As evidenced by the increased energy barrier and suppressed microcurrent, the critical role of Rb+ addition in blocking the diffusion pathway along grain boundaries, inhibiting halide phase segregation, and eventually enhancing intrinsic stability is elucidated. Hence, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in Rb+ concentration on electronic defects, ion migration, and phase stability is completely investigated in detail, shedding a new light on the advancement of high&#8208;efficiency cascade&#8208;incorporating strategies and perovskite compositional engineering.

         <title>Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Actuators and Waveguides that Operate at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elegant approach is described for conversion of elastic molecular crystals into flexible actuators that operate in low&#8208;temperature environments. These materials are tested in micromechanical actuation operations such as soft gripping of delicate objects, autonomous motion over flat surfaces, and measurement of temperature.








Abstract
Applications in extreme conditions, such as those encountered in space exploration, require lightweight materials that can retain their elasticity in extremely cold environments. However, cryogenic treatment of most soft polymeric and elastomeric materials results in complete loss of their ability for elastic flow, whereby such materials that are normally ductile become stiff, brittle, and prone to cracking. Here, a facile method for preparation of hybrid organic crystalline materials that are not only cryogenically robust but are also capable of large, recoverable, and reversible deformation at low temperatures is reported. To that end, flexible organic crystals are first mechanically reinforced by a polymer coating and combined with a thermally responsive polymer. The resulting hybrid materials respond linearly and reversibly to temperatures from &#8722;15 to &#8722;120 &#176;C without fatigue in air as well as in cold vacuum. The approach proposed here not only circumvents one of the main drawbacks that are inherent to the amorphous nature and has thus far limited the applications of polymeric materials at low temperatures, but it also provides a cost&#8208;effective access to a myriad of lightweight sensing, electronic, optical or actuating devices that can operate in low&#8208;temperature environmental settings.

         <title>3D Continuously Porous Graphene for Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D continuously porous graphene formed by folding a single&#8208;sheet graphene into a 3D porous architecture has well&#8208;retained 2D properties of graphene and novel functionalities from 3D structure, representing a distinct class of graphene materials with numerous unique and extraordinary properties. A comprehensive review of 3D continuously porous graphene and their applications in energy conversion and storage is provided.








Abstract
Constructing bulk graphene materials with well&#8208;reserved 2D properties is essential for device and engineering applications of atomically thick graphene. In this article, the recent progress in the fabrications and applications of sterically continuous porous graphene with designable microstructures, chemistries, and properties for energy storage and conversion are reviewed. Both template&#8208;based and template&#8208;free methods have been developed to synthesize the 3D continuously porous graphene, which typically has the microstructure reminiscent of pseudo&#8208;periodic minimal surfaces. The 3D graphene can well preserve the properties of 2D graphene of being highly conductive, surface abundant, and mechanically robust, together with unique 2D electronic behaviors. Additionally, the bicontinuous porosity and large curvature offer new functionalities, such as rapid mass transport, ample open space, mechanical flexibility, and tunable electric/thermal conductivity. Particularly, the 3D curvature provides a new degree of freedom for tailoring the catalysis and transport properties of graphene. The 3D graphene with those extraordinary properties has shown great promises for a wide range of applications, especially for energy conversion and storage. This article overviews the recent advances made in addressing the challenges of developing 3D continuously porous graphene, the benefits and opportunities of the new materials for energy&#8208;related applications, and the remaining challenges that warrant future study.

         <title>Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylene Lamellar&#8208;Thin Framework on Square Meter Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new member of low&#8208;dimensional structures with square meter lateral size by commodity polymer is introduced. This macroscopic low dimensional material is highly transparent optically and electronically, sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;porous, and self&#8208;standing with Young's Modulus of giga pascal level. Its potential applications include separation process and flexible electronics.








Abstract
A new member of low&#8208;dimensional structures with a high aspect ratio (LDHA) is introduced. For the first time, commodity polymer is processed into LDHA, which has long been stagnated by the lack of suitable processing techniques. The key to solve the current bottleneck is to overcome the trade&#8208;off between kinetic processability and thermodynamic stability. These two factors are both highly determined by intermolecular interaction level (IIL). Thus with a wide tuning range of IIL, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is selected and investigated to break through the trade&#8208;off. Polymeric LDHA preparation needs both thinning and stiffening. By focusing on one then the other sequentially, they are realized simultaneously. Thus the over sixty&#8208;year&#8208;old material is finally thinned down by seven orders of magnitude into a 65.5&#160;nm thick and 0.64 m2 large lamellar&#8208;thin framework (LTF). LTF exhibits a series of exceptional properties such as over&#8208;95% transparency, and seven times higher specific strength referred to steel. For the first time, cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) is utilized to observe commodity polymers directly. This new LDHA material is promising to expand the scale boundaries of both fundamental research and practical applications, not only for UHMWPE, but also for more commodity polymers to come.

         <title>An Advanced High&#8208;Entropy Fluorophosphate Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Increased Working Voltage and Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy effect is delicately introduced into fluorophosphate cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries by in situ partial substitution of active V central atom, preparing a high&#8208;entropy carbon&#8208;free Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 cathode, suppressing the occurrence of detrimental phase transition process in the low&#8208;voltage region, and further lifting up the mean working voltage of pristine Na3V2(PO4)2F3, enhancing sodium storage behavior, rate capability, and cycle performance.








Abstract
Impossible voltage plateau regulation for the cathode materials with fixed active elemental center is a pressing issue hindering the development of Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a high&#8208;entropy substitution strategy, to alter the detailed crystal structure of NVPF without changing the central active V atom, is pioneeringly utilized, achieving simultaneous electronic conductivity enhancement and diffusion barrier reduction for Na+, according to theoretical calculations. The as&#8208;prepared carbon&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 (HE&#8208;NVPF) cathode can deliver higher mean voltage of 3.81&#160;V and more advantageous energy density up to 445.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which is attributed by the diverse transition&#8208;metal elemental substitution in high&#8208;entropy crystalline. More importantly, high&#8208;entropy introduction can help realize disordered rearrangement of Na+ at Na(2) active sites, thereby to refrain from unfavorable discharging behaviors at low&#8208;voltage region, further lifting up the mean working voltage to realize a full Na&#8208;ion storage at the high voltage plateau. Coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HE&#8208;NVPF//HC SIB full cells can deliver high specific energy density of 326.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 5 C with the power density of 2178.9 W kg&#8722;1. This route means the unlikely potential regulation in NASICON&#8208;type crystal with unchangeable active center becomes possible, inspiring new ideas on elevating the mean working voltage for SIB cathodes.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Artificial Hybrid Nanocells for Boosted Vascular Regeneration in Ischemic Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of stem cell&#8208;based therapeutics faces some bottleneck problem in the progression of cellular approaches. This study introduces a cell&#8208;like nanoparticle delivery system that is capable of recapitulating multiple cell functions, providing superior effects on targeting ischemic tissues and spatiotemporal triggering of vascular regeneration in ischemic tissues.








Abstract
Restoration of sufficient blood supply for the treatment of ischemia remains a significant scientific and clinical challenge. Here, a cell&#8208;like nanoparticle delivery technology is introduced that is capable of recapitulating multiple cell functions for the spatiotemporal triggering of vascular regeneration. Specifically, a copper&#8208;containing protein is successfully prepared using a recombinant protein scaffold based on a de novo design strategy, which facilitates the timely release of nitric oxide and improved accumulation of particles within ischemic tissues. Through closely mimicking physiological cues, the authors demonstrate the benefits of bioactive factors secreted from hypoxic stem cells on promoting angiogenesis. Following this cell&#8208;mimicking manner, artificial hybrid nanosized cells (Hynocell) are constructed by integrating the hypoxic stem cell secretome into nanoparticles with surface coatings of cell membranes fused with copper&#8208;containing protein. The Hynocell, hybridized with different cell&#8208;derived components, provides synergistic effects on targeting ischemic tissues and promoting vascular regeneration in acute hindlimb ischemia and acute myocardial infarction models. This study offers new insights into the utilization of nanotechnology to potentiate the development of cell&#8208;free therapeutics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible electronics and devices could potentially revolutionize the paradigm and future direction of medical robotics. Herein, the materials, structures, and mechanisms in flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces used in prosthetic and rehabilitation robots are summarized in five primary areas: sensing, recording, communication, actuation, and stimulation. The current challenges and outlook of these technologies in medical robotics are discussed.








Abstract
Medical robots are invaluable players in non&#8208;pharmaceutical treatment of disabilities. Particularly, using prosthetic and rehabilitation devices with human&#8211;machine interfaces can greatly improve the quality of life for impaired patients. In recent years, flexible electronic interfaces and soft robotics have attracted tremendous attention in this field due to their high biocompatibility, functionality, conformability, and low&#8208;cost. Flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces on soft robotics will make a promising alternative to conventional rigid devices, which can potentially revolutionize the paradigm and future direction of medical robotics in terms of rehabilitation feedback and user experience. In this review, the fundamental components of the materials, structures, and mechanisms in flexible human&#8208;machine interfaces are summarized by recent and renowned applications in five primary areas: physical and chemical sensing, physiological recording, information processing and communication, soft robotic actuation, and feedback stimulation. This review further concludes by discussing the outlook and current challenges of these technologies as a human&#8211;machine interface in medical robotics.

         <title>Fermi Level Pinning Dependent 2D Semiconductor Devices: Challenges and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New and in&#8208;depth insight into the fundamental mechanism of Fermi level pinning in 2D semiconductor devices is presented in this review. The related device characteristics and contact strategies utilizing both the Fermi level pinning and depinning are introduced.








Abstract
Motivated by the high expectation for efficient electrostatic modulation of charge transport at very low voltages, atomically thin 2D materials with a range of bandgaps are investigated extensively for use in future semiconductor devices. However, researchers face formidable challenges in 2D device processing mainly originated from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) structure of ultrathin 2D materials. As major challenges, untunable Schottky barrier height and the corresponding strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) at metal interfaces are observed unexpectedly with 2D vdW materials, giving rise to unmodulated semiconductor polarity, high contact resistance, and lowered device mobility. Here, FLP observed from recently developed 2D semiconductor devices is addressed differently from those observed from conventional semiconductor devices. It is understood that the observed FLP is attributed to inefficient doping into 2D materials, vdW gap present at the metal interface, and hybridized compounds formed under contacting metals. To provide readers with practical guidelines for the design of 2D devices, the impact of FLP occurring in 2D semiconductor devices is further reviewed by exploring various origins responsible for the FLP, effects of FLP on 2D device performances, and methods for improving metallic contact to 2D materials.

         <title>Selective Center Charge Density Enables Conductive 2D Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks with Exceptionally High Pseudocapacitance and Energy Density for Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of selective center charge density to expand the traditional electrode materials to the electrode&#8722;electrolyte coupled system with prototypical of 2D Co&#8208;catecholate is proposed. The lower electron cloud density of the metal&#8208;ion center in the Z&#8208;axis provides the ability to attract a group of electron donors, leading to exceptionally high pseudocapacitance and energy density.








Abstract
Conductive 2D conjugated metal&#8722;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) are attractive electrode materials due to their high intrinsic electrical conductivities, large specific surface area, and abundant unsaturated bonds/functional groups. However, the 2D c&#8208;MOFs reported so far have limited charge storage capacity during electrochemical charging and discharging, and the energy density is still unsatisfactory. In this work, a strategy of selective center charge density to expand the traditional electrode materials to the electrode&#8722;electrolyte coupled system with the prototypical of 2D Co&#8208;catecholate (Co&#8208;CAT) is proposed. Electrochemical mechanism studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that dual redox sites are achieved with the quinone groups (CAT) and metal&#8208;ion linkages (Co&#8722;O) serving as the active sites of pseudocapacitive cation (Na+) and redox electrolyte species (SO32&#8722;). The resultant electrode delivers an exceptionally high capacity of 1160 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and a special self&#8208;discharge rate (86.8% after 48&#160;h). Moreover, the packaged asymmetric device exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy density of 158 W h kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 2000 W kg&#8722;1 and an excellent self&#8208;discharge rate of 80.6% after 48 h. This success will provide a new perspective for the performance enhancement for the 2D&#8208;MOF&#8208;based energy storage devices.

In this work, a strategy of selective center charge density to expand the traditional electrode materials to the electrode&#8722;electrolyte coupled system with the prototypical of 2D Co-catecholate (Co-CAT) is proposed. Electrochemical mechanism studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that dual redox sites are achieved with the quinone groups (CAT) and metal-ion linkages (Co&#8722;O) serving as the active sites of pseudocapacitive cation (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and redox electrolyte species (SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). The resultant electrode delivers an exceptionally high capacity of 1160 F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a special self-discharge rate (86.8% after 48&#160;h). Moreover, the packaged asymmetric device exhibits a state-of-the-art energy density of 158 W h kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at the power density of 2000 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an excellent self-discharge rate of 80.6% after 48 h. This success will provide a new perspective for the performance enhancement for the 2D-MOF-based energy storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism in Perylene Diimide Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic semiconductors with negligible spin&#8211;orbital couplings are potential materials for spintronics. Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism is revealed in perylene diimide (PDI) semiconductor with high mobility. PDI ferromagnets show Curie temperature of more than 400 K and saturation magnetization above 1 emu g&#8722;1. This work paves a new way to realize room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductors.








Abstract
The development of pure organic magnets with high Curie temperatures remains a challenging task in material science. Introducing high&#8208;density free radicals to strongly interacting organic molecules may be an effective method to this end. In this study, a solvothermal approach with excess hydrazine hydrate is used to concurrently reduce and dissolve rigid&#8208;backbone perylene diimide (PDI) crystallites into the soluble dianion species with a remarkably high reduction potential. The as&#8208;prepared PDI powders comprising radical anion aggregates are fabricated by a subsequent self&#8208;assembly and spontaneous oxidation process. The results of magnetic measurements show that the PDI powders exhibit room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism and a Curie temperature higher than 400 K, with a vast saturation magnetization that reaches &#8776;1.2 emu g&#8722;1. Elemental analysis along with the diamagnetic signal of the ablated residue are used to rule out the possibility that the magnetism is due to metal contamination. The findings suggest that the long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering can survive at room&#8208;temperature in organic semiconductors, and offers a new optional way to create room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductors.

Hygroscopic chemistry enables fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitors with a self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte. High&#8208;temperature&#8208;induced fire is a common safety risk that is extremely serious in energy storage devices. Here, a fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitor achieved by the self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte is reported, in which hygroscopic solute spontaneously absorbs water from the air as the solvent to recover the disenabled supercapacitor even after burning.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature&#8208;induced fire is an extremely serious safety risk in energy storage devices; which can be avoided by replacing their components with nonflammable materials. However; these devices are still destroyed by the high&#8208;temperature decomposition; lacking reliability. Here, a fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitor is further demonstrated that recovers after burning with a self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte. Using fire&#8208;tolerant electrodes and separator with a semiopen device configuration; hygroscopic CaCl2 in the air (&#8220;CaCl2&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221;) is designed as a self&#8208;healable electrolyte; which loses its water solvent at high temperatures but spontaneously absorbs water from the air to recover by itself at low temperatures. The supercapacitor is disenabled at 500 &#176;C; while it recovers after cooling in the air. Especially; it even recovers after burning at around 647 &#176;C with enhanced performance. The study offers a self&#8208;healing strategy to design high&#8208;safety; high&#8208;reliability; and fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitors; which inspires a promising way to deal with general fire&#8208;related risks.

         <title>Synergy Between Palladium Single Atoms and Nanoparticles Via Hydrogen Spillover for Enhancing CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Selective photoreduction of CO2 into carbon&#8208;neutral fuels (such as CH4) is extremely desirable but remains a challenge since sluggish multiple proton&#8208;electron coupling transfer and various C1 intermediates are involved. Herein, we present a synergistic function between single Pd atoms (Pd1) and Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on C3N4 for photocatalytic CO2 methanation. The catalyst achieved a high selectivity of 97.8% for CH4 production with a yield of 20.3&#160;&#956;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. Mechanistic studies revealed that Pd1 sites activated CO2, while PdNPs sites boosted H2O dissociation for increased H* coverage. The H* produced by PdNPs migrated to the Pd1 sites to promote multiple proton&#8208;electron coupling transfer via hydrogen spillover. Moreover, the adjacent Pd1 and PdNPs effectively stabilized intermediates such as *CHO, thereby favoring the pathway for CH4 production. This work provides a new perspective into the development of selective photocatalytic CO2 conversion through the artful design of synergistic catalytic sites.

         <title>Advancing the Mechanical Performance of Glasses: Perspectives and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanical performance of glassy materials presents a major challenge in modern glass science and technology. With a focus on visually transparent, inorganic and hybrid glasses, a perspective on the most recent developments in the field is provided herein, emphasizing the importance of translating fundamental insight from glass physics into future applications.








Abstract
Glasses are materials that lack a crystalline microstructure and long&#8208;range atomic order. Instead, they feature heterogeneity and disorder on superstructural scales, which have profound consequences for their elastic response, material strength, fracture toughness, and the characteristics of dynamic fracture. These structure&#8211;property relations present a rich field of study in fundamental glass physics and are also becoming increasingly important in the design of modern materials with improved mechanical performance. A first step in this direction involves glass&#8208;like materials that retain optical transparency and the haptics of classical glass products, while overcoming the limitations of brittleness. Among these, novel types of oxide glasses, hybrid glasses, phase&#8208;separated glasses, and bioinspired glass&#8211;polymer composites hold significant promise. Such materials are designed from the bottom&#8208;up, building on structure&#8211;property relations, modeling of stresses and strains at relevant length scales, and machine learning predictions. Their fabrication requires a more scientifically driven approach to materials design and processing, building on the physics of structural disorder and its consequences for structural rearrangements, defect initiation, and dynamic fracture in response to mechanical load. In this article, a perspective is provided on this highly interdisciplinary field of research in terms of its most recent challenges and opportunities.

         <title>A van der Waals Interface Hosting Two Groups of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multiple magnetic skyrmion phases add an additional degree of freedom for skyrmion based ultrahigh&#8208;density spin memory devices. Extending the field to two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals magnets is a rewarding challenge, where the realizable degree of freedoms (e.g. thickness, twist angle and electrical gating) and high skyrmion density result in intriguing new properties and enhanced functionality.

Two sets of topological Hall effect signals are observed below 60 K when Cr2Ge2Te6 is magnetically ordered. These two groups of skyrmions are directly imaged using magnetic force microscopy, and supported by micromagnetic simulations. Interestingly, the magnetic skyrmions persist in the heterostructure in the remanent state with zero applied magnetic field.

         <title>Anionic Lipid Nanoparticles Preferentially Deliver mRNA to the Hepatic Reticuloendothelial System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading non&#8208;viral technology for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro&#174;, an approved LNP&#8208;based RNA interference (RNAi) therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, we rationally design an LNP&#8208;based mRNA delivery platform to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice and directly compared to LNP&#8208;mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro&#174;, RES&#8208;targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro&#174; to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver&#8208;specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano&#8208;bio interactions involved.

         <title>A Redox Couple Strategy Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes by Suppressing Oxygen Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen release is the main reason for capacity decay of Li&#8208;rich cathodes. A novel redox couple strategy is proposed here to fundamentally solve this problem. As a proof of concept, the S2&#8722;/SO32&#8722; redox couple can significantly suppress oxygen release by chemically reducing surface O22&#8722; back into immobile O2&#8722;, thereby achieving the long&#8208;term cycling stability of Li&#8208;rich cathodes.








Abstract
Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMROs) are considered the most promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The poor cycling stability and fast voltage fading resulting from oxygen release during charging, however, severely hinders their practical application. Herein, a strategy of introducing an additional redox couple is proposed to eliminate the persistent problem of oxygen release. As a proof of concept, the cycling stability of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2, which is a typical LMRO cathode, is substantially enhanced with the help of the S2&#8722;/SO32&#8722; redox couple, and the capacity shows no decay with a retention of 100% after 700 cycles at 1C, far superior to the bare counterpart (61.7%). The surface peroxide ions (O22&#8722;) are readily chemically reduced back to immobile O2&#8722; by S2&#8722; during charging, accompanied by the formation of SO32&#8722;, which plays a critical role in stabilizing the oxygen lattice and eventually inhibiting the release of oxygen. More importantly, the S2&#8722; ions are regenerated during the following discharging process and participate in the chemical redox reaction again. The findings shed light on a potential direction to tackle the poor cycling stability of high&#8208;energy anion&#8208;redox cathode materials for rechargeable metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Versatile Polymer&#8208;Initiating Biomineralization for Tumor Blockade Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor blockade therapy is a promising penetration&#8208;independent antitumor modality, which effectively inhibits the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and information between the tumor and surrounding microenvironments. However, the current blockade therapy strategies have limited antitumor efficacy due to defects of inadequate tumor obstruction, possible side effects, and short duration. For these reasons, a facilely synthesized versatile polymer, 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;N&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;alendronate (DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;ALN, DPA), was developed to initiate the formation of biomineral shell around osteosarcoma as a potent physical barrier. The DSPE moiety shared a similar chemical structure with cytomembrane, allowing the membrane insertion of DPA. The bisphosphonic acid groups in ALN attracted ions to realize biomineralization around cells. After injection in the invasive osteosarcoma tissue, DPA inserted into the cytomembrane, induced continuous mineral deposition, and ultimately built a physical barrier around the tumor. Meanwhile, ALN in DPA alleviated bone destruction by suppressing the activity of osteoclasts. Through hindering the exchange of necessary substances, the biomineralization coating inhibited the growth of primary osteosarcoma and pulmonary metastasis simultaneously. Therefore, the multi&#8208;functional polymer&#8208;initiating blockade therapy provides a promising modality for tumor inhibition in clinic with high efficacy and negligible side effects.

         <title>Full&#8208;Dimensional Grain Boundary Stress Release for Flexible Perovskite Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics are strong potential candidates to drive low&#8208;power off&#8208;grid electronics for indoor applications. Compared with rigid devices, flexible perovskite devices can provide a more suitable surface for indoor small electronic devices, enabling them have a broader indoor application prospect. However, the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite photovoltaics is an urgent issue solved. Herein, we selected a kind of three&#8208;dimensional crosslinking agent named borax to carry out grain boundary penetration treatment on perovskite film to realize full&#8208;dimensional stress release. This strategy improves the mechanical and phase stabilities of perovskite films subjected to external forces or large temperature changes. The fabricated perovskite photovoltaics deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.63% under AM 1.5G illumination, which is the highest one to date. The merit of low trap states under weak light makes the devices present a superior indoor PCE of 31.85% under 1062 lux (LED, 2956 K), which is currently the best flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaic device. This work provides a full&#8208;dimensional grain boundary stress release strategy for highly stable flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaics.

         <title>Catalytic Kinetics Regulation for Enhanced Electrochemical Nitrogen Oxidation by Ru&#8208;Nanoclusters&#8208;Coupled Mn3O4 Catalysts Decorated with Atomically Dispersed Ru Atoms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;nanoclusters&#8208;coupled Mn3O4 catalysts decorated with atomically dispersed Ru atoms are designed as an advanced electrocatalyst for ambient N2 oxidation, with excellent FE and remarkable NO3&#8722; yields. The coexistence of Ru clusters and singe&#8208;atom Ru are considered to regulate catalytic kinetics among reaction&#8208;available N2, *OH accessibility, and transfer of electrons for optimized performance.








Abstract
Electrochemical N2 oxidation reaction (NOR), using water and N2 in the atmosphere, represents a sustainable approach for nitric production to replace the conventional industrial synthesis with high energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. Meanwhile, owing to chemical inertness of N2 and sluggish kinetics for 10&#8208;electron transfer, emerging electrocatalysts remain largely underexplored. Herein, Ru&#8208;nanoclusters&#8208;coupled Mn3O4 catalysts decorated with atomically dispersed Ru atoms (Ru&#8211;Mn3O4) are designed and explored as an advanced electrocatalyst for ambient N2 oxidation, with an excellent Faraday efficiency (28.87%) and a remarkable NO3&#8208; yield (35.34&#160;&#181;g h&#8208;1 mg&#8208;1cat.), respectively. Experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the outstanding activity is ascribed to the coexistence of Ru clusters and single&#8208;atom Ru. The synergistic effect between the Ru clusters and Mn3O4 can effectively activate the chemically inert N2, lowering the kinetic barrier for the vital breakage of N&#8801;N. The intensive *OH supply and enhanced conductivity are used to regulate the catalytic kinetics for optimized performance. This work provides brand&#8208;new ideas for the rational design of electrocatalysts in complicated electrocatalytic reactions with multiple dynamics&#8208;different steps.

         <title>2D FeOCl: A Highly In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Antiferromagnetic Semiconductor Synthesized via Temperature&#8208;Oscillation Chemical Vapor Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Good&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;scale antiferromagnetic semiconductor FeOCl single crystals are controllably synthesized by developing a temperature&#8208;oscillation chemical vapor transport method. The semiconducting characteristics, strong in&#8208;plane anisotropies, and spin&#8722;phonon coupling effect of the 2D FeOCl are explored in detail. This study provides a high&#8208;quality low&#8208;symmetry van der Waals magnetic candidate for miniaturized spintronic devices.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) transition&#8208;metal oxyhalides with low symmetry, novel magnetism, and good stability provide a versatile platform for conducting fundamental research and developing spintronics. Antiferromagnetic FeOCl has attracted significant interest owing to its unique semiconductor properties and relatively high N&#233;el temperature. Herein, good&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;scale FeOCl single crystals are controllably synthesized using the universal temperature&#8208;oscillation chemical vapor transport (TO&#8208;CVT) method. The crystal structure, bandgap, and anisotropic behavior of the 2D FeOCl are explored in detail. The absorption spectrum and electrical measurements reveal that 2D FeOCl is a semiconductor with an optical bandgap of &#8776;2.1&#160;eV and a resistivity of &#8776;10&#8722;1&#160;&#937; m at 295 K, and the bandgap increases with decreasing thickness. Strong in&#8208;plane optical and electrical anisotropies are observed in 2D FeOCl flakes, and the maximum resistance anisotropic ratio reaches 2.66 at 295 K. Additionally, the lattice vibration modes are studied through temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectra and first&#8208;principles density functional calculations. A significant decrease in the Raman frequencies below the N&#233;el temperature is observed, which results from the strong spin&#8722;phonon coupling effect in 2D FeOCl. This study provides a high&#8208;quality low&#8208;symmetry vdW magnetic candidate for miniaturized spintronics.

         <title>Design Rules of a Sulfur Redox Electrocatalyst for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice matching and 3d&#8208;orbital selection are proposed as two rules for the rational design of sulfur redox electrocatalysts. The former promotes the tight anchoring of polysulfides onto the SmMn2O5 catalyst, while the latter reduces the overpotential of the sulfur redox reaction, fundamentally accelerating the conversion of liquid&#8208;phase polysulfides to solid&#8208;phase discharge product and thus suppressing the shuttling.








Abstract
Seeking an electrochemical catalyst to accelerate the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides to insoluble products is crucial to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries and thus increase their practical energy density. Mn&#8208;based mullite (SmMn2O5) is used as a model catalyst for the sulfur redox reaction to show how the design rules involving lattice matching and 3d&#8208;orbital selection improve catalyst performance. Theoretical simulation shows that the positions of Mn and O active sites on the (001) surface are a good match with those of Li and S atoms in polysulfides, resulting in their tight anchoring to each other. Fundamentally, dz2 and dx2&#8722;y2 around the Fermi level are found to be crucial for strongly coupling with the p&#8208;orbitals of the polysulfides and thus decreasing the redox overpotential. Following the theoretical calculation, SmMn2O5 catalyst is synthesized and used as an interlayer in a Li&#8211;S battery. The resulted battery has a high cycling stability over 1500 cycles at 0.5 C and more promisingly a high areal capacity of 7.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 is achieved with a sulfur loading of &#8776;5.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 under the condition of a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) value &#8776;4.6&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Infused Porous Surfaces for Manipulation of Underwater Gas Bubble Transport and Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of thermotropic liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;infused porous surfaces capable of on&#8208;demand immobilization, transport, and release of gas bubbles via a LC phase transition is reported. Their use in the design of cyanobacteria&#8208;inspired object movement, smart catalysts, and bubble gating devices to sense and sort volatile organic compounds and control oxygen level in biomimetic cell cultures is demonstrated.








Abstract
Biomimetic artificial surfaces that enable the manipulation of gas bubble mobility have been explored in a wide range of applications in nanomaterial synthesis, surface defouling, biomedical diagnostics, and therapeutics. Although many superhydrophobic surfaces and isotropic&#8208;lubricant&#8208;infused porous surfaces have been developed to manipulate gas bubbles, the simultaneous control over the adhesion and transport of gas bubbles underwater remains a challenge. Thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs), a class of structured fluids, provide an opportunity to tune the behavior of gas bubbles through LC mesophase transitions using a variety of external stimuli. Using this central idea, the design and synthesis of LC&#8208;infused porous surfaces (LCIPS) is reported and the effects of the LC mesophase on the transport and adhesion of gas bubbles on LCIPS immersed in water elucidated. LCIPS are demonstrated to be a promising class of surfaces with an unprecedented level of responsiveness and functionality, which enables the design of cyanobacteria&#8208;inspired object movement, smart catalysts, and bubble gating devices to sense and sort volatile organic compounds and control oxygen levels in biomimetic cell cultures.

Abstract
Persistent luminescence is a unique optical process where long&#8208;lasting afterglow persists after the cessation of excitation. Nanoscale persistent luminescent materials are getting increased research interest from various fields due to their unique optical property. In recent years, inspiring achievements have been made to produce uniform persistent luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) in a controllable manner, unleashing their fascinating potential, surpassing other types of luminescent materials in a wide variety of application such as high&#8208;contrast bioimaging and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray detection. In this review, the evolution of uniform PLNPs, from their bulk phosphor counterparts, to the &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; preparation of nanoscale persistent luminescent materials, to the recent &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; synthesis of uniform PLNPs is first summarized. The respective milestones of uniform PLNPs prepared by templated synthesis, aqueous synthesis, and colloidal synthesis are highlighted. The key optical properties that can be enhanced in uniform PLNPs, including increasing the persistent luminescence intensity, tuning the excitation irradiance, as well as the emission wavelengths are then analyzed. Detailed strategies to enhance each optical property are also discussed in various sections. Finally, future challenges are highlighted with respect to the perspectives on the development of next&#8208;generation PLNPs with novel applications.

         <title>Nanolayer Laser Absorber for Femtoliter Chemistry in Polymer Reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinct challenges in femtoliter chemistry are precise chemical transfer and reaction in ultrasmall volumes. Here, a novel nanoabsorber film, revolutionizing the standard laser&#8208;induced forward transfer of polymers with significantly improved resolution, time&#8208;, and cost&#8208;efficiency is introduced. Moreover, this technology enables in situ photochemical oxidation within milliseconds, offering a potentially rapid approach for high&#8208;throughput screening of photochemical reaction conditions and substrate scope.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced forward transfer (LIFT) has the potential to be an alternative approach to atomic force microscopy based scanning probe lithography techniques, which have limitations in high&#8208;speed and large&#8208;scale patterning. However, traditional donor slides limit the resolution and chemical flexibility of LIFT. Here, a hematite nanolayer absorber for donor slides to achieve high&#8208;resolution transfers down to sub&#8208;femtoliters is proposed. Being wettable by both aqueous and organic solvents, this new donor significantly increases the chemical scope for the LIFT process. For parallel amino acid coupling reactions, the patterning resolution can now be increased more than five times (&gt;111&#160;000 spots&#160;cm&#8722;2 for hematite donor vs 20&#160;000 spots&#160;cm&#8722;2 for standard polyimide donor) with even faster scanning (2&#160;vs 6&#160;ms per spot). Due to the increased chemical flexibility, other types of reactions inside ultrasmall polymer reactors: copper (I) catalyzed click chemistry and laser&#8208;driven oxidation of a tetrahydroisoquinoline derivative, suggesting the potential of LIFT for both deposition of chemicals, and laser&#8208;driven photochemical synthesis in femtoliters within milliseconds can be explored. Since the hematite shows no damage after typical laser transfer, donors can be regenerated by heat treatment. These findings will transform the LIFT process into an automatable, precise, and highly efficient technology for high&#8208;throughput femtoliter chemistry.

         <title>Vibrational Strong Coupling between Surface Phonon Polaritons and Organic Molecules via Single Quartz Micropillars</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vibrational strong coupling between surface phonon polaritons and molecular vibrations is demonstrated by using single quartz micropillars as optical resonators at mid&#8208;infrared frequencies. The vibrational strong coupling at single optical resonator level shows pronounced mode splitting, anticrossing dispersion, and molecular number dependent coupling strength, which prominently elevates the sensitivity of vibrational strong coupling.








Abstract
Vibrational strong coupling (VSC), the strong coupling between optical resonances and the dipolar absorption of molecular vibrations at mid&#8208;infrared frequencies, holds the great potential for the development of ultrasensitive infrared spectroscopy, the modification of chemical properties of molecules, and the control of chemical reactions. In the realm of ultracompact VSC, there is a need to scale down the size of mid&#8208;infrared optical resonators and to elevate their optical field strength. Herein, by using single quartz micropillars as mid&#8208;infrared optical resonators, the strong coupling is demonstrated between surface phonon polariton (SPhP) resonances and molecular vibrations from far&#8208;field observation. The single quartz micropillars support sharp SPhP resonances with an ultrasmall mode volume, which strongly couples with the molecular vibrations of 4&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohol (C7H7NO3) molecules featuring pronounced mode splitting and anticrossing dispersion. The coupling strength depends on the molecular concentration and reaches the strong coupling regime with only 7300 molecules. The findings pave the way for promoting the VSC sensitivity, miniaturing the VSC devices, and will boost the development of ultracompact mid&#8208;infrared spectroscopy and chemical reaction control devices.

         <title>Boosting Charge Transport in BiVO4 Photoanode for Solar Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of hole polarons is the main cause of the slow migration of hole carriers to the surface for BiVO4 photoanode, which is localized at the BiO8 unit cell. A deep eutectic solvent that can leach Bi atoms from the BiVO4 crystal to selectively destroy the unit structure is reported. After losing Bi atoms from the BiVO4 crystal, the hole carriers will be in a more chainless state and can reach the surface with a faster migration speed to participate in the water oxidation.








Abstract
The ability to regulate charge separation is pivotal for obtaining high efficiency of any photoelectrode used for solar fuel production. Vacancy engineering for metal oxide semiconductor photoelectrode is a major strategy but has faced a formidable challenge in bulk charge transport because of the elusive charge self&#8208;trapping site. In this work, a new deep eutectic solvent to engineer bismuth vacancies (Bivac) of BiVO4 photoanode is reported; the novel Bivac can remarkably increase the charge diffusion coefficient by 5.8&#160;times (from 1.82 &#215; 10&#8722;7 to 1.06 &#215; 10&#8722;6 cm2 s&#8722;1), which boosts the charge transport efficiency. Through further loading CoBi cocatalyst to enhance charge transfer efficiency, the photocurrent density of BiVO4 photoanode with optimal Bivac concentration reaches 4.5 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode under AM 1.5 G illumination, which is higher than that of previously reported Ovac engineered BiVO4 photoanode where the BiVO4 photoanode is synthesized by a similar procedure. This work perfects a cation defect engineering that enables the potential capability to equate the charge transport properties in different types of semiconductor materials for solar fuel conversion.

         <title>Interfacial Design for a 4.6&#160;V High&#8208;Voltage Single&#8208;Crystalline LiCoO2 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials have attracted intensive interest. However, the single&#8208;crystalline LiCoO2 suffers severe structural instability and capacity fading when charged to high voltages (4.6 V vs Li/Li+) due to Co and O element dissolution, crack formation, and electrolyte penetration. In this work, the above problems are inhibited by forming a robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the surface of LiCoO2.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials have attracted intensive interest in offering greater capacity retention than their polycrystalline counterparts by reducing material surfaces and phase boundaries. However, the single&#8208;crystalline LiCoO2 suffers severe structural instability and capacity fading when charged to high voltages (4.6&#160;V) due to Co element dissolution and O loss, crack formation, and subsequent electrolyte penetration. Herein, by forming a robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) in an all&#8208;fluorinated electrolyte, reversible planar gliding along the (003) plane in a single&#8208;crystalline LiCoO2 cathode is protected due to the prevention of element dissolution and electrolyte penetration. The robust CEI effectively controls the performance fading issue of the single&#8208;crystalline cathode at a high operating voltage of 4.6&#160;V, providing new insights for improved electrolyte design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery cathode materials.

Herein, by forming a robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) in an all-fluorinated electrolyte, reversible planar gliding along the (003) plane in a single-crystalline LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode is protected due to the prevention of element dissolution and electrolyte penetration. The robust CEI effectively controls the performance fading issue of the single-crystalline cathode at a high operating voltage of 4.6&#160;V, providing new insights for improved electrolyte design of high-energy-density battery cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Redistributed Current Density in Lateral Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors Enabling Uniform Area Emission with Good Stability and Arbitrary Tunability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel kind of lateral organic light&#8208;emitting transistor with the incorporation of a charge&#8208;transport buffer layer (CTB&#8208;OLET) affords uniform RGB area emission with good gate tunable ability (ON/OFF ratio 106), high loop stability, and arbitrary tunability, enabling a high aperture ratio of over 80%, suggesting its great potential for next&#8208;generation display technology.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs), integrating the functions of an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) and organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) in a single device, are promising for the next&#8208;generation display technology. However, the great challenge of achieving uniform area emission in OLETs with good stability and arbitrary tunability hinders their development in this field. Herein, an effective solution to obtain well&#8208;defined area emission in lateral OLETs by incorporating a charge&#8208;transport buffer (CTB) layer between the conducting channel and emitting layer is proposed. Comprehensive theoretical simulation and experimental results demonstrate redistributed potential beneath the drain electrode under the shielding effect of the CBT layer, resulting in a highly uniform current density. In this case, uniform recombination of balanced holes and electrons can be guaranteed, which is essential for the formation of area emission in the following OLETs. RGB OLETs with uniform area emission are constructed, which show good gate tunable ability (ON/OFF ratio 106), high loop stability (over 200 cycles) and high aperture ratio (over 80%) due to the arbitrary tunability of the device geometry. This work provides a new avenue for constructing area&#8208;emission lateral OLETs, which have great potential for display technology because of their good compatibility with conventional fabrication techniques.

         <title>Biohybrid Variable&#8208;Stiffness Soft Actuators that Self&#8208;Create Bone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinduced variable&#8208;stiffness actuators are prepared by combining polypyrrole and alginate gel functionalized with cell&#8208;derived plasma membrane nanofragments. The actuators can morph in various shapes and change their properties from soft to rigid by growing their own bone, due to mineralization, within 2 days. Different patterning for programmed directional movements, and morphing and adhesion to bone tissue are also demonstrated.








Abstract
Inspired by the dynamic process of initial bone development, in which a soft tissue turns into a solid load&#8208;bearing structure, the fabrication, optimization, and characterization of bioinduced variable&#8208;stiffness actuators that can morph in various shapes and change their properties from soft to rigid are hereby presented. Bilayer devices are prepared by combining the electromechanically active properties of polypyrrole with the compliant behavior of alginate gels that are uniquely functionalized with cell&#8208;derived plasma membrane nanofragments (PMNFs), previously shown to mineralize within 2 days, which promotes the mineralization in the gel layer to achieve the soft to stiff change by growing their own bone. The mineralized actuator shows an evident frozen state compared to the movement before mineralization. Next, patterned devices show programmed directional and fixated morphing. These variable&#8208;stiffness devices can wrap around and, after the PMNF&#8208;induced mineralization in and on the gel layer, adhere and integrate onto bone tissue. The developed biohybrid variable&#8208;stiffness actuators can be used in soft (micro&#8208;)robotics and as potential tools for bone repair or bone tissue engineering.

         <title>Multilayer WSe2/MoS2 Heterojunction Phototransistors through Periodically Arrayed Nanopore Structures for Bandgap Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the high exciton binding energy, the efficiency of WSe2/MoS2 heterojunction phototransistors is improved by forming periodic arrayed nanopore structures for bandgap engineering. In particular, enhanced carrier lifetime and increased photocurrent are observed with a modulated charge carrier balance of the WSe2/MoS2 heterojunction phototransistor in the active area upon illumination.








Abstract
While 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising building blocks for various optoelectronic applications, limitations remain for multilayered TMD&#8208;based photodetectors: an indirect bandgap and a short carrier lifetime by strongly bound excitons. Accordingly, multilayered TMDs with a direct bandgap and an enhanced carrier lifetime are required for the development of various optoelectronic devices. Here, periodically arrayed nanopore structures (PANS) are proposed for improving the efficiency of multilayered p&#8208;WSe2/n&#8208;MoS2 phototransistors. Density functional theory calculations as well as photoluminescence and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence measurements are performed to characterize the photodetector figures of merit of multilayered p&#8208;WSe2/n&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures with PANS. The characteristics of the heterojunction devices with PANS reveal an enhanced responsivity and detectivity measured under 405&#160;nm laser excitation, which at 1.7 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1 and 1.7 &#215; 1013 Jones are almost two orders of magnitude higher than those of pristine devices, 3.6 &#215; 102 A W&#8722;1 and 3.6 &#215; 1011 Jones, respectively. Such enhanced optical properties of WSe2/MoS2 heterojunctions with PANS represent a significant step toward next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Tailoring Hyperbranched Poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester) as a Robust and Universal Platform for Cytosolic Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;degradable, hyperbranched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester) (HPAE) with well&#8208;tailored structure enables highly efficient cytosolic protein/peptide delivery into cancer cells, and it quickly degrades in response to over&#8208;produced H2O2 to facilitate the intracellular cargo release and potentiate the protein activity.








Abstract
Cytosolic protein delivery is a prerequisite for protein&#8208;based biotechnologies and therapeutics on intracellular targets. Polymers that can complex with proteins to form nano&#8208;assemblies represent one of the most important categories of materials, because of the ease of nano&#8208;fabrication, high protein loading efficiency, no need for purification, and maintenance of protein bioactivity. Stable protein encapsulation and efficient intracellular liberation are two critical yet opposite processes toward cytosolic delivery, and polymers that can resolve these two conflicting challenges are still lacking. Herein, hyperbranched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester) (HPAE) with backbone&#8208;embedded phenylboronic acid (PBA) is developed to synchronize these two processes, wherein PBA enhanced protein encapsulation via nitrogen&#8211;boronate (N&#8211;B) coordination while triggered polymer degradation and protein release upon oxidation by H2O2 in cancer cells. Upon optimization of the branching degree, charge density, and PBA distribution, the best&#8208;performing A2&#8208;B3&#8208;C2&#8208;S2&#8208;P2 is identified, which mediates robust delivery of various native proteins/peptides with distinct molecular weights (1.6&#8211;430&#160;kDa) and isoelectric points (4.1&#8211;10.3) into cancer cells, including enzymes, toxins, antibodies, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Moreover, A2&#8208;B3&#8208;C2&#8208;S2&#8208;P2 mediates effective cytosolic delivery of saporin both in vitro and in vivo to provoke remarkable anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. Such a potent and universal platform holds transformative potentials for protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Reconstructable Uterus&#8208;Derived Materials for Uterus Recovery toward Efficient Live Births</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconstructable uterus&#8208;derived materials (RUMs) with different states and shapes can be designed and fabricated, achieving highly efficient live births in rats with severe uterine injury. The RUMs can effectively prevent intrauterine adhesion, and promote endometrial regeneration and muscle collagen reconstruction, as well as accelerate wound healing by constructing a physical barrier and secreting cytokines, allowing efficient uterus recovery and live births.








Abstract
Uterine factor infertility is increasingly common in modern society and has severely affected human life and health. However, the existing biomaterial scaffold&#8208;mediated systems remain limited in efficient uterus recovery, leading to low pregnancy rate and live births. Here, reconstructable uterus&#8208;derived materials (RUMs) are demonstrated by combining uterus&#8208;derived extracellular matrix and seeded chorionic villi mesenchymal stem cells for uterus recovery, achieving highly efficient live births in rats with severe uterine injury. The RUMs can be designed into different states (such as, liquid RUMs and solid RUMs) and shapes (such as, cuboid, triangular&#8208;prism, and cube) in terms of requirements. The RUMs can effectively prevent intrauterine adhesion, and promote endometrial regeneration and muscle collagen reconstruction, as well as, accelerate wound healing by constructing a physical barrier and secreting cytokines, allowing efficient uterus recovery. The injured uterus nearly achieves complete recovery after treating with the RUMs and has normal pregnancies for supporting fetal development and live births, similar to the normal rats. The study provides a regenerative medicine therapeutics for uterine factor infertility.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Cost and Air&#8208;Stable Rechargeable Aluminum&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aluminum&#8208;based hydrated eutectic electrolyte composed of Al(ClO4)3&#183;9H2O and succinonitrile is developed for rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs). The electrolyte is highly conductive, nonflammable, and air&#8208;stable. The charge/discharge process of this AIB follows Al3+ insertion/extraction, and three&#8208;electron transfer is realized.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the abundant reserves, low cost, and high capacity of the Al anode. However, the development of AIBs is currently hindered by the usage of AlCl3/1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride electrolyte, which is expensive, highly corrosive, and extremely air&#8208;sensitive. Herein, a new hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) composed of hydrated aluminum perchlorate and succinonitrile for low&#8208;cost, noncorrosive, and air&#8208;stable AIBs is reported. Crystal water in the hydrated aluminum perchlorate plays a vital role in forming the HEE, in which one H2O and five succinonitrile molecules coordinate with one Al3+ ion. The optimized ratio of Al(ClO4)3&#183;9H2O to succinonitrile is 1:12. When combining with the self&#8208;doped polyaniline cathode, the associated AIB delivers a high discharge capacity of 185 mAh g&#8722;1 over 300 cycles; and the charge/discharge mechanism in the HEE is studied experimentally and theoretically. The HEE is nonflammable, air&#8208;stable, and noncorrosive, thus enabling good air tolerance and facile fabrication of AIBs.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Activatable Polymer Nano&#8208;Immunomodulator for Precision Cancer Photoimmunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;activatable polymer nano&#8208;immunomodulator comprising a near infrared&#8208;absorbing semiconducting polymer and an amphipathic polymer conjugated with a Toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist via an acid&#8208;labile linker is developed. The synergistic activity of released immunogenic factors and precise activation of TLR7 pathways at a tumor site elicits effective adaptive antitumor response via an in&#160;situ vaccine&#8208;like function.








Abstract
Cancer nanomedicine combined with immunotherapy has become a promising strategy for treating cancer in terms of safety and potency; however, precise regulation of the activation of antitumor immunity remains challenging. Herein, a smart semiconducting polymer nano&#8208;immunomodulator (SPNI), which responds to the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), for precision photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer, is reported. The SPNI is self&#8208;assembled by a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing semiconducting polymer and an amphipathic polymer conjugated with a Toll&#8208;like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist via an acid&#8208;labile linker. Upon arrival at tumor site, SPNI undergoes hydrolysis and triggers an efficient liberation of TLR7 agonist in response to the acidic TME for dendritic cell activation. Moreover, SPNI exerts photodynamic effects for direct tumor eradication and immunogenic cancer cell death under NIR photoirradiation. The synergistic action of released immunogenic factors and acidic&#8208;TME&#8208;activated TLR7 agonist can serve as an in situ generated cancer vaccine to evoke strong antitumor activities. Notably, such localized immune activation boosts systemic antitumor immune responses, resulting in enhanced cytotoxic CD8+ T infiltration to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Thereby, this work presents a general strategy to devise prodrug of immunotherapeutics for precise regulation of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Bioinspired 2D Isotropically Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D fatigue&#8208;resistant hydrogels are fabricated through synergistically engineering the 2D lamellar microstructures and nanocrystalline domains, involving the formation of preferentially aligned lamellar micro/nanostructures through the bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting process, followed by compression annealing. Their application as load&#8208;bearing components in a jellyfish&#8208;inspired underwater robot is investigated.








Abstract
Engineering conventional hydrogels with muscle&#8208;like anisotropic structures can efficiently increase the fatigue threshold over 1000 J m&#8722;2 along the alignment direction; however, the fatigue threshold perpendicular to the alignment is still as low as &#8776;100&#8211;300 J m&#8722;2, making them nonsuitable for those scenarios where isotropic properties are desired. Here, inspired by the distinct structure&#8211;properties relationship of heart valves, a simple yet general strategy to engineer conventional hydrogels with unprecedented yet isotropic fatigue resistance, with a record&#8208;high fatigue threshold over 1,500 J m&#8722;2 along two arbitrary in&#8208;plane directions is reported. The two&#8208;step process involves the formation of preferentially aligned lamellar micro/nanostructures through a bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting process, followed by compression annealing, synergistically contributing to extraordinary resistance to fatigue crack propagation. The study provides a viable means of fabricating soft materials with isotropically extreme properties, thereby unlocking paths to apply these advanced soft materials toward applications including soft robotics, flexible electronics, e&#8208;skins, and tissue&#160;patches.

         <title>Tackling Humidity with Designer Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Gas Sensing Soft Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Humidity influence in sensing of volatile organic compounds is tuned by materials design. The anions of ionic liquids tailor the gas sensing material's sensitivity to humidity, yielding either humidity&#8208;sensitive or humidity&#8208;tolerant odorant sensors that do not require sample preconditioning or signal processing to correct humidity impact, thereby contributing to the widespread field of artificial olfaction.








Abstract
Relative humidity is simultaneously a sensing target and a contaminant in gas and volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing systems, where strategies to control humidity interference are required. An unmet challenge is the creation of gas&#8208;sensitive materials where the response to humidity is controlled by the material itself. Here, humidity effects are controlled through the design of gelatin formulations in ionic liquids without and with liquid crystals as electrical and optical sensors, respectively. In this design, the anions [DCA]&#8722; and [Cl]&#8722; of room temperature ionic liquids from the 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium family tailor the response to humidity and, subsequently, sensing of VOCs in dry and humid conditions. Due to the combined effect of the materials formulations and sensing mechanisms, changing the anion from [DCA]&#8722; to the much more hygroscopic [Cl]&#8722;, leads to stronger electrical responses and much weaker optical responses to humidity. Thus, either humidity sensors or humidity&#8208;tolerant VOC sensors that do not require sample preconditioning or signal processing to correct humidity impact are obtained. With the wide spread of 3D&#8208; and 4D&#8208;printing and intelligent devices, the monitoring and tuning of humidity in sustainable biobased materials offers excellent opportunities in e&#8208;nose sensing arrays and wearable devices compatible with operation at room conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Humidity influence in sensing of volatile organic compounds is tuned by materials design. The anions of ionic liquids tailor the gas sensing material's sensitivity to humidity, yielding either humidity-sensitive or humidity-tolerant odorant sensors that do not require sample preconditioning or signal processing to correct humidity impact, thereby contributing to the widespread field of artificial olfaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative humidity is simultaneously a sensing target and a contaminant in gas and volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing systems, where strategies to control humidity interference are required. An unmet challenge is the creation of gas-sensitive materials where the response to humidity is controlled by the material itself. Here, humidity effects are controlled through the design of gelatin formulations in ionic liquids without and with liquid crystals as electrical and optical sensors, respectively. In this design, the anions [DCA]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [Cl]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; of room temperature ionic liquids from the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium family tailor the response to humidity and, subsequently, sensing of VOCs in dry and humid conditions. Due to the combined effect of the materials formulations and sensing mechanisms, changing the anion from [DCA]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to the much more hygroscopic [Cl]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, leads to stronger electrical responses and much weaker optical responses to humidity. Thus, either humidity sensors or humidity-tolerant VOC sensors that do not require sample preconditioning or signal processing to correct humidity impact are obtained. With the wide spread of 3D- and 4D-printing and intelligent devices, the monitoring and tuning of humidity in sustainable biobased materials offers excellent opportunities in e-nose sensing arrays and wearable devices compatible with operation at room conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Interfacial Modification and Crystallization Control by Biguanide Hydrochloride for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with PCE of 24.4%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biguanide hydrochloride (BGCl) is used at the tin oxide/perovskite interface for simultaneous interfacial modification and crystallization control. Assisted by Lewis coordination, electrostatic coupling and hydrogen bond anchoring between BGCl and its neighbors, better energetic alignment, reduced interfacial defects, and homogeneous perovskite crystallites are achieved, yielding an impressive power conversion efficiency of 24.4% and long&#8208;term device stability.








Abstract
Interfacial modification, which serves multiple roles, is vital for the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. Here, a multifunctional interfacial material, biguanide hydrochloride (BGCl), is introduced between tin oxide (SnO2) and perovskite to enhance electron extraction, as well as the crystal growth of the perovskite. The BGCl can chemically link to the SnO2 through Lewis coordination/electrostatic coupling and help to anchor the PbI2. Better energetic alignment, reduced interfacial defects, and homogeneous perovskite crystallites are achieved, yielding an impressive certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.4%, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.19&#160;V and a drastically improved fill factor of 82.4%. More importantly, the unencapsulated device maintains 95% of its initial PCE after aging for over 500 h at 20&#160;&#176;C and 30% relative humidity in ambient conditions. These results suggest that the incorporation of BGCl is a promising strategy to modify the interface and control the crystallization of the perovskite, toward the attainment of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells as well as other perovskite&#8208;based electronics.

         <title>Structural Insights into Multi&#8208;Metal Spinel Oxide Nanoparticles for Boosting Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic approach exploring the complex structure of multi&#8208;metal oxide electrocatalysts is developed to obtain high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. A detailed model study of uniform&#8208;sized Mn&#8208;, Fe&#8208;, and Co&#8208;containing oxide nanoparticles reveals that the incorporation of Co tunes the geometric and electronic structure of Mn active sites, elucidating the catalytic origin of the remarkable ORR activity.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;metal oxide (MMO) materials have significant potential to facilitate various demanding reactions by providing additional degrees of freedom in catalyst design. However, a fundamental understanding of the (electro)catalytic activity of MMOs is limited because of the intrinsic complexity of their multi&#8208;element nature. Additional complexities arise when MMO catalysts have crystalline structures with two different metal site occupancies, such as the spinel structure, which makes it more challenging to investigate the origin of the (electro)catalytic activity of MMOs. Here, uniform&#8208;sized multi&#8208;metal spinel oxide nanoparticles composed of Mn, Co, and Fe as model MMO electrocatalysts are synthesized and the contributions of each element to the structural flexibility of the spinel oxides are systematically studied, which boosts the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Detailed crystal and electronic structure characterizations combined with electrochemical and computational studies reveal that the incorporation of Co not only increases the preferential octahedral site occupancy, but also modifies the electronic state of the ORR&#8208;active Mn site to enhance the intrinsic ORR activity. As a result, nanoparticles of the optimized catalyst, Co0.25Mn0.75Fe2.0&#8208;MMO, exhibit a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.904&#160;V (versus RHE) and mass activity of 46.9 A goxide&#8722;1 (at 0.9&#160;V versus RHE) with promising stability.

         <title>Smart Adhesives via Magnetic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart adhesive that exploits bioinspired adhesives and hard&#8208;magnetic soft materials is introduced to achieve dynamically tunable adhesion. The smart adhesive with a magnetic tip is actuated by a magnetic field to create an initial crack at the adhesion interface, so as to modulate the adhesion from strong to weak.








Abstract
Smart adhesives possess a wide range of applications owing to their reversibly and repeatedly switchable adhesion in transfer technology. Despite recent advances, it still remains a technical and scientific challenge to achieve strategies for rapidly tunable adhesion in a noncontact manner. In this study, a smart adhesive to achieve dynamically tunable adhesion is developed. Specifically, a mushroom&#8208;shaped adhesive with a magnetized tip is actuated to reversibly and rapidly transform the morphology via magnetic actuation. The smart adhesive has two working modes, namely, selective pickup mode and pick&#8208;and&#8208;place mode. In the selective pickup mode, the external magnetic field is applied and the tip undergoes bending deformation. Changes in tip morphology allow for a reversible switch of the adhesion between &#8220;turn on&#8221; and &#8220;turn off.&#8221; In the pick&#8208;and&#8208;place mode, the external magnetic field is applied when the target object needs to be released. Upward bending deformation of the micro&#8208;beam, a part of the tip, creates an initial crack at the edge of the adhesion interface. The propagation of the edge crack modulates the adhesion from strong to weak and the target object is instantly released. The proposed smart adhesive may be of interest for practical applications demanding highly precise and swiftly controlled movements.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyclic electrochemical polishing and thermal annealing approach that allows the effective conversion from commercial Cu to single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) foils is reported. Using Cu(111), a general &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8208;etching&#8221; method is developed for producing pure monolayer graphene film with high and uniform electronic quality. This work provides new ways and mechanisms to address these key issues.








Abstract
Synthesis of large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline graphene monolayers without multilayers involves the fabrication of proper single&#8208;crystalline substrates and the ubiquitous formation of multilayered graphene islands during chemical vapor deposition. Here, a method of cyclic electrochemical polishing combined with thermal annealing, which allows the conversion of commercial polycrystalline Cu foils to single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) with an almost 100% yield, is presented. A global &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8208;etching&#8221; method that is capable of fabricating large&#8208;area pure single&#8208;crystalline graphene monolayers without multilayers through selectively etching bottom multilayered graphene underneath large area as&#8208;grown graphene monolayer on Cu(111) surface is demonstrated. Terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy (THz&#8208;TDS) measurement of the pure monolayer graphene film shows a high average sheet conductivity of 2.8 mS and mean carrier mobility of 6903 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 over a large area. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the selective etching is induced by the much easier diffusion of hydrogen atoms than hydrocarbon radicals across the edges of the top graphene layer, and the simulated selective etching processes based on phase field modeling are well consistent with experimental observations. This work provides new ways toward the production of single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) and the synthesis of pure monolayer graphene with high electronic quality.

A global &#8220;bottom-up-etching&#8221; method that is capable of fabricating large-area pure single-crystalline graphene monolayers without multilayers through selectively etching bottom multilayered graphene underneath large area as-grown graphene monolayer on Cu(111) surface is demonstrated. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) measurement of the pure monolayer graphene film shows a high average sheet conductivity of 2.8 mS and mean carrier mobility of 6903 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over a large area. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the selective etching is induced by the much easier diffusion of hydrogen atoms than hydrocarbon radicals across the edges of the top graphene layer, and the simulated selective etching processes based on phase field modeling are well consistent with experimental observations. This work provides new ways toward the production of single-crystal Cu(111) and the synthesis of pure monolayer graphene with high electronic quality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Aluminum Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state aluminum batteries are constructed using quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte with high air stability, still operating well when exposed to air and if burning in fire, revealing a long&#8208;term air stability and high safety. The results offer a novel approach for designing highly stable and safe aluminum batteries, providing a feasible strategy to boost applications in grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Nonaqueous rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) of low cost and high safety are promising for next&#8208;generation energy storage. With the presence of ionic liquid (IL) electrolytes, their high moisture sensitivity and poor stability would lead to critical issues in liquid RABs, including undesirable gas production, irreversible activity loss, and an unstable electrode interface, undermining the operation stability. To address such issues, herein, a stable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte is developed via encapsulating a small amount of an IL into a metal&#8211;organic framework, which not only protects the IL from moisture, but creates sufficient ionic transport network between the active materials and the electrolyte. Owing to the generated stable states at both positive&#8208;electrode&#8211;electrolyte and negative&#8208;electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces, the as&#8208;assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Al&#8211;graphite batteries deliver specific capacity of &#8776;75&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 (with positive electrode material loading &#8776;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, much higher than that in the conventional liquid systems). The batteries present a long&#8208;term cycling stability beyond 2000 cycles, with great stability even upon exposure to air within 2 h and under flame combustion tests. Such technology opens a new platform of designing highly safe rechargeable Al batteries for stable energy storage.

         <title>Dynamic Metal&#8211;Ligand Interaction of Synergistic Polymers for Bistable See&#8208;Through Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible see&#8208;through bistable electrochromic display based on polymer&#8208;assisted dynamic metal&#8211;ligand coordination is achieved successfully. It benefits from the stabilization of dye molecules by metal ions, the fixing effect, and the inhibited diffusion for metal ions by the closely associated ligand polymers. The synergistic polymers possess good film&#8208;forming ability, easy fabrication, and high transmittance with excellent bistability. These contribute potential for energy&#8208;saving displays.








Abstract
Bistable electrochromic materials are a promising alternative solution to reduce energy consumption in displays. Limited by the mechanism and lack of a design strategy, only a few electrochromic materials have truly been able achieve bistability. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to design bistable electrochromic materials based on polymer&#8208;assisted dynamic metal&#8211;ligand coordination. The mechanism and materials of such unconventional electrochromic systems are proved by sufficient characterization. Synergistic stabilization of polymerized switchable dyes and the ionic ligand polymer are attracted to each other by supramolecular forces. The color states of the dye molecules are controlled and stabilized by valence changes of the metal ions. Meanwhile, through the polymerization of the electrochromic material and the nearby metal&#8211;ligand material, the metal ions of the electroinduced valence change are tightly fixed, and the related diffusion problem of the active EC component is also almost completely suppressed. This strategy successfully enables preparation of the corresponding transparent electrochromic displays with good performances, such as, the display information is clearly visible for more than 1.5 h without consuming energy.&#160;Furthermore, the new way of dynamic coordination or dissociation bistable displays could likely prosper the development of the electrochromic area and inspire other fields.

         <title>Anisotropic Foams via Frontal Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast and convenient method to obtain anisotropic structural foams using frontal polymerization is described. A full factorial combination of variables is used to correlate the input parameters with the structure of the obtained foams. This work shows promise for creating foams with aligned cellular structures that allow anisotropic mass and energy transport properties in high&#8208;performance structural solids.








Abstract
The properties of foams, an important class of cellular solids, are most sensitive to the volume fraction and openness of its elementary compartments; size, shape, orientation, and the interconnectedness of the cells are other important design attributes. Control of these morphological traits would allow the tailored fabrication of useful materials. While approaches like ice templating have produced foams with elongated cells, there is a need for rapid, versatile, and energy&#8208;efficient methods that also control the local order and macroscopic alignment of cellular elements. Here, a fast and convenient method is described to obtain anisotropic structural foams using frontal polymerization. Foams are fabricated by curing mixtures of dicyclopentadiene and a blowing agent via frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP). The materials are characterized using microcomputed tomography (micro&#8208;CT) and an image analysis protocol to quantify the morphological characteristics. The cellular structure, porosity, and hardness of the foams change with blowing agent, concentration, and resin viscosity. Moreover, a full factorial combination of variables is used to correlate each parameter with the structure of the obtained foams. The results demonstrate the controlled production of foams with specific morphologies using the simple and efficient method of frontal polymerization.

         <title>Tailoring Aggregation Extent of Photosensitizers to Boost Phototherapy Potency for Eliciting Systemic Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A discretely integrated nanofabrication platform (named Pt&#8208;ICG/PES) is reported to boost phototherapy potency and antitumor immunity. Tailoring the aggregation extent of indocyanine green (ICG) to an optimized state can simultaneously relieve photobleaching and aggregation&#8208;caused&#8208;quenching effects, maximizing phototherapy efficiency. Equipped with photodynamic therapy/photothermal therapy/chemotherapy, Pt&#8208;ICG/PES magnifies immunogenic cell death effect, exerting synergistic promotion effect of antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Phototherapy is effective for triggering the immunogenic cell death (ICD) effect. However, its efficacy is limited by low 1O2&#160;generation and photothermal conversion efficacy due to two irreconcilable obstacles, namely the aggregation&#8208;caused&#8208;quenching (ACQ) effect and photobleaching. In this work, a discretely integrated nanofabrication (DIN) platform (Pt&#8208;ICG/PES) is developed by facile coordination coassembly of cisplatin (Pt), photosensitizer molecules (indocyanine green (ICG)), and polymeric spacer (p(MEO2MA&#8208;co&#8208;OEGMA)&#8208;b&#8208;pSS (PES)). By controlling the ICG/PES feeding ratio, the aggregation of ICG can be easily tailored using PES as an isolator to balance the ACQ effect and photobleaching, thereby maximizing the phototherapy potency of Pt&#8208;ICG/PES. With the optimized ratio of each component, Pt&#8208;ICG/PES integrates the complementarity of photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and chemotherapeutics to magnify the ICD effect, exerting a synergistic antitumor immunity&#8208;promoting effect. Additionally, temperature&#8208;sensitive PES enables photothermally guided drug delivery. In a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, Pt&#8208;ICG/PES elicits effective release of danger&#8208;associated molecular patterns, dendritic cell maturation, cytotoxic T lymphocytes activation, cytokine secretion, M2&#160;macrophage repolarization, and distal tumor suppression, confirming the excellent in situ tumor ICD effect as well as robust systematic antitumor immunity. Ultimately, a versatile DIN strategy is developed to optimize the phototherapeutic efficacy for improving antitumor effects and strengthening systemic antitumor immunity.

         <title>Compositionally Graded KNN&#8208;Based Multilayer Composite with Excellent Piezoelectric Temperature Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of structural gradient is proposed by designing compositionally graded multilayer composite with multiple successive phase transitions. The structural gradient ceramics exhibit a superior piezoelectric temperature stability over extensively studied lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics, and thereby achieve a new record performance.








Abstract
The inherent disadvantage of lead&#8208;free potassium sodium niobate (KNN)&#8208;based ceramics is the severe temperature instability of piezoelectric charge coefficient (d33) caused by the polymorphic phase boundary. Herein, a new concept of structural gradient is proposed by designing compositionally graded multilayer composites with multiple successive phase transitions, to solve the challenge of the inferior temperature stability. The structural gradient ceramics exhibit a superior temperature reliability (d33 remains almost unchanged in the temperature range of 25&#8211;100 &#176;C), far outperforming the previously reported KNN counterparts with d33 variation above 27% over the same temperature range. The synergistic contribution of the continuous phase transition, the strain gradient, and the complementary effect of each constituent layer leads to the excellent temperature stability, which is also confirmed by phase&#8208;field simulation. These findings are expected to provide a new paradigm for functional material design with outstanding temperature stability.

         <title>Oriented 2D Perovskite Wafers for Anisotropic X&#8208;ray Detection through a Fast Tableting Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new composition of 2D perovskite&#8212;4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bismuth iodide [(F&#8208;PEA)3BiI6] is reported, and large and oriented perovskite wafers over 1 cm2 are obtained through a facile and time&#8208;saving strategy by tableting disordered 2D perovskite powders. Consequently, the unique anisotropy of four&#8208;times conductivity difference between the vertical and lateral directions enables great potential application in hard X&#8208;ray detection.








Abstract
2D perovskite single crystals have emerged as excellent optoelectronic materials owing to their unique anisotropic properties. However, growing large 2D perovskite single crystals remains challenging and time&#8208;consuming. Here, a new composition of lead&#8208;free 2D perovskite&#8212;4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bismuth iodide [(F&#8208;PEA)3BiI6] is reported. An oriented bulk 2D wafer with a large area of 1.33 cm2 is obtained by tableting disordered 2D perovskite powders, resulting in anisotropic resistivities of 5 &#215; 1010 and 2 &#215; 1011&#160;&#937; cm in the lateral and vertical directions, respectively. Trivalent Bi3+ ions are employed to achieve a stronger ionic bonding energy with I&#8208; ions, which intrinsically suppress the ion&#8208;migration effect. Thus, the oriented wafer presents good capabilities in both charge collection and ion&#8208;migration suppression under a large applied bias along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, making it suitable for low&#8208;dosage X&#8208;ray detection. The large&#8208;area wafer shows a sensitive response to hard X&#8208;rays operated at a tube voltage of 120 kVp with the lowest detectable dose rate of 30 nGy s&#8208;1. Thus, the fast tableting process is a facile and effective strategy to synthesize large&#8208;area, oriented 2D wafers, showing excellent X&#8208;ray detection performance and operational stability that are comparable to those of 2D perovskite single crystals.

         <title>Continuous Carbon Channels Enable Full Na&#8208;Ion Accessibility for Superior Room&#8208;Temperature Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique continuous carbon pores serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide full Na&#8208;ion accessibility. The formation of a solid sodium sulfide interphase in the channels plays critical roles in enabling fast and stable cycling performance of Na&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Porous carbon has been widely used as an efficient host to encapsulate highly active molecular sulfur (S) in Li&#8211;S and Na&#8211;S batteries. However, for these sub&#8208;nanosized pores, it is a challenge to provide fully accessible sodium ions with unobstructed channels during cycling, particularly for high sulfur content. It is well recognized that solid interphase with full coverage over the designed architectures plays critical roles in promoting rapid charge transfer and stable conversion reactions in batteries, whereas constructing a high&#8208;ionic&#8208;conductivity solid interphase in the pores is very difficult. Herein, unique continuous carbonaceous pores are tailored, which can serve as multifunctional channels to encapsulate highly active S and provide fully accessible pathways for sodium ions. Solid sodium sulfide interphase layers are also realized in the channels, showing high Na&#8208;ion conductivity toward stabilizing the redox kinetics of the S cathode during charge/discharge processes. This systematically designed carbon&#8208;hosted sulfur cathode delivers superior cycling performance (420 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles), high capacity retention of &#8776;90% over 500 cycles at current density of 0.5 A g&#8722;1, and outstanding rate capability (470 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1) for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

Abstract
Since the discovery of graphene, its excellent physical properties have greatly improved the performance of optoelectronic devices and brought important technological advances to optical research and its applications. Here, graphene is introduced to the field of optical&#8208;tweezer technology and demonstrate a new graphene&#8208;based opto&#8208;thermoelectric tweezer. This technology not only reduces the incident light energy required by two orders of magnitude (compared with traditional optical tweezers), it also brings new advantages such as a much broader working bandwidth and a larger working area compared to those of widely researched gold&#8208;film&#8208;based opto&#8208;thermoelectric tweezers. Compared with gold film, graphene exhibits higher thermal conductivity and higher uniformity and is easier to process. Thus, it is found that even monolayer graphene provides stable trapping for particles in a broad bandwidth and that performance is enhanced as the number of graphene layers increases. Furthermore, parallel trap multiple particles as desired shapes can be easily generated with structured graphene patterns. This work demonstrates the enormous application potential of graphene in optical&#8208;tweezer technology and will promote their application to the trapping or concentration of cells and biomolecules as well as to microfluidics and biosensors.

         <title>Zwitterionic Polymer Electroplating Facilitates the Preparation of Electrode Surfaces for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic polypyrrole (ZiPPy) is applied to produce an optimal surface for biosensing electrodes. ZiPPy efficiently hydrates the electrode surface to minimize nonspecific protein adsorption, while enabling rapid, controlled polymer deposition through electropolymerization. ZiPPy&#8208;coated electrodes are used to detect neutralizing antibodies against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in human saliva.








Abstract
Surface chemistry critically affects the diagnostic performance of biosensors. An ideal sensor surface should be resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption, yet be conducive to analytical responses. Here a new polymeric material, zwitterionic polypyrrole (ZiPPy), is reported to produce optimal surface condition for biosensing electrodes. ZiPPy combines two unique advantages: the zwitterionic function that efficiently hydrates electrode surface, hindering nonspecific binding of hydrophobic proteins; and the pyrrole backbone, which enables rapid (&lt;7&#160;min), controlled deposition of ZiPPy through electropolymerization. ZiPPy&#8208;coated electrodes show lower electrochemical impedance and less nonspecific protein adsorption (low fouling), outperforming bare and polypyrrole&#8208;coated electrodes. Moreover, affinity ligands for target biomarkers can be immobilized together with ZiPPy in a single&#8208;step electropolymerization. ZiPPy&#8208;coated electrodes are developed with specificity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). The prepared sensor detects SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 antibodies in human saliva down to 50&#160;ng mL&#8722;1, without the need for sample purification or secondary labeling.

&lt;p&gt;Zwitterionic polypyrrole (ZiPPy) is applied to produce an optimal surface for biosensing electrodes. ZiPPy efficiently hydrates the electrode surface to minimize nonspecific protein adsorption, while enabling rapid, controlled polymer deposition through electropolymerization. ZiPPy-coated electrodes are used to detect neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human saliva.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface chemistry critically affects the diagnostic performance of biosensors. An ideal sensor surface should be resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption, yet be conducive to analytical responses. Here a new polymeric material, zwitterionic polypyrrole (ZiPPy), is reported to produce optimal surface condition for biosensing electrodes. ZiPPy combines two unique advantages: the zwitterionic function that efficiently hydrates electrode surface, hindering nonspecific binding of hydrophobic proteins; and the pyrrole backbone, which enables rapid (&amp;lt;7&#160;min), controlled deposition of ZiPPy through electropolymerization. ZiPPy-coated electrodes show lower electrochemical impedance and less nonspecific protein adsorption (low fouling), outperforming bare and polypyrrole-coated electrodes. Moreover, affinity ligands for target biomarkers can be immobilized together with ZiPPy in a single-step electropolymerization. ZiPPy-coated electrodes are developed with specificity for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The prepared sensor detects SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in human saliva down to 50&#160;ng mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, without the need for sample purification or secondary labeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors</title>

         <dc:description>
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (A&#8208;HSCs) based on a layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 cathode, an activated carbon cloth anode, and an aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte are successfully developed. The A&#8208;HSCs deliver an ultrahigh capacitance, amenable area energy density, and decent durability. This study proposes a new paradigm for electrochemical energy storage.








Abstract
The development of novel electrochemical energy storage devices is a grand challenge. Here, an aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (A&#8208;HSC), consisting of a layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 based cathode, an activated carbon cloth anode, and an aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte is developed. The aqueous A&#8208;HSC demonstrates an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 1550 mF cm&#8722;2 with a wide voltage window of 2.0 V. An amenable peak areal energy density (861.2 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2) and a decent capacitance retention (72.2% after 5000 cycles) are also achieved, surpassing traditional metal&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors. Ex situ characterizations reveal that NH4+ intercalation/deintercalation in the layered &#948;&#8208;MnO2 is accompanied by hydrogen bond formation/breaking. This work proposes a new paradigm for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Constructing a Stable Interface Layer by Tailoring Solvation Chemistry in Carbonate Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solvation chemistry in a commercial carbonate electrolyte is tailored by adding tetramethylurea cosolvent and an additive. As a result, a highly conductive and stable interface layer is constructed and lithium hexafluorophosphate decomposition is inhibited. This simple strategy can not only suppress Li&#8208;dendrite growth and hydrogen fluoride production to prolong cycle life, but also enhances the temperature tolerance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are considered as promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high energy density. However, commercial carbonate electrolytes cannot be used in LMBs due to their poor compatibility with the lithium&#8208;metal anode and detrimental hydrogen fluoride (HF) generation by lithium hexafluorophosphate decomposition. By introducing lithium nitrate additive and a small amount of tetramethylurea as a multifunctional cosolvent to a commercial carbonate electrolyte, NO3&#8722;, which is usually insoluble, can be introduced into the solvation structure of Li+ to form a conductive and stable solid electrolyte interface. At the same time, HF generation is suppressed by manipulating the solvation structure and a scavenging effect. As a result, the Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Li||Cu half cells using the designed carbonate electrolyte can reach 98.19% at room temperature and 96.14% at low temperature (&#8722;15&#160;&#176;C), and Li||LiFePO4 cells deliver a high capacity retention of 94.9% with a high CE of 99.6% after 550&#160;cycles. This work provides a simple and effective way to extend the use of commercial carbonate electrolytes for next&#8208;generation battery systems.

         <title>Synchrotron X&#8208;ray Spectroscopic Investigations of In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Formed Alloy Anodes for Magnesium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanostructured bismuth anode is constructed through an in situ electrochemical conversion reaction from layered bismuth selenide. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed bismuth anode with Bi nanocrystals exhibits short Mg2+ diffusion length and high ion diffusivity. The Li+&#8208;driven conversion reaction and magnesium alloying reaction in such Bi&#8208;based electrodes are systematically investigated by operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy.








Abstract
Magnesium batteries present high volumetric energy density and dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Mg, drawing wide attention in energy&#8208;storage devices. However, their further development remains stagnated due to relevant interfacial issues between the Mg anode and the electrolyte and sluggish solid&#8208;state diffusion kinetics of Mg2+ ions. Herein, an in situ conversion chemistry to construct a nanostructured Bi anode from bismuth selenide driven by Li+ is proposed. Through the combination of operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, ex situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and comprehensive electrochemical tests, it is demonstrated that the nanosize of the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed Bi crystals contributes to the fast Mg2+ diffusion kinetics and highly efficient Mg&#8211;Bi alloingy/de&#8208;alloying. The resultant Bi anodes exhibit superior long&#8208;term cycling stability with over 600 cycles under a high current density of 1.0 A g&#8208;1. This work provides a new approach to construct alloy anode and paves the way for exploring novel electrode materials for magnesium batteries.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Sensitive Linear&#8211;Dendritic Block Copolymer&#8211;Drug Prodrug as a Nanoplatform for Tumor Combination Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linear&#8211;dendritic block copolymer prodrug with enzyme and pH dual&#8208;responsiveness is synthesized through a new synthesis strategy. The prodrug and photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) self&#8208;assemble to form nanoparticles for efficient drug delivery and controlled release drug. Doxorubicin (DOX) and Ce6 exert a synergistic antitumor effect by intensifying cell DNA damage and activating apoptotic pathways, resulting in an excellent antitumor effect.








Abstract
Linear&#8211;dendritic block copolymer (LDBCs) are highly attractive candidates for smart drug&#8208;delivery vehicles. Herein, an amphiphilic poly[(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (POEGMA) linear&#8208;peptide dendritic prodrug of doxorubicin (DOX) prepared by reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is reported. The hydrophobic&#8208;dye&#8208;based photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) is employed for encapsulation in the prodrug nanoparticles (NPs) to obtain an LDBCs&#8208;based drug&#8208;delivery system (LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6) that offers a combination cancer therapy. Due to the presence of Gly&#8211;Phe&#8211;Leu&#8211;Gly peptides and hydrazone bonds in the prodrug structure, LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6 is degraded into small fragments, thus specifically triggering the intracellular release of DOX and Ce6 in the tumor microenvironment. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6 with laser irradiation treatment significantly induces apoptosis, DNA damage, and cell cycle arrest. The combination treatment can not only suppress tumor growth, but also significantly reduce tumor metastasis compared with treatments with DOX or Ce6 through regulating EMT pathway, TGF&#946; pathway, angiogenesis, and the hypoxia pathway. LD&#8208;DOX/Ce6 displays a synergistic chemo&#8208;photodynamic antitumor efficacy, resulting in a high inhibition in tumor growth and metastasis, while maintaining an excellent biosafety. Therefore, this study demonstrates the potential of the biodegradable and tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive LDBCs as an intelligent multifunctional drug&#8208;delivery vehicle for high&#8208;efficiency cancer combination therapy.

LD-DOX/Ce6 displays a synergistic chemo-photodynamic antitumor efficacy, resulting in a high inhibition in tumor growth and metastasis, while maintaining an excellent biosafety. Therefore, this study demonstrates the potential of the biodegradable and tumor-microenvironment-responsive LDBCs as an intelligent multifunctional drug-delivery vehicle for high-efficiency cancer combination therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ethylamine Iodide Additive Enables Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transformed Highly Oriented Perovskite for Excellent Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethylamine iodide (EAI) is employed to modify pure FAPbI3 film, and a novel solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition theory is raised to depict the effect of EAI on the perovskite crystallization. The photodetector based on the modified film shows high performance.








Abstract
Perovskite has been widely applied in the optoelectronic field due to its strong light absorption and high carrier mobility. Maintaining high crystallization is critical to fabricate high&#8208;performance perovskite devices, where many methods have been reported, such as the use of additives in precursor solutions. However, there are few reports for the working mechanism of these additives. Herein, a new method to obtain highly crystalline formamidinium&#8208;lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite films by introducing ethylamine iodide (EAI) into perovskite precursors is reported and a novel working mechanism for such alkyl amine additives in the crystallization process of perovskites is proposed. Unlike traditional liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (L&#8211;S) crystallization theory, the research results indicate that EAI affects the solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (S&#8211;S) transition process from the intermediate yellow phase to the final black phase, and this mechanism is further verified to be universal using other common alkyl amines. A self&#8208;powered photodetector based on an as&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 film is fabricated with an external quantum efficiency of over 90%. This work provides a deeper understanding of the perovskite crystallization process.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Associated Immune&#8208;Cell&#8208;Mediated Tumor&#8208;Targeting Mechanism with NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging</title>

Cyanine&#8208;based SH1 is reported as a structure&#8208;inherent tumor&#8208;targeting (SITT) fluorophore without targeting&#8208;ligands. A tumor&#8208;associated immune&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated targeting mechanism for SITT strategy is suggested, which is confirmed via in vitro flow cytometry and in vivo second near&#8208;infrared spectral window imaging. SH1 provides ubiquitous tumor targetability in pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer models with a high tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio.








Abstract
The strategy of structure&#8208;inherent tumor targeting (SITT) with cyanine&#8208;based fluorophores is receiving more attention because no chemical conjugation of targeting moieties is required. However, the targeting mechanism behind SITT has not yet been well explained. Here, it is demonstrated that heptamethine&#8208;cyanine&#8208;based fluorophores possess not only targetability of tumor microenvironments without the need for additional targeting ligands but also second near&#8208;infrared spectral window (NIR&#8208;II) imaging capabilities, i.e., minimum scattering and ultralow autofluorescence. The new SITT mechanism suggests that bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived and/or tissue&#8208;resident/tumor&#8208;associated immune cells can be a principal target for cancer detection due to their abundance in tumoral tissues. Among the tested, SH1 provides ubiquitous tumor targetability and a high tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (TBR) ranging from 9.5 to 47 in pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer mouse models upon a single bolus intravenous injection. Furthermore, SH1 can be used to detect small cancerous tissues smaller than 2&#8239;mm in diameter in orthotopic lung cancer models. Thus, SH1 could be a promising cancer&#8208;targeting agent and have a bright future for intraoperative optical imaging and image&#8208;guided cancer surgery.

         <title>Boosting Cancer Immunotherapy via the Convenient A2AR Inhibition Using a Tunable Nanocatalyst with Light&#8208;Enhanced Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>

A well&#8208;tailored nanoreactor is designed to achieve tumor&#8208;activated oxygen generation and near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;guided/accelerated oxygen supplementation for tumor&#8208;specific A2A adenosine receptor (A2AR) inhibition to prime antitumor T cell immunity. The photo&#8208;modulated nanoreactor not only brakes the shackles of immunosuppression but also enhances the anti&#8208;PD1 immunotherapy.








Abstract
Blockade of A2A adenosine receptors (A2AR)&#8208;adenosinergic signaling shows high potency to mobilize antitumor immunity for its in&#8208;depth involvement in immune regulation of nearly all immune cells. Available A2AR inhibition strategies are mainly based on small molecules or proteins inhibitors, yet are limited by the non&#8208;specific operation as well as the off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, the first effort to design a convenient tumor&#8208;specific A2AR inhibition strategy to improve antitumor immune responses via the spatiotemporally controlled oxygen supply by virtue of a versatile photo&#8208;modulated nanoreactor is reported on. This nanoreactor, consisting of a catalase&#8208;mimicking shell (Pt nanocatalyst) and a photothermal core (polydopamine), is rationally designed for achieving the near&#8208;infrared radiation (NIR)&#8208;guided/accelerated oxygen supplementation on tumor site, and for relieving the A2AR&#8208;mediated immunosuppression without toxicity concern. Meanwhile, the NIR light could also mediate the direct photothermal ablation of tumor, and elicit immunogenic cell deaths to boost antitumor immunity. In a poorly immunogenic breast cancer model, the intravenous injection of the nanoreactor leads to the improved immune response with an increased animal survival rate, and achieves the long&#8208;term immunological memory effect against tumor recurrence as well as rechallenge. This convenient nanoreactor&#8208;stimulated A2AR inhibition approach provides a versatile promising paradigm for improving these existing immunotherapies.

         <title>Controlling the Emission Zone by Additives for Improved Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The position of the in situ formed emission zone (EZ) in light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells has a profound influence on the device performance because of microcavity effects and doping and electrode quenching. This study shows that the inclusion of easily tuned additives can rationally shift the EZ position for improved performance.








Abstract
The position of the emission zone (EZ) in the active material of a light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) has a profound influence on its performance because of microcavity effects and doping&#8208; and electrode&#8208;induced quenching. Previous attempts of EZ control have focused on the two principal constituents in the active material&#8212;the organic semiconductor (OSC) and the mobile ions&#8212;but this study demonstrates that it is possible to effectively control the EZ position through the inclusion of an appropriate additive into the active material. More specifically, it is shown that a mere modification of the end group on an added neutral compound, which also functions as an ion transporter, results in a shifted EZ from close to the anode to the center of the active material, which translates into a 60% improvement of the power efficiency. This particular finding is rationalized by a lowering of the effective electron mobility of the OSC through specific additive: OSC interactions, but the more important generic conclusion is that it is possible to control the EZ position, and thereby the LEC performance, by the straightforward inclusion of an easily tuned additive in the active material.

When nanoscale drug carriers enter the blood, they are rapidly bound by complement proteins, such as C3, which mark the nanocarriers for clearance by phagocytes and produce an anaphylaxis&#8208;like reaction. In this work, nanocarriers are conjugated to the complement&#8208;cleaving enzyme Factor I, and it abrogates several major problems facing nanomedicine.








Abstract
Complement opsonization is among the biggest challenges facing nanomedicine. Nearly instantly after injection into blood, nanoparticles are opsonized by the complement protein C3, leading to clearance by phagocytes, fouling of targeting moieties, and release of anaphylatoxins. While surface polymers such as poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) partially decrease complement opsonization, most nanoparticles still suffer from extensive complement opsonization, especially when linked to targeting moieties. To ameliorate the deleterious effects of complement, two of mammals&#8217; natural regulators of complement activation (RCAs), Factors H and I, are here conjugated to the surface of nanoparticles. In vitro, Factor H or I conjugation to PEG&#8208;coated nanoparticles decrease their C3 opsonization, and markedly reduce nanoparticle uptake by phagocytes. In an in vivo mouse model of sepsis&#8208;induced lung injury, Factor I conjugation abrogates nanoparticle uptake by intravascular phagocytes in the lungs, allowing the blood concentration of the nanoparticle to remain elevated much longer. For nanoparticles targeted to the lung's endothelium by conjugation to anti&#8208;ICAM antibodies, Factor I conjugation shifts the cell&#8208;type distribution away from phagocytes and toward endothelial cells. Finally, Factor I conjugation abrogates the severe anaphylactoid responses common to many nanoparticles, preventing systemic capillary leak and preserving blood flow to visceral organs and the brain. Thus, conjugation of RCAs, like Factor I, to nanoparticles is likely to help in nanomedicine's long battle against complement, improving several key parameters critical for clinical success.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque Switching in an All&#8208;Van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure with an atomically sharp interface based on topological semimetal shows spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT)&#8208;driven magnetization switching. These findings highlight that engineering vdW&#8208;type topological materials and magnets offers a promising route to energy&#8208;efficient magnetization control in SOT&#8208;based spintronics.








Abstract
Current&#8208;induced control of magnetization in ferromagnets using spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) has drawn attention as a new mechanism for fast and energy efficient magnetic memory devices. Energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices require a spin&#8208;current source with a large SOT efficiency (&#958;) and electrical conductivity (&#963;), and an efficient spin injection across a transparent interface. Herein, single crystals of the van der Waals (vdW)&#160;topological semimetal WTe2&#160;and&#160;vdW ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 are used to satisfy the requirements in their all&#8208;vdW&#8208;heterostructure with an atomically sharp interface. The results exhibit values of &#958;&#160;&#8776; 4.6 and &#963;&#160;&#8776; 2.25 &#215; 105&#160;&#937;&#8208;1 m&#8208;1 for WTe2. Moreover, the significantly reduced switching current density of 3.90 &#215; 106 A cm&#8722;2 at 150 K is obtained, which is an order of magnitude smaller than those of conventional heavy&#8208;metal/ferromagnet thin films. These findings highlight that engineering vdW&#8208;type&#160;topological materials and magnets&#160;offers a promising route to energy&#8208;efficient magnetization control in&#160;SOT&#8208;based spintronics.

Multi&#8208;Metal Oxide (Electro)catalysts
Multi&#8208;metal oxide (MMO) nanomaterials have significant potential to facilitate various demanding (electro)catalytic reactions, but their intrinsic complexity hinders in&#8208;depth understanding of the origin of the catalytic activity. In article number 2107868, Kug&#8208;Seung Lee, Seoin Back, Yung&#8208;Eun Sung, Taeghwan Hyeon, and co&#8208;workers develop a structural understanding of uniform&#8208;sized spinel&#8208;type MMO nanoparticles, which boosts the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Physicochemical and electrochemical analysis reveal the contribution of each element to the structural flexibility and corresponding improved ORR activity.

Nanomedicine
Immediately upon encountering blood, nanoparticles are attacked by complement proteins. Complement binding produces an anaphylaxis&#8208;like reaction and causes nanoparticles to be cleared from circulation by phagocytes. To defend nanoparticles, in article number 2107070, Jacob W. Myerson,  Jacob S. Brenner, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate how to conjugate nanoparticles to humans' natural complement inhibitor, Factor I, which defends the nanoparticle from complement attack, thus ameliorating all the above problems.

Perovskite Solar Cells
In article 2106118, Kuan Sun and co&#8208;workers describe how a thin biguanide hydrochloride (BGCl) film is deposited at the SnO2/perovskite interface for simultaneous interfacial modification and crystallization control. Due to passivation to the oxygen vacancies and hydrogen bond anchoring between BGCl and SnO2/PbI2, reduced interfacial defects and homogeneous perovskite crystallites are achieved, enhancing the carrier dynamics in devices.

Due to passivation to the oxygen vacancies and hydrogen bond anchoring between BGCl and SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, reduced interfacial defects and homogeneous perovskite crystallites are achieved, enhancing the carrier dynamics in devices.

Single&#8208;Crystal Foils
In article number 2108608, Bin Wu, Jichen Dong, Yunqi Liu,  and co&#8208;workers report the development of a cyclic electrochemical polishing and thermal annealing approach to obtain single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) foils. Pure monolayer graphene is produced on Cu(111) based on a general &#8220;bottom&#8208;up etching&#8221; method. In particular, the obtained graphene shows high and uniform electronic quality using terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy (THz&#8208;TDS) measurement.

Polymer Laser Printing
In article number 2108493, Junfang Zhang, Felix Loeffler, and co&#8208;workers describe how a facile iron oxide nanofilm synthesis revolutionizes polymer laser printing. Fast and precise laser transfer of polymer spots enables over 100 000 individual chemical reactions to be run in parallel in a single square centimeter. Rapid chemical reaction screenings, such as amide bond formation, click chemistry, or photochemistry, are now possible in the microarray format.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Syntheses of 2D Materials: Flash Joule Heating and Other Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although studied for decades, 2D materials have often struggled to surpass small scales. Recent progress in the larger&#8208;scale synthesis of graphene represents an exciting paradigm shift. An overview of scalable graphene powder and film production is provided, addressing industrial and academic trends, and specifically highlighting flash Joule heating methods.








Abstract
In the past 17 years, the larger&#8208;scale production of graphene and graphene family materials has proven difficult and costly, thus slowing wider&#8208;scale commercial applications. The quality of the graphene that is prepared on larger scales has often been poor, demonstrating a need for improved quality controls. Here, current industrial graphene synthetic and analytical methods, as well as recent academic advancements in larger&#8208;scale or sustainable synthesis of graphene, defined here as weights more than 200 mg or films larger than 200 cm2, are compiled and reviewed. There is a specific emphasis on recent research in the use of flash Joule heating as a rapid, efficient, and scalable method to produce graphene and other 2D nanomaterials. Reactor design, synthetic strategies, safety considerations, feedstock selection, Raman spectroscopy, and future outlooks for flash Joule heating syntheses are presented. To conclude, the remaining challenges and opportunities in the larger&#8208;scale synthesis of graphene and a perspective on the broader use of flash Joule heating for larger&#8208;scale 2D materials synthesis are discussed.

         <title>A Review on the Applications of Graphene in Mechanical Transduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical review on the synthesis and applications of graphene and graphene&#8208;based materials in the wide field of mechanical sensors and actuators is provided. Different transduction mechanisms are covered, such as piezoresistivity, capacitive sensing, optically interrogated displacement, piezoelectricity, triboelectricity, electrostatic actuation, chemomechanical and thermomechanical actuation, as well as thermoacoustic emission.








Abstract
A pressing need to develop low&#8208;cost, environmentally friendly, and sensitive sensors has arisen with the advent of the always&#8208;connected paradigm of the internet&#8208;of&#8208;things (IoT). In particular, mechanical sensors have been widely studied in recent years for applications ranging from health monitoring, through mechanical biosignals, to structure integrity analysis. On the other hand, innovative ways to implement mechanical actuation have also been the focus of intense research in an attempt to close the circle of human&#8211;machine interaction, and move toward applications in flexible electronics. Due to its potential scalability, disposability, and outstanding properties, graphene has been thoroughly studied in the field of mechanical transduction. The applications of graphene in mechanical transduction are reviewed here. An overview of sensor and actuator applications is provided, covering different transduction mechanisms such as piezoresistivity, capacitive sensing, optically interrogated displacement, piezoelectricity, triboelectricity, electrostatic actuation, chemomechanical and thermomechanical actuation, as well as thermoacoustic emission. A critical review of the main approaches is presented within the scope of a wider discussion on the future of this so&#8208;called wonder material in the field of mechanical transduction.

         <title>Surface Passivation Using 2D Perovskites toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in 2D/3D heterostructure perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using surface passivation. The basic crystal structure, surface passivation strategy/process, optoelectronic properties, enhanced stability, and outstanding performance based on 2D/3D PSCs are systematically discussed. In addition, some emerging challenges and critical thoughts for 2D/3D PSCs are proposed to provide insights into follow&#8208;up studies.








Abstract
3D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great promise for use in next&#8208;generation photovoltaic devices. However, some challenges need to be addressed before their commercial production, such as enormous defects formed on the surface, which result in severe SRH recombination, and inadequate material interplay between the composition, leading to thermal&#8208;, moisture&#8208;, and light&#8208;induced degradation. 2D perovskites, in which the organic layer functions as a protective barrier to block the erosion of moisture or ions, have recently emerged and attracted increasing attention because they exhibit significant robustness. Inspired by this, surface passivation by employing 2D perovskites deposited on the top of 3D counterparts has triggered a new wave of research to simultaneously achieve higher efficiency and stability. Herein, we&#160;exploited a vast amount of literature to comprehensively summarize the recent progress on 2D/3D heterostructure PSCs using surface passivation. The review begins with an introduction of the crystal structure, followed by the advantages of the combination of 2D and 3D perovskites. Then, the surface passivation strategies, optoelectronic properties, enhanced stability, and photovoltaic performance of 2D/3D PSCs are systematically discussed. Finally, the perspectives of passivation techniques using 2D perovskites to offer insight into further improved photovoltaic performance in the future are proposed.

         <title>Unraveling Anionic Redox for Sodium Layered Oxide Cathodes: Breakthroughs and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 8, February 24, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anionic redox reaction in sodium layered transition oxides is considered as a promising tactics to increase the energy density of rechargeable batteries. Herein, a comprehensive review of anionic redox reaction is summarized in terms of evolution history, fundamental mechanism, major challenges, available strategies, classification of sodium layered oxide cathodes, progressive characterization techniques, and prospective trend.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) as the next generation of sustainable energy technologies have received widespread investigations for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems (EESs) and smart grids due to the huge natural abundance and low cost of sodium. Although the great efforts are made in exploring layered transition metal oxide cathode for SIBs, their performances have reached the bottleneck for further practical application. Nowadays, anionic redox in layered transition metal oxides has emerged as a new paradigm to increase the energy density of rechargeable batteries. Based on this point, in this review, the development history of anionic redox reaction is attempted to systematically summarize and provide an in&#8208;depth discussion on the anionic redox mechanism. Particularly, the major challenges of anionic redox and the corresponding available strategies toward triggering and stabilizing anionic redox are proposed. Subsequently, several types of sodium layered oxide cathodes are classified and comparatively discussed according to Na&#8208;rich or Na&#8208;deficient materials. A large amount of progressive characterization techniques of anionic oxygen redox is also summarized. Finally, an overview of the existing prospective and the future development directions of sodium layered transition oxide with anionic redox reaction are analyzed and suggested.

         <title>Chemical and Physical Properties of Photonic Noble&#8208;Metal Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) serve as building blocks in the assembly of artificial metamolecules and large&#8208;area metamaterials. These metastructures have exotic optical properties that depend on the NP number, arrangement, and interparticle spacing, and on the geometry of their patterned 2D and 3D superstructures. Their strong light&#8208;matter interactions are harnessed to manipulate the amplitude, phase, and polarization of light.








Abstract
Colloidal noble metal nanoparticles (NPs) are composed of metal cores and organic or inorganic ligand shells. These NPs support size&#8208; and shape&#8208;dependent plasmonic resonances. They can be assembled from dispersions into artificial metamolecules which have collective plasmonic resonances originating from coupled bright and dark optical electric and magnetic modes that form depending on the size and shape of the constituent NPs and their number, arrangement, and interparticle distance. NPs can also be assembled into extended 2D and 3D metamaterials that are glassy thin films or ordered thin films or crystals, also known as superlattices and supercrystals. The metamaterials have tunable optical properties that depend on the size, shape, and composition of the NPs, and on the number of NP layers and their interparticle distance. Interestingly, strong light&#8208;matter interactions in superlattices form plasmon polaritons. Tunable interparticle distances allow designer materials with dielectric functions tailorable from that characteristic of an insulator to that of a metal, and serve as strong optical absorbers or scatterers, respectively. In combination with lithography techniques, these extended assemblies can be patterned to create subwavelength NP superstructures and form large&#8208;area 2D and 3D metamaterials that manipulate the amplitude, phase, and polarization of transmitted or reflected light.

         <title>Prussian Blue Analogues for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Past, Present, and Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to first provide an overview of the history and parameters of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) materials and analyze the fundamental principles toward rational design of PBAs, and then evaluate the prospects and challenges for PBAs for practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hoping to bridge the gap between laboratory research and commercial reality.








Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have attracted wide attention for their application in the energy storage and conversion field due to their low cost, facile synthesis, and appreciable electrochemical performance. At the present stage, most research on PBAs is focused on their material&#8208;level optimization, whereas their properties in practical battery systems are seldom considered. This review aims to first provide an overview of the history and parameters of PBA materials and analyze the fundamental principles toward rational design of PBAs, and then evaluate the prospects and challenges for PBAs for practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hoping to bridge the gap between laboratory research and commercial reality.

         <title>Diverging Expressions of Anharmonicity in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Raman spectroscopy is used to compare the anharmonic expressions in the structural dynamics of two halide perovskites. In Cs2AgBiBr6, clear normal modes are observed in all measured temperatures. Contrary to this, the Raman spectrum of CsPbBr3 exhibits a breakdown of the normal&#8208;mode picture above 200 K. Implications of these diverging behaviors on the electronic properties of the crystals is discussed.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;based halide perovskite crystals are shown to have strongly anharmonic structural dynamics. This behavior is important because it may be the origin of their exceptional photovoltaic properties. The double perovskite, Cs2AgBiBr6, has been recently studied as a lead&#8208;free alternative for optoelectronic applications. However, it does not exhibit the excellent photovoltaic activity of the lead&#8208;based halide perovskites. Therefore, to explore the correlation between the anharmonic structural dynamics and optoelectronic properties in lead&#8208;based halide perovskites, the structural dynamics of Cs2AgBiBr6 are investigated and are compared to its lead&#8208;based analog, CsPbBr3. Using temperature&#8208;dependent Raman measurements, it is found that both materials are indeed strongly anharmonic. Nonetheless, the expression of their anharmonic behavior is markedly different. Cs2AgBiBr6 has well&#8208;defined normal modes throughout the measured temperature range, while CsPbBr3 exhibits a complete breakdown of the normal&#8208;mode picture above 200&#160;K. It is suggested that the breakdown of the normal&#8208;mode picture implies that the average crystal structure may not be a proper starting point to understand the electronic properties of the crystal. In addition to our&#160;main findings, an unreported phase of Cs2AgBiBr6 is also discovered below&#160;&#8776;37&#160;K.

To achieve global mission of carbon neutrality, green hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting technology has attracted much attention. Developing efficient electrocatalysts working under industrially required current densities is essential for wide implementation of this technology. This review summarizes progress in design of high&#8208;current&#8208;density catalysts, key aspects determining high&#8208;current&#8208;density performance, multiscale catalyst design strategy, and future directions in this emerging field.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting technology for producing &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; is important for the global mission of carbon neutrality. Electrocatalysts with decent performance at high current densities play a central role in the industrial implementation of this technology. This field has advanced immensely in recent years, as witnessed by many types of catalysts designed and synthesized toward industriallyrelevant current densities (&gt;200&#160;mA cm&#8211;2). By discussing recent advances in this field, several key aspects are summarized that affect the catalytic performance for high&#8208;current&#8208;density electrocatalysis, including dimensionality of catalysts, surface chemistry, electron transport path, morphology, and catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interplay. The multiscale design strategy that considers these aspects comprehensively for developing high&#8208;current&#8208;density electrocatalysts are highlighted. The perspectives on the future directions in this emerging field are also put forward.

         <title>Heterointerface created on Au cluster&#8208;loaded unilamellar hydroxide electrocatalysts as a highly active site for the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical element for all sorts of reactions that use water as a hydrogen source, such as hydrogen evolution and electrochemical CO2 reduction, and novel design principles that provide highly active sites on OER electrocatalysts will push the limits of their practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate Au&#8208;cluster loading on unilamellar exfoliated layered double hydroxide (ULDH) electrocatalysts for the OER to fabricate a heterointerface between Au clusters and ULDHs as an active site, which is accompanied by the oxidation state modulation of the active site and interfacial direct O&#8211;O coupling (interfacial DOOC). The Au cluster&#8208;loaded ULDHs exhibits excellent activity for the OER with an overpotential of 189&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a durability of 24 h. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements reveal that charge transfer from the Au clusters to ULDHs modifies the oxidation states of trivalent metal ions, which can be an active site on the ULDHs. To investigate the surface state in detail, we conducted highly sensitive spectroscopy by combining reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) and modulation&#8208;excitation spectroscopy (MES), i.e., RAIRS&#8208;MES, which achieved the observation of O&#8208;Au&#8208;O vibrations on Au&#8208;clusters supported on a ULDH in the presence of H2O vapor. This result strongly support interfacial DOOC mechanism. The present study supported by density functional theory calculations indicates that active sites at the interface between the Au clusters and ULDHs promote a novel OER mechanism through interfacial DOOC, thereby achieving outstanding catalytic performance.

         <title>Universal Solution Synthesis of Sulfide Solid Electrolytes Using Alkahest for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The wet&#8208;chemical processability of sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) provides intriguing opportunities for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Thus far, sulfide SEs are wet&#8208;prepared either from solid precursors suspended in solvents (suspension synthesis) or from homogeneous solutions using SEs (solution process) with restricted composition spaces. Here, we report a universal solution synthesis method for preparing sulfide SEs from precursors, not only Li2S, P2S5, LiCl, and Na2S, but also metal sulfides (e.g., GeS2 and SnS2), fully dissolved in an alkahest: a mixture solvent of 1,2&#8208;ethylenediamine (EDA) and 1,2&#8208;ethanedithiol (EDT) (or ethanethiol). Raman spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional dissolving power of EDA&#8208;EDT toward GeS2 is due to the nucleophilicity of the thiolate anions that is strong enough to dissociate the Ge&#8211;S bonds. Solution&#8208;synthesized Li10GeP2S12, Li6PS5Cl, and Na11Sn2PS12 exhibit high ionic conductivities (0.74, 1.3, and 0.10 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30&#176;C, respectively), and their application for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Mucus Penetrating and cell&#8208;binding Polyzwitterionic Micelles as Potent Oral Nanomedicine for Cancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Orally administerable anticancer nanomedicines are highly desirable due to their easy and repeatable administration, but are not yet feasible because the current nanomedicine cannot simultaneously overcome the strong mucus and villi barriers and thus have very low bioavailability. Herein, we present the first polymeric micelle capable of fast mucus permeation and villi absorption and delivering paclitaxel (PTX) efficiently to tumors with therapeutic efficacy even better than intravenously administered PEG&#8208;based counterpart or free PTX. Poly[2&#8208;(N&#8208;oxide&#8208;N,N&#8208;diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (OPDEA), a water&#8208;soluble polyzwitterion, is highly non&#8208;fouling to proteins and other biomarcomolecules such as mucin but can weakly bind to phospholipids. Therefore, the micelle of its block copolymer with poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (OPDEA&#8208;PCL) can efficiently permeate through the viscous mucus and bind to villi, which triggers transcytosis&#8208;mediated transepithelial transport into blood circulation for tumor accumulation. The orally administered micelles deliver PTX to tumors, efficiently inhibiting the growth of HepG2 and patient&#8208;derived hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts and triple&#8208;negative breast tumors. These results demonstrate that OPDEA&#8208;based micelles may serve as an efficient oral nanomedicine for delivering other small molecules or even large molecules.

         <title>Decoupling and Reprogramming the Wiggling Motion of Midge Larvae Using a Soft Robotic Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The efficient motility of invertebrates helps them survive under evolutionary pressures. Reconstructing the locomotion of invertebrates and decoupling the influence of individual basic motion are crucial for understanding their underlying mechanisms, which, however, generally remain a challenge due to the complexity of locomotion gaits. Herein, we develop a magnetic soft robot to reproduce midge larva's key natural swimming gaits and investigate the coupling effect between body curling and rotation on motility. Through our systematically decoupling studies using programmed magnetic field inputs, the soft robot (named LarvaBot) experiences various coupled gaits, including biomimetic side&#8208;to&#8208;side flexures, and unveils that the optimal rotation amplitude and the synchronization of curling and rotation greatly enhance its motility. The LarvaBot achieves fast locomotion and upstream capability at the moderate Reynolds number regime. Our soft robotics&#8208;based platform provides new insight to decouple complex biological locomotion, and design programmed swimming gaits for the fast locomotion of soft&#8208;bodied swimmers.

         <title>Direct Observation of Strong Anomalous Hall Effect and Proximity&#8208;Induced Ferromagnetic State in SrIrO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnetic state&#8212;rarely observed in 5d&#8208;based transition metal oxides due to the generally weak electron&#8211;electron correlation&#8212;is induced in SrIrO3 by proximity to ferromagnetic insulating LaCoO3. Electrical transport allows the ferromagnetism of SrIrO3 to be probed selectively, revealing a strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy and enabling the direct observation of a strong, intrinsic, and positive anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
The 5d iridium&#8208;based transition metal oxides have gained broad interest because of their strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, which favors new or exotic quantum electronic states. On the other hand, they rarely exhibit more mainstream orders like ferromagnetism due to generally weak electron&#8211;electron correlation strength. Here, a proximity&#8208;induced ferromagnetic (FM) state with TC&#160;&#8776; 100 K and strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy is shown in a SrIrO3 (SIO) heterostructure via interfacial charge transfer by using a ferromagnetic insulator in contact with SIO. Electrical transport allows to selectively probe the FM state of the SIO layer and the direct observation of a strong, intrinsic, and positive anomalous Hall effect (AHE). For T&#160;&#8804; 20 K, the AHE displays unusually large coercive and saturation field, a fingerprint of a strong pseudospin&#8211;lattice coupling. A Hall angle, &#963;xyAHE/&#963;xx, larger by an order of magnitude than in typical 3d metals and an FM net moment of about 0.1 &#956;B/Ir, is reported. This emphasizes how efficiently the nontrivial topological band properties of SIO can be manipulated by structural modifications and the exchange interaction with 3d TMOs.

         <title>Growth of 2D Materials at the Wafer Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces various 2D van der Waals layered materials and summarizes their wafer&#8208;scale growth processes, including strategies for mono&#8208;orientated film growth. Applications of these materials in integrated devices and new epitaxial technologies are discussed, as well as the required future research directions in this very important field.








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth has become a critical bottleneck for scaling up applications of van der Waal (vdW) layered 2D materials in high&#8208;end electronics and optoelectronics. Most vdW 2D materials are initially obtained through top&#8208;down synthesis methods, such as exfoliation, which can only prepare small flakes on a micrometer scale. Bottom&#8208;up growth can enable 2D flake growth over a large area. However, seamless merging of these flakes to form large&#8208;area continuous films with well&#8208;controlled layer thickness and lattice orientation is still a significant challenge. This review briefly introduces several vdW layered 2D materials covering their lattice structures, representative physical properties, and potential roles in large&#8208;scale applications. Then, several methods used to grow vdW layered 2D materials at the wafer scale are reviewed in depth. In particular, three strategies are summarized that enable 2D film growth with a single&#8208;crystalline structure over the whole wafer: growth of an isolated domain, growth of unidirectional domains, and conversion of oriented precursors. After that, the progress in using wafer&#8208;scale 2D materials in integrated devices and advanced epitaxy is reviewed. Finally, future directions in the growth and scaling of vdW layered 2D materials are discussed.

Inspired by a world entering a quantum age, a human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop framework is presented, which addresses key challenges and opportunities to overcome in the manufacturing of quantum materials.








Abstract
The quantum age is just around the corner. As quantum systems become more stable, robust, and mainstream, tackling the challenge of high&#8208;throughput manufacturing will require further developments in materials synthesis, characterization, assembly, and diagnostics. As the building blocks of future technologies scale down to atomic and molecular scales, a paradigm shift in manufacturing will begin to take shape. Inspired by a quantum manufacturing world that elevates the Materials Genome Initiative to the next level, a &#8220;human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop&#8221; framework for high&#8208;throughput manufacturing, which addresses key opportunities and challenges to be overcome, is outlined.

         <title>From p&#8208; to n&#8208;Type Mixed Conduction in Isoindigo&#8208;Based Polymers through Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molecular design criteria for isoindigo&#8208;based semiconducting polymers is presented and their versatility is showcased for the development of mixed conductors relevant to organic bioelectronic applications. Through rational choice of the isoindigoid motif and an appropriate comonomer, efficient hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transport materials are developed and strategies for further optimization are identified, including the development of ambipolar mixed conductors.








Abstract
Organic mixed ionic and electronic conductors are of significant interest for bioelectronic applications. Here, three different isoindigoid building blocks are used to obtain polymeric mixed conductors with vastly different structural and electronic properties which can be further fine&#8208;tuned through the choice of comonomer unit. This work shows how careful design of the isoindigoid scaffold can afford highly planar polymer structures with high degrees of electronic delocalization, while subtle structural modifications can control the dominant charge carrier (hole or electron) when probed in organic electrochemical transistors. A combination of experimental and computational techniques is employed to probe electrochemical, structural, and mixed ionic and electronic properties of the polymer series which in turn allows the derivation of important structure&#8211;property relations for this promising class of materials in the context of organic bioelectronics. Ultimately, these findings are used to outline robust molecular&#8208;design strategies for isoindigo&#8208;based mixed conductors that can support efficient p&#8208;type, n&#8208;type, and ambipolar transistor operation in an aqueous environment.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble Organic Photocatalyst Discovered for Highly Efficient Additive&#8208;Free Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Grafting of Polymers from Proteins at Ambient and Aqueous Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;soluble and biocompatible organic photocatalyst (PC) is reported, which enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven additive&#8208;free &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations of a protein in ambient and aqueous environments. A variety of protein&#8211;polymer conjugates are prepared under green light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) irradiation. It is believed that this PC will be widely employed for photocatalysis in aqueous environments.








Abstract
Since the pioneering discovery of a protein bound to poly(ethylene glycol), the utility of protein&#8211;polymer conjugates (PPCs) is rapidly expanding to currently emerging applications. Photoinduced energy/electron&#8208;transfer reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain&#8208;transfer (PET&#8208;RAFT) polymerization is a very promising method to prepare structurally well&#8208;defined PPCs, as it eliminates high&#8208;cost and time&#8208;consuming deoxygenation processes due to its oxygen tolerance. However, the oxygen&#8208;tolerance behavior of PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization is not well&#8208;investigated in aqueous environments, and thereby the preparation of PPCs using PET&#8208;RAFT polymerization needs a substantial amount of sacrificial reducing agents or inert&#8208;gas purging processes. Herein a novel water&#8208;soluble and biocompatible organic photocatalyst (PC) is reported, which enables visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven additive&#8208;free &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations of a protein in ambient and aqueous environments. Interestingly, the developed PC shows unconventional &#8220;oxygen&#8208;acceleration&#8221; behavior for a variety of acrylic and acrylamide monomers in aqueous conditions without any additives, which are apparently distinct from previously reported systems. With such a PC, &#8220;grafting&#8208;from&#8221; polymerizations are successfully performed from protein in ambient buffer conditions under green light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) irradiation, which result in various PPCs that have neutral, anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic polyacrylates, and polyacrylamides.

     alt="A Water-Soluble Organic Photocatalyst Discovered for Highly Efficient Additive-Free Visible-Light-Driven Grafting of Polymers from Proteins at Ambient and Aqueous Environments"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel water-soluble and biocompatible organic photocatalyst (PC) is reported, which enables visible-light-driven additive-free &#8220;grafting-from&#8221; polymerizations of a protein in ambient and aqueous environments. A variety of protein&#8211;polymer conjugates are prepared under green light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation. It is believed that this PC will be widely employed for photocatalysis in aqueous environments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the pioneering discovery of a protein bound to poly(ethylene glycol), the utility of protein&#8211;polymer conjugates (PPCs) is rapidly expanding to currently emerging applications. Photoinduced energy/electron-transfer reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain-transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization is a very promising method to prepare structurally well-defined PPCs, as it eliminates high-cost and time-consuming deoxygenation processes due to its oxygen tolerance. However, the oxygen-tolerance behavior of PET-RAFT polymerization is not well-investigated in aqueous environments, and thereby the preparation of PPCs using PET-RAFT polymerization needs a substantial amount of sacrificial reducing agents or inert-gas purging processes. Herein a novel water-soluble and biocompatible organic photocatalyst (PC) is reported, which enables visible-light-driven additive-free &#8220;grafting-from&#8221; polymerizations of a protein in ambient and aqueous environments. Interestingly, the developed PC shows unconventional &#8220;oxygen-acceleration&#8221; behavior for a variety of acrylic and acrylamide monomers in aqueous conditions without any additives, which are apparently distinct from previously reported systems. With such a PC, &#8220;grafting-from&#8221; polymerizations are successfully performed from protein in ambient buffer conditions under green light-emitting diode (LED) irradiation, which result in various PPCs that have neutral, anionic, cationic, and zwitterionic polyacrylates, and polyacrylamides.

         <title>Meniscus&#8208;Assisted Coating with Optimized Active&#8208;Layer Morphology toward Highly Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solution&#8208;printing strategy based on meniscus&#8208;assisted coating for all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) is presented. The champion device based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.53%, which is attributable to the enhanced crystallinity and nanofiber network morphology. It is worth mentioning that 15.53% is the highest PCE reported for solution&#8208;printing&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Morphology control is the key to engineering highly efficient solution&#8208;processed solar cells. Focusing on the most promising application&#8208;oriented photovoltaic all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs), herein a facile and effective meniscus&#8208;assisted&#8208;coating (MAC) strategy is reported for preparing high&#8208;quality blend films with enhanced crystallinity and an interpenetrating nanofiber network morphology. The all&#8208;PSCs based on MAC exhibit excellent optoelectronic properties with efficiencies exceeding 15%, which is the best performance of solution&#8208;printing&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs, as well as better stability. The crystallization kinetics of the polymer blend film is investigated by in situ UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopy, and the result explains the linear relationship between the meniscus advance speed and the crystallinity (crystallization rate) of the polymer. To verify the compatibility and universality of this strategy, the MAC strategy is applied to the other three binary systems. By precisely controlling the meniscus advancing speed, 1 cm2 all&#8208;PSC devices whose efficiencies exceed 12% are fabricated. Such progress demonstrates that the application of the MAC strategy is a promising approach for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;PSCs.

Abstract
The functional reconfiguration of transistors and memory in homogenous ferroelectric devices offers significant opportunities for implementing the concepts of in&#8208;memory computing and logic&#8208;memory monolithic integration. Thus far, reconfiguration has been realized through programmable doping profiles in the semiconductor channel using multiple&#8208;gate operation. This complex device architecture limits further scaling to match the overall chip requirements. Here, we demonstrate reconfigurable memory/transistor functionalities in a ferroelectric&#8208;gated van der Waals transistor by controlling the behavior of ferroelectric oxygen vacancies at the interface. Short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory functions by modulating the border oxygen vacancy distribution and the associated charge dynamics. The quasi&#8208;nonvolatile long&#8208;term memory exhibits data retention of over 105 s and endurance of up to 5 &#215; 105 cycles, verifying its applicability as a potential device platform for neuromorphic networks. More importantly, by modulating the ferroelectricity of the interfacial domains with the interactions of oxygen vacancies, a hysteresis&#8208;free logic transistor is realized with a sub&#8208;thermionic subthreshold swing down to 46&#160;mV/dec, which resembles a negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistor. The new concept of achieving functional reconfiguration with prior device performance in a single&#8208;gate ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor is of great advantage in future integrated circuit applications.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Deposited and Patternable Conductive Polymer Thin&#8208;Film Electrodes for Microbial Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conductive polymer&#8208;based thin&#8208;film coating that significantly enhances biotic current densities in microbial bioelectronic devices is reported. The coating is comprehensively characterized, and low&#8208;cost processing and patterning of the coating and the deposition of different microbial strains on a single substrate are demonstrated. This coating can help advance the development of microbial bioelectronic devices.








Abstract
Microbial bioelectronic devices integrate naturally occurring or synthetically engineered electroactive microbes with microelectronics. These devices have a broad range of potential applications, but engineering the biotic&#8211;abiotic interface for biocompatibility, adhesion, electron transfer, and maximum surface area remains a challenge. Prior approaches to interface modification lack simple processability, the ability to pattern the materials, and/or a significant enhancement in currents. Here, a novel conductive polymer coating that significantly enhances current densities relative to unmodified electrodes in microbial bioelectronics is reported. The coating is based on a blend of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) crosslinked with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethylacrylate) (PHEA) along with a thin polydopamine (PDA) layer for adhesion to an underlying indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. When used as an interface layer with the current&#8208;producing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, this material produces a 178&#8208;fold increase in the current density compared to unmodified electrodes, a current gain that is higher than previously reported thin&#8208;film 2D coatings and 3D conductive polymer coatings. The chemistry, morphology, and electronic properties of the coatings are characterized and the implementation of these coated electrodes for use in microbial fuel cells, multiplexed bioelectronic devices, and organic electrochemical transistor based microbial sensors are demonstrated. It is envisioned that this simple coating will advance the development of microbial bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Bimetallic Nanocatalysts Immobilized in Nanoporous Hydrogels for Long&#8208;Term Robust Continuous Glucose Monitoring of Smart Contact Lens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Smart contact lenses for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) have great potential for huge clinical impact. To date, their development has been limited by challenges in accurate detection of glucose without hysteresis for tear glucose monitoring to track the blood glucose levels. Here, long&#8208;term robust CGM in diabetic rabbits is demonstrated by using bimetallic nanocatalysts immobilized in nanoporous hydrogels in smart contact lenses. After redox reaction of glucose oxidase, the nanocatalysts facilitate rapid decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and nanoparticle&#8208;mediated charge transfer with drastically improved diffusion via rapid swelling of nanoporous hydrogels. The ocular glucose sensors result in high sensitivity, fast response time, low detection limit, low hysteresis, and rapid sensor warming&#8208;up time. In diabetic rabbits, smart contact lens can detect tear glucose levels consistent with blood glucose levels measured by a glucometer and a CGM device, reflecting rapid concentration changes without hysteresis. The CGM in a human demonstrates the feasibility of smart contact lenses for further clinical applications.

Self&#8208;polarization effect is found under charge excitation, which significantly improves the performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). This work provides a new strategy to enhance the dielectric properties of polar dielectric materials, and the realization of high charge density provides a promising strategy for achieving high&#8208;output TENGs toward various applications.








Abstract
Boosting output charge density is top priority for achieving high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The charge&#8208;excitation strategy is demonstrated to be a superior approach to acquire high output charge density. Meanwhile, the molecular charge behaviors in the dielectric under a strong electric field from high charge density bring new physics that are worth exploring. Here, a rapid self&#8208;polarization effect of a polar dielectric material by the superhigh electric field in a charge&#8208;excitation TENG is reported, by which the permittivity of the polar dielectric material realizes self&#8208;increase to a saturation, and thus enhances the output charge density. Consequently, an ultrahigh charge density of 3.53 mC m&#8722;2 is obtained with 7&#160;&#181;m homemade lead zirconate titanate&#8722;poly(vinylidene fluoride) composite film in the atmosphere with 5% relative humidity, which is the highest charge density for TENGs with high durability currently. This work provides new guidance for dielectric material optimization under charge excitation to boost the output performance of TENGs toward practical applications.

         <title>Fibrin Site&#8208;Specific Nanoprobe for Imaging Fibrin&#8208;Rich Thrombi and Preventing Thrombus Formation in Venous Vessels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a prevalent public health issue worldwide. Before treatment, spatiotemporally accurate thrombus detection is essential. However, with the currently available imaging technologie, this is challenging. Herein, the development of a novel fibrin&#8208;specific nanoprobe (NP) based on the conjugation of poly(&#8208;lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) with the pentapeptide Cys&#8208;Arg&#8208;Glu&#8208;Lys&#8208;Ala (CREKA) for selective and semiquantitative imaging in vivo is presented. By integrating Fe3O4 and NIR fluorochrome (IR780), the NP can function as a highly sensitive sensor for the direct analysis of thrombi in vivo. The fibrin&#8208;specific NP distinguishes fibrin&#8208;rich thrombi from collagen&#8208;rich or erythrocyte&#8208;rich thrombi, which could be beneficial for future individually tailored therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, loading NPs with the ketotifen fumarate results in mast cell degranulation inhibition, and hence, NPs can prevent thrombosis without the risk of excessive bleeding. Thus, the use of fibrin&#8208;specific NPs may serve as a safe alternative approach for the detection and prevention of VTEs in susceptible populations in the future.

         <title>Electroluminescencedynamic Flexible Device for High Efficient Eradication of Drug&#8208;resistant Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted wide attention in antibacterial applications due to its advantages of spatial&#8208;temporal selectivity, non&#8208;invasiveness, and low incidence to develop drug&#8208;resistance. To make it more convenient, universal, and manipulatable for clinical application, a conceptually antibacterial strategy, namely electroluminescencedynamic therapy (ELDT), is presented by nanoassemblie of electroluminescent (EL) material and photosensitizer, which is capable of generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) in situ under electric field, i.e., the fluorescence emitted by EL molecules excites photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen, for the oxidative damage of pathogens. Based on the scheme of ELDT, a flexible therapeutic device is fabricated through ELDT nanoagents loaded hydrogel, followed by integration with a flexible battery, satisfying the requirements of being light and wearable for wound dressings. The ELDT&#8208;based flexible device presents potent ROS&#8208;induced killing efficacies against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria (&gt;99.9%), so as to effectively inhibit the superficial infection and promote the healing of wound. This research reveals a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ELDT strategy as a prospective alternative to PDT, which avoids the utilization of physical light source, and achieves convenient and effective killing of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria through a hydrogel&#8208;based flexible therapeutic device.

         <title>High&#8208;fidelity skin&#8208;attachable acoustic sensor for realizing auditory electronic skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Wearable auditory sensors are critical in user&#8208;friendly sound&#8208;recognition systems for smart human&#8211;machine interaction and the Internet of Things. However, previously&#8208;reported wearable sensors have limited sound&#8208;sensing quality as a consequence of a poor frequency response and a narrow acoustic&#8208;pressure range. Here, we present a skin&#8208;attachable acoustic sensor that has higher sensing accuracy in wider auditory field than human ears, with flat frequency response (15&#8211;10,000&#160;Hz) and a good range of linearity (29&#8211;134 dBSPL) as well as high conformality to flexible surfaces and human skin. This high sound&#8208;sensing quality is achieved by exploiting the low residual stress and high processability of polymer materials in a diaphragm structure designed using acousto&#8208;mechano&#8208;electric modeling. Thus, our acoustic sensor shows high acoustic fidelity by sensing human&#8208;audible sounds, even loud sounds and low&#8208;frequency sounds that human ears cannot detect without distorting them. The polymer&#8208;based ultrasmall (&lt;9 mm2) and thin sensor maintains sound&#8208;detection quality on flexible substrates (radius of curvature &#8804;5&#160;mm) and in a wide temperature range (room temperature to &#8764;90 &#8451;). The acoustic sensor showed a significant potential of auditory electronic skin, by recognizing voice successfully when the sensor attached on human skin was connected to a commercial mobile device running the latest artificial intelligence assistant.

         <title>Quasi 1D Electronic Transport in a 2D Magnetic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We&#160;investigate electronic transport through exfoliated multilayers of CrSBr, a 2D semiconductor that is attracting attention because of its magnetic properties. We&#160;find an extremely pronounced anisotropy that manifests itself in qualitative and quantitative differences of all quantities measured along the in&#8208;plane a and b crystallographic directions. In particular, we&#160;observe a qualitatively different dependence of the conductivities &#963;a and &#963;b on temperature and gate voltage, accompanied by orders of magnitude differences in their values (&#963;b/&#963;a &#8776; 3 &#183; 102 &#8722; 105 at low temperature and large negative gate voltage). We&#160;also find a different behavior of the longitudinal magnetoresistance in the two directions, and the complete absence of the Hall effect in transverse resistance measurements. These observations appear not to be compatible with a description in terms of conventional band transport of a 2D doped semiconductor. The observed phenomenology &#8211;together with unambiguous signatures of a 1D van Hove singularity that we&#160;detect in energy resolved photocurrent measurements&#8211; indicate that electronic transport through CrSBr multilayers is better interpreted by considering the system as formed by weakly and incoherently coupled 1D wires, than by conventional 2D band transport. We&#160;conclude that CrSBr is the first 2D semiconductor to show distinctly quasi 1D electronic transport properties. Figure S1

Abstract
Bio&#8208;hybrid technologies aim to replicate the unique capabilities of biological systems that could surpass advanced artificial technologies. Soft bio&#8208;hybrid robots consist of synthetic and living materials and have the potential to self&#8208;assemble, regenerate, work autonomously, and interact safely with other species and the environment.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bio-hybrid technologies aim to replicate the unique capabilities of biological systems that could surpass advanced artificial technologies. Soft bio-hybrid robots consist of synthetic and living materials and have the potential to self-assemble, regenerate, work autonomously, and interact safely with other species and the environment. Cells require a sufficient exchange of nutrients and gases, which is guaranteed by convection and diffusive transport through liquid media. The functional development and long-term survival of biological tissues in vitro can be improved by dynamic flow culture, but only microfluidic flow control can develop tissue with fine structuring and regulation at the microscale. Full control of tissue growth at the microscale will eventually lead to functional macroscale constructs, which are needed as the biological component of soft bio-hybrid technologies. This review summarizes recent progress in microfluidic techniques to engineer biological tissues, focusing on the use of muscle cells for robotic bio-actuation. Moreover, the instances in which bio-actuation technologies greatly benefit from fusion with microfluidics are highlighted, which include: the microfabrication of matrices; biomimicry of cell microenvironments; tissue maturation, perfusion, and vascularization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hybrid&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Decorated Prussian Blue for Effective Cancer Immunotherapy via Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages Polarization and Hypoxia Relief</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid macrophage and thylakoid (TK) membrane camouflage hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) nanosystem with mannose decoration and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) adsorption (Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ) to form TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ, notably reduces in vivo reticuloendothelial system uptake, enhances tumor accumulation, inhibits tumor growth, induces tumor&#8208;associated macrophage polarization, facilitates cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration, and alleviates hypoxia microenvironment for improved cancer immunotherapy efficacy.








Abstract
Both tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and hypoxia condition severely restrict the antitumor potency during cancer immunotherapy. It is essential to overcome the two issues for improving therapeutic efficacy. In this study, a hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) nanosystem with mannose decoration and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) adsorption is built, to form Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ. It can facilitate cellular internalization via mannose&#8208;receptor mediated endocytosis and induce TAM polarization via iron ion/HCQ release with HMPB degradation. The hybrid macrophage and thylakoid (TK) membrane is camouflaged on the Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ surface, denoted as TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ, to reduce in vivo reticuloendothelial system uptake, enhance tumor accumulation, and mitigate hypoxia. The in vivo results indicate that TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ notably inhibits tumor growth, induces TAM polarization, facilitates cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration, and alleviates hypoxia microenvironment. The rational design may provide a new pathway to modulate the tumor microenvironment for promoting cancer immunotherapy effects.

         <title>Unconventional Doping Effect Leads to Ultrahigh Average Thermoelectric Power Factor in Cu3SbSe4&#8208;Based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the advantage of unconventional doping, high carrier mobility is maintained in Cu3SbSe4&#8722;xCuAlSe2&#160;composites, which is much higher than that of other Cu3SbSe4&#8208;based thermoelectrics doped by conventional methods. Consequently, a record&#8208;high average power factor of 19&#160;&#956;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2&#160;is obtained in the temperature range of 300&#8211;723&#160;K among Cu&#8208;based diamond&#8208;like thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials are typically highly degenerate semiconductors, which require high carrier concentration. However, the efficiency of conventional doping by replacing host atoms with alien ones is restricted by solubility limit, and, more unfavorably, such a doping method is likely to cause strong charge&#8208;carrier scattering at ambient temperature, leading to deteriorated electrical performance. Here, an unconventional doping strategy is proposed, where a small trace of alien atoms is used to stabilize cation vacancies in Cu3SbSe4&#160;by compositing with CuAlSe2, in which the cation vacancies rather than the alien atoms provide a high density of holes. Consequently, the hole concentration enlarges by six&#160;times but the carrier mobility is well maintained. As a result, a record&#8208;high average power factor of 19&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2&#160;in the temperature range of 300&#8211;723&#160;K is attained. Finally, with further reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a peak zT value of 1.4&#160;and a record&#8208;high average zT value of 0.72&#160;are achieved within the diamond&#8208;like compounds. This new doping strategy not only can be applied for boosting the average power factor for thermoelectrics, but more generally can be used to maintain carrier mobility for a variety of semiconductors that need high carrier concentration.

         <title>Cation vacancy enriched nickel phosphide for efficient electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis via the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e ORR) pathway is becoming increasingly important due to the green production process. Here, we first introduced cationic vacancies on nickel phosphide as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept to regulate the catalyst's physicochemical properties for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis. The as&#8208;fabricated VNi&#8208;riched Ni2&#8208;xP&#8208;VNi electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable 2e ORR performance with H2O2 molar fraction &gt;&#160;95% and Faradaic efficiencies &gt;&#160;90% in all pH conditions under a wide range of applied potentials. Impressively, the as&#8208;created VNi possesses superb long&#8208;term durability for over 50 hours, suppressing all the recently reported catalysts for H2O2 electrosynthesis. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge spectroscopy (XANES) and synchrotron Fourier transform infrared (SR&#8208;FTIR) combining theoretical calculation reveal that the excellent catalytic performance originates from the VNi&#8208;induced geometric and electronic structural optimization, thus promoting oxygen adsorption to the 2e ORR favored &#8220;end&#8208;on&#8221; configuration. We believe that the demonstrated cation vacancy engineering is an effective strategy towards creating active heterogeneous catalysts with atomic precision.

         <title>In Situ Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Organoids and Extracellular Matrix Interactions Via Photo&#8208;Transfer by Allyl Sulfide Exchange Expansion Microscopy (PhASE&#8208;ExM)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
3D organoid models have recently seen a boom in popularity, as they can better recapitulate the in vivo complexity of multicellular organs compared to other in vitro culture systems. However, organoids are difficult to image because of the limited penetration depth of high&#8208;resolution microscopes and depth&#8208;dependent light attenuation, which can limit the understanding of signal transduction pathways and characterization of intimate cell&#8208;extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. To overcome these challenges, we developed an expansion microscopy method termed PhASE&#8208;ExM, enabling optical clearance and super&#8208;resolution imaging of organoids and their ECM in 3D. PhASE&#8208;ExM uses hydrogels prepared via photo&#8208;initiated polymerization, which is advantageous as it decouples monomer diffusion into thick organoid cultures from the hydrogel fabrication. Apart from compatibility with organoids cultured Matrigel, PhASE&#8208;ExM enables 3.25x expansion and super&#8208;resolution imaging of organoids cultured in synthetic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels crosslinked via allyl&#8208;sulfide groups (PEG&#8208;AlS) through simultaneous photopolymerization and radical&#8208;mediated chain transfer reactions that complete in &lt;&#160;70 seconds. Further, PEG&#8208;AlS hydrogels can be in situ softened to promote organoid crypt formation, providing a super&#8208;resolution imaging platform both for pre&#8208; and post&#8208;differentiated organoids. Overall, PhASE&#8208;ExM is a useful tool to decipher organoid behavior by enabling sub&#8208;micron scale, 3D visualization of proteins and signal transduction pathways.

         <title>Fabrication of Flexible Mesoporous Black Nb2O5 Nanofiber Films for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction into CH4</title>

Abstract
Achieving high selectivity and conversion efficiency simultaneously is a challenge for visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction into CH4. Here, we report a facile nanofiber synthesis method and a new defect control strategy at room&#8208;temperature for the fabrication of flexible mesoporous black Nb2O5 nanofiber catalysts that contain abundant oxygen&#8208;vacancy and unsaturated Nb dual&#8208;sites, which are efficient towards photocatalytic production of CH4. The oxygen&#8208;vacancy decreases the bandgap width of Nb2O5 from 3.01&#8208;2.25&#160;eV that broaden the&#160;light absorption range from ultraviolet to visible&#8208;light, and the dual sites in the mesopores can easily adsorb CO2, so that the intermediate product of CO* can be spontaneously changed into *CHO. We propose that the formation of a highly stable Nb&#8208;CHO* intermediate at the dual sites was the key feature determining selectivity. The preliminary results show that without using sacrificial agents and photosensitizers, the nanofiber catalyst achieves 64.8% selectivity for the CH4 production with a high evolution rate of 19.5 &#956;mol&#8226;g&#8211;1&#8226;h&#8211;1 under visible&#8208;light. Furthermore, the flexible catalyst film can be directly used in devices, showing appealing and broadly commercial applications.

         <title>Reversible Pressure&#8208;Dependent Mechanochromism of Dion&#8211;Jacobson and Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Layered&#160;Hybrid&#160;Perovskites</title>

Layered Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) and Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) hybrid perovskite are promising materials for optoelectronic applications due to their modular structure. To fully exploit their functionality, mechanical stimuli could be used to control their properties without changing the composition. However, the responsiveness of these systems to pressure compatible with practical applications (&lt;1&#160;GPa) remains unexploited. We use hydrostatic pressure to investigate the structure&#8208;property relationships in representative iodide and bromide DJ and RP 2D perovskites based on 1,4&#8208;phenylenedimethylammonium (PDMA) and benzylammonium (BzA) spacers in the 0&#8211;0.35&#160;GPa pressure range. Pressure&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray scattering measurements reveal that lattices of these compositions monotonically shrink and DFT calculations provide insights into the structural changes within the organic spacer layer. These structural changes significantly affect the optical properties; the most significant shift in the optical absorption is observed in (BzA)2PbBr4 under 0.35&#160;GPa pressure, which is attributed to an isostructural phase transition. Surprisingly, the RP and DJ perovskites behave similarly under pressure, despite the different binding mode of the spacer molecules. This study provides important insights into how the manipulation of the crystal structure affects the optoelectronic properties of such materials, whereas the reversibility of their response expands the perspectives for future applications.

         <title>Modulating Electron Transfer in Vanadium&#8208;based Artificial Enzymes for Enhanced ROS&#8208;Catalysis and Disinfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanomaterials&#8208;based artificial enzymes (AEs) have flourished for more than a decade. However, it is still challenging to further enhance their biocatalytic performances due to the limited strategies to tune the electronic structures of active centers. Here, we report a new path for the de novo design of the d electrons of active centers by modulating the electron transfer in vanadium&#8208;based AEs (VOx&#8208;AE) via a unique Zn&#8208;O&#8208;V bridge for efficient ROS&#8208;catalysis. Benefiting from the electron transfer from Zn to V, the V site in VOx&#8208;AE exhibit a lower valence state than that in V2O5, which results in charge&#8208;filled V&#8208;dyz orbital near the Fermi level to interfere with the formation of sigma bonds between the V&#8208;dz2 and O&#8208;pz orbitals in H2O2. The VOx&#8208;AE exhibits a 2&#8208;fold Vmax and 3&#8208;fold turnover number than V2O5 when catalyzing H2O2. Meanwhile, the VOx&#8208;AE shows enhanced catalytic&#8208;eradication of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and achieves comparable wound treatment indexes to vancomycin. This modulating charge&#8208;filling of d electrons provides a new direction for the de novo design of nanomaterials&#8208;based AEs and deepens the understanding of ROS&#8208;catalysis.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area and Efficient Sky&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Via Blade&#8208;Coating</title>

Abstract
Large&#8208;area fabrication of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) through mass&#8208;production techniques have attracted growing attention due to their potential applications in lighting. Several breakthroughs have been made for red/infrared and green emissions. Nevertheless, large&#8208;area blue/sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs, a requisite color for lighting, have not been reported yet. Here, efficient and large&#8208;area sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs are fabricated through blade&#8208;coating supersaturated precursors. The volume ratio of dimethyl sulfoxide to dimethylformamide is tuned to obtain a supersaturated CsPb(Br0.84Cl0.16)3 solution. Blade&#8208;coating this supersaturated precursor results in nucleation in the solution phase with much higher nucleation sites, and a faster crystallization rate. The uniform films formed by this approach exhibit smaller grain size, lower trap density, and higher radiative recombination rate. The peak external quantum efficiency of the blade&#8208;coated PeLEDs reaches 10.3% with sky&#8208;blue emission (489&#160;nm). Benefitting from the robustness of our blade&#8208;coating technique, large&#8208;area sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs with a device area of 28 cm2 have also been achieved with uniform emission. This work represents a significant step forward towards flat&#8208;panel lighting and full&#8208;color display for the PeLEDs.

         <title>WET&#8208;induced Layered Organohydrogel as Bioinspired &#8220;Sticky&#8208;Slippy Skin&#8221; for Robust Underwater Oil&#8208;Repellency</title>

Abstract
Underwater superoleophobic surfaces featuring anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling properties are of great significance in widespread fields. However, their complicated engineering process and weak interfacial adhesion strength with underlying substrates severely hamper these ideal surfaces towards practical applications. Here, we report a moss&#8208;inspired sticky&#8208;slippy skin composed of layered organohydrogel through a one&#8208;step wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (WET) strategy, which unprecedentedly integrates robust inherent adhesion with durable anti&#8208;oil&#8208;fouling properties. The sticky organogel layer can be simply attached to various substrates from metals, plastics to glass independent of any surface pretreatment. The slippy hydrogel layer enables stable underwater superoleophobicity and ultralow oil adhesion for diverse kinds of oils. The sticky&#8208;slippy skin features outstanding comprehensive properties including easy&#8208;pasting, anti&#8208;swelling/anti&#8208;bending, compatibility with commercial adhesives, acid/alkali resistance, environmental friendliness and substrate universality. The design strategy with integrated functions provides a clue to accelerate the development of bioinspired multifunctional interfacial materials towards real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>A Nanostructured Moisture Absorbing Gel for Fast and Large&#8208;Scale Passive Dehumidification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dehumidification is significant for environmental sustainability and human health. Traditional dehumidification methods involve significant energy consumption and have negative impact on the environment. The core challenge is to expose hygroscopic surfaces to the air, and appropriately store the captured water and avoid surface inactivation. Here, we report a nanostructured moisture&#8208;absorbing gel (N&#8208;MAG) for passive dehumidification, which is consisted of a hydrophilic nanocellulose network controlled functionalized by hygroscopic lithium chloride. The interconnected nanocellulose can transfer the captured water to the internal space of the bulky N&#8208;MAG, eliminating the water accumulation near the surfaces and hence enabling high&#8208;rate moisture absorption. The N&#8208;MAG can reduce the relative humidity from 96.7% to 28.7% in 6 h, even if the space is over 2&#215;104 times of its own volume. The condensed water can be completely confined in N&#8208;MAG, overcoming the environmental pollution problem. This research bring new perspective for sustainable humidity management without energy consumption and with positive environmental footprint.

         <title>Amino Acid&#8208;Encoded Supramolecular Photothermal Nanomedicine for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photothermal nanomedicine based on self&#8208;assembly of biological components, with excellent biosafety and customized performance, is vital significance for precision cancer therapy. However, the programmable design of photothermal nanomedicine remains extremely challenging due to the vulnerability and variability of noncovalent interactions governing supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. We herein report that amino acid&#8208;encoding is a facile and potent means to design and construct supramolecular photothermal nanodrugs with controlled therapeutic activities. It was found that the amount and type of amino acids dominate the assembled nanostructures, structural stability, energy&#8208;conversion pathway, and therapeutic mechanism of the resulting nanodrugs. Two optimized nanodrugs were endowed with robust structural integrity against disassembly along with high photothermal conversion efficiency, efficient cellular internalization, and enhanced tumour accumulation, which result in more efficient tumour ablation. This work demonstrates that design based on amino acid encoding offers an unprecedented opportunity for the construction of remarkable photoactive nanomedicines toward cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>Open&#8208;shell Nanosensitizers for Glutathione Responsive Cancer Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deleterious effects to normal tissues and short biological half&#8208;life of sonosensitizers limit the applications of sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Herein we synthesize a new sonosensitizer (Cu(II)NS) that consists of porphyrins, the chelated Cu2+, and PEG to overcome the challenges of SDT. As Cu2+ contains 27 electrons, Cu(II)NS have an unpaired electron (open shell), resulting in a doublet ground state and little sonosensitivity. Overexpressed glutathione (GSH) in the tumor can reduce Cu2+ to generate Cu(I)NS, leading to a singlet ground state and recuperative sonosensitivity. Additionally, PEG endows Cu(II)NS with increased blood biological half&#8208;life and enhanced tumor accumulation, further increasing the effect of SDT. Through regulating the valence state of Cu, we achieve cancer SDT with enhanced therapeutic index.

         <title>Spatial Separation of Cocatalysts on Z&#8208;scheme Organic/Inorganic Heterostructure Hollow Spheres for Enhanced Photocatalytic H2 Evolution and in&#8208;depth Analysis of the Charge Transfer Mechanism</title>

Abstract
Herein, a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction with spatially separated cocatalysts is proposed for overcoming fundamental issues in photocatalytic water splitting, such as inefficient light absorption, charge recombination, and sluggish reaction kinetics. For efficient light absorption and interfacial charge separation, Z&#8208;scheme organic/inorganic heterojunction photocatalysts are synthesized by firmly immobilizing ultrathin g&#8208;C3N4 on the surface of TiO2 hollow spheres via electrostatic interactions. Additionally, two cocatalysts, Pt and IrOx, are spatially separated along the Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer pathway to enhance surface charge separation and reaction kinetics. The as&#8208;prepared Pt/g&#8208;C3N4/TiO2/IrOx (PCTI) hollow sphere photocatalyst exhibits an exceptional H2 evolution rate of 8.15&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and a remarkable apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 24.3% at 330&#160;nm in the presence of 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.2 wt% IrOx cocatalysts on g&#8208;C3N4 and TiO2, respectively. Photo&#8208;assisted Kelvin probe force microscopy is used to systematically analyze the Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism within PCTI. Furthermore, the benefits of spatially separating cocatalysts in the PCTI system are methodically investigated in comparison to randomly depositing them. This work adequately demonstrates that the combination of a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction and spatially separated cocatalysts can be a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic platforms for solar fuel production.

         <title>Wearable All&#8208;Gel Multimodal Cutaneous Sensor Enabling Simultaneous Single&#8208;Site Monitoring of Cardiac&#8208;Related Biophysical Signals</title>

Abstract
Human cutaneous sensory organ is a highly evolved biosensor that is efficient, sensitive, selective, and adaptable. Recently, with the developing various materials and structures inspired by sensory organs, artificial cutaneous sensors have been widely studied. In this study, we demonstrated the acquisition of biophysical signals at one point on the body using a wearable all&#8208;gel&#8208;integrated multimodal sensor composed of four element sensors, inspired by the slow/rapid adapting functions of the skin sensory receptors. The gel&#8208;type sensors ensure flexibility, compactness, portability, adherence, and integrity. The wearable all&#8208;gel multimodal sensor was easily attached to the wrist and simultaneously gathered blood pressure (BP), electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), and mechanomyogram (MMG) signals related to cardiac and muscle health. Human activity causes muscle contraction, which affects blood flow; therefore, the relationship between the muscle and heart is crucial for screening and predicting heart health. We monitored cardiac health by obtaining the two types of phase time differences (i.e., &#916;tbe: BP and ECG, &#916;tem: ECG and MMG) generated during muscle movement. The suggested multimodal sensor has potential applicability in monitoring biophysical conditions and diagnosing cardiac&#8208;related health problems.

         <title>The development of chiral nanoparticles to target NK cells and CD8+ T cells for cancer immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
The chirality of nanomaterials (NPs) can influence their interaction with cells and biological systems. However, how chirality can exert impact on the immune response has yet to be investigated. In this paper, we investigated the immunological effect of chiral nanomaterials as therapeutic and preventive options against tumors. Compared with achiral nanoparticles, chiral NPs with a g&#8208;factor of 0.44 were shown to enhance both innate and acquired immunity against tumor growth. We also found that chiral NPs enhanced the activation of CD8+ T and nature killer cells (CD69+ NK cells) by stimulating dendritic cells (DCs). Importantly, L&#8208;type NPs induced a 1.65&#8208;fold higher proportion of CD8+ T and CD69+ NK cells than D&#8208;type NPs. Next, we investigated the therapeutic and preventative effects of chiral NPs against tumors in a EG7.OVA tumor model. We found that L&#8208;type NPs had a significant greater ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells and prolong the survival time of model mice than D&#8208;type NPs. Mice treated with L&#8208;type NPs induced the activation of 84.98&#160;&#177; 6.63% CD8+ T cells and 33.62&#160;&#177; 3.41% of NK cells in tumor tissues; this was 1.62&#8208;fold and 1.39&#8208;fold higher than seen in the mice treated with D&#8208;type NPs. Mechanistic studies revealed that chiral NPs exerted mechanical force on bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and stimulated the expression of cytokines to induce cytotoxic activity in NK cells. Synergistically, the CD8 T cells were stimulated to eliminate tumor cells via antigen&#8208;cross presentation. The force of interaction between L&#8208;type NPs and cells was higher than that for D&#8208;NPs, thus further promoting the activation of NK cells and CD8+ T cells and their infiltration into tumor tissue. Our findings open up a new avenue for chiral nanomaterials to act as immunoadjuvants for the prevention and treatment of cancer.

         <title>Engineered Protein&#8208;Au Bioplaster for Efficient Skin Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Melanoma is the most lethal malignancy in skin cancer and may occur at any site and express melanocytes. Due to malignant melanoma's invasion and migration nature, conventional therapies make it challenging to remove the whole tumor tissue while undertaking the high risks of tumor recurrence. Regarding the emerging targeted therapies and immunotherapy, drug resistance and low immunotherapeutic activity remain significant challenges. It is thus becoming urgently important to develop alternative strategies for melanoma therapy. Herein, we develop a novel bifunctional protein&#8208;based photo&#8208;thermal bioplaster (PPTB) for non&#8208;invasive tumor therapy and skin tissue regeneration. The complexation of adhesive protein and gold nanorods (GNRs) endow the obtained PPTB with good biocompatibility, controllable near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;mediated adhesion performance, and high photo&#8208;thermal performance. Therefore, the PPTB bioagent facilitates skin adhesion and effectively transfers heat from skin to tumor. This behavior endows PPTB capability to eradicate skin tumors conveniently. Thus, our assembly strategy enables this hybrid bioplaster to hold great potential for skin&#8208;related tumor treatment.

         <title>A &#8220;Pre&#8208;Constrained Metal Twins&#8221; Strategy to Prepare Efficient Dual&#8208;Metal&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Cooperative Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained metal twin&#8221; strategy is presented for the first time to prepare dual&#8208;metal&#8208;atom&#8208;center catalysts (FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC) with continuous FeN4 and CoN4. The FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC delivers excellent catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and Zn&#8211;air batteries. The synergistic effect between the two metals optimizes the free energy of the oxygen intermediate state, resulting in improved performance.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal&#8208;atom&#8208;center catalysts (DACs) are a novel frontier in oxygen electrocatalysis, boasting functional and electronic synergies between contiguous metal centers and higher catalytic activities than single&#8208;atom&#8208;center catalysts. However, the definition and catalytic mechanism of DACs configurations remain unclear. Here, a &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained metal twins&#8221; strategy is proposed to prepare contiguous FeN4 and CoN4 DACs with homogeneous conformations embedded in a N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC). A programmable phthalocyanines dimer is used as a structural moiety to anchor the bimetallic sites (containing Co and Fe) in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) to achieve delocalized dispersion before pyrolysis. The resultant FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in oxygen electrocatalysis and rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the synergetic interaction of adjacent metals optimizes the d&#8208;band center position of metal centers and balances the free energy of the *O intermediate, thereby improving the oxygen electrocatalytic activity. This work opens up an avenue for the rational design of DACs with tailored electronic structures and uniform geometric configurations.

         <title>Elastic Plasmonic&#8208;Enhanced Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Cavities with Ultrasensitive Stretching Tunability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel plasmon&#8208;enhanced stretchable Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities obtained by a catalytic self&#8208;embedding process of Au&#8208;nanodomes into elastomeric materials are demonstrated. The resulting FP resonances are amplified by the broad plasmonic resonances of the Au nanostructures and modulated by the scattering from the wrinkled surface. The optical response is highly mechanically tunable in both FP resonances intensity and spectral position.








Abstract
The emerging stretchable photonics field faces challenges, like the robust integration of optical elements into elastic matrices or the generation of large optomechanical effects. Here, the first stretchable plasmonic&#8208;enhanced and wrinkled Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) cavities are demonstrated, which are composed of self&#8208;embedded arrays of Au nanostructures at controlled depths into elastomer films. The novel self&#8208;embedding process is triggered by the Au nanostructures&#8217; catalytic activity, which locally increases the polymer curing rate, thereby inducing a mechanical stress that simultaneously pulls the Au nanostructures into the polymer and forms a wrinkled skin layer. This geometry yields unprecedented optomechanical effects produced by the coupling of the broad plasmonic modes of the Au nanostructures and the FP modes, which are modulated by the wrinkled optical cavity. As a result, film stretching induces drastic changes in both the spectral position and intensity of the plasmonic&#8208;enhanced FP resonances due to the simultaneous cavity thickness reduction and cavity wrinkle flattening, thus increasing the cavity finesse. These optomechanical effects are exploited to demonstrate new strain&#8208;sensing approaches, achieving a strain detection limit of 0.006%, i.e., 16&#8208;fold lower than current optical strain&#8208;detection schemes.

         <title>An Asymmetry Field&#8208;Effect Phototransistor for Solving Large Exciton Binding Energy of 2D TMDCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric split&#8208;gate phototransistor configuration, called the &#8220;asymmetry field&#8208;effect phototransistor&#8221; (AFEPT) is demonstrated. The structure allows for an effective modulation of the electric&#8208;field profile throughout the channel, as well as enhanced photocarrier transport, thereby providing a new platform for improving optoelectronic properties and probing photocarrier dynamics in intrinsic 2D material layers.








Abstract
The probing of fundamental photophysics is a key prerequisite for the construction of diverse optoelectronic devices and circuits. To date, though, photocarrier dynamics in 2D materials remains unclear, plagued primarily by two issues: a large exciton binding energy, and the lack of a suitable system that enables the manipulation of excitons. Here, a WSe2&#8208;based phototransistor with an asymmetric split&#8208;gate configuration is demonstrated, which is named the &#8220;asymmetry field&#8208;effect phototransistor&#8221; (AFEPT). This structure allows for the effective modulation of the electric&#8208;field profile across the channel, thereby providing a standard device platform for exploring the photocarrier dynamics of the intrinsic WSe2 layer. By controlling the electric field, this work the spatial evolution of the photocurrent is observed, notably with a strong signal over the entire WSe2 channel. Using photocurrent and optical spectroscopy measurements, the physical origin of the novel photocurrent behavior is clarified and a room&#8208;temperature exciton binding energy of 210 meV is determined with the device. In the phototransistor geometry, lateral p&#8211;n junctions serve as a simultaneous pathway for both photogenerated electrons and holes, reducing their recombination rate and thus enhancing photodetection. The study establishes a new device platform for both fundamental studies and technological applications.

&lt;p&gt;An asymmetric split-gate phototransistor configuration, called the &#8220;asymmetry field-effect phototransistor&#8221; (AFEPT) is demonstrated. The structure allows for an effective modulation of the electric-field profile throughout the channel, as well as enhanced photocarrier transport, thereby providing a new platform for improving optoelectronic properties and probing photocarrier dynamics in intrinsic 2D material layers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probing of fundamental photophysics is a key prerequisite for the construction of diverse optoelectronic devices and circuits. To date, though, photocarrier dynamics in 2D materials remains unclear, plagued primarily by two issues: a large exciton binding energy, and the lack of a suitable system that enables the manipulation of excitons. Here, a WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based phototransistor with an asymmetric split-gate configuration is demonstrated, which is named the &#8220;asymmetry field-effect phototransistor&#8221; (AFEPT). This structure allows for the effective modulation of the electric-field profile across the channel, thereby providing a standard device platform for exploring the photocarrier dynamics of the intrinsic WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer. By controlling the electric field, this work the spatial evolution of the photocurrent is observed, notably with a strong signal over the entire WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel. Using photocurrent and optical spectroscopy measurements, the physical origin of the novel photocurrent behavior is clarified and a room-temperature exciton binding energy of 210 meV is determined with the device. In the phototransistor geometry, lateral p&#8211;n junctions serve as a simultaneous pathway for both photogenerated electrons and holes, reducing their recombination rate and thus enhancing photodetection. The study establishes a new device platform for both fundamental studies and technological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolyte Modulators toward Polarization&#8208;Mitigated Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries for Sustainable Electric Transportation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D metal&#8211;organic framework is employed as an electrolyte modulator (MEM) for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIB). Such an MEM can afford electrolytes with high lithium&#8208;ion transference number and high ionic conductivity, as well as low&#8208;resistivity interface with electrodes and ability to suppress polarizations. The LIB operated under strenuous conditions demonstrates that the MEM dramatically improves the energy output, energy efficiency, and cycle lifespan.








Abstract
Electric vehicles (EVs) are being adopted to replace combustion engine vehicles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change; developing batteries with high energy efficiency and long lifespan, in the context of carbon footprint and cost, are essential to ensure the successful transition. Herein, an electrolyte modulator that can effectively mitigate the polarization of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, leading to dramatically improved energy efficiency and lifespan, is reported. Under a dynamic stress test that mimics the operations of EVs, commercial pouch cells with a low concentration of electrolyte modulator (0.2 wt% of the electrolyte) exhibit enhanced energy efficiency (87.5% vs 80.4% for the first 500 testing cycles) and prolonged lifespan (fourfold improvement based on 70% energy&#8208;output retention). This work provides a simple yet effective strategy toward sustainable electrification of vehicles.

         <title>POM Anolyte for All&#8208;Anion Redox Flow Batteries with High Capacity Retention and Coulombic Efficiency at Mild pH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the multi&#8208;electron redox ability, structure stability, and high redox kinetics of {BW12} polyoxometalate (POM) anion anolyte at mild pH, all&#8208;anion aqueous redox flow batteries coupled with different catholyte anion exhibit very high capacity retention. An in&#8208;operando aqueous flowing Raman spectroscopy technique is also first constructed to investigate the structural revolution and stability of POMs anion during battery operation.








Abstract
A highly soluble Li5BW12O40 cluster delivers 2 e&#8722; redox reaction with fast electron transfer rates (2.5 &#215; 10&#8722;2&#160;cm s&#8722;1) and high diffusion coefficients (&#8776;2.08 &#215; 10&#8722;6 cm2 s&#8722;1) at mild pH ranging from 3 to 8. In&#8208;operando aqueous&#8208;flowing Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal that Raman shift changing of {BW12} clusters is due to the bond length changing between W&#8208;Ob&#8208;W and W&#8208;Oc&#8208;W at different redox states. The structure changing and redox chemistry of Li5BW12O40 are highly reversible, which makes the Li5BW12O40 cluster versatile to construct all&#8208;anion aqueous redox flow batteries (RFBs). The cation&#8208;exchange Nafion membrane will also repel the cross permeability of the anion redox couples. Consequently, by coupling with Li3K[Fe(CN)6] catholyte, the aqueous RFB can be operated at pH 8 with a capacity retention up to 95% and an average Coulombic efficiency more than 99.79% over 300 cycles within 0 to 1.2&#160;V. Meanwhile, Li5BW12O40 cluster can also be paired with LiI catholyte to form aqueous RFBs at pH 7 and pH 3, the capacity retention of 94% and 90% can be realized over 300 cycles within 0 to 1.3&#160;V.

         <title>Conductivity Mechanism in Ionic 2D Carbon Nitrides: From Hydrated Ion Motion to Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dark and photoinduced charge transport in the metal (M)&#8208;intercalated 2D carbon nitride poly(heptazine imide) (M&#8208;PHI) is investigated, revealing predominantly ionic, humidity&#8208;assisted conductivity. A correlation between ionic conductivity and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity is revealed, which suggests efficient screening of photogenerated charges by mobile ions, leading to prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes.








Abstract
Carbon nitrides are among the most studied materials for photocatalysis; however, limitations arise from inefficient charge separation and transport within the material. Here, this aspect is addressed in the 2D carbon nitride poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) by investigating the influence of various counterions, such as M = Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Ba2+, NH4+, and tetramethyl ammonium, on the material's conductivity and photocatalytic activity. These ions in the PHI pores affect the stacking of the 2D layers, which further influences the predominantly ionic conductivity in M&#8208;PHI. Na&#8208;containing PHI outperforms the other M&#8208;PHIs in various relative humidity (RH) environments (0&#8211;42%RH) in terms of conductivity, likely due to pore&#8208;channel geometry and size of the (hydrated) ion. With increasing RH, the ionic conductivity increases by 4&#8211;5 orders of magnitude (for Na&#8208;PHI up to 10&#8208;5 S cm&#8208;1 at 42%RH). At the same time, the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate is observed for Na&#8208;PHI, which is mirrored by increased photogenerated charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes, pointing to efficient charge&#8208;carrier stabilization by, e.g., mobile ions. These results indicate that also ionic conductivity is an important parameter that can influence the photocatalytic activity. Besides, RH&#8208;dependent ionic conductivity is of high interest for separators, membranes, or sensors.

         <title>Acoustophoretic Liquefaction for 3D Printing Ultrahigh&#8208;Viscosity Nanoparticle Suspensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustophoretic&#8208;liquefaction Digital Light Processing (AL&#8208;DLP) permits manipulation of resin rheology during 3D printing. Acoustic transduction reduces the viscosity of nanopartice suspensions by up to three orders of magnitude to promote resin recirculation and reduce viscous adhesion. Consequently, AL&#8208;DLP improves resolution (&gt;25%), increases printable area (&#8776;50 &#215; ), and reduces build times (&gt;3 &#215; faster) when compared to conventional methods for printing composite.








Abstract
An acoustic liquefaction approach to enhance the flow of yield stress fluids during Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based 3D printing is reported. This enhanced flow enables processing of ultrahigh&#8208;viscosity resins (&#956;app&#160;&gt; 3700 Pa s at shear rates &#947;&#729;&#160;= 0.01 s&#8211;1) based on silica particles in a silicone photopolymer. Numerical simulations of the acousto&#8211;mechanical coupling in the DLP resin feed system at different agitation frequencies predict local resin flow velocities exceeding 100 mm s&#8211;1 at acoustic transduction frequencies of 110 s&#8211;1. Under these conditions, highly loaded particle suspensions (weight fractions, &#981;&#160;= 0.23) can be printed successfully in complex geometries. Such mechanically reinforced composites possess a tensile toughness 2000% greater than the neat photopolymer. Beyond an increase in processible viscosities, acoustophoretic liquefaction DLP (AL&#8208;DLP) creates a transient reduction in apparent viscosity that promotes resin recirculation and decreases viscous adhesion. As a result, acoustophoretic liquefaction Digital Light Processing (AL&#8208;DLP) improves the printed feature resolution by more than 25%, increases printable object sizes by over 50 times, and can build parts &gt;3 &#215; faster when compared to conventional methodologies.

Acoustic transduction reduces the viscosity of nanopartice suspensions by up to three orders of magnitude to promote resin recirculation and reduce viscous adhesion. Consequently, AL-DLP improves resolution (&amp;gt;25%), increases printable area (&#8776;50 &#215; ), and reduces build times (&amp;gt;3 &#215; faster) when compared to conventional methods for printing composite.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An acoustic liquefaction approach to enhance the flow of yield stress fluids during Digital Light Processing (DLP)-based 3D printing is reported. This enhanced flow enables processing of ultrahigh-viscosity resins (&#956;&lt;sub&gt;app&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&amp;gt; 3700 Pa s at shear rates &#947;&#729;&#160;= 0.01 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;) based on silica particles in a silicone photopolymer. Numerical simulations of the acousto&#8211;mechanical coupling in the DLP resin feed system at different agitation frequencies predict local resin flow velocities exceeding 100 mm s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; at acoustic transduction frequencies of 110 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Under these conditions, highly loaded particle suspensions (weight fractions, &#981;&#160;= 0.23) can be printed successfully in complex geometries. Such mechanically reinforced composites possess a tensile toughness 2000% greater than the neat photopolymer. Beyond an increase in processible viscosities, acoustophoretic liquefaction DLP (AL-DLP) creates a transient reduction in apparent viscosity that promotes resin recirculation and decreases viscous adhesion. As a result, acoustophoretic liquefaction Digital Light Processing (AL-DLP) improves the printed feature resolution by more than 25%, increases printable object sizes by over 50 times, and can build parts &amp;gt;3 &#215; faster when compared to conventional methodologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Predictive Theory for Domain Walls in Oxide Ferroelectrics Based on Interatomic Interactions and its Implications for Collective Material Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A discrete microscopic Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire (dmLGD) approach with A&#8208; and B&#8208;site cation displacements serving as order parameters is developed. Using dmLGD decomposition of the total energy of the system into the contributions of the individual cations, various properties are predicted for a wide range of ferroelectric perovskites based on the results obtained for BaTiO3, KNbO3, and PbTiO3 only.








Abstract
Domain walls separating regions of ferroelectric material with polarization oriented in different directions are crucial for applications of ferroelectrics. Rational design of ferroelectric materials requires the development of a theory describing how compositional and environmental changes affect domain walls. To model domain wall systems, a discrete microscopic Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire (dmLGD) approach with A&#8208; and B&#8208;site cation displacements serving as order parameters is developed. Application of dmLGD to the classic BaTiO3, KNbO3, and PbTiO3 ferroelectrics shows that A&#8211;B cation repulsion is the key interaction that couples the polarization in neighboring unit cells of the material. dmLGD decomposition of the total energy of the system into the contributions of the individual cations and their interactions enables the prediction of different properties for a wide range of ferroelectric perovskites based on the results obtained for BaTiO3, KNbO3, and PbTiO3 only. It is found that the information necessary to estimate the structure and energy of domain&#8208;wall &#8220;defects&#8221; can be extracted from single&#8208;domain 5&#8208;atom first&#8208;principles calculations, and that &#8220;defect&#8208;like&#8221; domain walls offer a simple model system that sheds light on the relative stabilities of the ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and paraelectric bulk phases. The dmLGD approach provides a general theoretical framework for understanding and designing ferroelectric perovskite oxides.

         <title>Hysteresis&#8208;Free Nanoparticle&#8208;Reinforced Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly swollen, low&#8208;crosslinking&#8208;density polymer hydrogel reinforced with hyperbranched silica nanoparticles is absent of temporary entanglement and effectively avoids hysteresis during extensive cyclic tensile tests. This work provides a universal design principle for hysteresis&#8208;free hydrogels, leading to better antifatigue performances.








Abstract
The elastic storage and release of mechanical energy has been key to many developments throughout the history of mankind. Resilience, absent hysteresis, has been an elusive goal to achieve, particularly at large deformations. Using a low&#8208;crosslink&#8208;density polyacrylamide hydrogel at 96% water content having hyperbranched silica nanoparticles (HBSPs) as the major junction points, a hysteresis&#8208;free material is realized. The fatigue&#8208;free characteristic of these composite hydrogels is evidenced by the invariance of the stress&#8211;strain curves at strain ratios of 4, even after 5000 cycles. At a strain ratio of 7, only a 1.3% hysteresis is observed. A markedly increased strain&#8208;ratio&#8208;at&#8208;break of 11.5 is observed. The unique attributes of these resilient hydrogels are manifested in the high&#8208;fidelity detection of dynamic deformations under cyclic loading over a broad range of frequencies, difficult to achieve with other materials.

         <title>Microfluidic Screening&#8208;Assisted Machine Learning to Investigate Vertical Phase Separation of Small Molecule:Polymer Blend</title>

         <dc:description>
Microfluidic channel embedded solution shearing is developed, which enables time&#8208; and resource&#8208;efficient generation and screening of thin&#8208;films of varying experimental conditions. Gaussian Process Regression algorithm tuned by Bayesian optimization is utilized to predict the transistor performance, optimize the experimental conditions, and investigate the vertical phase separation during solvent evaporation.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film processing is a widely utilized technique for the fabrication of various devices. In particular, the tunability of the ink composition and coating condition allows precise control of thin&#8208;film properties and device performance. Despite the advantage of having such tunability, the sheer number of possible combinations of experimental parameters render it infeasible to efficiently optimize device performance and analyze the correlation between experimental parameters and device performance. In this work, a microfluidic screening&#8208;embedded thin&#8208;film processing technique is developed, through which thin&#8208;films of varying ratios of small molecule semiconductor:polymer blend are simultaneously generated and screened in a time&#8208; and resource&#8208;efficient manner. Moreover, utilizing the thin&#8208;films of varying combinations of experimental parameters, machine learning models are trained to predict the transistor performance. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithms tuned by Bayesian optimization shows the best predictive accuracy amongst the trained models, which enables narrowing down of the combinations of experimental parameters and investigation of the degree of vertical phase separation under the predicted parameter space. The technique can serve as a guideline for elucidating the underlying complex parameter&#8208;property&#8208;performance correlations in solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film processing, thereby accelerating the optimization of various thin&#8208;film devices in the future.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric design of the organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor layer allows for the rectification of input signals with a high current density of over 30 kA cm&#8722;2 in an aqueous electrolyte. The operation mechanism is elucidated with the help of numerical analysis and in operando electrochemical potential mapping methods, and analog/digital circuits are demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of these novel device architectures.








Abstract
Owing to their outstanding electrical/electrochemical performance, operational stability, mechanical flexibility, and decent biocompatibility, organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors have shown great potential as implantable electrodes for neural recording/stimulation and as active channels for signal switching/amplifying transistors. Nonetheless, no studies exist on a general design rule for high&#8208;performance electrochemical diodes, which are essential for highly functional circuit architectures. In this work, generalizable electrochemical diodes with a very high current density over 30 kA cm&#8722;2 are designed by introducing an asymmetric active layer based on organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors. The underlying mechanism on polarity&#8208;sensitive balanced ionic doping/dedoping is elucidated by numerical device analysis and in operando spectroelectrochemical potential mapping, while the general material requirements for electrochemical diode operation are deduced using various types of conjugated polymers. In parallel, analog signal rectification and digital logic processing circuits are successfully demonstrated to show the broad impact of circuits incorporating organic electrochemical diodes. It is expected that organic electrochemical diodes will play vital roles in realizing multifunctional soft bioelectronic circuitry in combination with organic electrochemical transistors.

         <title>Dielectric&#8208;Modulated Biosensing with Ultrahigh&#8208;Frequency&#8208;Operated Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte&#8208;gated graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (Gr&#8208;FETs) are configured in reflectometry mode at ultrahigh frequencies (UHF), where the conductivity of high&#8208;salt solutions, and thus the ionic screening is fully cancelled. By simultaneous characterization using field effect and UHF reflectometry, dielectric&#8208;modulated Gr&#8208;FET biosensors with high sensitivities are achieved.








Abstract
Owing to their excellent electrical properties and chemical stability, graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (Gr&#8208;FET) are extensively studied for biosensing applications. However, hinging on surface interactions of charged biomolecules, the sensitivity of Gr&#8208;FET is hampered by ionic screening under physiological conditions with high salt concentrations up to frequencies as high as MHz. Here, an electrolyte&#8208;gated Gr&#8208;FET in reflectometry mode at ultrahigh frequencies (UHF, around 2&#160;GHz), where the ionic screening is fully cancelled and the dielectric sensitivity of the device allows the Gr&#8208;FET to directly function in high&#8208;salt solutions, is configured. Strikingly, by simultaneous characterization using electrolyte gating and UHF reflectometry, the developed graphene biosensors offer unprecedented capability for real&#8208;time monitoring of dielectric&#8208;specified biomolecular/cell interactions/activities, with superior limit of detection compared to that of previously reported nanoscale high&#8208;frequency sensors. These achievements highlight the unique potential of ultrahigh&#8208;frequency operation for unblocking the true potential of graphene biosensors for point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic.

         <title>A Multilevel Analytical Theory for Prediction of Ferroelectric Perovskite Oxide Properties from Composition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multilevel model for the prediction of the technologically important properties of perovskite oxide ferroelectric solid solutions is developed, starting at the level of the electronic structure and chemical bonding of the constituent ions and ending at the level of collective macroscopic behavior. This approach is likely to be generally applicable to different classes of materials and functional properties.








Abstract
Prediction of properties from composition is a fundamental goal of materials science that is particularly relevant for ferroelectric perovskite oxide solid solutions where compositional variation is a primary tool for material design. Design of ferroelectric oxide solid solutions has been guided by heuristics and first&#8208;principles and Landau&#8211;Ginzburg&#8211;Devonshire theoretical methods that become increasingly difficult to apply in ternary, quaternary, and quintary solid solutions. To address this problem, a multilevel model is developed for the prediction of the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric transition temperature (Tc), coercive field (Ec), and polarization (P) of PbTiO3&#8208;derived ferroelectric solid solutions from composition. The characteristics of the materials at different length scales, starting at the level of the electronic structure and chemical bonding of the constituent ions and ending at the level of collective behavior, are analytically related by using ferroelectric domain walls and cationic off&#8208;center displacements as the key links between the different levels of the model. The obtained composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships provide a unified quantitatively predictive theory for understanding PbTiO3&#8208;derived solid solutions. Such a multilevel analytical modeling approach is likely to be generally applicable to different classes of ferroelectric perovskite oxides and to other functional properties, and to materials and properties beyond the field of ferroelectrics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Blockade of PD&#8208;L1 with Bacteria&#8208;Derived Outer&#8208;Membrane Vesicle for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An LyP1 polypeptide&#8208;modified outer&#8208;membrane vesicle loaded with a PD&#8208;1 plasmid is developed for inducing the self&#8208;expression of PD&#8208;1 by tumor cells and achieving self&#8208;blockade of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway. The outer&#8208;membrane protein component can recruit cytotoxic lymphocyte cells and natural killer cells to tumor microenvironment, further improving the antitumor activity of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 self&#8208;blocking therapy.








Abstract
The checkpoint inhibitor therapy that blocks programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) and its major ligand PD&#8208;L1 has achieved encouraging clinical efficacy in certain cancers. However, the binding of checkpoint inhibitors with other immune cells that express PD&#8208;L1 often results in a low response rate to the blockade and severe adverse effects. Herein, an LyP1 polypeptide&#8208;modified outer&#8208;membrane vesicle (LOMV) loaded with a PD&#8208;1 plasmid is developed to achieve self&#8208;blockade of PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells. The nanocarriers accumulate in the tumor tissue through OMV&#8208;targeting ability and are internalized into the tumor cells via the LyP1&#8208;mediated target, subsequently delivering PD&#8208;1 plasmid into the nucleus, leading to the expression of PD&#8208;1 by the tumor cells. In addition, a magnetic particle chemiluminescence kit is developed to quantitatively detect the binding rate of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1. The self&#8208;expressed PD&#8208;1 bonded with the PD&#8208;L1 is expressed by both autologous and neighboring tumor cells, achieving self&#8208;blockade. Simultaneously, the outer&#8208;membrane protein of LOMV recruits cytotoxic lymphocyte cells and natural killer cells to tumor tissues and stimulates them to secrete IFN&#8208;&#947;&#8202;&#8202;, improving the antitumor activity of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 self&#8208;blocking therapy.

         <title>Multifunctional Separator Allows Stable Cycling of Potassium Metal Anodes and of Potassium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;free potassium metal anode and potassium metal battery are achieved by a multifunctional separator of double&#8208;coated reactive AlF3 on polypropylene. It possesses improved electrolyte wetting and uptake, ion conductivity, and ion transference numbers, facilitating uniform K&#8208;ion flux, and plays as an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), facilitating stable KF, Al2O3, and AlF3 SEI.








Abstract
This is the first report of a multifunctional separator for potassium&#8208;metal batteries (KMBs). Double&#8208;coated tape&#8208;cast microscale AlF3 on polypropylene (AlF3@PP) yields state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance: symmetric cells are stable after 1000 cycles (2000 h) at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2, with 0.042&#160;V overpotential. Stability is maintained at 5.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 600 cycles (240 h), with 0.138&#160;V overpotential. Postcycled plated surface is dendrite&#8208;free, while stripped surface contains smooth solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Conventional PP cells fail rapidly, with dendrites at plating, and &#8220;dead metal&#8221; and SEI clumps at stripping. Potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) cathode KMBs with AlF3@PP display enhanced capacity retention (91% at 100 cycles vs 58%). AlF3 partially reacts with K to form an artificial SEI containing KF, AlF3, and Al2O3 phases. The AlF3@PP promotes complete electrolyte wetting and enhances uptake, improves ion conductivity, and increases ion transference number. The higher of K+ transference number is ascribed to the strong interaction between AlF3 and FSI&#8722; anions, as revealed through 19F NMR. The enhancement in wetting and performance is general, being demonstrated with ester&#8208; and ether&#8208;based solvents, with K&#8208;, Na&#8208;, or Li&#8208; salts, and with different commercial separators. In full batteries, AlF3 prevents Fe crossover and cycling&#8208;induced cathode pulverization.

         <dc:description>
The reactions of sulfur in a Li&#8211;S battery are very complicated and the evaluation of their mechanism is challenging. Many hidden information can be easily revealed by an in situ electrochemistry and mass spectrometry (EC&#8208;MS) and it shines a light for design novel catalyst and system for the Li&#8211;S battery.








Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is one of the most promising next generation energy storage systems due to its high theoretical specific energy. However, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides formed during cell operation is a crucial reason for the low cyclability suffered by current Li&#8211;S batteries. As a result, an in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the sulfur cathode redox reactions is urgently required for further advancement of Li&#8211;S batteries. Herein, the direct observation of polysulfides in a Li&#8208;S battery is reported by an in situ hyphenated technique of electrochemistry and mass spectrometry. Several short&#8208;lived lithium polysulfide intermediates during sulfur redox have been identified. Furthermore, this method is applied to a mechanistic study of an electrocatalyst that has been observed to promote the polysulfides conversion in a Li&#8211;S cell. Through the abundance distributions of various polysulfides before and after adding the electrocatalyst, compelling experimental evidences of catalytic selectivity of cobalt phthalocyanine to those long&#8208;chain polysulfide intermediates are obtained. This work can provide guidance for the design of novel cathode to overcome the shuttle effect and facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics.

         <title>Rational Design of Covalent Heptazine Frameworks with Spatially Separated Redox Centers for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) with spatially separated redox centers are rationally designed from the molecular level. The spatial separation feature is critical for enhancing surface charge separation and achieving efficient H2O2 production. This study establishes a new foundation for the future development of metal&#8208;free polymer photocatalysts toward various photocatalytic overall reactions.








Abstract
The redox reaction centers in natural organisms conducting oxygenic photosynthesis are well arranged in a physically separated manner to convert sunlight into chemical energy efficiently. Mimicking natural photosynthesis via precisely constructing oxidative and reductive reaction centers within photocatalysts is ideal for enhancing catalytic performances in artificial photosynthesis. In this study, new covalent heptazine frameworks (CHFs) with spatially separated redox centers are rationally designed for photocatalytic production of H2O2 from water and oxygen without using any sacrificial agents. Both experimental and computational investigations indicate that the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction occurs on the heptazine moiety, whereas the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction occurs on the acetylene or diacetylene bond in the CHFs. This unique spatial separation feature is critical for enhancing charge separation and achieving efficient H2O2 production. Meanwhile, the measured exciton binding energy of the diacetylene&#8208;containing polymer is merely 24 meV. Under simulated solar irradiation, the rationally designed CHFs can achieve a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.78%, surpassing previously reported photocatalytic materials. This study establishes a molecular engineering approach to construct periodically arranged and spatially separated redox centers in single&#8208;component polymer photocatalysts, representing a hallmark to create more exciting polymer structures for photocatalysis moving forward.

         <title>Unraveling the Molar Mass Dependence of Shearing&#8208;Induced Aggregation Structure of a High&#8208;Mobility Polymer Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molar mass dependence on aggregation structure evolution and charge transport of TDPP&#8208;Se is thoroughly examined by neutron scattering and complementary techniques. The rod&#8208;like preaggregate with moderate length favors a highly aligned and ordered structure by bar coating. Hence, a reliable hole mobility up to &#8776;14 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is recorded for thin&#8208;film transistors using diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;structure formation of conjugated polymers is a fundamental problem in the field of organic electronics and remains poorly understood. Herein, the molar mass dependence of the aggregation structure of a high&#8208;mobility conjugated copolymer (TDPP&#8208;Se) comprising thiophene&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and selenophene is thoroughly shown. Five batches of TDPP&#8208;Se are prepared with the number&#8208;average molecular weights (Mn) varied greatly from 21 to 135&#160;kg mol&#8722;1. Small&#8208;angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy are combined to probe the solution structure of these polymers, consistently using a deuterated solvent. All the polymers adopt 1D rod&#8208;like aggregation structures and the radius of the 1D rods is not sensitive to the Mn, while the length increases monotonically with Mn. By utilizing the ordered packing of the aggregated structure in solution, a highly aligned and ordered film is prepared and, thereafter, a reliable hole mobility of 13.8 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is realized in organic thin&#8208;film transistors with the moderate Mn batch via bar coating. The hole mobility is among the highest values reported for diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers. This work paves the way to visualize the real aggregated structure of polymer semiconductors in solution and sheds light on the microstructure control of high&#8208;performance electronic devices.

         <title>Highly Efficient Photothermal Conversion and Water Transport during Solar Evaporation Enabled by Amorphous Hollow Multishelled Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous Ta2O5/C nanocomposite with a hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is prepared for the first time. This HoMS results in highly efficient energy conversion and rapid water transport, achieving superfast evaporation speed with long&#8208;term stability. A World Health Organization standard drinkable water can be achieved from seawater, water containing metallic ions, and extremely acidic/alkaline , radioactive, and virus&#8208;polluted water.








Abstract
Solar evaporation, which enables water purification without consuming fossil fuels, has been considered the most promising strategy to address global scarcity of drinkable water. However, the suboptimal structure and composition designs still result in a trade&#8208;off between photothermal conversion, water transport, and tolerance to harsh environments. Here, an ultrastable amorphous Ta2O5/C nanocomposite is designed with a hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) for solar evaporation. This HoMS results in highly efficient photoabsorption and photothermal conversion, as well as a decrease of the actual water evaporation enthalpy. A superfast evaporation speed of 4.02&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 is achieved. More importantly, a World Health Organization standard drinkable water can be achieved from seawater, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208; and bacteria&#8208;containing water, and even from extremely acidic/alkaline or radioactive water sources. Notably, the concentration of pseudovirus SC2&#8208;P can be decreased by 6 orders of magnitude after evaporation.

         <title>Reliable and Remote Monitoring of Absolute Temperature during Liver Inflammation via Luminescence&#8208;Lifetime&#8208;Based Nanothermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lifetime&#8208;based infrared luminescent nanothermometers are shown to be minimally affected by the effects of biological tissues on the propagation of photons. Real&#8208;time and reliable thermal monitoring of the liver of a mouse subjected to lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced inflammation is achieved through the use of bright Ag2S nanoparticles. Remarkable thermal sensitivity (3% &#176;C&#8211;1 around 37 &#176;C) and thermal resolution (smaller than 0.3 &#176;C) are obtained.








Abstract
Temperature of tissues and organs is one of the first parameters affected by physiological and pathological processes, such as metabolic activity, acute trauma, or infection&#8208;induced inflammation. Therefore, the onset and development of these processes can be detected by monitoring deviations from basal temperature. To accomplish this, minimally invasive, reliable, and accurate measurement of the absolute temperature of internal organs is required. Luminescence nanothermometry is the ideal technology for meeting these requirements.

&lt;p&gt;Lifetime-based infrared luminescent nanothermometers are shown to be minimally affected by the effects of biological tissues on the propagation of photons. Real-time and reliable thermal monitoring of the liver of a mouse subjected to lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation is achieved through the use of bright Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nanoparticles. Remarkable thermal sensitivity (3% &#176;C&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; around 37 &#176;C) and thermal resolution (smaller than 0.3 &#176;C) are obtained.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temperature of tissues and organs is one of the first parameters affected by physiological and pathological processes, such as metabolic activity, acute trauma, or infection-induced inflammation. Therefore, the onset and development of these processes can be detected by monitoring deviations from basal temperature. To accomplish this, minimally invasive, reliable, and accurate measurement of the absolute temperature of internal organs is required. Luminescence nanothermometry is the ideal technology for meeting these requirements. Although this technique has lately undergone remarkable developments, its reliability is being questioned due to spectral distortions caused by biological tissues. In this work, how the use of bright Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nanoparticles featuring temperature-dependent fluorescence lifetime enables reliable and accurate measurement of the absolute temperature of the liver in mice subjected to lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation is demonstrated. Beyond the remarkable thermal sensitivity (&#8776; 3% &#176;C&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; around 37 &#176;C) and thermal resolution obtained (smaller than 0.3 &#176;C), the results included in this work set a blueprint for the development of new diagnostic procedures based on the use of intracorporeal temperature as a physiological indicator.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Honeycomb&#8208;Structure RuI3, A New Quantum Material Related to &#945;&#8208;RuCl3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Honeycomb&#8208;layer&#8208;structure RuI3 is synthesized at moderately high pressures. Preliminary characterization reveals metallic, paramagnetic behavior with no long&#8208;range magnetic order down to 0.35&#160;K, and an unusually large T&#8208;linear contribution to the heat capacity. This RuI3 phase with a layered honeycomb lattice and strong spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupling, may provide a new route for the characterization of quantum materials.








Abstract
The layered honeycomb lattice material &#945;&#8208;RuCl3 has emerged as a prime candidate for displaying the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state, and as such has attracted much research interest. Here a new layered honeycomb lattice polymorph of RuI3, a material that is strongly chemically and structurally related to &#945;&#8208;RuCl3 is described. The material is synthesized at moderately elevated pressures and is stable under ambient conditions. Preliminary characterization reveals that it is a metallic conductor, with the absence of long&#8208;range magnetic order down to 0.35 K and an unusually large T&#8208;linear contribution to the heat capacity. It is proposed that this phase, with a layered honeycomb lattice and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, provides a new route for the characterization of quantum materials.

         <title>Anisotropic Carrier Mobility from 2H WSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic carrier mobility is realized in 2H WSe2. The intrinsic screening layer responds to the electrical anisotropy, which is confirmed by theoretical calculations and experimental results, excluding phonon scattering, impurity ions scattering, and defect scattering. The electrical anisotropy provides a degree of freedom for adjusting the physical properties and is an essential step for exploring and integrating transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) transistors in multi&#8208;terminal artificial synaptic devices.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with 2H phase are expected to be building blocks in next&#8208;generation electronics; however, they suffer from electrical anisotropy, which is the basics for multi&#8208;terminal artificial synaptic devices, digital inverters, and anisotropic memtransistors, which are highly desired in neuromorphic computing. Herein, the anisotropic carrier mobility from 2H WSe2 is reported, where the anisotropic degree of carrier mobility spans from 0.16 to 0.95 for various WSe2 field&#8208;effect transistors under a gate voltage of &#8722;60&#160;V. Phonon scattering, impurity ions scattering, and defect scattering are excluded for anisotropic mobility. An intrinsic screening layer is proposed and confirmed by Z&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging to respond to the electrical anisotropy. Seven types of intrinsic screening layers are created and calculated by density functional theory to evaluate the modulated electronic structures, effective masses, and scattering intensities, resulting in anisotropic mobility. The discovery of anisotropic carrier mobility from 2H WSe2 provides a degree of freedom for adjusting the physical properties of 2H TMDCs and fertile ground for exploring and integrating TMDC electronic transistors with better performance along the direction of high mobility.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Phenolic&#8208;Network&#8208;Coated Dendrimer&#8211;Drug Conjugates for Tumor MR Imaging and Chemo/Chemodynamic Therapy via Amplification of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;network&#8208;coated dendrimer&#8211;drug conjugates are constructed as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) amplification. The generated nanocomplexes can responsively release the ERS drug toyocamycin in the tumor microenvironment, while the coated iron&#8211;tannic acid network can generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals, thus rendering ERS amplification for combined chemo/chemodynamic therapy of tumors under the guidance of magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Amplification of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) to realize enhanced cancer therapy has been considered to be unique in current cancer nanomedicine design. Herein, the design of metal&#8211;phenolic&#8208;network&#8208;coated dendrimer&#8211;drug conjugates as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on ERS amplification is reported. In the design, acetylated generation&#8208;5 poly(amidoamine) dendrimers are conjugated with an ERS drug, toyocamycin (Toy), through the attached phenylboronic acid moiety, and coated with an iron (Fe)&#8211;tannic acid (TF) network. The generated nanocomplexes with a size of 50.2&#160;nm are stable under the physiological environment, and can rapidly release Toy under the tumor microenvironment due to the pH&#8208; and reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species&#8208;responsive boronic ester bonds to effectively inhibit the ERS&#8208;mediated cancer cell adaptation. Meanwhile, the coated TF network enables the nanocomplexes to generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals through a Fenton reaction, amplifying the ERS for improved chemo/chemodynamic therapy of cancer cells in vitro and a xenografted breast tumor model in vivo. Moreover, the coating of TF also renders the complexes with an eminent r1 relaxivity for in vivo T1&#8208;weighted tumor magnetic resonance imaging. The created intelligent nanocomplexes may represent an advanced nanomedicine formulation uniquely integrated with a metal&#8211;phenolic network and dendrimer nanotechnology for imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapy through ERS amplification.

         <title>A Mechanically Interlocking Strategy Based on Conductive Microbridges for Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solderless stretchable interconnections (SLSIs) are developed to realize the assembly of individual soft devices toward multifunctional all&#8208;stretchable integrated platforms. This stretchable interconnection can effectively bridge interlayer conductivity with tight adhesion through regional functionality. SLSIs show promising stretchability up to a strain of 35% (R/R0&#160;&#8804; 5) and can be adopted to achieve an all&#8208;stretchable self&#8208;powered data acquisition platform.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics incorporating critical sensing, data transmission, display and powering functionalities, is crucial to emerging wearable healthcare applications. To date, methods to achieve stretchability of individual functional devices have been extensively investigated. However, integration strategies of these stretchable devices to achieve all&#8208;stretchable systems are still under exploration, in which the reliable stretchable interconnection is a key element. Here, solderless stretchable interconnections based on mechanically interlocking microbridges are developed to realize the assembly of individual stretchable devices onto soft patternable circuits toward multifunctional all&#8208;stretchable platforms. This stretchable interconnection can effectively bridge interlayer conductivity with tight adhesion through both conductive microbridges and selectively distributed adhesive polymer. Consequently, enhanced stretchability up to a strain of 35% (R/R0&#160;&#8804; 5) is shown, compared with conventional solder&#8208;assisted connections which lose electrical conduction at a strain of less than 5% (R/R0&#160;&#8776; 30). As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;powered all&#8208;stretchable data&#8208;acquisition platform is fabricated by surface mounting a stretchable strain sensor and a supercapacitor onto a soft circuit through solderless interconnections. This solderless interconnecting strategy for surface&#8208;mountable devices can be utilized as a valuable technology for the integration of stretchable devices to achieve all&#8208;soft multifunctional systems.

Consequently, enhanced stretchability up to a strain of 35% (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8804; 5) is shown, compared with conventional solder-assisted connections which lose electrical conduction at a strain of less than 5% (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8776; 30). As a proof of concept, a self-powered all-stretchable data-acquisition platform is fabricated by surface mounting a stretchable strain sensor and a supercapacitor onto a soft circuit through solderless interconnections. This solderless interconnecting strategy for surface-mountable devices can be utilized as a valuable technology for the integration of stretchable devices to achieve all-soft multifunctional systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;Lift Micro&#8208;Aerial&#8208;Robot Powered by Low&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Endurance Dielectric Elastomer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;voltage, long&#8208;endurance, and power&#8208;dense dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) based on novel multiple&#8208;layer fabrication methods and electrode&#8208;material optimization is presented. An insect&#8208;scale micro&#8208;aerial&#8208;vehicle (MAV) is designed with this DEA. The robot achieves the best&#8208;performing and longest hovering flight among sub&#8208;gram MAVs. This type of DEA shows promise in making next&#8208;generation agile soft robots.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a special class of artificial muscles that have been used to construct animal&#8208;like soft robotic systems. However, compared with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rigid actuators such as piezoelectric bimorphs and electromagnetic motors, most DEAs require higher driving voltages, and their power density and lifetime remain substantially lower. These limitations pose significant challenges for developing agile and powered autonomous soft robots. Here, a low&#8208;voltage, high&#8208;endurance, and power&#8208;dense DEA based on novel multiple&#8208;layering techniques and electrode&#8208;material optimization, is reported. When operated at 400&#160;Hz, the 143&#160;mg DEA generates forces of 0.36 N and displacements of 1.15&#160;mm. This DEA is incorporated into an aerial robot to demonstrate high performance. The robot achieves a high lift&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio of 3.7, a low hovering voltage of 500&#160;V, and a long lifetime that exceeds 2 million actuation cycles. With 20 s of hovering time, and position and attitude error smaller than 2.5&#160;cm and 2&#176;, respectively, the robot demonstrates the longest and best&#8208;performing flight among existing sub&#8208;gram aerial robots. This important milestone demonstrates that soft robots can outperform their state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rigid counterparts, and it provides an important step toward realizing power autonomy in soft robotic flights.

         <title>Simultaneous Large Optical and Piezoelectric Effects Induced by Domain Reconfiguration Related to Ferroelectric Phase Transitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In domain&#8208;engineered relaxor ferroelectric crystals of Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3&#8211;Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8211;PbTiO3, reversible and repeatable phase transitions from the as&#8208;poled polydomain rhombohedral state to a monodomain monoclinic state can be stimulated by electric field or stress. These transitions lead to bimodal functionality&#8212;variable optical transparency as well as a giant effective piezoelectric effect.








Abstract
Electrical switching of ferroelectric domains and subsequent domain wall motion promotes strong piezoelectric activity, however, light scatters at refractive index discontinuities such as those found at domain wall boundaries. Thus, simultaneously achieving large piezoelectric effect and high optical transmissivity is generally deemed infeasible. Here, it is demonstrated that the ferroelectric domains in perovskite Pb(In1/2Nb1/2)O3&#8211;Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8211;PbTiO3 domain&#8208;engineered crystals can be manipulated by electrical field and mechanical stress to reversibly and repeatably, with small hysteresis, transform the opaque polydomain structure into a highly transparent monodomain state. This control of optical properties can be achieved at very low electric fields (less than 1.5&#160;kV cm&#8722;1) and is accompanied by a large (&gt;10&#160;000 pm V&#8722;1) piezoelectric coefficient that is superior to linear state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials by a factor of three or more. The coexistence of tunable optical transmissivity and high piezoelectricity paves the way for a new class of photonic devices.

         <title>Mixed Dimethylammonium/Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskite Crystals for Improved Structural Stability and Enhanced Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed technique termed solvent acidolysis crystallization (SAC) allows the growth of mixed dimethylammonium/methylammonium lead tribromide crystals with the highest, as of yet, dimethylammonium incorporation of 44% while maintaining the perovskite cubic phase. This mixed cation composition not only suppresses the tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition but also leads to improved photodetection capabilities both at room temperature and 200 K.








Abstract
The solvent acidolysis crystallization technique is utilized to grow mixed dimethylammonium/methylammonium lead tribromide (DMA/MAPbBr3) crystals reaching the highest dimethylammonium incorporation of 44% while maintaining the 3D cubic perovskite phase. These mixed perovskite crystals show suppression of the orthorhombic phase and a lower tetragonal&#8208;to&#8208;cubic phase&#8208;transition temperature compared to MAPbBr3. A distinct behavior is observed in the temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence properties of MAPbBr3 and mixed DMA/MAPbBr3 crystals due to the different organic cation dynamics governing the phase transition(s). Furthermore, lateral photodetectors based on these crystals show that, at room temperature, the mixed crystals possess higher detectivity compared to MAPbBr3 crystals caused by structural compression and reduced surface trap density. Remarkably, the mixed&#8208;crystal devices exhibit large enhancement in their detectivity below the phase&#8208;transition temperature (at 200 K), while for the MAPbBr3 devices only insignificant changes are observed. The high detectivity of the mixed crystals makes them attractive for visible&#8208;light communication and for space applications. The results highlight the importance of the synthetic technique for compositional engineering of halide perovskites that governs their structural and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Tailoring Layer Number of 2D Porphyrin&#8208;Based MOFs Towards Photocoupled Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freestanding monolayer and bilayer 2D porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be easily synthesized via bottom&#8208;up growth. Interestingly, a difference in the atomic layer number results in a distinct catalytic pathway of photocoupled electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The monolayer exhibits a high selectivity of C2 species, while the major products over the bilayer are C1 species. The photocoupled electrocatalytic mechanisms are further studied.








Abstract
Inspired by the success of graphene, a series of single&#8208; or few&#8208;layer 2D materials have been developed and applied in the past decade. Here, the successful preparation of monolayer and bilayer 2D porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by a facile solvothermal method is reported. The structure transition from monolayer to bilayer drives distinct electronic properties and restructuring behaviors, which finally results in distinct catalytic pathways towards CO2 electrocatalysis. The monolayer favors CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 pathway due to the restructuring of Cu&#63743;O4 sites, while CO and HCOO&#8722; are the major products over the bilayer. In photocoupled electrocatalysis, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the C2 compounds shows a nearly fourfold increase on the monolayer than that under dark conditions (FEC2 increases from 11.9% to 41.1% at &#8722;1.4&#160;V). For comparison, the light field plays a negligible effect on the bilayer. The light&#8208;induced selectivity optimization is investigated by experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work opens up a novel possibility to tune the selectivity of carbon products just by tailoring the layer number of the 2D material.

The monolayer favors CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pathway due to the restructuring of Cu&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites, while CO and HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are the major products over the bilayer. In photocoupled electrocatalysis, the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compounds shows a nearly fourfold increase on the monolayer than that under dark conditions (FE&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; increases from 11.9% to 41.1% at &#8722;1.4&#160;V). For comparison, the light field plays a negligible effect on the bilayer. The light-induced selectivity optimization is investigated by experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work opens up a novel possibility to tune the selectivity of carbon products just by tailoring the layer number of the 2D material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Van der Waals Encapsulation by Inorganic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an effective van der Waals passivation method for 2D materials with inorganic molecular crystal Sb2O3 as the encapsulation layer is developed. The scalable encapsulation method, carried out through a complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;compatible manufacturing process, opens unprecedented opportunities for 2D materials to be applied in optoelectronic devices toward chip&#8208;level development.








Abstract
Encapsulation is critical for devices to guarantee their stability and reliability. It becomes an even more essential requirement for devices based on 2D materials with atomic thinness and far inferior stability compared to their bulk counterparts. Here a general van der Waals (vdW) encapsulation method for 2D materials using Sb2O3 layer of inorganic molecular crystal fabricated via thermal evaporation deposition is reported. It is demonstrated that such a scalable encapsulation method not only maintains the intrinsic properties of typical air&#8208;susceptible 2D materials due to their vdW interactions but also remarkably improves their environmental stability. Specifically, the encapsulated black phosphorus (BP) exhibits greatly enhanced structural stability of over 80 days and more sustaining&#8208;electrical properties of 19 days, while the bare BP undergoes degradation within hours. Moreover, the encapsulation layer can be facilely removed by sublimation in vacuum without damaging the underlying materials. This scalable encapsulation method shows a promising pathway to effectively enhance the environmental stability of 2D materials, which may further boost their practical application in novel (opto)electronic devices.

         <title>Guiding Transition Metal&#8208;Doped Hollow Cerium Tandem Nanozymes with Elaborately Regulated Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Activities for Intensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hollow mesoporous Mn/Zr&#8208;co&#8208;doped CeO2 tandem nanozyme is developed, serving as an H2O2 homeostasis disruptor to promote H2O2 evolvement, restrain the off&#8208;target elimination of H2O2, and realize intensive nanozyme&#8208;initiated chemodynamic therapy of tumor. T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging and high&#8208;contrast X&#8208;ray computed tomography imaging are also achieved using the nanozyme for in vivo tracking of the therapeutic process.








Abstract
Clinical applications of nanozyme&#8208;initiated chemodynamic therapy (NCDT) have been severely limited by the poor catalytic efficiency of nanozymes, insufficient endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content, and its off&#8208;target consumption. Herein, the authors&#160;developed a hollow mesoporous Mn/Zr&#8208;co&#8208;doped CeO2 tandem nanozyme (PHMZCO&#8208;AT) with regulated multi&#8208;enzymatic activities, that is, the enhancement of superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activities and inhibition of catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activity. PHMZCO&#8208;AT as a H2O2 homeostasis disruptor promotes H2O2 evolution and restrains off&#8208;target elimination of H2O2 to achieve intensive NCDT. PHMZCO&#8208;AT with SOD&#8208;like activity catalyzes endogenous superoxide anion (O2&#8226;&#8722;) into H2O2 in the tumor region. The suppression of CAT activity and depletion of glutathione by PHMZCO&#8208;AT largely weaken the off&#8208;target decomposition of H2O2 to H2O. Elevated H2O2 is then catalyzed by the downstream POD&#8208;like activity of PHMZCO&#8208;AT to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals, further inducing tumor apoptosis and death. T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging and X&#8208;ray computed tomography imaging are also achieved using PHMZCO&#8208;AT due to the existence of paramagnetic Mn2+ and the high X&#8208;ray attenuation ability of elemental Zr, permitting in vivo tracking of the therapeutic process. This work presents a typical paradigm to achieve intensive NCDT efficacy by regulating multi&#8208;enzymatic activities of nanozymes to perturb the H2O2 homeostasis.

         <title>Achieving Efficient NIR&#8208;II Type&#8208;I Photosensitizers for Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy upon Regulating Chalcogen Elements</title>

         <dc:description>
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window semiconducting polymers (SPs) for type&#8208;I photodynamic therapy (PDT) through generating O2&#8226;&#8722; for hypoxic oncotherapy have not previously been reported. Upon tuning of chalcogen elements, the first type&#8208;I PDT NIR&#8208;II SPs are achieved due to narrowed &#916;EST and enlarged spin&#8211;orbit coupling constant.

Abstract
Second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window type&#8208;I photosensitizers have intrinsic advantages in photodynamic/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT) of some malignant tumors with deep infiltration, large size, complicated location, and low possibility of surgery/radiotherapy. Herein, three chalcogen&#8208;element&#8208;based donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type semiconducting polymers (poly[2,2&#8243;&#8208;((E)&#8208;4,4&#8243;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;[6,6&#8243;&#8208;bithieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrolylidene]&#8208;5,5&#8243;(4H,4&#8243;H)&#8208;dione)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,5&#8208;(thiophene)] (PTS), poly[2,2&#8243;&#8208;((E)&#8208;4,4&#8243;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;[6,6&#8243;&#8208;bithieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrolylidene]&#8208;5,5&#8243;(4H,4&#8243;H)&#8208;dione)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,5&#8208;(selenophene)] (PTSe), and poly[2,2&#8243;&#8208;((E)&#8208;4,4&#8243;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;[6,6&#8243;&#8208;bithieno[3,2&#8208;b]pyrrolylidene]&#8208;5,5&#8243;(4H,4&#8242;H)&#8208;dione)&#8208;alt&#8208;2,5&#8208;(tellurophene)] (PTTe)) are synthesized and fully characterized, demonstrating strong absorption in the NIR&#8208;II region. Upon adjusting the chalcogen elements, the intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer characteristics and the heavy&#8208;atom effect are tuned to enhance the intersystem crossing rate, improving the photodynamic effect. Moreover, the energy levels and Gibbs free energies are tuned to facilitate the type&#8208;I photodynamic process. As a result, PTTe nanoparticles (NPs) produce superoxide anion radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) more efficiently and demonstrate higher photothermal conversion efficiency than PTS and PTSe NPs upon NIR&#8208;II (1064&#160;nm) laser irradiation, exhibiting unprecedented NIR&#8208;II type&#8208;I PDT/PTT performance in vitro and in vivo. This work provides ideas for achieving high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II type&#8208;I PDT/PTT semiconducting polymers for hypoxic oncotherapy.

         <title>Capillary&#8208;Confinement Crystallization for Monolayer Molecular Crystal Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general solution procedure named the &#8220;soft&#8208;template&#8208;assisted&#8208;assembly method&#8221; is developed to prepare centimeter&#8208;scale monolayer molecular crystal (MMC) arrays with precise regulation over their size and location. The MMC&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors show extraordinary uniformity with the lowest coefficient of variation on record (4.4%). The direct observation and fluent simulations of the formation of MMCs show that the crystallization process is confined via capillary.








Abstract
Organic single&#8208;crystalline semiconductors are highly desired for the fabrication of integrated electronic circuits, yet their uniform growth and efficient patterning is a huge challenge. Here, a general solution procedure named the &#8220;soft&#8208;template&#8208;assisted&#8208;assembly method&#8221; is developed to prepare centimeter&#8208;scale monolayer molecular crystal (MMC) arrays with precise regulation over their size and location via a capillary&#8208;confinement crystallization process. It is remarkable that the field&#8208;effect mobility of the array is highly uniform, with variation less than 4.4%, which demonstrates the most uniform organic single&#8208;crystal arrays ever reported so far. Simulations based on fluid dynamics are carried out to understand the function mechanism of this method. Thanks to the ultrasmooth crystalline orientation surface of MMCs, high&#8208;quality p&#8211;n heterojunction arrays can be prepared by weak epitaxy growth of n&#8208;type material atop the MMC. The p&#8211;n heterojunction field&#8208;effect transistors show ambipolar characteristics and the corresponding inverters constructed by these heterojunctions exhibit a competitive gain of 155. This work provides a general strategy to realize the preparation and application of logic complementary circuits based on patterned organic single crystals.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Selectivity and &#8220;Order&#8208;in&#8208;Disorder&#8221; Engineering in Carbon for Durable and Fast Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ defect&#8208;selectivity and &#8220;order&#8208;in&#8208;disorder&#8221; synergetic engineering in carbon materials via a self&#8208;template approach is developed to boost the K+&#8208;storage capacity, rate capability, and long&#8208;term cyclic stability simultaneously. In situ/ex situ characteristics and density functional theory (DFT) calculation demonstrate that carbon&#8208;vacancies possess higher reversibility and faster ion/electron migration kinetics than heteroatom&#8208;defects.








Abstract
Defect&#8208;rich carbon materials possess high gravimetric potassium storage capability due to the abundance of active sites, but their cyclic stability is limited because of the low reversibility of undesirable defects and the deteriorative conductivity. Herein, in situ defect&#8208;selectivity and order&#8208;in&#8208;disorder synergetic engineering in carbon via a self&#8208;template strategy is reported to boost the K+&#8208;storage capacity, rate capability and cyclic stability simultaneously. The defect&#8208;sites are selectively tuned to realize abundant reversible carbon&#8208;vacancies with the sacrifice of poorly reversible heteroatom&#8208;defects through the persistent gas release during pyrolysis. Meanwhile, nanobubbles generated during the pyrolysis serve as self&#8208;templates to induce the surface atom rearrangement, thus in situ embedding nanographitic networks in the defective domains without serious phase separation, which greatly enhances the intrinsic conductivity. The synergetic structure ensures high concentration of reversible carbon&#8208;vacancies and fast charge&#8208;transfer kinetics simultaneously, leading to high reversible capacity (425 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1), high&#8208;rate (237.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1), and superior cyclic stability (90.4% capacity retention from cycle 10 to 400 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a rational and facile strategy to realize the tradeoff between defect&#8208;sites and intrinsic conductivity, and gives deep insights into the mechanism of reversible potassium storage.

         <title>A ROS&#8208;Sensitive Nanozyme&#8208;Augmented Photoacoustic Nanoprobe for Early Diagnosis and Therapy of Acute Liver Failure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive nanozyme&#8208;augmented photoacoustic nanoprobe is developed for early diagnosis and therapy of acute liver failure (ALF). Deep&#8208;tissue detection of ROS in early ALF is achieved by the nanoprobe due to the synergy between nanocatalytic bubble generation and thermoelastic expansion. Meanwhile, nanozymes released from the nanoprobe can catalyze ROS into O2, allowing highly efficient therapy of ALF.








Abstract
Early diagnosis of acute liver failure (ALF) is critical for curable treatment of patients, because most existing ALF therapies have narrow therapeutic time windows after disease onset. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which lead to the sequential occurrences of hepatocyte necrosis and the leakage of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), represent early biomarkers of ALF. Photoacoustic imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for in vivo imaging of ROS. However, high&#8208;performance imaging probes that can boost the photoacoustic signals of the short&#8208;lived ROS of ALF are yet to be developed, and there remains a great challenge for ROS&#8208;based imaging of ALF. Herein, a ROS&#8208;sensitive nanozyme&#8208;augmented photoacoustic nanoprobe for successful in vivo imaging of ALF is presented. The deep&#8208;penetrating photoacoustic signals of the nanoprobe can be activated by the overexpressed ROS in ALF due to the synergy between nanocatalytic bubbles generation and thermoelastic expansion. Impressively, the nanozyme&#8208;augmented ROS imaging enables earlier diagnosis of ALF than the clinical ALT method, and the ROS&#8208;activated catalytic activity of nanoprobe permits timely nanocatalytic therapy of ALF.

         <title>Microstructurally Tailored Thin &#946;&#8208;Ag2Se Films toward Commercial Flexible Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag can be quickly and directly converted into &#946;&#8208;Ag2Se at room temperature in aqueous solution. The fabricated flexible thin films show power factor and figure of merit (zT) values as high as 2590&#160;&#177; 414 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 and 1.2&#160;&#177; 0.42, respectively. At &#8710;T&#160;= 30 K, a 4&#8208;leg flexible thermoelectric power generator shows high maximum output power density of 27.6&#160;&#177; 1.95 W m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Aiming to overcome both the structural and commercial limitations of flexible thermoelectric power generators, an efficient room&#8208;temperature aqueous selenization reaction that can be completed in air within less than 1&#160;min, to directly fabricate thin &#946;&#8208;Ag2Se films consisting of perfectly crystalline and large columnar grains with both in&#8208;plane randomness and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane [201] preferred orientation, is designed. A high power factor (PF) of 2590&#160;&#177; 414 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 and a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (zT) of 1.2&#160;&#177; 0.42 are obtained from a sample with a thickness of &#8776;1&#160;&#181;m. The maximum output power density of the best 4&#8208;leg thermoelectric generator sample reach 27.6&#160;&#177; 1.95 and 124&#160;&#177; 8.78 W m&#8722;2 at room temperature with 30 and 60 K temperature differences, respectively, which may be useful in future flexible thermoelectric devices.

         <title>Kinetics Manipulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Thick Ternary Organic Solar Cells via R2R&#8208;Compatible Slot&#8208;Die Coating</title>

         <dc:description>
Highly efficient, thick ternary organic solar cells are fabricated by roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R)&#8208;compatible slot&#8208;die coating via kinetics manipulation. A highly crystalline molecule, BTR&#8208;Cl, is incorporated, and the phase&#8208;separation kinetics of the D18:Y6 film is regulated. The molecular crystallinity and vertical phase separation of the ternary blends is improved, which results in high power conversion efficiencies of 17.2% and 15.5% for photoactive films with thicknesses of 110 and 300 nm, respectively.








Abstract
Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has crossed the 18% mark for OSCs, which are largely fabricated by spin&#8208;coating, and the optimal photoactive thickness is limited to 100&#160;nm. To increase reproducibility of results with industrial roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing, slot&#8208;die coating coupled with a ternary strategy for optimal performance of large&#8208;area, thick OSCs is used. Based on miscibility differences, a highly crystalline molecule, BTR&#8208;Cl, is incorporated, and the phase&#8208;separation kinetics of the D18:Y6 film is regulated. BTR&#8208;Cl provides an early liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and early aggregation of Y6, which slightly improves the molecular crystallinity and vertical phase separation of the ternary blends, resulting in high PCEs of 17.2% and 15.5% for photoactive films with thicknesses of 110 and 300&#160;nm, respectively. The ternary design strategy for large&#8208;area and thick films is further used to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency flexible devices, which promises reproducibility of the lab results from slot&#8208;die coating to industrial R2R manufacturing.

&lt;p&gt;Highly efficient, thick ternary organic solar cells are fabricated by roll-to-roll (R2R)-compatible slot-die coating via kinetics manipulation. A highly crystalline molecule, BTR-Cl, is incorporated, and the phase-separation kinetics of the D18:Y6 film is regulated. The molecular crystallinity and vertical phase separation of the ternary blends is improved, which results in high power conversion efficiencies of 17.2% and 15.5% for photoactive films with thicknesses of 110 and 300 nm, respectively.

         <title>Inorganic&#8208;Cation Pseudohalide 2D Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2 Perovskite Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2, an all&#8208;inorganic pseudo&#8208;halide 2D phase perovskite single crystal, is grown by an antisolvent vapor&#8208;assisted crystallization method at room temperature. It exhibits a reversible first&#8208;order phase transformation to CsPbBr3 at 450 K. Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2 has a low exciton binding energy (160 meV). The demonstrated photodetector produces respectable responsivity (8.46 mA W&#8722;1) and detectivity (1.2 &#215; 1010 Jones) at 0.5 V.








Abstract
Most of the reported 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) lead halide perovskites with the general formula of An+1BnX3n+1 (n&#160;= 1, 2, &#8230;) comprise layered perovskites separated by A&#8208;site&#8208;substituted organic spacers. To date, only a small number of X&#8208;site&#8208;substituted RP perovskites have been reported. Herein, the first inorganic&#8208;cation pseudohalide 2D phase perovskite single crystal, Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2, is reported. It is synthesized by the antisolvent vapor&#8208;assisted crystallization (AVC) method at room temperature. It exhibits a standard single&#8208;layer (n&#160;= 1) Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper structure described in space group of Pmmn (#59) and has a small separation (d&#160;= 1.69 &#197;) between the perovskite layers. The SCN&#8722; anions are found to bend the 2D Pb(SCN)2Br2 framework slightly into a kite&#8208;shaped octahedron, limiting the formation of a quasi&#8208;2D perovskite structure (n&#160;&gt; 1).&#160;This 2D single crystal exhibits a reversible first&#8208;order phase transformation to 3D CsPbBr3 (Pm3m #221) at 450 K. It has a low exciton binding energy of 160 meV&#8212;one of the lowest for 2D perovskites (n&#160;= 1). A Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2&#8208;single&#8208;crystal photodetector is demonstrated with respectable responsivity of 8.46&#160;mA W&#8722;1 and detectivity of &#8776;1.2 &#215; 1010 Jones at a low bias voltage of 0.5&#160;V.

         <title>An NIR Discrete Metallacycle Constructed from Perylene Bisimide and Tetraphenylethylene Fluorophores for Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Radio&#8208;Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic metallacycle (M) is developed for imaging&#8208;guided cancer radio&#8208;chemotherapy using perylene bisimide fluorophore (PPy) and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based di&#8208;Pt(II) organometallic precursor (TPE&#8208;Pt) as building blocks. Guided by in vivo fluorescence imaging, radio&#8208;chemotherapy is precisely carried out, which facilitates boosting the therapeutic outcomes and minimizing undesired side effects.








Abstract
To promote the clinical theranostic performances of platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs, imaging capability is urgently desired, and their chemotherapeutic efficacy needs to be upgraded. Herein, a theranostic metallacycle (M) is developed for imaging&#8208;guided cancer radio&#8208;chemotherapy using perylene bisimide fluorophore (PPy) and tetraphenylethylene&#8208;based di&#8208;Pt(II) organometallic precursor (TPE&#8208;Pt) as building blocks. The formation of this discrete supramolecular coordination complex facilitates the encapsulation of M by a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive amphiphilic block copolymer to prepare M&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (MNPs). TPE&#8208;Pt acts as a chemotherapeutic drug and also an excellent radiosensitizer, thus incorporating radiotherapy into the nanomedicine to accelerate the therapeutic efficacy and overcome drug resistance. The NIR&#8208;emission of PPy is employed to detect the intracellular delivery and tissue distribution of MNPs in real time. In vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate the excellent anticancer efficacy combining chemotherapy and radiotherapy; the administration of this nanomedicine effectively inhibits the tumor growth and greatly extends the survival rate of cisplatin&#8208;resistant A2780CIS&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Guided by in vivo fluorescence imaging, radio&#8208;chemotherapy is precisely carried out, which facilitates boosting of the therapeutic outcomes and minimizing undesired side effects. The success of this theranostic system brings new hope to supramolecular nanomedicines for their potential clinical translations.

Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries
In article number 2105855, Pengcheng Liu, David Mitlin, and co&#8208;workers report a multifunctional separator for potassium&#8208;metal batteries. The cover depicts two foxes playfully hopping across an ancient arctic river while carrying glowing ions in their mouths. The potassiphilic aluminum fluoride crystals, which are the key functional aspect of the separator, are the crystallographic ice sheets regularly arranged on the surface. The frigid water beneath represents the electrolyte. In the background are frozen mountains, which are the potassium&#8208;metal dendrites that would form without the functional separator.

2D Perovskites
Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2, an inorganic&#8208;cation pseudo&#8208;halide 2D phase perovskite single crystal, is grown by a simple antisolvent vapor&#8208;assisted crystallization method, as reported by Chu&#8208;Chen Chueh, Anita W. Y. Ho&#8208;Baillie, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2104782. Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2 exhibits a reversible first&#8208;order phase transformation to CsPbBr2 at 450 K and has a low exciton binding energy amongst the 2D perovskites. Demonstration for photodetector application shows respectable responsivity and detectivity.

Graphene Biosensors
In article 2106666, Xiaoyan Zhang, Gr&#233;gory F. Schneider, Wangyang Fu, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate graphene biosensors operating at ultrahigh frequencies, where the conductivity of high&#8208;salt solutions and thus the ionic screening is fully cancelled. Dielectric&#8208;modulated detection of the binding of streptavidin molecules to biotin molecules that are noncovalently anchored on the graphene surface is demonstrated using the developed graphene biosensors.

Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries
Defect&#8208;rich carbon materials possess high gravimetric potassium storage capability, but their cyclic stability is limited because of the low reversibility of undesirable defects and their deteriorative conductivity. In article number 2108621, Zhicheng Ju, Shenglin Xiong, and co&#8208;workers propose an in situ defect&#8208;selectivity and order&#8208;in&#8208;disorder synergetic engineering in carbon materials via a self&#8208;template strategy to boost the K+&#8208;storage capacity, rate capability, and cyclic stability simultaneously.

2D Materials
Van der Waals (vdW) encapsulation is one of the most promising approaches to improve the stability and reliability of 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based devices. So far, a scalable vdW encapsulation approach through complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible processes still remains elusive. In article number 2106041, Kailang Liu, Tianyou Zhai, and co&#8208;workers present a scalable vdW encapsulation method based on inorganic molecular crystals, through which the ambient stability of a series of 2D materials is significantly improved by tens of times.

Soft Robots
The muscle&#8208;like dielectric elastomer actuators developed by Yufeng Chen and co&#8208;workers in article number 2106757 lead to insect&#8208;scale flapping&#8208;wing aerial soft robots that resemble the size, weight, and performance of honeybees in nature. The actuators consist of soft elastomers and carbon nanotube electrodes, and they are made through novel fabrication methods to significantly reduce operating voltage and improve lifetime.

Water Purification
In article number 2107400, Suojiang Zhang, Dan Wang, and co&#8208;workers report an ultrastable amorphous Ta2O5/C nanocomposite with a hollow multishelled structure for solar evaporation, which results in highly efficient photoabsorption, photothermal conversion, and promoted water transport. Thus, a superfast evaporation speed of 4.02 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 is achieved. Importantly, the ion concentration meets the World Health Organization's drinking&#8208;water standard after purification, even under extreme conditions.

         <title>Tin&#8208;Based Anode Materials for Stable Sodium Storage: Progress and Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are now intensively studied to complement lithium&#8208;ion batteries in energy&#8208;storage markets. Recent advances in various high&#8208;capacity Sn&#8208;based anode materials for SIBs are summarized, with an emphasis on the reaction mechanisms, and the multiphase and multiscale structural optimizations for stable sodium storage. Cathode materials and electrolyte are also discussed from the perspective of full&#8208;cell construction.








Abstract
Because of concerns regarding shortages of lithium resources and the urgent need to develop low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency energy&#8208;storage systems, research and applications of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have re&#8208;emerged in recent years. Herein, recent advances in high&#8208;capacity Sn&#8208;based anode materials for stable SIBs are highlighted, including tin (Sn) alloys, Sn oxides, Sn sulfides, Sn selenides, Sn phosphides, and their composites. The reaction mechanisms between Sn&#8208;based materials and sodium are clarified. Multiphase and multiscale structural optimizations of Sn&#8208;based materials to achieve good sodium&#8208;storage performance are emphasized. Full&#8208;cell designs using Sn&#8208;based materials as anodes and further development of Sn&#8208;based materials are discussed from a commercialization perspective. Insights into the preparation of future high&#8208;performance Sn&#8208;based anode materials and the construction of sodium&#8208;ion full batteries with a high energy density and long service life are provided.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Carrier Transport in Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic understanding of 2D perovskite's carrier transport mechanism is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The recent advances on the carrier behavior of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper PSCs from the view of crystal structure, grain orientation, quantum&#8208;well width distribution, and device structure are summarized, and guidelines for successfully elevating carrier transports are provided.








Abstract
In recent years, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (2DRP) perovskite materials have been explored as emerging semiconductor materials in solar cells owing to their excellent stability and structural diversity. Although 2DRP perovskites have achieved photovoltaic efficiencies exceeding 19%, their widespread use is hindered by their inferior charge&#8208;carrier transport properties in the presence of diverse organic spacer cations, compared to that of traditional 3D perovskites. Hence, a systematic understanding of the carrier transport mechanism in 2D perovskites is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, the recent advances in the carrier behavior of 2DRP PSCs are summarized, and guidelines for successfully enhancing carrier transport are provided. First, the composition and crystal structure of 2DRP perovskite materials that affect carrier transport are discussed. Then, the features of 2DRP perovskite films (phase separation, grain orientation, crystallinity kinetics, etc.), which are closely related to carrier transport, are evaluated. Next, the principal direction of carrier transport guiding the selection of the transport layer is revealed. Finally, an outlook is proposed and strategies for enhancing carrier transport in high&#8208;performance PSCs are rationalized.

         <title>Material Evolution with Nanotechnology, Nanoarchitectonics, and Materials Informatics: What will be the Next Paradigm Shift in Nanoporous Materials?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 7, February 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of functional materials has several complicated aspects. To accelerate material discovery, three key concepts, nanotechnology as a game changer, nanoarchitectonics as an integrator, and materials informatics as a super&#8208;accelerator, are discussed, starting from conceptual viewpoints and summing up with exemplifying recent developments, as the best integrated strategy for the development of functional materials, with a particular emphasis on nanoporous materials.








Abstract
Materials science and chemistry have played a central and significant role in advancing society. With the shift toward sustainable living, it is anticipated that the development of functional materials will continue to be vital for sustaining life on our&#160;planet. In the recent decades, rapid progress has been made in materials science and chemistry owing to the advances in experimental, analytical, and computational methods, thereby producing several novel and useful materials. However, most problems in material development are highly complex. Here, the best strategy for the development of functional materials via the implementation of three key concepts is discussed: nanotechnology as a game changer, nanoarchitectonics as an integrator, and materials informatics as a super&#8208;accelerator. Discussions from conceptual viewpoints and example recent developments, chiefly focused on nanoporous materials, are presented. It is anticipated that coupling these three strategies together will open advanced routes for the swift design and exploratory search of functional materials truly useful for solving real&#8208;world problems. These novel strategies will result in the evolution of nanoporous functional materials.

The nanoparticle&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery method is developed and advanced as the new gene&#8208;delivery system for plants, realizing transient/stable transformation, obtaining transgenic food, and resisting to plant abiotic/biotic stresses.








Abstract
Plant genetic engineering is essential for improving crop yield, quality, and resistance to abiotic/biotic stresses for sustainable agriculture. Agrobacterium&#8208;, biolistic bombardment&#8208;, electroporation&#8208;, and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;mediated genetic&#8208;transformation systems are extensively used in plant genetic engineering. However, these systems have limitations, including species dependency, destruction of plant tissues, low transformation efficiency, and high cost. Recently, nanotechnology&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery methods have been developed for plant genetic transformation. This nanostrategy shows excellent transformation efficiency, good biocompatibility, adequate protection of exogenous nucleic acids, and the potential for plant regeneration. However, the nanomaterial&#8208;mediated gene&#8208;delivery system in plants is still in its infancy, and there are many challenges for its broad applications. Herein, the conventional genetic transformation techniques used in plants are briefly discussed. After that, the progress in the development of nanomaterial&#8208;based gene&#8208;delivery systems is considered. CRISPR&#8208;Cas&#8208;mediated genome editing and its combined applications with plant nanotechnology are also discussed. The conceptual innovations, methods, and practical applications of nanomaterial&#8208;mediated genetic transformation summarized herein will be beneficial for promoting plant genetic engineering in modern agriculture.

         <title>Intracellular mechanical drugs induce cell cycle altering and cell death</title>

Abstract
Current advances in materials science have demonstrated that extracellular mechanical cues can define cell function and cell fate. However, a fundamental understanding of the manner in which intracellular mechanical cues affect cell mechanics remain elusive. We here describe how intracellular mechanical hindrance, reinforcement and supports interfere with the cell cycle and promote cell death. Reproducible devices with highly controlled size, shape and with a broad range of stiffness were internalized in HeLa cells. Once inside, they induced characteristic cell cycle deviations and promoted cell death. Device shape and stiffness were the dominant determinants of mechanical impairment. Device structural support to the cell membrane and centring during mitosis maximized their effects, preventing spindle centring and correct chromosome alignment. Nanodevices reveal that the spindle generated forces larger than 114 nN which overcome intracellular confinement by relocating the device to a less damaging position. By using intracellular mechanical drugs, this work provides a foundation to defining the role of intracellular constrains on cell function and fate, with relevance to fundamental cell mechanics and nanomedicine.

         <title>Nanoengineered neutrophils as cellular sonosensitizer for visual sonodynamic therapy of malignant tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The rapid evolution of cell&#8208;based theranostics has attracted extensive attention due to their unique advantages in biomedical applications. However, only the inherent functions of cells cannot meet the needs of malignant tumor treatment. Thus endowing original cells with new characteristics to generate multifunctional living cells may hold a tremendous promise. Here, for the first time, we used the nanoengineering method to combine customized liposomes with neutrophils, generating oxygen&#8208;carrying sonosensitizer cells with acoustic functions, which we called Acouscyte/O2, for the visual diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Specifically, oxygen&#8208;carried perfluorocarbon and temoporfin were encapsulated into cRGD peptide modified multilayer liposomes (C&#8208;ML/HPT/O2), which were then loaded into live neutrophils to obtain Acouscyte/O2. Acouscyte/O2 could not only carry a large amount of oxygen but also exhibit the ability of long circulation, inflammation triggered recruitment and decomposition. Importantly, Acouscyte/O2 could be selectively accumulated in tumors, effectively enhanced tumor oxygen levels, and triggered anticancer sonodynamics in response to ultrasound stimulation, leading to completely obliterating tumors and efficiently extending survival time of tumor&#8208;bearing mice with minimal systemic adverse effects. Meanwhile, the tumors could be real&#8208;time monitored by temoporfin&#8208;mediated fluorescence imaging and PFC&#8208;microbubble enhanced ultrasound imaging. Therefore, the nanoengineered neutrophils, i.e., Acouscyte/O2, were a new type of multifunctional cellular drug, which provides a new platform for the diagnosis and sonodynamic therapy of solid malignant tumors.

Abstract
Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental process for neuronal communication and is involved in neurodegeneration. This process has been recently exploited to inspire the design of the next&#8208;generation bioelectronic platforms. Here, neuromorphic devices have emerged as ideal candidates in mimicking brain functionalities, thanks to their ionic&#8208;to&#8208;electronic signal transduction, biocompatibility and their ability to display short and long&#8208;term memory as biological synapses. However, these devices still fail in bridging the gap between electronics and biological systems due to the lack of biomimetic features. Here, we implement a biomembrane&#8208;based OECT and investigate the SLB&#8208;mediated short&#8208;term depression of the device. After morphological and electrical characterization of the lipid bilayer, its ionic barrier behavior is exploited to enhance the neuromorphic operation of the OECT. Such biomimetic neuromorphic device paves the way towards the implementation of synapses&#8208;resembling in vitro platforms to investigate and characterize neurodegenerative processes involving synaptic plasticity loss.

         <title>Phase&#8208;change enabled, rapid, high&#8208;resolution direct ink writing of soft silicone</title>

Abstract
Soft silicone is an ideal flexible material for application, e.g., in soft robotics, flexible electronics, bionics, or implantable biomedical devices. However, gravity&#8208;driven sagging, filament stretching and deformation can cause inevitable defects during rapid manufacturing, making it hard to obtain complex, high&#8208;resolution 3D silicone structures with direct ink writing (DIW) technology. Here, we present rapid DIW of soft silicone enabled by a phase&#8208;change&#8208;induced, reversible change of the ink's hierarchical microstructure. During printing, the silicone&#8208;based ink containing silica nanoparticles and wax microparticles is extruded from a heated nozzle into a cold environment under controlled stress. The wax phase change (solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid) during printing rapidly destroys and rebuilds the particle networks, realizing fast control of ink flow behavior and printability. This high operating temperature&#8208;direct ink writing (HOT&#8208;DIW) method is fast (maximum speed &#8776;3100&#160;mm min&#8211;1) and extends the DIW scale range of soft silicone. Extruded filaments have small diameters (50&#160;&#177; 5&#160;&#956;m), allow for large spans (&#8776;13&#8208;fold filament diameter) and high aspect ratios (&#8776;1), setting a new benchmark in the DIW of soft silicone. Printed silicone structures exhibit excellent performance as flexible sensors, superhydrophobic surfaces, and shape memory bionic devices, illustrating the potential of the new 3D printing strategy.

         <title>Stable and Solution Processable Cumulenic sp&#8208;Carbon Wires: A New Paradigm for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed, large&#8208;area, and flexible electronics largely relies on the excellent electronic properties of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon molecules, either in the form of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and polymers or graphene and carbon nanotubes. Carbon with sp&#8208;hybridization, the foundation of the elusive allotrope carbyne, offers vast opportunities for functionalized molecules in the form of linear carbon atomic wires (CAWs), with intriguing and even superior predicted electronic properties. While CAWs represent a vibrant field of research, to date they have only been applied sparingly to molecular devices. The recent observation of the field&#8208;effect in microcrystalline cumulenes suggests their potential applications in solution&#8208;processed thin film transistors but concerns surrounding the stability and electronic performance have precluded developments in this direction. In the present study, we demonstrate ideal field&#8208;effect characteristics for solution&#8208;processed thin films of tetraphenyl[3]cumulene, the shortest semiconducting CAW. Films are deposited through a scalable, large&#8208;area, meniscus&#8208;coating technique, providing transistors with hole mobilities in excess of 0.1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, as well as promising operational stability under dark conditions. These results offer a solid foundation for the exploitation of a vast class of molecular semiconductors for organic electronics based on sp&#8208;hybridized carbon systems and create a previously unexplored paradigm.

Carbon with &lt;i&gt;sp-&lt;/i&gt;hybridization, the foundation of the elusive allotrope carbyne, offers vast opportunities for functionalized molecules in the form of linear carbon atomic wires (CAWs), with intriguing and even superior predicted electronic properties. While CAWs represent a vibrant field of research, to date they have only been applied sparingly to molecular devices. The recent observation of the field-effect in microcrystalline cumulenes suggests their potential applications in solution-processed thin film transistors but concerns surrounding the stability and electronic performance have precluded developments in this direction. In the present study, we demonstrate ideal field-effect characteristics for solution-processed thin films of tetraphenyl[3]cumulene, the shortest semiconducting CAW. Films are deposited through a scalable, large-area, meniscus-coating technique, providing transistors with hole mobilities in excess of 0.1&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as promising operational stability under dark conditions. These results offer a solid foundation for the exploitation of a vast class of molecular semiconductors for organic electronics based on &lt;i&gt;sp-&lt;/i&gt;hybridized carbon systems and create a previously unexplored paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Gradient Doping in Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskites by Barium Ions for Efficient Single&#8208;junction and Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Narrow bandgap tin&#8208;lead (NBG Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites generally have a high density of unintentional p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping, which reduces the charge carrier lifetimes, diffusion lengths and device efficiencies. Here, we demonstrate a p&#8208;n homojunction across the Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite resulted from a gradient doping by Ba2+. We report that 0.1 mol% Ba2+ can effectively compensate the p&#8208;doping of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites or even turns it to n&#8208;type without changing its bandgap. Ba2+ cations are found to stay at the interstitial sites and work as shallow electron donor. In addition, Ba2+ cations show a unique heterogeneous distribution in perovskite film. Most of the barium ions stay in the top 600 nanometer region of the perovskite films and turn it into weakly n&#8208;type, while the bottom portion of the film remains to be p&#8208;type. The gradient doping forms of a homojunction from top to bottom of the perovskite films with a built&#8208;in field that facilitates extraction of photogenerated carriers, resulting an increased carrier extraction length. This strategy enhanced the efficiency of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite single&#8208;junction solar cells to over 21.0% and boosted the efficiencies of monolithic perovskite&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells to 25.3% and 24.1%, for active areas of 5.9 mm2 and 0.94 cm2, respectively.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Microsized Si Anodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Insights into the Polymer Configuration Conversion Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microsized silicon particles are desirable Si anodes because of their low price and abundant sources. However, it is challenging to achieve stable electrochemical performances using traditional microsized silicon (&#956;Si) anode due to poor conductivity, serious volume expansion, and unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, a composite microsized Si anode was designed and synthesized by constructing a unique polymer, i.e., poly(hexaazatrinaphthalene) (PHATN), on the Si/C surface (PCSi). The Li+ transport mechanism of the PCSi was elucidated by using in&#8208;situ characterization techniques and theoretical simulation. Notably, during the lithiation of the PCSi anode, &#8208;C = N&#8208; groups with high electron density in the PHATN first coordinate Li+ to form &#8208;C&#8208;N&#8208;Li bonds on both sides of the PHATN molecule plane. Consequently, the original benzene rings in the PHATN become active centers to accept lithium and form stable Li&#8208;rich PHATN coatings. PHATN molecules expand due to the change of molecular configuration during the consecutive lithiation process, which provides controllable space for the subsequent volume expansion of the Si particles. Therefore, the PCSi composite anode remained a specific capacity of 1129.6 mAh g&#8211;1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8211;1, and also exhibited compelling rate performance, maintaining a specific capacity of 417.9 mAh g&#8211;1 at 16.5 A g&#8211;1. This work provides an effective strategy for the secondary utilization of silicon slag to design and synthesize high&#8208;performance and more desirable microsized silicon anodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Soft Actuators Made of Discrete Grains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent work has demonstrated the potential of actuators consisting of bulk elastomers with phase&#8208;changing inclusions for generating high forces and large volumetric expansions. Simultaneously, granular assemblies have been shown to enable tunable properties via different packings, dynamic moduli via jamming, and compatibility with various printing methods via suspension in carrier fluids. Herein, we introduce granular actuators, a new class of soft actuators made of discrete grains. The soft grains consist of a hyperelastic shell and multiple solvent cores. Upon heating, the encapsulated solvent cores undergo liquid&#8208;to&#8208;gas phase change, inducing rapid and strong volumetric expansion of the hyperelastic shell up to 700%. The grains can be used independently for micro&#8208;actuation, or in granular agglomerates for meso&#8208; and macro&#8208;scale actuation, demonstrating the scalability of granular actuators. Furthermore, the active grains can be suspended in a carrier resin or solvent to enable printable soft actuators via established granular material processing techniques. By combining the advantages of phase&#8208;change soft actuation and granularity, we present the opportunity to realize soft actuators with tunable bulk properties, compatibility with self&#8208;assembly techniques, and on&#8208;demand reconfigurability.

         <title>A Transformable Amphiphilic and Block Polymer&#8208;Dendron Conjugate for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Retention with Cellular Homeostasis Perturbation via Membrane Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Efficient penetration and retention of therapeutic agents in tumor tissues can be realized through rational design of drug delivery systems. Herein, we present a polymer&#8208;dendron conjugate, POEGMA&#8208;b&#8208;p(GFLG&#8208;Dendron&#8208;Ppa) (GFLG&#8208;DP), which allows cathepsin B (CTSB)&#8208;triggered stealthy&#8208;to&#8208;sticky structural transformation. The compositions and ratios were optimized through dissipative particle dynamics simulations. GFLG&#8208;DP displayed tumor&#8208;specific transformation and consequently released dendron&#8208;Ppa was found to effectively accumulate on the tumor cell membrane. The interaction between dendron&#8208;Ppa and the tumor cell membrane resulted in intracellular and intercellular transport via membrane flow, thus achieving efficient deep penetration and prolonged retention of therapeutic agents in solid tumor tissues. Meanwhile, the interaction of dendron&#8208;Ppa with endoplasmic reticulum disrupted the cell homeostasis, making tumor cells more vulnerable and susceptible to the photodynamic therapy. This platform represents a versatile approach to augmenting the tumor therapeutic efficacy of a nanomedicine via manipulation of its interactions with tumor membrane systems.

         <title>Ultrafast sub&#8208;100 fs all&#8208;optical modulation and efficient third&#8208;harmonic generation in Weyl semimetal niobium phosphide thin films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Since their experimental discovery in 2015, Weyl semimetals generated a large amount of attention due their intriguing physical properties that arise from their linear electron dispersion relation and topological surface states. In particular in the field of nonlinear (NL) optics and light harvesting, Weyl semimetals have shown outstanding performances and achieved record NL conversion coefficients. In this context, we perform first steps towards Weyl semimetal nanophotonics by thoroughly characterizing the linear and NL optical behavior of epitaxially grown niobium phosphide (NbP) thin films, covering the visible to near&#8208;infrared regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. Despite the measured high linear absorption, third&#8208;harmonic generation studies demonstrate high conversion efficiencies up to 10&#8208;4%, that can be attributed to the topological electron states at the surface of the material. Furthermore, nondegenerate pump&#8208;probe measurements with sub&#8208;10 fs pulses reveal a maximum modulation depth of about 1%, completely decaying within 100 fs and therefore suggesting the possibility of developing devices based on NbP with all&#8208;optical switching bandwidths of up to 10 THz. Altogether, our work reveals promising NL optical properties of Weyl semimetal thin films that are outperforming bulk crystals of the same material, laying the grounds for nanoscale applications, enabled by top&#8208;down nanostructuring, such as light&#8208;harvesting, on&#8208;chip frequency conversion and all&#8208;optical processing.

Altogether, our work reveals promising NL optical properties of Weyl semimetal thin films that are outperforming bulk crystals of the same material, laying the grounds for nanoscale applications, enabled by top-down nanostructuring, such as light-harvesting, on-chip frequency conversion and all-optical processing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bistable and Multistable Actuators for Soft Robots: Structures, Materials, and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Snap&#8208;through bistability is often observed in nature (e.g., fast snapping to closure of Venus flytrap) and our life (e.g., bottle caps and hair clippers). Recently, harnessing bistability and multistability in different structures and soft materials has attracted growing interest for high&#8208;performance soft actuators and soft robots. They have demonstrated broad and unique applications in high&#8208;speed locomotion on land and under water, adaptive sensing and fast grasping, shape reconfiguration, electronics&#8208;free controls with a single input, and logic computation. Here, an overview of integrating bistable and multistable structures with soft actuating materials for diverse soft actuators and soft/flexible robots is given. The mechanics&#8208;guided structural design principles for five categories of basic bistable elements from 1D to 3D (i.e., constrained beams, curved plates, dome shells, compliant mechanisms of linkages with flexible hinges and deformable origami, and balloon structures) are first presented, alongside brief discussions of typical soft actuating materials (i.e., fluidic elastomers and stimuli&#8208;responsive materials such as electro&#8208;, photo&#8208;, thermo&#8208;, magnetic&#8208;, and hydro&#8208;responsive polymers). Following that, integrating these soft materials with each category of bistable elements for soft bistable and multistable actuators and their diverse robotic applications are discussed. To conclude, perspectives on the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field are considered.

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Observation of Near&#8208;intrinsic Exciton Linewidth in Monolayer WS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The homogeneous exciton linewidth, which captures the coherent quantum dynamics of an excitonic state, is a vital parameter in exploring light&#8208;matter interactions in two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). An efficient control of the exciton linewidth is of great significance, and in particular of its intrinsic linewidth, which determines the minimum timescale for the coherent manipulation of excitons. However, such a control has rarely been achieved in TMDs at room temperature (RT). While the intrinsic A exciton linewidth is down to 7 meV in monolayer WS2, the reported RT linewidth was typically a few tens of meV due to inevitable homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening effects. Here, we show that a 7.18 meV near&#8208;intrinsic linewidth can be observed at RT when monolayer WS2 is coupled with a moderate&#8208;refractive&#8208;index hydrogenated silicon nanosphere in water. By boosting the dynamic competition between exciton and trion decay channels in WS2 through the nanosphere&#8208;supported Mie resonances, we have managed to tune the coherent linewidth from 35 down to 7.18 meV. Such modulation of exciton linewidth and its associated mechanism are robust even in presence of defects, easing the sample quality requirement and providing new opportunities for TMD&#8208;based nanophotonics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Highly Conducting and Stretchable Double Network Hydrogel for Soft Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conducting polymer hydrogels are promising materials in soft bioelectronics because of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties and the capability of electrical interaction with tissues. However, it is challenging to balance electrical conductivity and mechanical stretchability: pure conducting polymer hydrogels are highly conductive, but they are brittle; while incorporating the conducting network with a soft network to form a double network can improve the stretchability, its electrical conductivity significantly decreases. Here we address the problem by concentrating a poorly crosslinked precursor hydrogel with a high content ratio of the conducting polymer to achieve a densified double network hydrogel (5.5&#160;wt.% conducting polymer), exhibiting both high electrical conductivity (&#8764;10 S cm&#8211;1) and a large fracture strain (&#8764;150%), in addition to high biocompatibility, tissue&#8208;like softness, low swelling ratio, and desired electrochemical properties for bioelectronics. We further use a surface grafting method to form an adhesive layer on the conducting hydrogel, enabling robust and rapid bonding on the tissues. Furthermore, we apply the proposed hydrogel to show high quality physiological signal recording and reliable, low&#8208;voltage electrical stimulation based on an in vivo rat model. Our method provides an ideal strategy for rapid and reliable tissue&#8208;device integration with high&#8208;quality electrical communications.

         <title>Intelligent Gold Nanoparticles with Oncogenic MicroRNA&#8208;dependent Activities to Manipulate Tumorigenic Environments for Synergistic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumorigenic environments, especially aberrantly over&#8208;expressed oncogenic microRNAs, play critical role in various activities of tumor progression. However, developing strategies to effectively utilize and manipulate these oncogenic microRNAs for tumor therapy is still a challenge. To address this challenge, we have fabricated spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) consisting of gold nanoparticles in the core and antisense oligonucleotides as the shell. Hybridized to the oligonucleotide shell was a DNA sequence to which doxorubicin was conjugated (DNA&#8208;DOX). The oligonucleotides shell was designed to capture over&#8208;expressed miR&#8208;21/miR&#8208;155 and inhibit the expression of these oncogenic miRNAs in tumor cells after tumor accumulation to manipulate genetic environment for accurate gene therapy. This process would further induce the aggregation of these SNAs, which not only generated photothermal agents to achieve on&#8208;demand photothermal therapy in situ, but enlarged the size of SNAs to enhance the retention time in tumor for sustained therapy. The capturing of the relevant miRNAs simultaneously triggered the intracellular release of the DNA&#8208;DOX from the SNAs to deliver tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro results indicated that this combination strategy has excellent tumor inhibition properties with high survival rate of tumor&#8208;bearing mice, which could be a promising candidate for effective tumor treatment.

         <title>Understanding Heterogeneities in Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum materials are usually heterogeneous, with structural defects, impurities, surfaces, edges, interfaces, and disorder. These heterogeneities are sometimes viewed as liabilities within conventional systems; however, their electronic and magnetic structures often define and affect the quantum phenomena such as coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topological effects in the host system. Therefore, a critical need is to understand the roles of heterogeneities in order to endow materials with new quantum functions for energy and quantum information science applications. In this article, several representative examples are reviewed on the recent progress in connecting the heterogeneities to the quantum behaviors of real materials. Specifically, three intertwined topic areas are assessed: (i) Reveal the structural, electronic, magnetic, vibrational, and optical degrees of freedom of heterogeneities. (ii) Understand the effect of heterogeneities on the behaviors of quantum states in host material systems. (iii) Control heterogeneities for new quantum functions. This progress is achieved by establishing the atomistic&#8208;level structure&#8208;property relationships associated with heterogeneities in quantum materials. The understanding of the interactions between electronic, magnetic, photonic, and vibrational states of heterogeneities enables the design of new quantum materials, including topological matter and quantum light emitters based on heterogenous 2D materials.

Constructing composite structures is an essential approach for obtaining the multiple functionalities in single entity. A vailable synthesis methods of the composites need to be urgently exploited; especially in&#8208;situ construction. Here; we report a NiS/NiFe2O4 composite through a local coordination metal&#8208;S at the interface; derived from phase reconstruction in a highly defective matrix. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure confirmed that long&#8208;range order was broken via the local metal&#8208;S coordination; and by using the electron energy loss spectroscopy we identified the introduction of NiS/NiFe2O4 interfaces during the irradiation of plasma energy. Density functional theory calculations revealed that in&#8208;situ phase reconfiguration is crucial for synergistically reducing energetic barriers and accelerating reaction kinetics towards catalyzing the oxygen evolution. As a result; it leads to an overpotential of 230&#160;mV @10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 for OER and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81V&#160;for ORR; as well as an excellent Zinc&#8208;air batteries performance with a power density of 148.5 mW&#183;cm&#8211;2. Our work provides a new compositing strategy in terms of fast phase reconstruction of bifunctional catalyst.

         <title>Commensurate Stacking Phase Transitions in an Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;step first&#8208;order structural phase transitions at around 230 K in Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 are solely associated with the stacking degree of freedom, evolving from a high&#8208;temperature phase with ABC stacking and R3m symmetry to an intermediate phase with AB stacking and P3m1, and finally to a low temperature phase again with R3m symmetry, but with ACB stacking. Each step involves a rigid slide of building blocks by a vector [1/3, 2/3, 0].








Abstract
Intercalation and stacking&#8208;order modulation are two active ways in manipulating the interlayer interaction of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), which lead to a variety of emergent phases and allow for engineering material properties. Herein, the growth of Pb&#8208;intercalated TMDCs&#8211;Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2, the first 124&#8208;phase, is reported. Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 exhibits a unique two&#8208;step first&#8208;order structural phase transition at around 230 K. The transitions are solely associated with the stacking degree of freedom, evolving from a high&#8208;temperature (high&#8208;T) phase with ABC stacking and R3m symmetry to an intermediate phase with AB stacking and P3m1, and finally to a low&#8208;temperature (low&#8208;T) phase again with R3msymmetry, but with ACB stacking. Each step involves a rigid slide of building blocks by a vector [1/3, 2/3, 0]. Intriguingly, gigantic lattice contractions occur at the transitions on warming. At low&#8208;T, bulk superconductivity with Tc&#160;&#8776; 1.8 K is observed. The underlying physics of the structural phase transitions are discussed from first&#8208;principle calculations. The symmetry analysis reveals topological nodal lines in the band structure. The results demonstrate the possibility of realizing higher&#8208;order metal&#8208;intercalated phases of TMDCs and advance the knowledge of polymorphic transitions, and may inspire stacking&#8208;order engineering in TMDCs and&#160;beyond.

         <title>Optimizing Atomic Hydrogen Desorption of Sulfur&#8208;Rich NiS1+x Cocatalyst for Boosting Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient coupling strategy of active&#8208;site&#8208;enriched regulation and electronic structure modification of active S sites is developed to simultaneously increase the active S number and weaken the strong S&#63743;Hads bonds. The designed core&#8211;shell Au@NiS1+x cocatalyst with electron&#8208;enriched S&#948;&#8722; active centers can realize the facile adsorption and desorption of atomic hydrogen, thus achieving signally boosted photocatalytic H2&#8208;evolution activity on TiO2.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost transition&#8208;metal chalcogenides (MSx) are demonstrated to be potential candidate cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 generation. However, their H2&#8208;generation performance is limited by insufficient quantities of exposed sulfur (S) sites and their strong bonding with adsorbed hydrogen atoms (S&#63743;Hads). To address these issues, an efficient coupling strategy of active&#8208;site&#8208;enriched regulation and electronic structure modification of active S sites is developed by rational design of core&#8211;shell Au@NiS1+x nanostructured cocatalyst. In this case, the Au@NiS1+x cocatalyst can be skillfully fabricated to synthesize the Au@NiS1+x modified TiO2 (denoted as TiO2/Au@NiS1+x) by a two&#8208;step route. Photocatalytic experiments exhibit that the resulting TiO2/Au@NiS1+x(1.7:1.3) displays a boosted H2&#8208;generation rate of 9616&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with an apparent quantum efficiency of 46.0%&#160; at 365&#160;nm, which is 2.9 and 1.7 times the rate over TiO2/NiS1+x and TiO2/Au, respectively. In situ/ex situ XPS characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the free&#8208;electrons of Au can transfer to sulfur&#8208;enriched NiS1+x to induce the generation of electron&#8208;enriched S&#948;&#8722; active centers, which boosts the desorption of Hads for rapid hydrogen formation via weakening the strong S&#63743;Hads bonds. Hence, an electron&#8208;enriched S&#948;&#8722;&#8208;mediated mechanism is proposed. This work delivers a universal strategy for simultaneously increasing the active site number and optimizing the binding strength between the active sites and hydrogen adsorbates.

         <title>A General Strategy to Immobilize Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are immobilized in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) by a general strategy with SnO2 as a mediator onto metal&#8211;oxo clusters via a two&#8208;step microwave&#8208;assisted modification approach. Remarkably, the H2 production efficiency of Pt1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 under visible light surpasses that of Cu1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 and Ni1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, surpassing that of their corresponding metal nanoparticles (NPs) by far.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are witnessing rapid development due to their high activity and selectivity toward diverse reactions. However, it remains a grand challenge in the general synthesis of SACs, particularly featuring an identical chemical microenvironment and on the same support. Herein, a universal synthetic protocol is developed to immobilize SACs in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Significantly, by means of SnO2 as a mediator or adaptor, not only different single&#8208;atom metal sites, such as Pt, Cu, and Ni, etc., can be installed, but also the MOF supports can be changed (for example, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, PCN&#8208;222, and DUT&#8208;67) to afford M1/SnO2/MOF architecture. Taking UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 as a representative, the Pt1/SnO2/MOF exhibits approximately five times higher activity toward photocatalytic H2 production than the corresponding Pt nanoparticles (&#8776;2.5&#160;nm) stabilized by SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Remarkably, despite featuring identical parameters in the chemical microenvironment and support in M1/SnO2/UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, the Pt1 catalyst possesses a hydrogen evolution rate of 2167 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1, superior to the Cu1 and Ni1 counterparts, which is attributed to the differentiated hydrogen binding free energies, as supported by density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. This is thought to be the first report on a universal approach toward the stabilization of SACs with identical chemical microenvironment on an identical support.

         <title>Mechanochemistry Advances High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanochemical route to prepare stoichiometric&#8208;pure and air&#8208;stable &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powders is developed, which can be stored for more than 10 months in ambient environment. Redissolving the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powders can generate a high concentration of large&#8208;sized polyiodide colloids, which can serve as nuclei to promote heterogeneous nucleation for perovskite films. As a result, a competitive solar cell efficiency of 24.22% is achieved.








Abstract
A prerequisite for commercializing perovskite photovoltaics is to develop a swift and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis route, which guarantees the mass production of halide perovskites in the industry. Herein, a green&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted mechanochemical strategy is developed for fast synthesizing a stoichiometric &#948;&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (&#948;&#8208;FAPbI3) powder, which serves as a high&#8208;purity precursor for perovskite film deposition with low defects. The presynthesized &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 precursor possesses high concentration of micrometer&#8208;sized colloids, which are in favor of preferable crystallization by spontaneous nucleation. The resultant perovskite films own preferred crystal orientations of cubic (100) plane, which is beneficial for superior carrier transport compared to that of the films with isotropic crystal orientations using &#8220;mixture of PbI2 and FAI&#8221; as precursors. As a result, high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 24.2% are obtained. Moreover, the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powder shows superior storage stability for more than 10 months in ambient environment (40&#160;&#177; 10% relative humidity), being conducive to a facile and practical storage for further commercialization.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Membrane for Precise Ion/Solvent Separation toward Highly Stable Magnesium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase enabled by an intact metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane is constructed directly on Mg foils. Through precious solvent molecule/Mg ion sieve owing to the angstrom&#8208;sized aperture window, the MOF membrane suppresses the solvent reduction and enables a low migration barrier for Mg2+ transportation within this MOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase.








Abstract
Metallic magnesium batteries are promising candidates beyond lithium&#8208;ion batteries; however, a passive interfacial layer because of the electro&#8208;reduction of solvents on Mg surfaces usually leads to ultrahigh overpotential for the reversible Mg chemistry. Inspired by the excellent separation effect of permselective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) at angstrom scale, a large&#8208;area and defect&#8208;free MOF membrane directly on Mg surfaces is here constructed. In this process, the electrochemical deprotonation of ligand can be facilitated to afford the self&#8208;correcting of intercrystalline voids until a seamless membrane formed, which can eliminate nonselective intercrystalline diffusion of electrolyte and realize selective Mg2+ transport but precisely separate the solvent molecules from the MOF channels. Compared with the continuous solvent reduction on bare Mg anode, the as&#8208;constructed MOF membrane is demonstrated to significantly stabilize the Mg electrode via suppressing the permeation of solvents, hence contributing to a low&#8208;overpotential plating/stripping in conventional electrolytes. The concept is demonstrated that membrane separation can serve as solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, which would be widely applicable to other energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Intrinsic Wettability in Pristine Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the assistance of environmental scanning electron microscope, the high hydrophilic nature of pristine graphene with an extremely low water contact angle of &#8776;30&#176; is confirmed, using the suspended, superclean graphene membrane to exclude the interference by substrates and contamination. This high hydrophilicity is revealed to originate from the charge transfer between graphene and water molecules through H&#8211;&#960; interaction.








Abstract
The wettability of graphene remains controversial owing to its high sensitivity to the surroundings, which is reflected by the wide range of reported water contact angle (WCA). Specifically, the surface contamination and underlying substrate would strongly alter the intrinsic wettability of graphene. Here, the intrinsic wettability of graphene is investigated by measuring WCA on suspended, superclean graphene membrane using environmental scanning electron microscope. An extremely low WCA with an average value &#8776;30&#176; is observed, confirming the hydrophilic nature of pristine graphene. This high hydrophilicity originates from the charge transfer between graphene and water molecules through H&#8211;&#960; interaction. The work provides a deep understanding of the water&#8211;graphene interaction and opens up a new way for measuring the surface properties of 2D materials.

         <title>Stretchable Soft Composites with Strain&#8208;Induced Architectured Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Color&#8208;changing composites are manufactured using magnetically aligned coated platelets dispersed in a stretchable polymer matrix. Stretching of such composites enables color change through the strain&#8208;induced rotation of the embedded reflecting platelets. By harnessing the concept of architectured color, the composites feature unique direction&#8208;selective coloration effects that can be exploited in low&#8208;energy optical displays, robotic actuators, and soft tactile sensors.








Abstract
Colors enable interaction and communication between living species in a myriad of biological and artificial environments. While living organisms feature low&#8208;power mechanisms to dynamically control color in soft tissues, man&#8208;made color&#8208;changing devices remain predominantly rigid and energy intensive. Here, architectured composites that display striking color changes when stretched in selective directions under ambient light with minimum power input are reported. The orientation&#8208;dependent color change results from the rotation of reflective coated platelets that are embedded in a soft polymer matrix and pre&#8208;aligned in a well&#8208;defined architecture. The light reflected by the platelets generates structural color defined by the oxide coating on the platelet surface. By magnetically programming the initial orientation and spatial distribution of selected platelets within the soft matrix, composites with strain&#8208;modulated color&#8208;changing effects that cannot be achieved using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies are created. The proposed concept of strain&#8208;induced architectured color can be harnessed to develop low&#8208;power smart stretchable displays, tactile synthetic skins, and autonomous soft robotic devices that undergo fast and reversible color changes through the mechano&#8208;optic coupling programmed within their soft composite architecture.

         <title>Paper without a Trail: Time&#8208;Dependent Encryption using Pillar[5]arene&#8208;Based Host&#8211;Guest Invisible Ink</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;erasing ink that can display information on time scales based on the incorporated photochromic spiropyran and host&#8211;guest crosslinkers is reported. Upon the addition of a competitive host or guest, disassembly of the crosslinks occurs. This reduces the extent of merocyanine aggregation and accelerates the decay periods that control the information displayed at various time points.








Abstract
A stimuli&#8208;responsive invisible ink for time&#8208;dependent encryption of information is reported. Consisting of a pillar[5]arene&#8208;based supramolecular network grafted with spiropyran moieties, these materials display time&#8208;dependent photochromic behavior with tailorable fading rates. Ultraviolet (UV) light results in isomerization of the colorless spiropyran to the corresponding colored merocyanine, while visible light or heat causes the reverse isomerization with a rate that is dependent on the density of host&#8211;guest crosslinks. The kinetics of discoloration are a function of merocyanine aggregation, which becomes more pronounced as the host&#8211;guest crosslink density is increased, leading to a reduced conversion rate and slower time&#8208;dependent fading. The degree of crosslinking, and hence the fading rate, may be modulated via the addition of unbound pillar[5]arene host or nitrile guest as competitors. Time&#8208;dependent information encryption is enabled by combining selective placement of host and guest competitors and UV patterning. UV patterning provides an initially &#8220;false&#8221; image that does not reveal the desired information, and it is only after a given time that the encrypted data appears. This work provides a unique approach to enhance the security of information storage associated with offline portable data encryption.

         <title>Resonance&#8208;Mediated Dynamic Modulation of Perovskite Crystallization for Efficient and Stable Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic strategy is proposed to fabricate high&#8208;quality perovskite films through resonance modulation, leading to a Voc of 1.16 V and high power conversion efficiencies approaching 22.0% and 19.5% for small&#8208;area (0.09&#160;cm2) and large&#8208;area (1.02&#160;cm2) inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), respectively. More importantly, the unencapsulated PSCs exhibit excellent long&#8208;term stability under various environmental conditions (moisture, light, and heat).








Abstract
Manipulating perovskite crystallization to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite films is the key to achieving highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a dynamic strategy is proposed to modulate perovskite crystallization using a resonance hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) capable of fast self&#8208;adaptive tautomerization between multiple electronic states with neutral and charged resonance forms for mediating perovskite crystal growth and defect passivation in situ. This approach, based on resonance variation with self&#8208;adaptive molecular interactions between the HTM and the perovskite, produces high&#8208;quality perovskite films with smooth surface, oriented crystallization, and low charge recombination, leading to high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs with power conversion efficiencies approaching 22% for small&#8208;area devices (0.09&#160;cm2) and up to 19.5% for large&#8208;area devices (1.02&#160;cm2). Also, remarkably high stability of the PSCs is observed, retaining over 90%, 88%, or 83% of the initial efficiencies in air with relative humidity of 40&#8211;50%, under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination, or at 75&#160;&#176;C&#160;annealing for 1000 h without encapsulation.

         <title>Reaching the Excitonic Limit in 2D Janus Monolayers by In Situ Deterministic Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deterministic conversion of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) to Janus quantum layers is achieved via a novel synthesis approach. Integrated in situ spectroscopy measurements enable detailed insights into classical TMDs to Janus layer conversion to reach excitonic&#8208;grade Janus layer.








Abstract
Named after the two&#8208;faced Roman god of transitions, transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) Janus monolayers have two different chalcogen surfaces, inherently breaking the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane mirror symmetry. The broken mirror symmetry and the resulting potential gradient lead to the emergence of quantum properties such as the Rashba effect and the formation of dipolar excitons. Experimental access to these quantum properties, however, hinges on the ability to produce high&#8208;quality 2D Janus monolayers. Here, these results introduce a holistic 2D Janus synthesis technique that allows real&#8208;time monitoring of the growth process. This prototype chamber integrates in situ spectroscopy, offering fundamental insights into the structural evolution and growth kinetics, that allow the evaluation and optimization of the quality of Janus monolayers. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by synthesizing and monitoring the conversion of SWSe, SNbSe, and SMoSe Janus monolayers. Deterministic conversion and real&#8208;time data collection further aid in conversion of exfoliated TMDs to Janus monolayers and unparalleled exciton linewidth values are reached, compared to the current best standard. The results offer an insight into the process kinetics and aid in the development of new Janus monolayers with high optical quality, which is much needed to access their exotic properties.

         <title>Reconfiguring Colors of Single Relief Structures by Directional Stretching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relief structures in an elastomer that exhibit reconfigurable colors from individual micro&#8208;/nanostructures are designed and experimentally demonstrated. Distinct from Bragg diffraction effects from periodic structures, individual trench segments can act as a single color pixel with high resolution. Multiple sets of colorful microprints are accessible from monolithic reliefs by directional strains and capillary effects.








Abstract
Color changes can be achieved by straining photonic crystals or gratings embedded in stretchable materials. However, the multiple repeat units and the need for a volumetric assembly of nanostructures limit the density of information content. Inspired by surface reliefs on oracle bones and music records as a means of information archival, here, surface&#8208;relief elastomers are endowed with multiple sets of information that are accessible by mechanical straining along in&#8208;plane axes. Distinct from Bragg diffraction effects from periodic structures, trenches that generate color due to variations in trench depth, enabling individual trench segments to support a single color, are reported. Using 3D printed cuboids, trenches of varying geometric parameters are replicated in elastomers. These parameters determine the initial color (or lack thereof), the response to capillary forces, and the appearance when strained along or across the trenches. Strain induces modulation in trench depth or the opening and closure of a trench, resulting in surface reliefs with up to six distinct states, and an initially featureless surface that reveals two distinct images when stretched along different axes. The highly reversible structural colors are promising in optical data archival, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and strain&#8208;sensing applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color changes can be achieved by straining photonic crystals or gratings embedded in stretchable materials. However, the multiple repeat units and the need for a volumetric assembly of nanostructures limit the density of information content. Inspired by surface reliefs on oracle bones and music records as a means of information archival, here, surface-relief elastomers are endowed with multiple sets of information that are accessible by mechanical straining along in-plane axes. Distinct from Bragg diffraction effects from periodic structures, trenches that generate color due to variations in trench depth, enabling individual trench segments to support a single color, are reported. Using 3D printed cuboids, trenches of varying geometric parameters are replicated in elastomers. These parameters determine the initial color (or lack thereof), the response to capillary forces, and the appearance when strained along or across the trenches. Strain induces modulation in trench depth or the opening and closure of a trench, resulting in surface reliefs with up to six distinct states, and an initially featureless surface that reveals two distinct images when stretched along different axes. The highly reversible structural colors are promising in optical data archival, anti-counterfeiting, and strain-sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anomalous Superconducting Proximity Effect in Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 Thin&#8208;Film Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anomalous superconducting proximity effect (SPE) is unveiled in topological insulator (TI)/superconductor Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 heterostructures. In contrast with the normal SPE that decays with thickness, such an effect occurs in momentum space regardless of the TI film thickness, as long as the topologically protected surface states are robust and form a continuous conduction loop.








Abstract
The superconducting proximity effect (SPE) induces a superconductivity transition in otherwise non&#8208;superconducting thin films in proximity with a superconductor. The SPE usually occurs in real space and decays exponentially with film thickness. Herein, an abnormal SPE in a topological insulator (TI)/superconductor heterostructure is unveiled, which is attributed to the topologically protected surface state. Surprisingly, such abnormal SPE occurs in momentum space regardless of the TI film thickness, as long as the topological surface states are robust and form a continuous conduction loop. Combining transport measurements and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy techniques, the SPE in Bi2Se3/FeSe0.5Te0.5 heterostructures is explored, where Bi2Se3 is an ideal 3D topological insulator and FeSe0.5Te0.5 a typical iron&#8208;based superconductor. As the thickness of the Bi2Se3 thin film exceeds 400 nm, there still exists SPE&#8208;induced superconductivity on the surface of Bi2Se3 thin film with a transition temperature Tc not less than 10 K. Such an extraordinary behavior is induced by the unique properties of topologically protected surface states of Bi2Se3. This research deepens the understanding of the important role of topologically protected surface states in the SPE.

         <title>Decoupling Complex Multi&#8208;Length&#8208;Scale Morphology in Non&#8208;Fullerene Photovoltaics with Nitrogen K&#8208;Edge Resonant Soft X&#8208;ray Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) is complex and difficult to analyze. An innovative approach is provided by nitrogen K&#8208;edge resonant soft X&#8208;ray scattering, utilizing the spatial and orientational contrast from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, chemically determining the phase separation, which decouples the mesoscale complexity for understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship in high&#8208;efficiency OPVs.








Abstract
Complex morphology in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and other functional soft materials commonly dictates performance. Such complexity in OPVs originates from the mesoscale kinetically trapped non&#8208;equilibrium state, which governs device charge generation and transport. Resonant soft X&#8208;ray scattering (RSoXS) has been revolutionary in the exploration of OPV morphology in the past decade due to its chemical and orientation sensitivity. However, for non&#8208;fullerene OPVs, RSoXS analysis near the carbon K&#8208;edge is challenging, due to the chemical similarity of the materials used in active layers. An innovative approach is provided by nitrogen K&#8208;edge RSoXS (NK&#8208;RSoXS), utilizing the spatial and orientational contrasts from the cyano groups in the acceptor materials, which allows for determination of phase separation. NK&#8208;RSoXS clearly visualizes the combined feature sizes in PM6:Y6 blends from crystallization and liquid&#8211;liquid demixing, while PM6:Y6:Y6&#8208;BO ternary blends with reduced phase&#8208;separation size and enhanced material crystallization can lead to current amplification in devices. Nitrogen is common in organic semiconductors and other soft materials, and the strong and directional N 1s &#8594; &#960;* resonances make NK&#8208;RSoXS a powerful tool to uncover the mesoscale complexity and open opportunities to understand heterogeneous systems.

         <title>Smart Face Mask Based on an Ultrathin Pressure Sensor for Wireless Monitoring of Breath Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thinnest (totally compressed thickness of &#8776;5.5&#160;&#181;m) and lightest (total weight of &#8776;4.5&#160;mg) self&#8208;powered pressure sensor developed can output a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage up to &#8776;10&#160;V when stimulated by airflow. A portable/wearable smart face mask is obtained based on the sensor and is used for wireless monitoring and analysis of various breath conditions from multiple testers.








Abstract
A smart face mask that can conveniently monitor breath information is beneficial for maintaining personal health and preventing the spread of diseases. However, some challenges still need to be addressed before such devices can be of practical use. One key challenge is to develop a pressure sensor that is easily triggered by low pressure and has excellent stability as well as electrical and mechanical properties. In this study, a wireless smart face mask is designed by integrating an ultrathin self&#8208;powered pressure sensor and a compact readout circuit with a normal face mask. The pressure sensor is the thinnest (totally compressed thickness of &#8776;5.5&#160;&#181;m) and lightest (total weight of &#8776;4.5&#160;mg) electrostatic pressure sensor capable of achieving a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of up to &#8776;10&#160;V when stimulated by airflow, which endows the sensor with the advantage of readout circuit miniaturization and makes the breath&#8208;monitoring system portable and wearable. To demonstrate the capabilities of the smart face mask, it is used to wirelessly measure and analyze the various breath conditions of multiple testers.

         <title>Stabilization of Exposed Metal Nanocrystals in High&#8208;Temperature Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partial oxide coating strategy is developed for the stabilization of exposed metal nanocrystals to enhance their performance in thermal reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalysis particularly at high temperatures. This study opens a new avenue for the exploration of high&#8208;quality colloidal metal nanocrystals in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Colloidal metal nanocrystals with uniform sizes, shapes, compositions, and architectures are ideal building blocks for constructing heterogeneous catalysts with well&#8208;defined characteristics toward the investigation of accurate structure&#8211;property relationships and better understanding of catalytic mechanism. However, their applications in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis are often restricted by the difficulty in maintaining the high metal dispersity and easy accessibility to active sites under harsh operating conditions. Here, a partial&#8208;oxide&#8208;coating strategy is proposed to stabilize metal nanocrystals against sintering and meanwhile enable an effective exposure of active sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, controlled partial silica coating of colloidally prepared Pd0.82Ni0.18 nanocrystals with the size of 8 nm is demonstrated. This partially coated catalyst exhibits excellent activity, selectivity, and stability, outperforming its counterparts with fully coated and supported structures, in reverse water gas shift (RWGS) catalysis particularly at high operating temperatures. This study opens a new avenue for the exploration of colloidal metal nanocrystals in high&#8208;temperature heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Orbital Gating Driven by Giant Stark Effect in Tunneling Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital gating is introduced driven by giant Stark effect in tunneling phototransistors based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 without using external gating bias or slow charge trapping dynamics in conventional photogating, which realizes low dark current, practical photoresponsivity, and fast switching time simultaneously.








Abstract
Conventional gating in transistors uses electric fields through external dielectrics that require complex fabrication processes. Various optoelectronic devices deploy photogating by electric fields from trapped charges in neighbor nanoparticles or dielectrics under light illumination. Orbital gating driven by giant Stark effect is demonstrated in tunneling phototransistors based on 2H&#8208;MoTe2 without using external gating bias or slow charge trapping dynamics in photogating. The original self&#8208;gating by light illumination modulates the interlayer potential gradient by switching on and off the giant Stark effect where the dz2&#8208;orbitals of molybdenum atoms play the dominant role. The orbital gating shifts the electronic bands of the top atomic layer of the MoTe2 by up to 100 meV, which is equivalent to modulation of a carrier density of 7.3 &#215; 1011 cm&#8211;2 by electrical gating. Suppressing conventional photoconductivity, the orbital gating in tunneling phototransistors achieves low dark current, practical photoresponsivity (3357 AW&#8211;1), and fast switching time (0.5&#160;ms) simultaneously.

         <title>Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Cathode with Dual Energy&#8208;Storage Mechanism for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Ultralong&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism is detected in an organic (ethylenediamine (EDA))&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathode. Both the EDA ligand and the V&#8211;O layer can participate in Zn&#8208;ion storage synchronously. Benefiting from the advanced mechanism, this hybrid provides a high specific capacity, elevated voltage, and excellent long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
The exploitation of cathode materials with high capacity as well as high operating voltage is extremely important for the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). Yet, the classical high&#8208;capacity materials (e.g., vanadium&#8208;based materials) provide a low discharge voltage, while organic cathodes with high operating voltage generally suffer from a low capacity. In this work, organic (ethylenediamine)&#8211;inorganic (vanadium oxide) hybrid cathodes, that is, EDA&#8208;VO, with a dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism, are designed for ultrahigh&#8208;rate and ultralong&#8208;life ZIBs. The embedded ethylenediamine (EDA) can not only increase the layer spacing of the vanadium oxide, with improved mobility of Zn ions in the V&#8211;O layered structure, but also act as a bidentate chelating ligand participating in the storage of Zn ions. This hybrid provides a high specific capacity (382.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1), elevated voltage (0.82&#160;V) and excellent long&#8208;term cycle stability (over 10&#160;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1). Assistant density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the cathode has remarkable electronic conductivity, with an ultralow diffusion barrier of 0.78&#160;eV for an optimal Zn&#8208;ion diffusion path in the EDA&#8208;VO. This interesting idea of building organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid cathode materials with a dual energy&#8208;storage mechanism opens a new research direction toward high&#8208;energy secondary batteries.

         <title>Controlling and Focusing In&#8208;Plane Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with a Curved Plasmonic Antenna</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Launching, controlling, and focusing in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in van der Waals &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are realized with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas. By engineering the curvature of the antenna extremity, it is able to tune the focal lengths and lateral sizes of the focal points. This study can open up new avenues for planar nanophotonic devices in the mid&#8208;IR region.








Abstract
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) sustained in polar van der Waals (vdW) crystals exhibit extraordinary confinement of long&#8208;wave electromagnetic fields to the deep subwavelength scale. In stark contrast to uniaxial vdW hyperbolic materials, recently emerged biaxial hyperbolic materials, such as &#945;&#8208;MoO3 and &#945;&#8208;V2O5, offer new degrees of freedom for controlling light in two&#8208;dimensions due to their distinctive in&#8208;plane hyperbolic dispersions. However, the control and focusing of these in&#8208;plane HPhPs remain elusive. Here, a versatile technique is proposed for launching, controlling, and focusing in&#8208;plane HPhPs in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas. It is found that the subwavelength manipulation and focusing behaviors are strongly dependent on the curvature of the antenna extremity. This strategy operates effectively in a broadband spectral region. These findings not only provide fundamental insights into the manipulation of light by biaxial hyperbolic crystals at the nanoscale but also open up new opportunities for planar nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Polymer Acceptors with Flexible Spacers Afford Efficient and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New polymer acceptors (PAs) are developed by embedding flexible conjugation&#8208;break spacer (FCBS) units into the rigid backbones. The incorporation of FCBS affords effective modulation of the crystallinity and pre&#8208;aggregation of the PA and attains optimal blend morphology. As a result, the all&#8208;polymer solar cells exhibit both a high efficiency of 14.68% and excellent mechanical robustness with a crack onset strain of 21.64%.








Abstract
High efficiency and mechanical robustness are both crucial for the practical applications of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) in stretchable and wearable electronics. In this regard, a series of new polymer acceptors (PAs) is reported by incorporating a flexible conjugation&#8208;break spacer (FCBS) to achieve highly efficient and mechanically robust all&#8208;PSCs. Incorporation of FCBS affords the effective modulation of the crystallinity and pre&#8208;aggregation of the PAs, and achieves the optimal blend morphology with polymer donor (PD), increasing both the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of all&#8208;PSCs. In particular, an all&#8208;PSC based on PYTS&#8208;0.3 PA incorporated with 30% FCBS and PBDB&#8208;T PD demonstrates a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.68% and excellent mechanical stretchability with a crack onset strain (COS) of 21.64% and toughness of 3.86&#160;MJ m&#8208;3, which is significantly superior to those of devices with the PA without the FCBS (PYTS&#8208;0.0, PCE = 13.01%, and toughness = 2.70&#160;MJ m&#8208;3). To date, this COS is the highest value reported for PSCs with PCEs of over 8% without any insulating additives. These results reveal that the introduction of FCBS into the conjugated backbone is a highly feasible strategy to simultaneously improve the PCE and stretchability of PSCs.

A proposed octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA)&#8208;treated indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (IGZO)/p&#8208;Si heterostructure photodetector exhibits an excellent on/off current ratio of 4 &#215; 103 and unique negative differential resistance (NDR) current behavior, after implementation with a simple annealing process. Uniformity tests using 156 photodiodes and a 20&#160;000 cycle test demonstrate the reliability of the proposed photodiode.








Abstract
Metal oxide semiconductors are of great interest for enabling advanced photodetectors. However, operational instability and the absence of an appropriate doping technique hinder practical development and commercialization. Here, a strategy is proposed to dramatically increase the conventional photodetection performance, having superior stability in operational and environmental atmospheres. By performing energy&#8208;band engineering through an octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA) self&#8208;assembled&#8208;monolayer&#8208;based doping treatment, the proposed indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (IGZO)/p&#8208;Si heterointerface devices exhibit greatly enhance the photoresponsive characteristics, including a photoswitching current ratio with a 100&#8208;fold increase, and photoresponsivity and detectivity with a 15&#8208;fold increase each. The observed ODPA doping effects are investigated through comprehensive analysis with X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). Furthermore, the proposed photodetectors, fabricated at a 4 in. wafer scale, demonstrate its excellent operation robustness with consistent performance over 237 days and 20&#160;000 testing cycles.

Silica aerogels with accurate building&#8208;block control are realized by adjusting the surfactant concentration during the synthesis process. The resulting silica aerogels, serving as a diffuser, show an incredibly promising application in laser&#8208;driven lighting.








Abstract
Silica aerogels with accurate building&#8208;block control are realized by adjusting the surfactant concentration during the synthesis process. The resulting silica&#8208;aerogel monolith with spherical building blocks of &#8776;24&#8211;40&#160;nm, together with a deliberately created hole along the incident light direction, shows an incredibly promising application in monochromatic laser&#8208;driven lighting. The resulting coefficient of illuminance variation is as low as 8.1%, significantly outperforming commercially available ground&#8208;glass diffusers (139.0%) and polymer diffusers (249.1%); the speckle contrast is lower, as well as better, than that can be recognized by the human eye (4%), and the illuminance uniformity in the range of 0.770&#8211;0.862 is much better (higher) than that indoor workplace lighting required by the International Organization for Standardization. Lighting with any color in the visible spectrum, including white, can be obtained by using three primary color lasers (450, 532, and 638&#160;nm) with different powers simultaneously as the light source. The resulting silica aerogel, which has excellent thermal stability, high laser&#8208;damage threshold, outstanding mechanical performance, and superhydrophobicity, can be further applied to long&#8208;distance and noncontact laser&#8208;driven lighting in rain or underwater without any additional encapsulation components.

         <title>Strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; Stacking Stabilized Nanophotosensitizers: Improving Tumor Retention for Enhanced Therapy for Large Tumors in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoparticles encapsulating BODIPY photosensitizers with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking are prepared, demonstrating long tumor retention of up to 10 days. The nanoparticles can completely suppress regular test size tumors (100 mm3) in mice by one&#8208;time radiation. Importantly, the nanoparticles also allow treatment of large&#8208;size tumors (350 mm3) via single&#8208;dose injection and three&#8208;time light treatments, resulting in a 90% inhibition rate.








Abstract
Conventional photosensitizers (PSs) often show poor tumor retention and are rapidly cleared from the bloodstream, which is one of the key hindrances to guarantee precise and efficient photodynamic therapy (PDT) in vivo. In this work, a photosensitizer assembly nanosystem that sharply enhances tumor retention up to &#8776;10 days is present. The PSs are synthesized by meso&#8208;substituting anthracene onto a BODIPY scaffold (AN&#8208;BDP), which then self&#8208;assembles into stable nanoparticles (AN&#8208;BDP NPs) with amphiphilic block copolymers due to the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction of the anthracene. Additionally, the incorporated anthracene excites the PSs, producing singlet oxygen under red&#8208;light irradiation. Although AN&#8208;BDP NPs can completely suppress regular test size tumors (&#8776;100 mm3) by one&#8208;time radiation, only 12% tumor growth inhibition rate is observed in the case of large&#8208;size tumors (&#8776;350 mm3) under the same conditions. Due to the long&#8208;time tumor retention, AN&#8208;BDP NPs allow single&#8208;dose injection and three&#8208;time light treatments, resulting in an inhibition rate over 90%, much more efficient than single&#8208;time radiation of conventional clinically used PSs including chlorin&#8208;e6 (Ce6) and porphyrin with poor tumor retention. The results reveal the importance of long tumor retention time of PSs for efficient PDT, which can accelerate the clinical development of nanophotosensitizers.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Responsive TiO2 Biometasurfaces: Toward In Situ Photodynamic Antibacterial Therapy for Biomedical Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface is constructed on a Ti alloy by a newly invented alkaline&#8211;acid bidirectional hydrothermal (aaBH) strategy, which manipulates the light&#8211;matter interaction and induces the strong adsorption of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. The aaBH&#8208;treated Ti alloy implants show potent NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial activity and possess a strong ability to promote the anchorage of human gingival fibroblasts on their surface.








Abstract
Implant&#8208;related microbial infection is a challenging clinical problem, and its treatment requires efficient eradication of the biofilm from the implant surface. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive strategies are proposed as an emerging efficient antibacterial therapy. However, the utilization of photosensitizers or photocatalytic/photothermal nanomaterials in the available approach likely induces high potential risks of interfacial deterioration and biosafety compromise. Herein, a TiO2/TiO2&#8722;x metasurface with potent NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial activity is produced on a Ti alloy implant by a newly invented topochemical conversion&#8208;based alkaline&#8211;acid bidirectional hydrothermal method (aaBH). Electromagnetic simulations prove that NIR absorption and near&#8208;field distribution of the metasurface can be tuned by the dimension and arrangement of the nanostructural unit. Promising antibacterial efficacy is proved by both in vitro and in vivo tests, with low&#8208;power NIR irradiation for 10 min. Besides, the designed nanostructure in the metasurface itself also shows excellence in enhancing the adhesion&#8208;related gene expression of human gingival fibroblasts that are exposed to 10 min of NIR irradiation, proving the potent nanostructure&#8208;induced biological effects. This work provides a biosafe and upscalable metasurfacing approach with extraordinary capacity of manipulating light adsorption, photocatalysis, and biological properties.

         <title>Biomimetic Trachea Engineering via a Modular Ring Strategy Based on Bone&#8208;Marrow Stem Cells and Atelocollagen for Use in Extensive Tracheal Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chondroitin&#8208;sulfate&#8208;incorporating type&#8208;II atelocollagen scaffold repopulated with bone marrow stem cells for cartilaginous rings regeneration and type&#8208;I atelocollagen scaffold for vascularized fibrous tissue formation is fabricated; then, a modular ring strategy to develop a biomimetic trachea with cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between the vascularized fibrous tissue architecture is adopted. The biomimetic trachea is used for extensive tracheal reconstruction.








Abstract
The fabrication of biomimetic tracheas with a architecture of cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between vascularized fibrous tissue (CRVFT) has the potential to perfectly recapitulate the normal tracheal structure and function. Herein, the development of a customized chondroitin&#8208;sulfate&#8208;incorporating type&#8208;II atelocollagen (COL II/CS) scaffold with excellent chondrogenic capacity and a type&#8208;I atelocollagen (COL I) scaffold to facilitate the formation of vascularized fibrous tissue is described.

&lt;p&gt;A chondroitin-sulfate-incorporating type-II atelocollagen scaffold repopulated with bone marrow stem cells for cartilaginous rings regeneration and type-I atelocollagen scaffold for vascularized fibrous tissue formation is fabricated; then, a modular ring strategy to develop a biomimetic trachea with cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between the vascularized fibrous tissue architecture is adopted. The biomimetic trachea is used for extensive tracheal reconstruction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabrication of biomimetic tracheas with a architecture of cartilaginous rings alternately interspersed between vascularized fibrous tissue (CRVFT) has the potential to perfectly recapitulate the normal tracheal structure and function. Herein, the development of a customized chondroitin-sulfate-incorporating type-II atelocollagen (COL II/CS) scaffold with excellent chondrogenic capacity and a type-I atelocollagen (COL I) scaffold to facilitate the formation of vascularized fibrous tissue is described. An efficient modular ring strategy is then adopted to develop a CRVFT-based biomimetic trachea. The in vitro engineering of cartilaginous rings is achieved via the recellularization of ring-shaped COL II/CS scaffolds using bone marrow stem cells as a mimetic for native cartilaginous ring tissue. A CRVFT-based trachea with biomimetic mechanical properties, composed of bionic biochemical components, is additionally successfully generated in vivo via the alternating stacking of cartilaginous rings and ring-shaped COL I scaffolds on a silicone pipe. The resultant biomimetic trachea with pedicled muscular flaps is used for extensive tracheal reconstruction and exhibits satisfactory therapeutic outcomes with structural and functional properties similar to those of native trachea. This is the first study to utilize stem cells for long-segmental tracheal cartilaginous regeneration and this represents a promising method for extensive tracheal reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent&#8208;Linking&#8208;Enabled Superior Compatibility of ZIF&#8208;8 Hybrid Membrane for Efficient Propylene Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superior interfacial compatibility in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) hybrid membranes is achieved by linking functionalized ZIF&#8208;8 and polymeric PIM&#8208;1 through chemical bonds. The fabricated membrane exhibits the highest C3H6 permeability and remarkable selectivity for C3H6 over C3H8 among ZIF analogs, potentially for efficient propylene separation.








Abstract
The interface is a critical issue for metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework hybrid membranes in propylene separation. Here, a covalent&#8208;linking strategy is reported for strikingly reinforcing the interfacial compatibility in a ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based membrane. A functionalized ZIF&#8208;8 material named ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN is synthesized using the mixed&#8208;ligand approach. ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN has an identical crystalline structure to ZIF&#8208;8, and the 4,5&#8208;dicyanoimidazole ligand is available for further functionalization. Covalent linkage of ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN with PIM&#8208;1 is driven by the thermal reaction of the cyano groups on both entities, which strengthens the filler&#8211;polymer connection in the ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 membrane. ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 exhibits remarkably enhanced propylene permeation property with C3H6/C3H8 selectivity of &#8776;28, which is 350% and 180% higher than those on non&#8208;treated ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN/PIM&#8208;1 and non&#8208;functionalized ZIF&#8208;8@tPIM&#8208;1, respectively. Additionally, ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;CN@tPIM&#8208;1 shows the highest C3H6 permeability of &#8776;370 Barrer among all relevant ZIF&#8208;8 membranes. This strategy opens an avenue for precise interface engineering in membranes and the resultant high performance is appealing in the propylene separation industry.

&lt;p&gt;The interface is a critical issue for metal&#8211;organic-framework hybrid membranes in propylene separation.

         <title>Resolving Atomic&#8208;Scale Interactions in Nonfullerene Acceptor Organic Solar Cells with Solid&#8208;State NMR Spectroscopy, Crystallographic Modelling, and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>

         <dc:description>
The combined results from solid&#8208;state NMR, crystallography, and modelling techniques highlight key differences in the Y6 morphology in PM6:Y6 blends cast from different solvents, which lead to different power conversion efficiencies in solar cells. By interpreting the experimental data step&#8208;by&#8208;step and using the results from each step, a more complete understanding of the underlying fundamental processes is reached.








Abstract
Fused&#8208;ring core nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), designated &#8220;Y&#8208;series,&#8221; have enabled high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) achieving over 18% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Since the introduction of these NFAs, much effort has been expended to understand the reasons for their exceptional performance. While several studies have identified key optoelectronic properties that govern high PCEs, little is known about the molecular level origins of large variations in performance, spanning from 5% to 18% PCE, for example, in the case of PM6:Y6 OSCs. Here, a combined solid&#8208;state NMR, crystallography, and molecular modeling approach to elucidate the atomic&#8208;scale interactions in Y6 crystals, thin films, and PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends is introduced. It is shown that the Y6 morphologies in BHJ blends are not governed by the morphology in neat films or single crystals. Notably, PM6:Y6 blends processed from different solvents self&#8208;assemble into different structures and morphologies, whereby the relative orientations of the sidechains and end groups of the Y6 molecules to their fused&#8208;ring cores play a crucial role in determining the resulting morphology and overall performance of the solar cells. The molecular&#8208;level understanding of BHJs enabled by this approach will guide the engineering of next&#8208;generation NFAs for stable and efficient OSCs.

         <title>Sequential Activation of Molecular and Macroscopic Spin&#8208;State Switching within the Hysteretic Region Following Pulsed Light Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking advantage of an exceptionally reversible bidirectional switching in a molecular spin&#8208;crossover crystal, pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy is used to explore the dynamics of the spin&#8208;state switching within the hysteretic region. Remarkably, before the millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser excitation involves a gradual and homogeneous molecular conversion process, as if there were&#160;no hysteresis loop.








Abstract
Molecular spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) compounds constitute a promising class of photoactive materials exhibiting efficient photoinduced phase transitions (PIPTs). Taking advantage of the unique, picture&#8208;perfect reproducibility of the spin&#8208;transition properties in the compound [Fe(HB(1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)3)2], the spatiotemporal dynamics of the PIPT within the thermodynamic metastability (hysteretic) region of a single crystal is dissected, using pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy. Beyond a threshold laser&#8208;excitation density, complete PIPTs are evidenced, with conversion rates up to 200 switched molecules per absorbed photon. It is shown that the PIPT takes place through the sequential activation of two (molecular and macroscopic) switching mechanisms, occurring on sub&#8208;microsecond and millisecond timescales, governed by the intramolecular and free energy barriers of the system, respectively. The main finding here is that the thermodynamic metastability has strictly no influence on the sub&#8208;millisecond switching dynamics. Indeed, before this millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser excitation involves a gradual, molecular conversion process, as if there were&#160;no hysteresis loop. Consequently, in this regime, even a 100% photoinduced conversion may not give rise to a PIPT. These results provide new insight on the intrinsic dynamical limits of the PIPT, which is an important issue from a technological perspective.

         <title>Two&#8208;Photon 3D Laser Printing Inside Synthetic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon 3D laser printing inside of giant unilamellar lipid vesicles is reported. 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape, including transmembrane pores, are realized within the confinement of a synthetic cell.








Abstract
Toward the ambitious goal of manufacturing synthetic cells from the bottom up, various cellular components have already been reconstituted inside lipid vesicles. However, the deterministic positioning of these components inside the compartment has remained elusive. Here, by using two&#8208;photon 3D&#160;laser printing, 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures are manufactured with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape inside preformed giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). The required water&#8208;soluble photoresist is brought into the GUVs by diffusion in a single mixing step. Crucially, femtosecond two&#8208;photon printing inside the compartment does not destroy the GUVs. Beyond this proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration, early functional architectures are realized. In particular, a transmembrane structure acting as a pore is 3D&#160;printed, thereby allowing for the transport of biological cargo, including DNA, into the synthetic compartment. These experiments show that two&#8208;photon 3D laser microprinting can be an important addition to the existing toolbox of synthetic&#160;biology.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward the ambitious goal of manufacturing synthetic cells from the bottom up, various cellular components have already been reconstituted inside lipid vesicles. However, the deterministic positioning of these components inside the compartment has remained elusive. Here, by using two-photon 3D&#160;laser printing, 2D and 3D hydrogel architectures are manufactured with high precision and nearly arbitrary shape inside preformed giant unilamellar lipid vesicles (GUVs). The required water-soluble photoresist is brought into the GUVs by diffusion in a single mixing step. Crucially, femtosecond two-photon printing inside the compartment does not destroy the GUVs. Beyond this proof-of-principle demonstration, early functional architectures are realized. In particular, a transmembrane structure acting as a pore is 3D&#160;printed, thereby allowing for the transport of biological cargo, including DNA, into the synthetic compartment. These experiments show that two-photon 3D laser microprinting can be an important addition to the existing toolbox of synthetic&#160;biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Auxetics&#8208;Inspired Tunable Metamaterials for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Auxetics refers to structures or materials identified by a negative Poisson's ratio and exhibiting a counterintuitive geometrical behavior. Inspired by auxetics, mechanically tunable magnetic metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz frequencies are proposed, which serve to enhance local magnetic fields and increase signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (&#8776;4.5&#215;) in their application to magnetic resonance imaging.








Abstract
Auxetics refers to structures or materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, thereby capable of exhibiting counterintuitive behaviors. Herein, auxetic structures are exploited to design mechanically tunable metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz (MHz) frequencies, optimized for their application to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specially, the reported tunable metamaterials are composed of arrays of interjointed unit cells featuring metallic helices, enabling auxetic patterns with a negative Poisson's ratio. The deployable deformation of the metamaterials yields an added degree of freedom with respect to frequency tunability through the resultant modification of the electromagnetic interactions between unit cells. The metamaterials are fabricated using 3D printing technology and an &#8776;20&#160;MHz frequency shift of the resonance mode is enabled during deformation. Experimental validation is performed in a clinical (3.0 T) MRI system, demonstrating that the metamaterials enable a marked boost in radiofrequency field strength under resonance&#8208;matched conditions, ultimately yielding a dramatic increase in the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (&#8776;4.5&#215;) of MRI. The tunable metamaterials presented herein offer a novel pathway toward the practical utilization of metamaterials in MRI, as well as a range of other emerging applications.

         <title>Fast Uncooled Mid&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors with Heterostructures of van der Waals on Epitaxial HgCdTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals on epitaxial HgCdTe for uncooled mid&#8208;wavelength infrared photodetectors with fast response and high detectivity at spectral blackbody detection is introduced. Meaningfully, the device exhibits a fast response time of 13 ns, peak detectivity of 2 &#215; 1010 and 1011 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 under blackbody radiation at 300 K and at 77 K.








Abstract
Uncooled infrared photodetectors have evoked widespread interest in basic research and military manufacturing because of their low&#8208;cost, compact detection systems. However, existing uncooled infrared photodetectors utilize the photothermoelectric effect of infrared radiation operating at 8&#8211;12&#160;&#181;m, with a slow response time in the millisecond range. Hence, the exploration of new uncooled mid&#8208;wavelength infrared (MWIR) heterostructures is conducive to the development of ultrafast and high&#8208;performance nano&#8208;optoelectronics. This study explores a van der Waals heterojunction on epitaxial HgCdTe (vdWs&#8208;on&#8208;MCT) as an uncooled MWIR photodetector, which achieves fast response as well as high detectivity for spectral blackbody detection. Specifically, the vdWs&#8208;on&#8208;MCT photodetector has a fast response time of 13&#160;ns (77&#160;MHz), which is approximately an order of magnitude faster than commercial uncooled MCT photovoltaic photodetectors. Importantly, the device exhibits a photoresponsivity of 2.5 A W&#8208;1, quantum efficiency as high as 85%, peak detectivity of 2 &#215; 1010&#160;cm Hz1/2 W&#8208;1 under blackbody radiation at room temperature, and peak detectivity of up to 1011&#160;cm Hz1/2 W&#8208;1 at 77 K. Thereby, this work facilitates the effective design of high&#8208;speed and high&#8208;performance heterojunction uncooled MWIR photodetectors.

         <title>An Ultrahigh&#8208;Power Mesocarbon Microbeads|Na+&#8208;Diglyme|Na3V2(PO4)3 Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prototype of ultrahigh power sodium ion battery (SIB), mesocarbon microbeads|Na+&#8208;diglyme|Na3V2(PO4)3, is assembled. The as&#8208;synthesized Na3V2(PO4)3@C@CNTs cathode and mesocarbon microbeads anode display the well&#8208;matched rate capability. The assembled full&#8208;cell delivers an energy density of 88&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at ultrahigh power density of &#8776;10&#160;kW kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) show practical applications in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. But, their power density is limited by the sluggish Na+ diffusion into the cathode and anode materials. Herein, the authors demonstrate a prototype of ultrahigh power SIB, consisting of the high&#8208;rate Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode, graphite&#8208;type mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB) anode, and Na+&#8208;diglyme electrolyte. It is found that the overpotential of the NVP cathode obeys the Ohmic rule. Thus, the as&#8208;synthesized NVP@C@carbon nanotubes (CNTs) cathode with the high conductive CNTs networks displays high electronic conductivity, reducing the overpotential and charge transfer resistances and leading to the remarkable rate capability over 1000C. For the MCMB anode, the initial [Na&#8208;diglyme]+ co&#8208;intercalation step is pseudocapacitive dominated, and then the expanded graphite's layers ensure the subsequent fast ions diffusion. The rapid (de)intercalation kinetics in between the cathode and anode are well&#8208;matched. Thus, the assembled MCMB|1 m NaPF6 in diglyme|NVP@C@CNTs full&#8208;cell SIB delivers the energy density of 88&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the high power density of &#8776;10&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. Even at the ultrahigh power density of 23&#160;kW kg&#8722;1, an energy density of 58&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 is obtained. The encouraging results of the full cell will promote the development of high&#8208;power SIB for large&#8208;scale applications in the future.

A biological self&#8208;assembly technology to fabricate Rhizopus hyphae carbon fibre (RHCF) and its derivatives is proposed. The RHCFs are multifunctional as the hosts to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form an RHCF&#8208;based cathode, anode, and separator, respectively. The as&#8208;assembled RHCF&#8208;based full cell shows excellent cycling capacity and high&#8208;rate performance.








Abstract
Biotechnology can bring new breakthroughs on design and fabrication of energy materials and devices. In this work, a novel and facile biological self&#8208;assembly technology to fabricate multifunctional Rhizopus hyphae carbon fiber (RHCF) and its derivatives on a large scale for electrochemical energy storage is proposed. Crosslinked hollow carbon fibers are successfully prepared by conversion of Rhizopus hyphae, and macroscopic production of centimeter&#8208;level carbon balls consisting of hollow RHCFs is further realized. Moreover, the self&#8208;assembled RHCF balls show strong adsorption characteristics on metal ions and can be converted into a series of derivatives such as RHCF/metal oxides. Notably, the designed RHCF derivatives are demonstrated with powerful multifunctionability as cathode, anode, and separator for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). The RHCF can act as the host material to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form a new RHCF/CoO&#8208;S cathode, an RHCF/Li anode, and an RHCF/PP separator, respectively. Consequently, the optimized LSB full cell presents excellent cycling performance and superior high&#8208;rate capacity (881.3&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 at 1 C). This work provides a new method for large&#8208;scale preparation of hollow carbon fibers and derivatives for advanced energy storage and conversion.

&lt;p&gt;A biological self-assembly technology to fabricate &lt;i&gt;Rhizopus&lt;/i&gt; hyphae carbon fibre (RHCF) and its derivatives is proposed. The RHCFs are multifunctional as the hosts to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form an RHCF-based cathode, anode, and separator, respectively. The as-assembled RHCF-based full cell shows excellent cycling capacity and high-rate performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biotechnology can bring new breakthroughs on design and fabrication of energy materials and devices. In this work, a novel and facile biological self-assembly technology to fabricate multifunctional &lt;i&gt;Rhizopus&lt;/i&gt; hyphae carbon fiber (RHCF) and its derivatives on a large scale for electrochemical energy storage is proposed. Crosslinked hollow carbon fibers are successfully prepared by conversion of &lt;i&gt;Rhizopus&lt;/i&gt; hyphae, and macroscopic production of centimeter-level carbon balls consisting of hollow RHCFs is further realized. Moreover, the self-assembled RHCF balls show strong adsorption characteristics on metal ions and can be converted into a series of derivatives such as RHCF/metal oxides. Notably, the designed RHCF derivatives are demonstrated with powerful multifunctionability as cathode, anode, and separator for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). The RHCF can act as the host material to combine with metal oxide (CoO) and S, Li metal, and a polypropylene (PP) separator to form a new RHCF/CoO-S cathode, an RHCF/Li anode, and an RHCF/PP separator, respectively. Consequently, the optimized LSB full cell presents excellent cycling performance and superior high-rate capacity (881.3&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 C). This work provides a new method for large-scale preparation of hollow carbon fibers and derivatives for advanced energy storage and conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Memory Realization of Eligibility Traces Based on Conductance Drift of Phase Change Memory for Energy&#8208;Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, in&#8208;memory realization of eligibility trace for energy&#8208;efficient reinforcement learning (RL) with outstanding performance in discrete&#8208; and continuous&#8208;state RL tasks is presented. For the first time, the inherent conductance drift of phase change memory is exploited as physical decay function to realize in&#8208;memory eligibility trace, demonstrating excellent performance and significantly enhanced energy efficiency compared with traditional computing platforms.








Abstract
Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown outstanding performance in handling complex tasks in recent years. Eligibility trace (ET), a fundamental and important mechanism in reinforcement learning, records critical states with attenuation and guides the update of policy, which plays a crucial role in accelerating the convergence of RL training. However, ET implementation on conventional digital computing hardware is energy hungry and restricted by the memory wall due to massive calculation of exponential decay functions. Here, in&#8208;memory realization of ET for energy&#8208;efficient reinforcement learning with outstanding performance in discrete&#8208; and continuous&#8208;state RL tasks is demonstrated. For the first time, the inherent conductance drift of phase change memory is exploited as physical decay function to realize in&#8208;memory eligibility trace, demonstrating excellent performance during RL training in various tasks. The spontaneous in&#8208;memory decay computing and storage of policy in the same phase change memory give rise to significantly enhanced energy efficiency compared with traditional graphics processing unit platforms. This work therefore provides a holistic energy and hardware efficient method for both training and inference of reinforcement learning.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Doped Titania Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristors for Crossbar Array Neuromorphic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristor is fabricated using in&#160;situ doping with a custom&#8208;designed NaOH reactant during atomic layer deposition growth, where the resulting resistive&#8208;switching mechanism is based on Na migration. By applying these self&#8208;rectifying Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors to a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;crossbar array, each of the 36&#160;devices are operated individually without crosstalk disturbance.








Abstract
Memristors integrated into a crossbar&#8208;array architecture (CAA) are promising candidates for nonvolatile memory elements in artificial neural networks. However, the relatively low reliability of memristors coupled with crosstalk and sneak currents in CAAs have limited the realization of the full potential of this technology. Here, high&#8208;reliability Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors grown in&#160;situ by atomic layer deposition (ALD) are demonstrated, where reversible Na migration underlies the resistive&#8208;switching mechanism. By employing ALD growth with an aqueous NaOH reactant in deionized water, uniform implantation of Na dopants is achieved in the crystallized TiO2&#160;thin films at 250&#160;&#176;C without post&#8208;annealing. The resulting Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors show electroforming&#8208;free and self&#8208;rectifying resistive&#8208;switching behavior, and they are ideally suited for selectorless CAAs. Effective addressing of selectorless nodes is demonstrated via electrical measurement of individual memristors in a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;crossbar using a read current of less than 1&#160;&#181;A with negligible sneak current at or below the noise level of &#8776;100&#160;pA. Finally, the long&#8208;term potentiation and depression synaptic behavior from these Na&#8208;doped TiO2&#160;memristors achieves greater than 99.1% accuracy for image&#8208;recognition tasks using a convolutional neural network based on the selectorless of crossbar arrays.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8211;Lead Mixed&#8208;Perovskite Solar Cells with Vertical Compositional Gradient</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
4&#8208;Hydrazinobenzoic acid is introduced to enhance the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8211;Pb mixed&#8208;perovskite solar cells. Moreover, a vertical compositional gradient with a continuous change of the Pb/Sn ratio is found in the Sn&#8211;Pb mixed&#8208;perovskite films, leading to graded heterojunctions that are beneficial for photocarrier separation. The resultant devices show a record efficiency up to 22%.








Abstract
Sn&#8211;Pb mixed perovskites with bandgaps in the range of 1.1&#8211;1.4&#160;eV are ideal candidates for single&#8208;junction solar cells to approach the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. However, the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8211;Pb mixed&#8208;perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still lag far behind those of Pb&#8208;based counterparts due to the easy oxidation of Sn2+. Here, a reducing agent 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzoic acid is introduced as an additive along with SnF2 to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+. Meanwhile, a vertical Pb/Sn compositional gradient is formed spontaneously after an antisolvent treatment due to different solubility and crystallization kinetics of Sn&#8208; and Pb&#8208;based perovskites and it can be finely tuned by controlling the antisolvent temperature. Because the band structure of a perovskite is dependent on its composition, graded vertical heterojunctions are constructed in the perovskite films with a compositional gradient, which can enhance photocarrier separation and suppress carrier recombination in the resultant PSCs. Under optimal fabrication conditions, the Sn&#8211;Pb mixed PSCs show power conversion efficiency up to 22% along with excellent stability during light soaking.

         <title>Unusual Site&#8208;Selective Doping in Layered Cathode Strengthens Electrostatic Cohesion of Alkali&#8208;Metal Layer for Practicable Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual site&#8208;selective doping with Cu ion at transition metal site (2a) and unusual Zn ion at Na site (2d) for P2&#8208; Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 can effectively restrain P2&#8211;O2 phase transition and prevent material crack due to the enhanced electrostatic cohesions between two transition metal layers, leading to ultralong life span sodium&#8208;ion full cell.








Abstract
P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 is a dominant cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to its high theoretical capacity and energy density. However, charging P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 to voltages higher than 4.2&#8201;V (vs. Na+/Na) can induce detrimental structural transformation and severe capacity fading. Herein, stable cycling and moisture resistancy of Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 at 4.35&#8201;V (vs. Na+/Na) are achieved through dual&#8208;site doping with Cu ion at transition metal site (2a) and unusual Zn ion at Na site (2d) for the first time. The Cu ion doping in 2a site stabilizes the metal layer, while more importantly, the unusual alkali&#8208;metal site doping by Zn ion serves as O2&#8208;&#63743;Zn2+&#63743;O2&#8208; &#8220;pillar&#8221; for enhancing electrostatic cohesion between two adjacent transition metal layers, preventing the crack of active material along the a&#8211;b&#8208;plane and restraining the generation of O2 phase upon deep desodiation. This unique dual&#8208;site&#8208;doped [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.18Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 cathode exhibits a prominent cyclability with 80.6% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at an ultrahigh rate of 10C, demonstrating its great potential for practical applications. Impressively, the full cell devices with [Na0.67Zn0.05]Ni0.18Cu0.1Mn0.67O2 and commercial hard carbon as cathode and anode, respectively, can deliver a high energy density of 217.9&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 and excellent cycle life over 1000 cycles.

However, charging P2-type Na&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.33&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to voltages higher than 4.2&#8201;V (vs. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na) can induce detrimental structural transformation and severe capacity fading. Herein, stable cycling and moisture resistancy of Na&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.33&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 4.35&#8201;V (vs. Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na) are achieved through dual-site doping with Cu ion at transition metal site (2a) and unusual Zn ion at Na site (2d) for the first time. The Cu ion doping in 2a site stabilizes the metal layer, while more importantly, the unusual alkali-metal site doping by Zn ion serves as O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; &#8220;pillar&#8221; for enhancing electrostatic cohesion between two adjacent transition metal layers, preventing the crack of active material along the &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-plane and restraining the generation of O2 phase upon deep desodiation. This unique dual-site-doped [Na&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;]Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.18&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode exhibits a prominent cyclability with 80.6% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at an ultrahigh rate of 10C, demonstrating its great potential for practical applications. Impressively, the full cell devices with [Na&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;Zn&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;]Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.18&lt;/sub&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.67&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and commercial hard carbon as cathode and anode, respectively, can deliver a high energy density of 217.9&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent cycle life over 1000 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mass&#8208;Manufactured Beam&#8208;Steering Metasurfaces for High&#8208;Speed Full&#8208;Duplex Optical Wireless&#8208;Broadcasting Communications</title>

Assisted by an silicon&#8208;on&#8208;isolator&#8208;based metasurface that can be mass&#8208;manufactured by the complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) process, an ultracompact prototype for full&#8208;duplex metabroadcasting communications is demonstrated, which shows beam&#8208;steering angles up to &#177;40&#176;, 14 broadcasting channels with capacity for downstream and upstream links up to 100 and 10&#160;Gbps for each user channel, and three operating modes for flexible signal switching.








Abstract
Beam&#8208;steering devices, which are at the heart of optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communication links, play an important role in data allocation and exchange. An ideal beam&#8208;steering device features large steering angles, arbitrary channel numbers, reconfigurability, and ultracompactness. However, these criteria have been achieved only partially with conventional beam&#8208;steering devices based on waveguides, micro&#8208;electricalmechanical systems, spatial light modulators, and gratings, which will substantially limit the application of optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communication techniques. In this study, an ultracompact full&#8208;duplex metabroadcasting communication system is designed and experimentally demonstrated, which exhibits beam steering angles up to &#177;40&#176;, 14 broadcasting channels with capacity for downstream and upstream links up to 100 and 10&#160;Gbps for each user channel, three operating modes for flexible signal switching, and metadevice dimensions as small as 2&#160;mm&#160;&#215;&#160;2&#160;mm. In particular, the beam&#8208;steering metadevices are mass&#8208;manufactured by a complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) processing platform, which shows their potential for large&#8208;scale commercial applications. The demonstrated metabroadcasting communication system merges optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communications and metasurfaces, which reduces the complexity of beam&#8208;steering devices while significantly increasing their performance, opening up a new avenue for high&#8208;quality optical wireless&#8208;broadcasting communications.

         <title>Homologous Bromides Treatment for Improving the Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite surface treatment by homologous bromide salts is investigated. It is found that bromides not only passivate surface defects but also penetrate into the perovskite providing bulk passivation. This leads to a large voltage&#160;of 1.24 V&#160;in a 1.63&#160;eV bandgap device and an efficiency of 23.7%&#160;in a 1.56&#160;eV bandgap device.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution&#8208;processed organic&#8211;inorganic mixed halide perovskite solar cells has achieved rapid improvement. However, it is imperative to minimize the voltage deficit (Woc&#160;= Eg/q&#160;&#8722; Voc) for their PCE to approach the theoretical limit. Herein, the strategy of depositing homologous bromide salts on the perovskite surface to achieve a surface and bulk passivation for the fabrication of solar cells with high open&#8208;circuit voltage is reported. Distinct from the conclusions given by previous works, that homologous bromides such as FABr only react with PbI2 to form a large&#8208;bandgap perovskite layer on top of the original perovskite, this work shows that the bromide also penetrates the perovskite film and passivates the perovskite in the bulk. This is confirmed by the small&#8208;bandgap enlargement observed by absorbance and photoluminescence, and the bromide element ratio increasing in the bulk by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry and depth&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, a clear suppression of non&#8208;radiative recombination is confirmed by a variety of characterization methods. This work provides a simple and universal way to reduce the Woc of single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells and it will also shed light on developing other high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, including perovskite&#8208;based tandems and light&#8208;emitting diodes.

Spin&#8208;State Switching
In article number 2105468, Karl Ridier, G&#225;bor Moln&#225;r,  Azzedine Bousseksou, and co&#8208;workers dissect the spatiotemporal dynamics of the spin transition in crystals of  [Fe(HB(1,2,4&#8208;triazol&#8208;1&#8208;yl)3)2], using pump&#8211;probe optical microscopy. On the sub&#8208;millisecond timescale, the response of the crystal to the laser pulse involves a homogeneous and gradual molecular conversion process, as if there were no hysteresis loop, whereas the macroscopic switching is delayed to the millisecond timescale. These results provide guidance for achieving efficient photocontrol of bistable materials.

Tunable Metamaterials
In article number 2109032, Stephan W. Anderson, Xin Zhang, and co&#8208;workers exploit auxetic structures with a negative Poisson's ratio, exhibiting counterintuitive behaviors, to design mechanically tunable metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz (MHz) frequencies. Optimized for their application to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the proposed tunable metamaterials serve to enhance local magnetic fields and increase the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio in magnetic resonance image around 4.5 times.

Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons
Launching, controlling, and focusing of in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in van der Waals &#945;&#8208;MoO3 with geometrically designed curved gold plasmonic antennas are realized by Huanjun Chen, Shaozhi Deng, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2104164. By engineering the curvature of the antenna extremity, it is possible to tune the focal lengths and lateral sizes of the focal points. This study can open up new avenues for planar nanophotonic devices in the mid&#8208;infrared region.

2D Janus Monolayers
In article number 2106222, Mete Atature, Sefaattin Tongay, and co&#8208;workers use an in situ deterministic plasma technique to enable the synthesis of high&#8208;quality excitonic grade 2D SWSe, SMoSe, and other 2D Janus layers. Integrated spectrometers allow for the collection of structural, optical, and phononic properties during the growth. Through time&#8208;resolved studies, the team offers the first insights into the growth process and minute control provides the first with excitonic grade Janus layers.

Orientation&#8208;Dependent Color
In article number 2104874, Ahmad Rafsanjani, Andr&#233; R. Studart, and co&#8208;workers report soft architectured composites that display striking orientation&#8208;dependent color changes when stretched. The color change results from the rotation of pre&#8208;aligned reflective coated platelets embedded in a soft polymer matrix in a well&#8208;defined architecture. A soft robotic actuator that turns from fully opaque to reflective green upon inflation is illustrated.

         <title>Plant&#8208;Based Structures as an Opportunity to Engineer Optical Functions in Next&#8208;Generation Light Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a critical assessment of lignocellulosics for engineering optically functional materials for smart devices. It discusses the effects of fibrillation, fibril alignment, densification, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;patterning, and compositing on targeted optical properties, such as transparency, haze, luminescence, UV&#8208;absorption, and structural colors. The scope covers the main plant&#8208;based structural materials, as well as non&#8208;lignocellulosic additives bearing an optical function.








Abstract
This review addresses the reconstruction of structural plant components (cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses) into materials displaying advanced optical properties. The strategies to isolate the main building blocks are discussed, and the effects of fibrillation, fibril alignment, densification, self&#8208;assembly, surface&#8208;patterning, and compositing are presented considering their role in engineering optical performance. Then, key elements that enable lignocellulosic to be translated into materials that present optical functionality, such as transparency, haze, reflectance, UV&#8208;blocking, luminescence, and structural colors, are described. Mapping the optical landscape that is accessible from lignocellulosics is shown as an essential step toward their utilization in smart devices. Advanced materials built from sustainable resources, including those obtained from industrial or agricultural side streams, demonstrate enormous promise in optoelectronics due to their potentially lower cost, while meeting or even exceeding current demands in performance. The requirements are summarized for the production and application of plant&#8208;based optically functional materials in different smart material applications and the review is concluded with a perspective about this active field of knowledge.

         <title>Polyprodrug Nanomedicines: An Emerging Paradigm for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyprodrug nanomedicines have great potential in cancer therapy owing to their well&#8208;controlled composition and high drug loading by direct polymerization of therapeutic monomers. Recent advances in the development of polyprodrug nanomedicines are summarized to provide deep insights into the design and preparation of polyprodrug nanomedicines for efficient cancer therapy.








Abstract
Nanomedicines have the potential to provide advanced therapeutic strategies in combating tumors. Polymer&#8208;prodrug&#8208;based nanomedicines are particularly attractive in cancer therapies owing to the maximum drug loading, prolonged blood circulation, and reduced premature leakage and side effects in comparison with conventional nanomaterials. However, the difficulty in precisely tuning the composition and drug loading of polymer&#8211;drug conjugates leads to batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch variations of the prodrugs, thus significantly restricting their clinical translation. Polyprodrug nanomedicines inherit the numerous intrinsic advantages of polymer&#8211;drug conjugates and exhibit well&#8208;controlled composition and drug loading via direct polymerization of therapeutic monomers, representing a promising nanomedicine for clinical tumor therapies. In this review, recent advances in the development of polyprodrug nanomedicines are summarized for tumor elimination. Various types of polyprodrug nanomedicines and the corresponding properties are first summarized. The unique advantages of polyprodrug nanomedicines and their key roles in various tumor therapies are further highlighted. Finally, current challenges and the perspectives on future research of polyprodrug nanomedicines are discussed.

         <dc:description>
Bioinspired by the natural world, versatile chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems have been fabricated and functionalized, and they exhibit excellent potential in biomedical applications by providing diverse prototypes/products. It is believed that such devices hold great promise to improve the lives by significantly improving patient/user comfort, convenience, and compliance, indicating high clinical and industrial values.








Abstract
Smart attachable systems have attracted much attention owing to their capabilities in terms of body performance evaluation, disease diagnostics, and drug delivery. Recent advances in chemical and engineering techniques provide many opportunities to improve device fabrication and applications owing to the advantages of being lightweight and easy to control as well as their battery absence and functional diversity. This review highlights the latest developments in the field of chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems, which are mainly inspired by the natural world. Their applications for real&#8208;time monitoring, point&#8208;of&#8208;care sampling, biomarker detection, and controlled release are discussed thoroughly with respect to specific products/prototypes. The perspectives of the field, including persistence guarantee, burden reduction, and personality improvement, are also discussed. It is believed that chemical engineering&#8208;based lightweight and miniaturized attachable systems have good potential in both clinical and industrial fields, indicating a large potential to improve human lives in the near future.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Porous Organic Polymers for Separation, Sensing, and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 6, February 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycles as an emerging class of building blocks are used for porous organic polymers owing to their easy functionalization, unique host&#8211;guest properties, modifiable conformations, and tunable chemistry. Facilitated by these features, macrocycle&#8208;based porous organic polymers have attracted considerable attentions in the construction of advanced porous materials and excelled in adsorptive separation, optical sensing, and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
With the rapid development of materials science, porous organic polymers (POPs) have received remarkable attentions because of their unique properties such as the exceptionally high surface area and flexible molecular design. The ability to incorporate specific functions in a precise manner makes POPs promising platforms for a myriad of applications in molecular adsorption, separation, and catalysis. Therefore, many different types of POPs have been rationally designed and synthesized to expand the scope of advanced materials, endowing them with distinct structures and properties. Recently, supramolecular macrocycles with excellent host&#8211;guest complexation abilities are emerging as powerful crosslinkers for developing novel POPs with hierarchical structures and improved performance, which can be well&#8208;organized at different spatial scales. Macrocycle&#8208;based POPs could have unusual porous, adsorptive, and optical properties when compared to their nonmacrocycle&#8208;incorporated counterparts. This cooperation provides valuable insights for the molecular&#8208;level understanding of skeletal complexity and diversity. Here, the research advances of macrocycle&#8208;based POPs are aptly summarized by showing their syntheses, properties, and applications in terms of separation, sensing, and catalysis. Finally, the current challenging issues in this exciting research field are delineated and a comprehensive outlook is offered for their future directions.

An aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for 3D printing to precisely create 3D architectures with high design freedom and a post&#8208;printing freeze&#8211;thawing treatment protocol is proposed to transform the as&#8208;printed objects into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale, enabling customizable applications.








Abstract
The ongoing miniaturization of devices and development of wireless and implantable technologies demand electromagnetic interference (EMI)&#8208;shielding materials with customizability. Additive manufacturing of conductive polymer hydrogels with favorable conductivity and biocompatibility can offer new opportunities for EMI&#8208;shielding applications. However, simultaneously achieving high conductivity, design freedom, and shape fidelity in 3D printing of conductive polymer hydrogels is still very challenging. Here, an aqueous Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;functionalized poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate ink is developed for extrusion printing to create 3D objects with arbitrary geometries, and a freeze&#8211;thawing protocol is proposed to transform the printed objects directly into highly conductive and robust hydrogels with high shape fidelity on both the macro&#8208; and microscale. The as&#8208;obtained hydrogel exhibits a high conductivity of 1525.8 S m&#8211;1 at water content up to 96.6 wt% and also satisfactory mechanical properties with flexibility, stretchability, and fatigue resistance. Furthermore, the use of the printed hydrogel for customizable EMI&#8208;shielding applications is demonstrated. The proposed easy&#8208;to&#8208;manufacture approach, along with the highlighted superior properties, expands the potential of conductive polymer hydrogels in future customizable applications and represents a real breakthrough from the current state of the art.

         <title>Free&#8208;Standing Nanofilm Electrode Arrays for Long&#8208;Term Stable Neural Interfacings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes are developed. The NEAs are encapsulated into biodissolvable polymer carriers through an efficient elastocapillary self&#8208;assembly process, enabling their reliable implantation into deep brain tissues. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months.








Abstract
Flexible neural electrodes integrated on micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates offer important opportunities for improving the stability of neuronal activity recordings during cognitive processes. However, the bending stiffness of micrometer&#8208;thick polymer substrates is typically two orders of magnitude higher than that of nanofilm electrodes, making it a limiting factor in electrode&#8208;tissue interfacings. Here, this limitation is overcome by developing self&#8208;assembled nanofilm electrode arrays (NEAs) that consist of high&#8208;density, free&#8208;standing gold nanofilm electrodes. Chronically implanted NEAs can form intimate and innervated interfaces with neural tissue, enabling stable neuronal activity recordings across multiple brain regions over several months. As an application example, the activities of the same neuronal populations are tracked across odor discrimination reversal learning and it is illustrated how dorsal striatal neurons represent and update stimulus&#8208;outcome associations across multiple timescales. The results underscore the potential of free&#8208;standing nanoscale materials for interfacing biological systems over long terms.

         <title>Soluble Organic Cathodes Enable Long Cycle Life, High Rate, and Wide&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble organic cathodes are demonstrated with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life, excellent rate capability, and a wide operation temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on bi&#8208;functional gel polymer electrolytes, which can eliminate the shuttling of the soluble organic electrode materials through molecular sieving and charge repulsion while maintaining a fast reaction kinetics.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials free of rare transition metal elements are promising for sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and environmentally benign battery chemistries. However, severe shuttling effect caused by the dissolution of active materials in liquid electrolytes results in fast capacity decay, limiting their practical applications. Here, using a gel polymer electrolyte (GPE) that is in situ formed on Nafion&#8208;coated separators, the shuttle reaction of organic electrodes is eliminated while maintaining the electrochemical performance. The synergy of physical confinement by GPE with tunable polymer structure and charge repulsion of the Nafion&#8208;coated separator substantially prevents the soluble organic electrode materials with different molecular sizes from shuttling. A soluble small&#8208;molecule organic electrode material of 1,3,5&#8208;tri(9,10&#8208;anthraquinonyl)benzene demonstrates exceptional electrochemical performance with an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 10&#8239;000 cycles, excellent rate capability of 203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 C, and a wide working temperature range from &#8722;70 to 100&#160;&#176;C based on the solid&#8211;liquid conversion chemistry, which outperforms all previously reported organic cathode materials. The shielding capability of GPE can be designed and tailored toward organic electrodes with different molecular sizes, thus providing a universal resolution to the shuttling effect that all soluble electrode materials suffer.

         <title>Efficiency of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Sensitized Triplet Upconversion Doubled in Three&#8208;Component System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the first three&#8208;component metal&#8208;free photon upconversion system on the upconversion efficiency and threshold light intensity is studied herein. While the efficiency is doubled, the threshold light intensity is also increased. The performance enhancement can be attributed to more efficient energy transfer from the sensitizer to the intermediate acceptor in combination with a high quantum yield emitter molecule.








Abstract
As in many fields, the most exciting endeavors in photon upconversion research focus on increasing the efficiency (upconversion quantum yield) and performance (anti&#8208;Stokes shift) while diminishing the cost of production. In this vein, studies employing metal&#8208;free thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers have garnered increased interest. Here, for the first time, the strategy of ternary photon upconversion is utilized with the TADF sensitizer 2,4,5,6&#8208;tetrakis(carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)isophthalonitrile (4CzIPN), resulting in a doubling of the upconversion quantum yield in comparison to the binary system employing p&#8208;terphenyl as the emitter. In this ternary blend, the sensitizer 4CzIPN is paired with an intermediate acceptor, 1&#8208;methylnaphthalene, in addition to the emitter molecule, p&#8208;terphenyl, yielding a normalized upconversion quantum yield of 7.6% while maintaining the 0.83&#160;eV anti&#8208;Stokes shift. These results illustrate the potential benefits of utilizing this strategy of energy&#8208;funneling, previously used only with heavy&#8208;metal based sensitizers, to increase the performance of these photon upconversion systems.

         <title>Boosting Piezoelectricity under Illumination via the Bulk Photovoltaic Effect and the Schottky Barrier Effect in BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancement of piezoelectricity by external stimuli is advantageous for its simple and in situ control, and compatibility with other functionalities. In this work, light is shown to be a powerful control parameter to induce a sevenfold enhancement of piezoelectric coefficient in BiFeO3 single crystals due to the bulk photovoltaic and Schottky barrier effects, offering potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity is a key functionality induced by conversion between mechanical and electrical energy. Enhancement of piezoelectricity in ferroelectrics often has been realized by complicated synthetical approaches to host unique structural boundaries, so&#8208;called morphotropic phase boundaries. While structural approaches are well&#8208;known, enhancing piezoelectricity by external stimuli has yet to be clearly explored, despite their advantages of offering not only simple and in situ control without any prior processing requirement, but compatibility with other functionalities. Here, it is shown that light is a powerful control parameter to enhance the piezoelectric property of BiFeO3 single crystals. A series of measurements based on piezoresponse force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy, under illumination, reveal a locally enhanced effective piezoelectric coefficient, dzz, eventually showing almost a sevenfold increase. This phenomenon is explained with theoretical models by introducing the two main underlying mechanisms attributed to the bulk photovoltaic effect and Schottky barrier effect, involving the role of open&#8208;circuit voltage and photocharge carrier density. These results provide key insights to light&#8208;induced piezoelectricity enhancement, offering its potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.

These results provide key insights to light-induced piezoelectricity enhancement, offering its potential for multifunctional optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Sprayed Starvation/Chemodynamic Therapeutic Gel for Post&#8208;Surgical Treatment of IDH1 (R132H) Glioma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel of GOx@MnCaP@fibrin is developed for post&#8208;surgical treatment of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) (R132H) glioma, through depleting intratumoral glucose and generating high levels of reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Complete resection of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) (R132H) glioma is unfeasible and the classic post&#8208;surgical chemo/radiotherapy suffers from high recurrence and low survival rate. IDH1 (R132H) cells are sensitive to low concentrations of glucose and high concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inherent metabolism reprograming. Hence, a starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel is developed to combat residual IDH1 (R132H) tumor cells after surgery. Briefly, glucose oxidase (GOx) is mineralized with manganese&#8208;doped calcium phosphate to form GOx@MnCaP nanoparticles, which are encapsulated into the fibrin gel (GOx@MnCaP@fibrin). After spraying gel in the surgical cavity, GOx catalyzes the oxidation of glucose in residual IDH1 (R132H) cells and produces H2O2. The generated H2O2 is further converted into highly lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) by a Mn2+&#8208;mediated Fenton&#8208;like reaction to further kill the residual IDH1 (R132H) cells. The as&#8208;prepared starvation/chemodynamic therapeutic gel shows much higher therapeutic efficacy toward IDH1 (R132H) cells than IDH1 (WT) cells, and achieves long&#8208;term survival.

         <title>Shielding Ferritin with a Biomineralized Shell Enables Efficient Modulation of Tumor Microenvironment and Targeted Delivery of Diverse Therapeutic Agents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible ferritin&#8208;based platform is developed through biomineralization, in which calcium phosphate is generated on the ferritin surface. Such a &#8220;shielding&#8221; strategy not only enables efficient drug delivery to tumor and powerful tumor microenvironment modulation, but also brings additional functionalities by loading diverse drugs in the cavity and the shell for potent antitumor effects on multiple cell and patient&#8208;derived xenografts.








Abstract
Ferritin (Fn) is considered a promising carrier for targeted delivery to tumors, but the successful application in vivo has not been fully achieved yet. Herein, strong evidence is provided that the Fn receptor is expressed in liver tissues, resulting in an intercept effect in regards to tumor delivery. Building on these observations, a biomineralization technology is rationally designed to shield Fn using a calcium phosphate (CaP) shell, which can improve the delivery performance by reducing Fn interception in the liver while re&#8208;exposing it in acidic tumors. Moreover, the selective dissolution of the CaP shell not only neutralizes the acidic microenvironment but also induces the intratumoral immunomodulation and calcification. Upon multiple cell line and patient&#8208;derived xenografts, it is demonstrated that the elaboration of the highly flexible Fn@CaP chassis by loading a chemotherapeutic drug into the Fn cavity confers potent antitumor effects, and additionally encapsulating a photosensitizer into the outer shell enables a combined chemo&#8208;photothermal therapy for complete suppression of advanced tumors. Altogether, these results support Fn@CaP as a new nanoplatform for efficient modulation of the tumor microenvironment and targeted delivery of diverse therapeutic agents.

         <title>Immune Checkpoint Ligand Bioengineered Schwann Cells as Antigen&#8208;Specific Therapy for Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>

A translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 and cluster of differentiation 86&#8208;functionalized Schwann cells to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis is developed.








Abstract
Failure to establish immune tolerance leads to the development of autoimmune disease. The ability to regulate autoreactive T cells without inducing systemic immunosuppression represents a major challenge in the development of new strategies to treat autoimmune disease. Here, a translational method for bioengineering programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#8208; and cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86)&#8208;functionalized mouse Schwann cells (SCs) to prevent and ameliorate multiple sclerosis (MS) in established mouse models of chronic and relapsing&#8208;remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is described. It is shown that the intravenous (i.v.) administration of immune checkpoint ligand functionalized mouse SCs modifies the course of disease and ameliorates EAE. Further, it is found that such bioengineered mouse SCs inhibit the differentiation of myelin&#8208;specific helper T cells into pathogenic T helper type&#8208;1 (Th1) and type&#8208;17 (Th17) cells, promote the development of tolerogenic myelin&#8208;specific regulatory T (Treg) cells, and resolve inflammatory central nervous system microenvironments without inducing systemic immunosuppression.

         <title>Tuning the Transport Properties of Gases in Porous Graphene Membranes with Controlled Pore Size and Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gas&#8208;separation membranes based on porous graphene (PG) offer ultimate permeance; however, they show low selectivity. The pore&#8208;narrowing approach, via gold deposition onto PG, allows both the thickness and the pore size of the membrane to be tuned to obtain a high number of pores below 3&#160;nm, enabling increased gas&#8211;surface interactions and molecular sieving for high gas selectivity and permeance.








Abstract
Porous graphene membranes have emerged as promising alternatives for gas&#8208;separation applications due to their atomic thickness enabling ultrahigh permeance, but they suffer from low gas selectivity. Whereas decreasing the pore size below 3&#160;nm is expected to increase the gas selectivity due to molecular sieving, it is rather challenging to generate a large number of uniform small pores on the graphene surface. Here, a pore&#8208;narrowing approach via gold deposition onto porous graphene surface is introduced to tune the pore size and thickness of the membrane to achieve a large number of small pores. Through the systematic approach, the ideal combination is determined as pore size below 3&#160;nm, obtained at the thickness of 100&#160;nm, to attain high selectivity and high permeance. The resulting membrane shows a H2/CO2 separation factor of 31.3 at H2 permeance of 2.23&#160;&#215; 105 GPU (1 GPU = 3.35&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;10&#160;mol s&#8722;1 m&#8722;2 Pa&#8722;1), which is the highest value reported to date in the 105 GPU permeance range. This result is explained by comparing the predicted binding energies of gas molecules with the Au surface, &#8722;5.3&#160;versus &#8722;21&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 for H2 and CO2, respectively, increased surface&#8211;gas interactions and molecular&#8208;sieving effect with decreasing pore size.

A super&#8208;boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film. The plasmonic effect, super&#8208;boosted by microfocusing the incident light, by MLA leads to superior sensitivity and responsivity of devices at weak near&#8208;infrared excitation powers.








Abstract
A super&#8208;boosted hybrid plasmonic upconversion (UC) architecture comprising a hierarchical plasmonic upconversion (HPU) film and a polymeric microlens array (MLA) film is proposed for efficient photodetection at a wavelength of 1550&#160;nm. Plasmonic metasurfaces and Au core&#8211;satellite nanoassembly (CSNA) films can strongly induce a more effective plasmonic effect by providing numerous hot spots in an intense local electromagnetic field up to wavelengths exceeding 1550&#160;nm. Hence, significant UC emission enhancement is realized via the amplified plasmonic coupling of an HPU film comprising an Au CSNA and UC nanoparticles. Furthermore, an MLA polymer film is synergistically coupled with the HPU film, thereby focusing the incident near&#8208;infrared light in the micrometer region, including the plasmonic nanostructure area. Consequently, the plasmonic effect super&#8208;boosted by microfocusing the incident light, significantly lowers the detectable power limit of a device, resulting in superior sensitivity and responsivity at weak excitation powers. Finally, a triple&#8208;cation perovskite&#8208;based photodetector coupled with the hybrid plasmonic UC film exhibits the excellent values of responsivity and detectivity of 9.80&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and 8.22&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at a weak power density of &#8776;0.03&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, demonstrating that the device performance is enhanced by more than 104 magnitudes over a reference sample.

         <title>A Hydrogel Ionic Circuit Based High&#8208;Intensity Iontophoresis Device for Intraocular Macromolecule and Nanoparticle Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iontophoresis device based on a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC) is developed for highly effective intraocular delivery of macromolecule and nanoparticle drugs. The HIC&#8208;based device allows safe application of high current intensities (up to 87 mA cm&#8722;2) to the ocular tissue. Moreover, therapeutically effective concentrations of bevacizumab and dexamethasone in a nanoparticle formulation can be delivered to target tissues within 10&#8211;20 min of iontophoresis application.








Abstract
Iontophoresis is an electrical&#8208;current&#8208;based, noninvasive drug&#8208;delivery technology, which is particularly suitable for intraocular drug delivery. Current ocular iontophoresis devices use low current intensities that significantly limit macromolecule and nanoparticle (NP) delivery efficiency. Increasing current intensity leads to ocular tissue damage. Here, an iontophoresis device based on a hydrogel ionic circuit (HIC), for high&#8208;efficiency intraocular macromolecule and NP delivery, is described. The HIC&#8208;based device is capable of minimizing Joule heating, effectively buffering electrochemical (EC) reaction&#8208;generated pH changes, and absorbing electrode overpotential&#8208;induced heating. As a result, the device allows safe application of high current intensities (up to 87&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, more than 10 times higher than current ocular iontophoresis devices) to the eye with minimal ocular cell death and tissue damage. The high&#8208;intensity iontophoresis significantly enhances macromolecule and NP delivery to both the anterior and posterior segments by up to 300 times compared to the conventional iontophoresis. Therapeutically effective concentrations of bevacizumab and dexamethasone are delivered to target tissue compartments within 10&#8211;20&#160;min of iontophoresis application. This study highlights the significant safety enhancement enabled by an HIC&#8208;based device design and the potential of the device to deliver therapeutic doses of macromolecule and NP ophthalmic drugs within a clinically relevant time frame.

         <title>Multivalent Noncovalent Interfacing and Cross&#8208;Linking of Supramolecular Tubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical synthetic supramolecular network is formed and interfaced to biomimetic surfaces using purely noncovalent interactions. Supramolecular synthetic copolymer bearing biotin linking group forms supramolecular networks upon addition of streptavidin, and can bind to streptavidin&#8208;modified surfaces. The architectures of these networks can be tuned by changing the biotin ratio in supramolecular copolymer and the concentration of streptavidin.








Abstract
Natural supramolecular filaments have the ability to cross&#8208;link with each other and to interface with the cellular membrane via biomolecular noncovalent interactions. This behavior allows them to form complex networks within as well as outside the cell, i.e., the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, respectively. The potential of artificial supramolecular polymers to interact through specific noncovalent interactions has so far only seen limited exploration due to the dynamic nature of supramolecular interactions. Here, a system of synthetic supramolecular tubes that cross&#8208;link forming supramolecular networks, and at the same time bind to biomimetic surfaces by the aid of noncovalent streptavidin&#8211;biotin linkages, is demonstrated. The architecture of the networks can be engineered by controlling the density of the biotin moiety at the exterior of the tubes as well as by the concentration of the streptavidin. The presented strategy provides a pathway for designing adjustable artificial supramolecular superstructures, which can potentially yield more complex biomimetic adaptive materials.

         <title>Lateral Fully Organic P&#8211;N Diodes Created in a Single Donor&#8211;Acceptor Copolymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lateral fully organic P&#8211;N diodes can be created in a single polymer, which exhibits a high rectification ratio &#8776;2100 and a high current density 3.83 A cm&#8722;2. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.








Abstract
P&#8211;N junctions exist in many solid&#8208;state organic devices, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices. Creating P&#8211;N junctions by bulk chemical doping in a single organic material (like silicon doped by boron and phosphorus) may capitalize the vast scientific and technological groundwork established in the inorganic semiconducting field. However, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;organic&#8208;material P&#8211;N junctions are seldom reported, because the diffusion of the dopant counterions often leads to transient rectification properties. Herein, a new type of lateral fully organic diodes created in single donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) copolymer films with only one P&#8208;type dopant is reported. The achieved lateral devices exhibit high current densities of &#8776;3.83 A cm&#8722;2 and a high rectification ratio of &#8776;2100, which are beyond the requirements for high&#8208;frequency identification tags. The P&#8208; to N&#8208;type polarity switching mechanism is proposed after spectroscopic and structural tests. Decent stability of the organic diode is obtained, which is due to the long channel length and low diffusion speed of the large size of dopants. This work opens the opportunities to create P&#8211;N junctions in ways of silicon&#8208;based inorganic semiconductors and promises new opportunities for integrating organic materials for flexible and printable organic devices.

         <title>Cluster Fragments in Amorphous Phosphorus and their Evolution under Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning&#8208;driven simulations provide new insight into the structure of amorphous phosphorus. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings and more complex cluster fragments. The simulation results help to understand previous experimental observations at ambient and high pressure, and they provide an example of the emerging application of machine&#8208;learned potentials to complex functional materials.








Abstract
Amorphous phosphorus (a&#8208;P) has long attracted interest because of its complex atomic structure, and more recently as an anode material for batteries. However, accurately describing and understanding a&#8208;P at the atomistic level remains a challenge. Here, it is shown that large&#8208;scale molecular&#8208;dynamics simulations, enabled by a machine&#8208;learning (ML)&#8208;based interatomic potential for phosphorus, can give new insights into the atomic structure of a&#8208;P and how this structure changes under pressure. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five&#8208;membered rings, as well as more complex seven&#8208; and eight&#8208;atom clusters. Changes in the simulated first sharp diffraction peak during compression and decompression indicate a hysteresis in the recovery of medium&#8208;range order. An analysis of cluster fragments, large rings, and voids suggests that moderate pressure (up to about 5&#160;GPa) does not break the connectivity of clusters, but higher pressure does. The work provides a starting point for further computational studies of the structure and properties of a&#8208;P, and more generally it exemplifies how ML&#8208;driven modeling can accelerate the understanding of disordered functional materials.

The simulation results help to understand previous experimental observations at ambient and high pressure, and they provide an example of the emerging application of machine-learned potentials to complex functional materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amorphous phosphorus (a-P) has long attracted interest because of its complex atomic structure, and more recently as an anode material for batteries. However, accurately describing and understanding a-P at the atomistic level remains a challenge. Here, it is shown that large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations, enabled by a machine-learning (ML)-based interatomic potential for phosphorus, can give new insights into the atomic structure of a-P and how this structure changes under pressure. The structural model so obtained contains abundant five-membered rings, as well as more complex seven- and eight-atom clusters. Changes in the simulated first sharp diffraction peak during compression and decompression indicate a hysteresis in the recovery of medium-range order. An analysis of cluster fragments, large rings, and voids suggests that moderate pressure (up to about 5&#160;GPa) does not break the connectivity of clusters, but higher pressure does. The work provides a starting point for further computational studies of the structure and properties of a-P, and more generally it exemplifies how ML-driven modeling can accelerate the understanding of disordered functional materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Two Birds with One Stone: Interfacial Engineering of Multifunctional Janus Separator for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one multifunctional Janus separator is prepared using interfacial engineering strategies to improve the performance of Li&#8211;S batteries. The reversibility of the Li&#8208;metal anode is greatly enhanced and the shuttle effect of the sulfur cathode is effectively suppressed. This work offers a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the metallic Li anode and the sulfur cathode in Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8208;dendrite growth and unsatisfactory sulfur cathode performance are two core problems that restrict the practical applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Here, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design concept for a Janus separator, enabled by the interfacial engineering strategy, is proposed to improve the performance of LSBs. At the interface of the anode/separator, the thin functionalized composite layer contains high&#8208;elastic&#8208;modulus and high&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity boron nitride nanosheets and oxygen&#8208;group&#8208;grafted cellulose nanofibers (BNNs@CNFs), by which the formation of &#8220;hot spots&#8221; can be effectively avoid, the Li&#8208;ion flux homogenized, and dendrite growth suppressed. Meanwhile, at the interface between the separator and the cathode, the homogenously exposed single&#8208;atom Ru on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO@Ru SAs) can &#8220;trap&#8221; polysulfides and reduce the activation energy to boost their conversion kinetics. Consequently, the LSBs show a high capacity of 460 mAh g&#8211;1 at 5C and ultrastable cycling performance with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.046% per cycle over 800 cycles. To further demonstrate the practical prospect of the Janus separator, a lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell using the Janus separator delivers a cell&#8208;level energy density of 310.2&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1. This study provides a promising strategy to simultaneously tackle the challenges facing the Li anode and the sulfur cathode in LSBs.

         <title>Lattice Polarity Manipulation of Quasi&#8208;vdW Epitaxial GaN Films on Graphene Through Interface Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manipulation of the lattice polarity of quasi&#8208;vdW epitaxial GaN on graphene through controlling the interface atomic configuration is reported. This polarity&#8208;control rule is not affected by the growth method and is free of either crystalline or non&#8208;crystalline substrates. It makes the epitaxy of III&#8208;nitrides with preferred lattice polarity possible and improves the ability to fabricate advanced semiconductor devices.








Abstract
Quasi van der Waals epitaxy, a pioneering epitaxy of sp3&#8208;hybridized semiconductor films on sp2&#8208;hybridized 2D materials, provides a way, in principle, to achieve single&#8208;crystal epilayers with preferred atom configurations that are free of substrate. Unfortunately, this has not been experimentally confirmed in the case of the hexagonal semiconductor III&#8208;nitride epilayer until now. Here, it is reported that the epitaxy of gallium nitride (GaN) on graphene can tune the atom arrangement (lattice polarity) through manipulation of the interface atomic configuration, where GaN films with gallium and nitrogen polarity are achieved by forming C&#63743;O&#63743;N&#63743;Ga(3) or C&#63743;O&#63743;Ga&#63743;N(3) configurations, respectively, on artificial C&#63743;O surface dangling bonds by atomic oxygen pre&#8208;irradiation on trilayer graphene. Furthermore, an aluminum nitride buffer/interlayer leads to unique metal polarity due to the formation of an AlON thin layer in a growth environment containing trace amounts of oxygen, which explains the open question of why those reported wurtzite III&#8208;nitride films on 2D materials always exhibit metal polarity. The reported atomic modulation through interface manipulation provides an effective model for hexagonal nitride semiconductor layers grown on graphene, which definitely promotes the development of novel semiconductor devices.

Electrostatic&#8211;mechanical, synergistic, in situ, multiscale tissue adhesion for various bioelectronic applications is demonstrated. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored elastomer&#8211;hydrogel combinatory adhesive architecture is proposed. Reliable real&#8208;time measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are also successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Recent studies on soft adhesives have sought to deeply understand how their chemical or mechanical structures interact strongly with living tissues. The aim is to optimally address the unmet needs of patients with acute or chronic diseases. Synergistic adhesion involving both electrostatic (hydrogen bonds) and mechanical interactions (capillarity&#8208;assisted suction stress) seems to be effective in overcoming the challenges associated with long&#8208;term unstable coupling to tissues. Here, an electrostatically and mechanically synergistic mechanism of residue&#8208;free, sustainable, in situ tissue adhesion by implementing hybrid multiscale architectonics. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored multiscale combinatory adhesive is proposed. The model supports the experimental results that the thermodynamically controlled swelling of the nanoporous hydrogel embedded in the hierarchical elastomeric structure enhances biofluid&#8208;insensitive, sustainable, in situ adhesion to diverse soft, slippery, and wet organ surfaces, as well as clean detachment in the peeling direction. Based on the robust tissue adhesion capability, universal reliable measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues, ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, the muscle, brain, and human skin, are successfully demonstrated.

         <title>Atomic Fe&#8211;N4/C in Flexible Carbon Fiber Membrane as Binder&#8208;Free Air Cathode for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries with Stable Cycling over 1000 h</title>

         <dc:description>
Flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon membrane with atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/C sites is constructed and used as electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. In virtue of the hierarchical porous structures and optimized local atomic configurations, the as&#8208;synthesized noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free membrane as binder&#8208;free air cathode demonstrates a stable cycling over 1000 h for Zn&#8211;air battery.








Abstract
Noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free, durable, and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) are vital for rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a flexible and free&#8208;standing carbon fiber membrane immobilized with atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N4/C catalysts (Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3) is synthesized and used as air cathode for ZABs. The intertwined fibers with hierarchical nanopores facilitate the gas transportation, electrolyte infiltration and electron transfer. The large specific surface area exposes a high concentration of Fe&#8211;N4/C sites embedded in the carbon matrix. Modulation of local atomic configurations by sulfur doping in Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst leads to excellent ORR and enhanced OER activities. The as&#8208;synthesized Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst demonstrates a positive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#160;V and a small Tafel slope of 70.82&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (0.86&#160;V/94.74&#160;mV dec&#8211;1) and most reported M&#8211;Nx/C (M = Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover the crucial role of S doping in regulating ORR and OER activities. The liquid&#8208;state ZABs with Fe/SNCFs&#8208;NH3 catalyst as air cathode deliver a large peak power density of 255.84&#160;mW cm&#8211;2 and long&#8208;term cycle durability over 1000 h. Solid&#8208;state ZAB shows stable cycling at various flat/bent/flat states, demonstrating great prospects in flexible electronic device applications.

The as-synthesized Fe/SNCFs-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst demonstrates a positive half-wave potential of 0.89&#160;V and a small Tafel slope of 70.82&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (0.86&#160;V/94.74&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and most reported M&#8211;N&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;/C (M = Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover the crucial role of S doping in regulating ORR and OER activities. The liquid-state ZABs with Fe/SNCFs-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst as air cathode deliver a large peak power density of 255.84&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; and long-term cycle durability over 1000 h. Solid-state ZAB shows stable cycling at various flat/bent/flat states, demonstrating great prospects in flexible electronic device applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Controlled Nucleation and Shaping of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling self&#8208;assembly is fundamentally challenging with implications for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Herein, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Light patterns enable positioning of composites in preassigned locations, sculpting of fine details and contours, and commanding the assembly of lines over millimeters with micrometer precision, hence combining the power of photolithography with self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Controlling self&#8208;assembly of nanocomposites is a fundamental challenge with exciting implications for next&#8208;generation advanced functional materials. Precursors for composites can be generated photochemically, but limited insight in the underlying processes has hindered precise hands&#8208;on guidance. In this study, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Carbonate is generated photochemically with UV light to steer the precipitation of nanocomposites of barium carbonate nanocrystals and amorphous silica (BaCO3/SiO2). Using a custom&#8208;built optical setup, the self&#8208;assembly process is controlled by optimizing the photogeneration, diffusion, reaction, and precipitation of the carbonate species, using the radius and intensity of the UV&#8208;light irradiated area and reaction temperature. Exploiting this control, nucleation is induced and the contours and individual features of the growing composite are sculpted according to micrometer&#8208;defined light patterns. Moreover, moving light patterns are exploited to create a constant carbonate concentration at the growth front to draw lines of nanocomposites with constant width over millimeters with micrometer precision. Light&#8208;directed generation of local gradients opens previously unimaginable opportunities for guiding self&#8208;assembly into functional materials.

         <title>The Quest for Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;cycling potassium&#8208;ion battery is demonstrated, using a K2MnFe(CN)6 Prussian white cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode, and a concentrated electrolyte. This full cell delivers a high energy density of 260&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and stable cycling over 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) have attracted wide interest for energy storage because of the abundance of the electrode materials involved; however, their electrochemical performances are far behind what can be achieved from lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) or sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, key promising electrode and electrolyte materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries are identified, the coupled electrochemical reactions in the cell are investigated, and the compatibility between different materials is demonstrated to play the most important role. K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode can deliver a high capacity of &#8776;125 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability over 61&#160;000 cycles (&#8776;9 months) if the side reactions from the anode can be prevented. Graphite is a good anode material but is subjected to degradation in traditional carbonate electrolytes. New concentrated electrolytes are developed and evaluated. A stable KIB system is demonstrated by coupling a stable K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode, a prepotassiated graphite anode with a concentrated electrolyte to achieve a high energy density of &#8776;260&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the active mass of cathode and anode) and good cycling of over 1000 cycles.

         <title>High Miscibility Compatible with Ordered Molecular Packing Enables an Excellent Efficiency of 16.2% in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel small&#8208;molecule donors with thioalkyl chains in the para&#8208; (P&#8208;PhS) and the meta&#8208;position (M&#8208;PhS) are synthesized to regulate surface tension and molecular packing. An optimized morphology with small domains and ordered packing is simultanously obtained in the M&#8208;PhS:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, promoting a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.2% with excellent (FF&#160;&#215; Jsc) in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs).








Abstract
In all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs), a high short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) usually needs a small phase separation, while a high fill factor (FF) is generally realized in a highly ordered packing system. However, small domain and ordered packing always conflicted each other in ASM&#8208;OSCs, leading to a mutually restricted Jsc and FF. In this study, alleviation of the previous dilemma by the strategy of obtaining simultaneous good miscibility and ordered packing through modulating homo&#8208; and heteromolecular interactions is proposed. By moving the alkyl&#8208;thiolation side chains from the para&#8208; to the meta&#8208;position in the small&#8208;molecule donor, the surface tension and molecular planarity are synchronously enhanced, resulting in compatible properties of good miscibility with acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9 and strong self&#8208;assembly ability. As a result, an optimized morphology with multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale domains and highly ordered packing is realized. The device exhibits a long carrier lifetime (39.8 &#956;s) and fast charge collection (15.5&#160;ns). A record efficiency of 16.2% with a high FF of 75.6% and a Jsc of 25.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in the ASM&#8208;OSCs is obtained. These results demonstrate that the strategy of simultaneously obtaining good miscibility with high crystallinity could be an efficient photovoltaic material design principle for high&#8208;performance ASM&#8208;OSCs.

         <title>Scalable Polyimide&#8208;Poly(Amic Acid) Copolymer Based Nanocomposites for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To develop scalable, high&#8208;temperature capacitors, polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymer&#8208;based nanocomposites with very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed. The outstanding energy density of &#8776;1.38 J cm&#8722;3 with high efficiency of &gt;96%&#160;is achieved at 150&#160;&#176;C under 200 MV m&#8722;1 (working conditions in hybrid electric vehicles), &#8776;2.5 times higher than the room&#8208;temperature performance of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biaxially oriented polypropylene.








Abstract
The developments of next&#8208;generation electric power systems and electronics demand for high temperature (&#8776;150&#160;&#176;C), high energy density, high efficiency, scalable, and low&#8208;cost polymer&#8208;based dielectric capacitors are still scarce. Here, the nanocomposites based on polyimide&#8208;poly(amic acid) copolymers with a very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed and synthesized. Under the actual working condition in hybrid electric vehicles of 200 MV m&#8722;1 and 150&#160;&#176;C, a high energy density of 1.38 J cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency higher than 96% is achieved. This is about 2.5 times higher than the room temperature energy density (&#8776;0.39 J cm&#8722;3 under 200 MV m&#8722;1) of the commercially used biaxially oriented polypropylene, the benchmark of dielectric polymer. Especially, the energy density and efficiency at 150&#160;&#176;C show no sign of degradation after 20&#160;000 cycles of charge&#8208;discharge test and 35 days&#8217; high&#8208;temperature endurance test. This research provides an effective and low&#8208;cost strategy to develop high&#8208;temperature polymer&#8208;based capacitors.

Here, the nanocomposites based on polyimide-poly(amic acid) copolymers with a very low amount of boron nitride nanosheets are designed and synthesized. Under the actual working condition in hybrid electric vehicles of 200 MV m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 150&#160;&#176;C, a high energy density of 1.38 J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; with an efficiency higher than 96% is achieved. This is about 2.5 times higher than the room temperature energy density (&#8776;0.39 J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; under 200 MV m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the commercially used biaxially oriented polypropylene, the benchmark of dielectric polymer. Especially, the energy density and efficiency at 150&#160;&#176;C show no sign of degradation after 20&#160;000 cycles of charge-discharge test and 35 days&#8217; high-temperature endurance test. This research provides an effective and low-cost strategy to develop high-temperature polymer-based capacitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Architecting Endogenous Heterojunction of MoS2 Coupling with Mo2CTx MXenes for Optimized Li+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX is constructed in situ. The obtained hetero&#8208;Mo2C shows extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with reversible structural transformation. Moreover, the improved capability of electron and ion transport endows hetero&#8208;Mo2C electrode with superior lithium storage performance, which surpasses all reported Mo2C MXenes electrode materials.








Abstract
Endogenous heterojunction of 2D MXenes with unique structure shows inspiring potential in energy applications, which is impeded by complex synthesis method and finite MAX materials. Herein, an in situ hydrothermal strategy is implemented to successfully synthesize unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx (hetero&#8208;Mo2C) directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure caused by the introduction of MoS2 endow the hetero&#8208;MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and optimized Li+ storage mechanism with improved charge transport and lithium ion adsorption capabilities. As a result, hetero&#8208;Mo2C exhibits excellent electrochemical performance with a high discharge specific capacity of 1242 mAh g&#8208;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and long cycle stability of 683.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycling. This work provides new insights into rational design of novel MXenes heterojunctions, practically important for the development of MXenes and their applications in high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Nonfused Wide&#8208;Bandgap Acceptor for Versatile Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new wide&#8208;bandgap nonfused nonfullerene acceptor named GS&#8208;ISO is designed and synthesized. GS&#8208;ISO exhibits a very flat molecular backbone and stable molecular conformation. Based on GS&#8208;ISO, outstanding power conversion efficiencies of over 19% (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) for a tandem organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell and over 28% (500&#160;lux, 2700&#160;K LED) for an indoor OPV cell are achieved.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) with nonfused conjugated structures play a critical role in organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, NFAs named GS&#8208;OEH, GS&#8208;OC6, and GS&#8208;ISO, with optical bandgaps larger than 1.70&#160;eV, are synthesized without using the fused ring structures. Compared with GS&#8208;OEH and GS&#8208;OC6, GS&#8208;ISO exhibits much stronger crystallinity, leading to a smaller energetic disorder and a larger exciton diffusion coefficient. GS&#8208;ISO also possesses a higher electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. The OPV cell based on PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.62% under the standard one sun illumination. Besides, the PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based cell with effective area of 1.0&#160;cm2&#160;exhibits a PCE of 28.37% under 2700&#160;K illumination of 500&#160;lux. A tandem OPV cell using PBDB&#8208;TF:GS&#8208;ISO as the front subcell shows an outstanding efficiency of 19.10%. Importantly, the GS&#8208;ISO&#8208;based OPV cell exhibits promising stability under the continuous illumination of simulated sunlight. This study indicates that the molecular design strategy demonstrated in this work has great superiority in developing nonfused NFAs and also that GS&#8208;ISO is a promising WBG acceptor for versatile photovoltaic applications.

         <title>Reversible Manipulation of Photoconductivity Caused by Surface Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Stannates with Ultraviolet Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8211;matter interaction under different oxygen pressure can reversibly manipulate photoconductivity from surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite stannate semiconductors. Utilizing surface&#8208;selective photochemical reaction combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient, ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;excited electron&#8211;hole pairs of the perovskite compound under low oxygen pressure accelerate the unprecedented formation of spatially&#160;confined and optically&#160;programmable in&#8208;gap states induced by oxygen vacancies at room temperature.








Abstract
Programmable optoelectronic devices call for the reversible control of the photocarrier recombination process by in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors. However, previous approaches to produce oxygen vacancies as a source of in&#8208;gap states in oxide semiconductors have hampered the reversible formation of oxygen vacancies and their related phenomena. Here, a new strategy to manipulate the 2D photoconductivity from perovskite stannates is demonstrated by exploiting spatially&#160;selective photochemical reaction under ultraviolet illumination at room temperature. Remarkably, the ideal trap&#8208;free photocurrent of air&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;200&#160;pA) is reversibly switched into three orders of magnitude higher photocurrent of vacuum&#8208;illuminated BaSnO3 (&#8776;335&#160;nA) with persistent photoconductivity depending on ambient oxygen pressure under illumination. Multiple characterizations elucidate that ultraviolet illumination of BaSnO3&#160;under low oxygen pressure induces surface oxygen vacancies as a result of surface photolysis combined with the low oxygen&#8208;diffusion coefficient of BaSnO3; the concentrated oxygen vacancies are likely to induce a two&#8208;step transition of photocurrent response by changing the characteristics of in&#8208;gap states from the shallow level to the deep level. These results suggest a novel strategy that uses light&#8211;matter interaction in a reversible and spatially&#160;confined way to manipulate functionalities related to surface defect states, for the emerging applications using newly discovered oxide semiconductors.

These results suggest a novel strategy that uses light&#8211;matter interaction in a reversible and spatially&#160;confined way to manipulate functionalities related to surface defect states, for the emerging applications using newly discovered oxide semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulating Electroluminochromism Behavior of Viologen&#8208;Substituted Iridium(III) Complexes through Ligand Engineering for Information Display and Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of viologen&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes is designed to manipulate their electroluminochromism behavior. By attaching pyridiniums to the diimine or cyclometalating ligand and judiciously selecting the co&#8208;ligands, luminescence response to electrical stimuli is achieved in intensity, wavelength, and lifetime, which demonstrates anti&#8208;counterfeiting display through naked&#8208;eye detection, near&#8208;infrared camera, or time&#8208;resolved luminescence.








Abstract
Electrically controlling photoluminescence has attracted great research interest and offers many opportunities for technological developments. Electroluminochromic materials undergo redox reactions under low&#8208;voltage stimuli to achieve reversible luminescence switching. Till now, photoluminescence switching of a single molecule caused by electrical stimuli is restricted to intensity response because the redox&#8208;active moieties are good electron donors or acceptors and electrical stimuli can regulate the photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer and affect the luminescence intensity. In this work, the manipulation of the electroluminochromism behavior of a series of viologen&#8208;substituted iridium(III) complexes through the regulation of ligand orbital energy levels and electronic communication between the viologen pendants and the iridium(III) complex core is reported. Electrochemical redox reactions reversibly modulate either the luminescence quenching effect or the push&#8211;pull electronic effect of the viologen substituents, achieving multicolor &#8220;on&#8211;off&#8221; luminescence response toward electrical stimuli and luminescence manipulation between two emissive states with different wavelengths and lifetimes. To illustrate the promising applications of these electroluminochromic materials, recording and displaying luminescence information under electrical stimuli are demonstrated. Information encryption is realized by letting the electroluminochromism occur in the near&#8208;infrared region or in the time domain. Near&#8208;infrared camera or time&#8208;resolved luminescence analysis can be used to help read the invisible information.

         <title>High&#8208;Performing Self&#8208;Powered Photosensing and Reconfigurable Pyro&#8208;photoelectric Memory with Ferroelectric Hafnium Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hafnium oxide (HfO2)&#8208;based self&#8208;powered, ultrafast (60 &#181;s), and high&#8208;performing (68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1) infrared pyroelectric sensor is developed. Further, a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory with controllable suspension and reestablishment of self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse is demonstrated. Using the innovative approach, advanced applications like memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency warning systems are offered.








Abstract
With highly diverse multifunctional properties, hafnium oxide (HfO2) has attracted considerable attention not only because of its potential to address fundamental questions about material behaviors, but also its potential for applied perspectives like ferroelectric memory, transistors, and pyroelectric sensors.&#160;However, effective harvesting of the pyro&#8208;photoelectric effect of HfO2 to develop high&#8208;performing self&#8208;biased photosensors and electric writable and optical readable memory has yet to be developed. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept HfO2&#8208;based self&#8208;powered and ultrafast (response time &#8776; 60 &#181;s) infrared pyroelectric sensor with a responsivity of up to 68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 is developed. In particular, temporal infrared light illumination induced surface heating and, in turn, change in spontaneous polarization are attributed to robust pyro&#8208;photocurrent generation. Further, controllable suspension and reestablishment of the self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse are demonstrated, which offers a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory. Potentially, the novel approach opens a new avenue for designing on&#8208;demand pyro&#8208;phototronic response over a desired area and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various applications, including memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency alert systems.

The MMP&#8208;2&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) loading guanidinobenzoic acid&#8208;modified generation 5 polyamidoamine (G5&#8208;GBA)/Smad3&#8208;small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanoparticles (siRNA@MS) were fabricated by microfluidics technique, and then were incorporated into a self&#8208;healing hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel (siRNA@MS@HA) on the polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun nanofibers to form peritendinous anti&#8208;adhesion membrane. Here it is hypothesized that Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles would be released from GelMA MSs responded to the elevation of MMP&#8208;2 after tendon injury, thus downregulating the expression of Smad3 and fibroblast proliferation in peritendinous area. Moreover, the hydrogel&#8208;electrospun nanofibers could attenuate inflammation and act as a physical barrier to prevent adhesion tissue invading into the repaired tendon.








Abstract
Antiadhesion barriers such as films and hydrogels used to wrap repaired tendons are important for preventing the formation of adhesion tissue after tendon surgery. However, sliding of the tendon can compress the adjacent hydrogel barrier and cause it to rupture, which may then lead to unexpected inflammation. Here, a self&#8208;healing and deformable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel is constructed as a peritendinous antiadhesion barrier. Matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP&#8208;2)&#8208;degradable gelatin&#8208;methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) encapsulated with Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles are entrapped within the HA hydrogel to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and prevent peritendinous adhesion. GelMA MSs are responsively degraded by upregulation of MMP&#8208;2, achieving on&#8208;demand release of siRNA nanoparticles. Silencing effect of Smad3&#8208;siRNA nanoparticles is around 75% toward targeted gene. Furthermore, the self&#8208;healing hydrogel shows relatively attenuated inflammation compared to non&#8208;healing hydrogel. The mean adhesion scores of composite barrier group are 1.67 &#177; 0.51 and 2.17 &#177; 0.75 by macroscopic and histological evaluation, respectively. The proposed self&#8208;healing hydrogel antiadhesion barrier with MMP&#8208;2&#8208;responsive drug release behavior is highly effective for decreasing inflammation and inhibiting tendon adhesion. Therefore, this research provides a new strategy for the development of safe and effective antiadhesion barriers.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Mediated Intracellular Polymerization of AIEgens for Light&#8208;Up Tumor Localization and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>

An aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen&#8208;peptide conjugates (D2P1) and 3CBT that can undergo in situ polymerization to form aggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin B enzyme reactions, the peptide cleavage on D2P1 induces covalent polymerization between 3CBT, which triggers aggregation and accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, resulting in enhanced fluorescence signal and tumor treatment efficacy.








Abstract
Improving the enrichment of drugs or theranostic agents within tumors is vital to achieve effective cancer diagnosis and therapy with reduced dosage and damage to normal tissues. In this work, an enzyme&#8208;mediated aggregation&#8208;induced emission fluorogen (AIEgen) intracellular polymerization strategy that can simultaneously promote the accumulation and retention of the AIEgen in the tumor for prolonged imaging and enhanced tumor growth inhibition is described. An AIEgen&#8208;peptide conjugate (D2P1) and cyanobenzothiazole&#8208;cysteine (3CBT) that can undergo rapid condensation reaction to form nanoaggregates in tumor cells are rationally designed. Upon tumor&#8208;specific cathepsin protease reaction, the cleavage of peptides induces condensate polymerization between the exposed cysteine and 2&#8208;cyanobenzothiazole on 3CBT, triggering accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, leading to fluorescence light&#8208;up. Such enzyme&#8208;mediated polymerization of D2P1 and 3CBT alters cellular motility via disrupting actin organization and in turn inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, due to the built&#8208;in intrinsic photosensitization property of the AIEgen, the accumulation of D2P1 can remarkably promote the tumor photodynamic therapy effect in vivo under light irradiation. This study thus represents the enzyme&#8208;mediated intracellular polymerization system with high potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes of tumors in vivo.

Upon tumor-specific cathepsin protease reaction, the cleavage of peptides induces condensate polymerization between the exposed cysteine and 2-cyanobenzothiazole on 3CBT, triggering accumulation of D2P1 into the tumor site, leading to fluorescence light-up. Such enzyme-mediated polymerization of D2P1 and 3CBT alters cellular motility via disrupting actin organization and in turn inhibiting cell proliferation. In addition, due to the built-in intrinsic photosensitization property of the AIEgen, the accumulation of D2P1 can remarkably promote the tumor photodynamic therapy effect in vivo under light irradiation. This study thus represents the enzyme-mediated intracellular polymerization system with high potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes of tumors in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Efficient Blue Phosphorescence from Pillar&#8208;Layer MOFs by Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient (QYphos.&#160;= 80.6%), long&#8208;lived (169.7&#160;ms) blue phosphorescence has been achieved in pillar&#8208;layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks based on the isolation and lock of ligand chromophores. The potential applications of these phosphors in 3D printing, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and fingerprint visualization have been demonstrated owing to the excellent chemical and mechanical stability.








Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has been extensively researched in heavy&#8208;metal containing complexes and purely organic systems. Despite the rapid blossom of RTP materials, it is still a tremendous challenge to develop highly efficient blue RTP materials with long&#8208;lived lifetimes. Taking the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a model, herein, a feasible strategy of ligand functionalization is proposed, including two essential elements, to develop blue phosphorescence materials with high efficiency and long&#8208;lived lifetimes simultaneously under ambient conditions. One is isolation of the chromophores with assistance of another predefined co&#8208;ligands, the other is restriction of the chromophores&#8217; motions through coordination and host&#8208;guest interactions. Remarkably, it renders the MOFs with highly efficient blue phosphorescence up to 80.6% and a lifetime of 169.7&#160;ms under ambient conditions. Moreover, a demo of the crown is fabricated with MOFs ink by 3D printing technique. The potential applications for anti&#8208;counterfeiting and fingerprint visualization have been also demonstrated. This finding not only outlines a universal principle to design and synthesize highly efficient RTP materials, but also endows traditional MOFs with fresh vitality for potential applications.

         <title>Tailored Double Emulsions Made Simple</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method is developed to produce double emulsions of a single core and a thin shell at a milliliter per minute production rate, requiring minimal instrumentation, cost, and expertise. This two&#8208;step emulsification technique offers control of shell thickness, diversity of liquid formulations, integration with microfluidic devices, and potential to scale&#8208;up.








Abstract
Double emulsions, such as water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplets, are important material platforms for conducting fundamental research and for technological applications. To date, well&#8208;defined double&#8208;emulsion droplets consisting of a single water core and a thin oil shell can be exclusively formed with sophisticated microfluidic devices. The fabrication, preparation, and operation of such devices is challenging, which reduces the availability of tailored double emulsions to a limited community of experts. Here, a simple method is introduced to produce single&#8208;core double emulsions with high yield in large quantities, using a vortex mixer. Utilizing the density difference between the dispersed droplet and the continuous phase, this two&#8208;step emulsification method can achieve very small core droplet diameters below 10 &#956;m and ultrathin shells with thicknesses below 1 &#956;m. A detailed picture of the formation mechanism is provided and it is demonstrated that the process can be extended to produce multishell and multicore emulsions. Finally, its application is demonstrated to produce structurally colored colloidal supraparticles with unprecedented uniformity and yield. The method allows the creation of tailored double emulsions with minimal time, cost, effort, and expertise, and may widen its application to nonspecialized scientific communities.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Assisted 4D Programming and Reprogramming of Liquid Crystalline Organogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entropic approach is reported to program and reprogram the molecular ordering in liquid crystalline organogels via directed solvent evaporation. A wide variety of active origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of 3D printed LCNs with unattainable spatial and temporal control can be readily reached without meticulous alignment during network formation.








Abstract
Encoding molecular ordering during liquid crystalline network (LCN) formation endows preprogrammed but fixed shape morphing in response to external stimuli. The incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds enables shape reprogramming but also permanently alters the network structures. Here, an entropic approach that can program complex shapes via directed solvent evaporation from an isotropic LCN organogel is discoursed. Different shapes can be erased and reprogrammed from the same LCN on demand depending on the modes of deformation of the organogel during solvent evaporation. The ability to decouple network synthesis and molecular alignment relaxes the requirements to LCN chemistry and alignment methods, allowing for the realization of a variety of origami/kirigami structures and 4D shape morphing of LCNs printed from the digital light processing technique with unattainable spatial and temporal controls.

         <title>Strong Metal Phosphide&#8211;Phosphate Support Interaction for Enhanced Non&#8208;Noble Metal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for heterogeneous catalysis but limited by reducible oxide supports and the activity and stability contradiction. A new strong metal phosphide&#8211;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI) induced by P activation is reported for the non&#8208;noble metal catalyst with superior hydrogenation activity, stability, anti&#8208;oxidant and anti&#8208;acid capacity.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) is crucial for supported catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. Here is the first report on strong metal phosphide&#8208;phosphate support interaction (SMPSI). The key to SMPSI is the activation of P species on the support, which leads to simultaneous generation of metal phosphide nanoparticles (NPs) and core&#8211;shell nanostructures formed by support migration onto the NPs. The encapsulation state of metal phosphide and charge transfer are identical to those of classical SMSIs and can be optimally regulated. Furthermore, the strong interactions of Co2PL/MnP&#8208;3 not only significantly enhance the anti&#8208;oxidation and anti&#8208;acid capability of non&#8208;noble metal but also exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability toward hydrogenating a wide range of compounds into value&#8208;added fine chemicals with 100% selectivity, which is even better than Pd/C and Pt/C. The SMPSI construction can be generally extended to other systems such as Ni2PL/Mn3(PO4)2, Co2PL/LaPO4, and CoPL/CePO4. This study provides a new approach for the rational design of advanced non&#8208;noble metal catalysts and introduce a novel paradigm for the strong interaction between NPs and support.

         <title>Toward Perfect Optical Diffusers: Dielectric Huygens&#8217; Metasurfaces with Critical Positional Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurfaces based on disordered arrangements of silicon nanoresonators are used to implement wavelength&#8208;selective optical diffusers with nearly Lambertian scattering profiles and a high tolerance for incidence angles and polarizations. Their working principles and scattering performances are discussed on the basis of exhaustive experimental and numerical studies. Such diffusers open new opportunities in applications like fluorescence microscopy, augmented reality displays, or wavefront&#8208;shaping.








Abstract
Conventional optical diffusers, such as thick volume scatterers (Rayleigh scattering) or microstructured surface scatterers (geometric scattering), lack the potential for on&#8208;chip integration and are thus incompatible with next&#8208;generation photonic devices. Dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces, on the other hand, consist of 2D arrangements of resonant dielectric nanoparticles and therefore constitute a promising material platform for ultrathin and highly efficient photonic devices. When the nanoparticles are arranged in a random but statistically specific fashion, diffusers with exceptional properties are expected to come within reach.

     alt="Toward Perfect Optical Diffusers: Dielectric Huygens&#8217; Metasurfaces with Critical Positional Disorder"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metasurfaces based on disordered arrangements of silicon nanoresonators are used to implement wavelength-selective optical diffusers with nearly Lambertian scattering profiles and a high tolerance for incidence angles and polarizations. Their working principles and scattering performances are discussed on the basis of exhaustive experimental and numerical studies. Such diffusers open new opportunities in applications like fluorescence microscopy, augmented reality displays, or wavefront-shaping.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional optical diffusers, such as thick volume scatterers (Rayleigh scattering) or microstructured surface scatterers (geometric scattering), lack the potential for on-chip integration and are thus incompatible with next-generation photonic devices. Dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces, on the other hand, consist of 2D arrangements of resonant dielectric nanoparticles and therefore constitute a promising material platform for ultrathin and highly efficient photonic devices. When the nanoparticles are arranged in a random but statistically specific fashion, diffusers with exceptional properties are expected to come within reach. This work explores how dielectric Huygens&#8217; metasurfaces can implement wavelength-selective diffusers with negligible absorption losses and nearly Lambertian scattering profiles that are largely independent of the angle and polarization of incident waves. The combination of tailored positional disorder with a carefully balanced electric and magnetic response of the nanoparticles is shown to be an integral requirement for the operation as a diffuser. The proposed metasurfaces&#8217; directional scattering performance is characterized both experimentally and numerically, and their usability in wavefront-shaping applications is highlighted.

         <title>Cell Sheet&#8208;Like Soft Nanoreactor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3&#160;nm&#8208;thick soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays are designed to confine and guide the inward crystallization of nanocrystals. Such cell&#8208;like soft nanoreactor sheets change the reaction kinetics and offer a general platform to synthesize a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures that are difficult to achieve using traditional bulk solution&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
Tissues, which consist of groups of closely packed cell arrays, are essentially sheet&#8208;like biosynthesis plants. In tissues, individual cells are discrete microreactors working under highly viscous and confined environments. Herein, soft polystyrene&#8208;encased nanoframe (PEN) reactor arrays, as analogous nanoscale &#8220;sheet&#8208;like chemosynthesis plants&#8221;, for the controlled synthesis of novel nanocrystals, are reported. Although the soft polystyrene (PS) is only 3&#160;nm thick, it is elastic, robust, and permeable to aqueous solutes, while significantly slowing down their diffusion. PEN&#8208;associated palladium (Pd) crystallization follows a diffusion&#8208;controlled zero&#8208;order kinetics rather than a reaction&#8208;controlled first&#8208;order kinetics in bulk solution. Each individual PEN reactor has a volume in the zeptoliter range, which offers a unique confined environment, enabling a directional inward crystallization, in contrast to the conventional outward nucleation/growth that occurs in an unconfined bulk solution. This strategy makes it possible to generate a set of mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, and trimetallic, and even semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable interior structures, which are difficult to achieve with normal systems based on bulk solutions.

         <title>Electronically and Geometrically Modified Single&#8208;Atom Fe Sites by Adjacent Fe Nanoparticles for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlations between electronic and geometric structures of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and their oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance are investigated by varying the secondary heat&#8208;treatment of a NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst. The adjacent Fe nanoparticles can regulate the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites, reducing energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials exhibit excellent activity and stability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), as one of the most promising candidates to replace commercial Pt/C catalysts. However, it is challenging to unravel features of the superior ORR activity originating from Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials. In this work, the electronic and geometric structures of the isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and their correlations with the ORR performance are investigated by varying the secondary thermal activation temperature of a rationally designed NC&#8208;supported Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC). The systematic analyses demonstrate the significant role of coordinated atoms of SA and metallic Fe nanoparticles (NPs) in altering the electronic structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites. Meanwhile, strong interaction between isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites and adjacent Fe NPs can change the geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites. Theoretical calculations reveal that optimal regulation of the electronic and geometric structure of isolated Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C sites by the co&#8208;existence of Fe NPs narrows the energy barriers of the rate&#8208;limiting steps of ORR, resulting in outstanding ORR performance. This work not only provides the fundamental understanding of the underlying structure&#8211;activity relationship, but also sheds light on designing efficient Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.

         <title>Brain&#8208;Targeted Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Nanoparticles with Near&#8208;Infrared Imaging at 1550&#160;nm Boosts Orthotopic Glioblastoma Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II)&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of nanofluorophores is a promising approach for theranostic of orthotopic glioma. Brain&#8208;targeting nanofluorophores featuring novel molecular design of &#8220;backbone distortion + molecular rotor&#8221; are prepared. They can balance the photon energy flow to achieve advanced NIR&#8208;II imaging at 1550&#160;nm and photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat ratio for PTT in orthotopic&#8208;glioma&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
A remaining challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is surmounting the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB). Such a challenge prevents the development of efficient theranostic approaches that combine reliable diagnosis with targeted therapy. In this study, brain&#8208;targeted near&#8208;infrared IIb (NIR&#8208;IIb) aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) nanoparticles are developed via rational design, which involves twisting the planar molecular backbone with steric hindrance. The resulting nanoparticles can balance competing responsiveness demands for radiation&#8208;mediated NIR fluorescence imaging at 1550&#160;nm and non&#8208;radiation NIR photothermal therapy (NIR&#8208;PTT). The brain&#8208;targeting peptide apolipoprotein E peptide (ApoE) is grafted onto these nanoparticles (termed as ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs) to target glioma and promote efficient BBB traversal. A long imaging wavelength 1550&#160;nm band&#8208;pass filter is utilized to monitor the in vivo biodistribution and accumulation of the nanoparticles in a model of orthotopic glioma, which overcomes previous limitations in wavelength range and equipment. The results demonstrate that the ApoE&#8208;Ph NPs have a higher PTT efficiency and significantly enhanced survival of mice bearing orthotopic GBM with moderate irradiation (0.5&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2). Collectively, the work highlights the smart design of a brain&#8208;targeted NIR&#8208;II AIE theranostic approach that opens new diagnosis and treatment options in the photonic therapy of GBM.

In article number 2108809, Li Song and co&#8208;workers successfully synthesize unique endogenous hetero&#8208;MXenes of amorphous MoS2 coupling with fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx directly from Mo2Ga2C MAX via an optimal in situ hydrothermal strategy. The distinctive morphology and heterojunction structure endow the hetero&#8208;MXenes with extraordinary structural stability and an optimized Li+&#8208;storage mechanism, with improved charge transport and Li+&#8208;adsorption capabilities.

Interfacial Atomic Configurations
In article number 2106814, Kaihui Liu, Xin&#8208;Zheng Li, Xinqiang Wang, and co&#8208;workers profile a novel perspective of the lattice arrangement (polarity) manipulation of a quasi&#8208;van der Waals epitaxial hexagonal III&#8208;nitride film on graphene by interfacial atomic configuration engineering. Through using atomic O preirradiation and a specific supply sequence of Ga and N atoms to form the C&#8211;O&#8211;N&#8211;Ga(3) and C&#8211;O&#8211;Ga&#8211;N(3) configurations, N&#8208; and Ga&#8208;lattice polarity GaN films are achieved on transferred graphene, respectively.

Single&#8208;Core Double Emulsions
The fabrication of single&#8208;core double emulsions typically requires sophisticated microfluidic devices and meticulous operation protocols. In article number 2107338, Nicolas Vogel and co&#8208;workers develop a convenient method to produce such tailored double emulsions with defined droplet structure using only vortex mixing. This fast, low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;yield method improves the accessibility of droplet&#8208;based materials.

2D Photoconductivity
Light&#8211;matter interaction under different oxygen pressures can reversibly manipulate photoconductivity from surface oxygen vacancies of perovskite stannate semiconductors. In article number 2107650, utilizing a surface&#8208;selective photochemical reaction, Junwoo Son and co&#8208;workers report that ultraviolet&#8208;excited electron&#8211;hole pairs of a perovskite compound under low oxygen pressure accelerate the unprecedented formation of spatially confined and optically programmable in&#8208;gap states induced by oxygen vacancies at room temperature.

Tissue Adhesives
In article number 2105338, Donghee Son, Changhyun Pang, and co&#8208;workers report an electrostatic&#8211;mechanical synergistic multiscale tissue adhesive for sustainable residue&#8208;free bioelectronics interfaces. To deduce the mechanism, a thermodynamic model based on a tailored elastomer&#8211;hydrogel combinatory adhesive architecture is proposed. This patch also successfully demonstrates reliable real&#8208;time measurements of electrophysiological signals generated by various tissues ranging from rodent sciatic nerve, muscle, brain, and human skin.

         <title>Advanced Multifunctional Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries Design: From Materials and Devices to Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 5, February 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) can provide additional functions to realize unprecedented applications where conventional batteries normally fail. This review describes the recent advances of MARBs in terms of materials engineering, device design, system integration, and applications. The challenges and opportunities for further developments in the emerging field of MARBs are deeply discussed.








Abstract
Multifunctional aqueous rechargeable batteries (MARBs) are regarded as safe, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable electrochemical energy storage devices, which offer additional functionalities that conventional batteries cannot achieve, which ideally leads to unprecedented applications. Although MARBs are among the most exciting and rapidly growing topics in scientific research and industrial development nowadays, a systematic summary of the evolution and advances in the field of MARBs is still not available. Therefore, the review presented comprehensively and systematically summarizes the design principles and the recent advances of MARBs by categories of smart ARBs and integrated systems, together with an analysis of their device design and configuration, electrochemical performance, and diverse smart functions. The two most promising strategies to construct novel MARBs may be A) the introduction of functional materials into ARB components, and B) integration of ARBs with other functional devices. The ongoing challenges and future perspectives in this research and development field are outlined to foster the future development of MARBs. Finally, the most important upcoming research directions in this rapidly developing field are highlighted that may be most promising to lead to the commercialization of MARBs and to a further broadening of their range of applications.

Abstract
Anisotropy is the characteristic of a material to exhibit variations in its mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical properties, etc. along different directions. Anisotropic materials have attracted great research interest because of their wide applications in aerospace, sensing, soft robotics, and tissue engineering. 3D printing provides exceptional advantages in achieving controlled compositions and complex architecture, thereby enabling the manufacture of 3D objects with anisotropic functionalities. Here, a comprehensive review of the recent progress on 3D printing of anisotropic polymer materials based on different techniques including material extrusion, vat photopolymerization, powder bed fusion, and sheet lamination is presented. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies implemented in manipulating anisotropic structures are highlighted with the discussion of material categories, functionalities, and potential applications. This review is concluded with analyzing the current challenges and providing perspectives for further development in this field.

         <dc:description>
This review analyzes the key factors that hinder the reversible conversion of conversion&#8208;type materials, provides a fundamental understanding of graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs), and provides guidance on the bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs to be used in high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation batteries, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation batteries based on conversion reactions, including aqueous metal&#8211;air batteries, nonaqueous alkali metal&#8208;O2 and &#8208;CO2 batteries, alkali metal&#8208;chalcogen batteries, and alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries have attracted great interest. However, their use is restricted by inefficient reversible conversion of active agents. Developing bifunctional catalysts to accelerate the conversion reaction kinetics in both discharge and charge processes is urgently needed. Graphene&#8208;, or graphene&#8208;like carbon&#8208;supported atomically dispersed metal catalysts (G&#8208;ADMCs) have been demonstrated to show excellent activity in various electrocatalytic reactions, making them promising candidates. Different from G&#8208;ADMCs for catalysis, which only require high activity in one direction, G&#8208;ADMCs for rechargeable batteries should provide high activity in both discharging and charging. This review provides guidance for the design and fabrication of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries based on conversion reactions. The key challenges that prevent their reversible conversion, the origin of the activity of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs, and the current design principles of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMCs for highly reversible conversion, have been analyzed and highlighted for each conversion&#8208;type battery. Finally, a summary and outlook on the development of bifunctional G&#8208;ADMC materials for next&#8208;generation batteries with a high energy density and excellent energy efficiency are given.
