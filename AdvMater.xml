      <title>Superwetting Shape Memory Microstructure: Smart Wetting Control and Practical Application</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent developments in the smart control of wettability on superwetting shape memory microstructures and corresponding applications are summarized. Research results demonstrate that the shape memory ability of a shape memory polymer can provide an excellent controllability in surface microstructure and wetting performance; meanwhile, some new functions can also be realized.








Abstract
Smart control of wettability on superwetting surfaces has aroused much attention in the past few years. Compared with traditional strategies such as adjusting the surface chemistry, regulating the surface microstructure is more difficult, though it can bring lots of new functions. Recently, it was found that, based on the shape memory effect of a shape memory polymer, the surface microstructure can be controlled more easily and precisely. Here, recent developments in the smart control of wettability on superwetting shape memory microstructures and corresponding applications are summarized. The primary concern is the superhydrophobic surfaces that have demonstrated numerous attractive functions, including controllable droplet storage, transportation, bouncing, capture/release, and reprogrammable gradient wetting, under variation of the surface microstructure. Finally, some achievements in wetting control on other superwetting surfaces (such as superomniphobic surfaces and superslippery surfaces) and perspectives on future research directions are also discussed.

      <title>Proton&#8208;Conductive Melanin&#8208;Like Fibers through Enzymatic Oxidation of a Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide</title>
      <dc:description>
Melanins are a class of pigments with remarkable optical and electric properties, yet their applications in bioelectronics are limited due to difficulties in control of supramolecular structure and nano&#8208;to&#8208;micrometer scale morphology. Supramolecular templating of a minimalistic peptide precursor containing two oxidizable tyrosines is used to form a melanin&#8208;like material with controlled fibrillar morphology, broad UV absorption, and unprecedented high conductivity.








Abstract
Melanin pigments have various properties that are of technological interest including photo&#8208; and radiation protection, rich coloration, and electronic functions. Nevertheless, laboratory&#8208;based synthesis of melanin and melanin&#8208;like materials with morphologies and chemical structures that are specifically optimized for these applications, is currently not possible. Here, melanin&#8208;like materials that are produced by enzymatic oxidation of a supramolecular tripeptide structures that are rich in tyrosine and have a 1D morphology are demonstrated, that are retained during the oxidation process while conducting tracks form through oxidative tyrosine crosslinking. Specifically, a minimalistic self&#8208;assembling peptide, Lys&#8211;Tyr&#8211;Tyr (KYY) with strong propensity to form supramolecular fibers, is utilized. Analysis by Raman spectroscopy shows that the tyrosines are pre&#8208;organized inside these fibers and, upon enzymatic oxidation, result in connected catechols. These form 1D conducting tracks along the length of the fiber, which gives rise to a level of internal disorder, but retention of the fiber morphology. This results in highly conductive structures demonstrated to be dominated by proton conduction. This work demonstrates the ability to control oxidation but retain a well&#8208;defined fibrous morphology that does not have a known equivalent in biology, and demonstrate exceptional conductivity that is enhanced by enzymatic oxidation.

      <title>Ionic&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Based Safe Adjuvants</title>
      <dc:description>
Despite extensive research, only a handful of vaccine adjuvants, non&#8208;native to the human body, have been approved. A new adjuvant based on ionic liquids is demonstrated, which combines two metabolites of the body, choline and lactic acid (ChoLa). It successfully enhances immune infiltration at the injection site and leads to a potent immune response against the antigen, serving as a safe adjuvant alternative that can help protect against infections.








Abstract
Adjuvants play a critical role in the design and development of novel vaccines. Despite extensive research, only a handful of vaccine adjuvants have been approved for human use. Currently used adjuvants are mostly composed of components that are non&#8208;native to the human body, such as aluminum salt, bacterial lipids, or foreign genomic material. Here, a new ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;based adjuvant is explored, synthesized using two metabolites of the body, choline and lactic acid (ChoLa). ChoLa distributes the antigen efficiently upon injection, maintains antigen integrity, enhances immune infiltration at the injection site, and leads to a potent immune response against the antigen. Thus, it can serve as a promising safe adjuvant platform that can help to protect against pandemics and future infectious threats.

      <title>Single Cobalt Sites Dispersed in Hierarchically Porous Nanofiber Networks for Durable and High&#8208;Power PGM&#8208;Free Cathodes in Fuel Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed single&#8208;Co&#8208;site catalysts, through electrospinning cobalt&#8208;doped ZIF&#8208;8 crystals, and selected dual polyacrylonitrile and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) polymers are reported. The interconnected porous nanofiber networks with hierarchical architecture are essential to facilitate mass and charge transfer within an electrode, along with uniform ionomer dispersion for the oxygen reduction reaction. The catalyst is highly active and durable in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
Increasing catalytic activity and durability of atomically dispersed metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) cathode in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells remains a grand challenge. Here, a high&#8208;power and durable Co&#8211;N&#8211;C nanofiber catalyst synthesized through electrospinning cobalt&#8208;doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks into selected polyacrylonitrile and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) polymers is reported. The distinct porous fibrous morphology and hierarchical structures play a vital role in boosting electrode performance by exposing more accessible active sites, providing facile electron conductivity, and facilitating the mass transport of reactant. The enhanced intrinsic activity is attributed to the extra graphitic N dopants surrounding the CoN4 moieties. The highly graphitized carbon matrix in the catalyst is beneficial for enhancing the carbon corrosion resistance, thereby promoting catalyst stability. The unique nanoscale X&#8208;ray computed tomography verifies the well&#8208;distributed ionomer coverage throughout the fibrous carbon network in the catalyst. The membrane electrode assembly achieves a power density of 0.40 W cm&#8722;2 in a practical H2/air cell (1.0&#160;bar) and demonstrates significantly enhanced durability under accelerated stability tests. The combination of the intrinsic activity and stability of single Co sites, along with unique catalyst architecture, provide new insight into designing efficient PGM&#8208;free electrodes with improved performance and durability.

      <title>General Synthesis of Nanoporous 2D Metal Compounds with 3D Bicontinous Structure</title>
      <dc:description>
2D metal compounds with bicontinous nanoporous structure are successfully prepared by using a recyclable nanoporous gold assisted chemical vapor deposition process. The resulting 3D nanoporous MoSSe with tunable pore sizes and porosity exhibits excellent electrochemical N2 reduction reaction properties. This work opens up a promising avenue for fundamental studies and potential applications of a wide variety of nanoporous metal compounds.








Abstract
Although 2D layered metal compounds are widely exploited using various techniques such as exfoliation and vapor&#8208;phase&#8208;assisted growth, it is still challenging to construct the 2D materials in a 3D configuration with preservation of the unique physicochemical properties of the metal compounds. Herein, a general synthetic strategy is reported for a wide variety of 2D (atomic&#8208;scale thickness) metal compounds with 3D bicontinous nanoporous structure. 19 binary compounds including sulfides, selenides, tellurides, carbides, and nitrides, and five alloyed compounds, are successfully prepared via a surface alloy strategy, which are readily created by using a recyclable nanoporous gold assisted chemical vapor deposition process. These 3D nanoporous metal compounds with preserved 2D physicochemical properties, tunable pore sizes, and compositions for electrocatalytic applications, show excellent catalytic performance in the electrochemical N2 reduction reaction. This work opens up a promising avenue for fundamental studies and potential applications of a wide variety of nanoporous metal compounds.

      <title>Quantitative Polarization&#8208;Resolved Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Microscopy of Glycine Microneedles</title>
      <dc:description>
A quantitative framework for finding &#967;(2), the second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility tensor, from polarization&#8208;resolved second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy in transmission mode is presented. This method corrects for micrometer&#8208;scale morphology and birefringence, which enable the determination and comparison of the &#967;(2) tensors of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;phase glycine microneedles and is broadly applicable for quantitative SHG material characterization and biological diagnostic imaging.








Abstract
Second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) is a nonlinear optical process that can provide disease diagnosis through characterization of biological building blocks such as amino acids, peptides, and proteins. The second&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility tensor &#967;(2) of a material characterizes its tendency to cause SHG. Here, a method for finding the &#967;(2) elements from polarization&#8208;resolved SHG microscopy in transmission mode is presented. The quantitative framework and analytical approach that corrects for micrometer&#8208;scale morphology and birefringence enable the determination and comparison of the SHG susceptibility tensors of &#946;&#8208; and &#947;&#8208;phase glycine microneedles. The maximum nonlinear susceptibility coefficients are d33&#160;= 15 pm V&#8722;1 for the &#946; and d33&#160;= 5.9 pm V&#8722;1 for the &#947; phase. The results demonstrate glycine as a useful biocompatible nonlinear material. This combination of the analytical model and polarization&#8208;resolved SHG transmission microscopy is broadly applicable for quantitative SHG material characterization and diagnostic imaging.

      <title>A Versatile Nonviral Delivery System for Multiplex Gene&#8208;Editing in the Liver</title>
      <dc:description>
A liposome&#8208;coated mesoporous silica nanoparticle enables multiplex gene editing to understand potential therapeutic targets in liver lipid metabolism. Using this novel nonviral platform to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, gene editing is&#160;demonstrated at three potential therapeutic targets (pcsk9, apoc3, angptl3) for cardioprotection in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Recent advances in CRISPR present attractive genome&#8208;editing toolsets for therapeutic strategies at the genetic level. Here, a liposome&#8208;coated mesoporous silica nanoparticle (lipoMSN) is reported as an effective CRISPR delivery system for multiplex gene&#8208;editing in the liver. The MSN provides efficient loading of Cas9 plasmid as well as Cas9 protein/guide RNA ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP), while liposome&#8208;coating offers improved serum stability and enhanced cell uptake. Hypothesizing that loss&#8208;of&#8208;function mutation in the lipid&#8208;metabolism&#8208;related genes pcsk9, apoc3, and angptl3 would improve cardiovascular health by lowering blood cholesterol and triglycerides, the lipoMSN is used to deliver a combination of RNPs targeting these genes. When targeting a single gene, the lipoMSN achieved a 54% gene&#8208;editing efficiency, besting the state&#8208;of&#8208;art Lipofectamine CRISPRMax. For multiplexing, lipoMSN maintained significant gene&#8208;editing at each gene target despite reduced dosage of target&#8208;specific RNP. By delivering combinations of targeting RNPs in the same nanoparticle, synergistic effects on lipid metabolism are observed in vitro and vivo. These effects, such as a 50% decrease in serum cholesterol after 4 weeks of post&#8208;treatment with lipoMSN carrying both pcsk9 and angptl3&#8208;targeted RNPs, could not be reached with a single gene&#8208;editing approach. Taken together, this lipoMSN represents a versatile platform for the development of efficient, combinatorial gene&#8208;editing therapeutics.

Monolayer ternary telluride core/shell WSe2&#8722;2xTe2x/WSe2&#8722;2yTe2y (x&#160;&gt;&#160;y) structures are synthesized using a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition process with rapid cooling.

Abstract
Device engineering based on the tunable electronic properties of ternary transition metal dichalcogenides has recently gained widespread research interest. In this work, monolayer ternary telluride core/shell structures are synthesized using a one&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition process with rapid cooling. The core region is the tellurium&#8208;rich WSe2&#8722;2xTe2x alloy, while the shell is the tellurium&#8208;poor WSe2&#8722;2yTe2y alloy. The bandgap of the material is &#8776;1.45&#160;eV in the core region and &#8776;1.57&#160;eV in the shell region. The lateral gradient of the bandgap across the monolayer heterostructure allows for the fabrication of heterogeneous transistors and photodetectors. The difference in work function between the core and shell regions leads to a built&#8208;in electric field at the heterojunction. As a result, heterogeneous transistors demonstrate a unidirectional conduction and strong photovoltaic effect. The bandgap gradient and high mobility of the ternary telluride core/shell structures provide a unique material platform for novel electronic and photonic devices.

      <title>Programming Multiphase Media Superwetting States in the Oil&#8211;Water&#8211;Air System: Evolutions in Hydrophobic&#8211;Hydrophilic Surface Heterogeneous Chemistry</title>
      <dc:description>
A new conceptual insight &#8220;multiphase media superwetting states&#8221; for superwettability is presented. Programming of multiphase media superwetting states can be manipulated by surface hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic heterogeneous chemistry by varying the spraying inks&#8217; chemistry and external stimuli. In&#8208;air superhydrophilicity&#8211;superoleophobicity and underoil superhydrophilicity can be realized via ammonia vapor exposure and ultraviolet light illumination, respectively.








Abstract
Studies toward tailoring macroscopic extreme wetting behaviors on a certain well&#8208;defined surface in multiphase media are significant but still at an infant stage. Herein, superantiwetting evolutions in the oil&#8211;water&#8211;air system can be programmed from single to quadruple superrepellence by controlling the surface hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic heterogeneous chemistry. Ammonia vapor exposure makes the realization of challenging superhydrophilicity&#8211;superoleophobicity possible in air medium, causing the transition from quadruple to triple superantiwetting states in the oil&#8211;water&#8211;air system. Upon UV illumination, only single superrepellence&#8211;underwater superoleophobicity is maintained on titanium dioxide (TiO2, P25)&#8208;based coatings. A reversible transition between underoil superhydrophilicity and superhydrophobicity via an alternating UV irradiation and heating process leads to a switching between &#8220;water&#8208;absorbing&#8221; and &#8220;size&#8208;sieving&#8221; effects in water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion separation. A comparative study for investigating two such effects in emulsion separation is further investigated. The current conceptual insights not only extend superwetting states to multiphase media, but can also deepen the understanding of the relationship between macroscopic extreme wetting behaviors and surface chemistry.

      <title>Understanding the Self&#8208;Assembly of Cellulose Nanocrystals&#8212;Toward Chiral Photonic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral photonic films that selectively reflect circularly polarized light can be prepared using the liquid crystalline properties of cellulose nanocrystals. The recent developments to understand the growth and structure of films with chiral nematic order are highlighted, together with studies that may lead to the development of new optical components, sensory materials, and decorative applications.








Abstract
Over millions of years, animals and plants have evolved complex molecules and structures that endow them with vibrant colors. Among the sources of natural coloration, structural color is prominent in insects, bird feathers, snake skin, plants, and other organisms, where the color arises from the interaction of light with nanoscale features rather than absorption from a pigment. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are a biorenewable resource that spontaneously organize into chiral nematic liquid crystals having a hierarchical structure that resembles the Bouligand structure of arthropod shells. The periodic, chiral nematic organization of CNC films leads them to diffract light, making them appear iridescent. Over the past two decades, there have been many advances to develop the photonic properties of CNCs for applications ranging from cosmetics to sensors. Here, the origin of color in CNCs, the control of photonic properties of CNC films, the development of new composite materials of CNCs that can yield flexible photonic structures, and the future challenges in this field are discussed. In particular, recent efforts to make flexible photonic materials using CNCs are highlighted.

Among the sources of natural coloration, structural color is prominent in insects, bird feathers, snake skin, plants, and other organisms, where the color arises from the interaction of light with nanoscale features rather than absorption from a pigment. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are a biorenewable resource that spontaneously organize into chiral nematic liquid crystals having a hierarchical structure that resembles the Bouligand structure of arthropod shells. The periodic, chiral nematic organization of CNC films leads them to diffract light, making them appear iridescent. Over the past two decades, there have been many advances to develop the photonic properties of CNCs for applications ranging from cosmetics to sensors. Here, the origin of color in CNCs, the control of photonic properties of CNC films, the development of new composite materials of CNCs that can yield flexible photonic structures, and the future challenges in this field are discussed. In particular, recent efforts to make flexible photonic materials using CNCs are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Circularly Polarized Luminescence: Chiral Organic Materials for Emerging Optical Technologies</title>
      <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state light emission is very promising in view of potential applications. Scientific approaches to the realization of chiral emissive materials are indeed growing exponentially. The properties of the nanostructures discussed are related both to the way in which luminescence is generated upon aggregation (aggregation&#8208;induced emission) and the way in which it is detected (circularly polarized emission).








Abstract
Chirality is becoming increasingly important in the design of organic materials with functional properties, when bulk anisotropy is needed. In the past decades, a plethora of chiral organic materials have been studied and developed. Nanostructures have brought substantial advancement to the realization of organic&#8208;molecule&#8208;based devices, and the possibilities for solid&#8208;state light emission are very promising in view of potential applications. Scientific approaches to the realization of chiral emissive materials are indeed growing exponentially. The chiral nanostructures discussed are related both to the way in which luminescence is generated and the way in which it is detected. As to the former, the focus will be on organic chromophores with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties, so that emission is present, or at least largely amplified, when the molecules are in the aggregated state. As to the latter, the focus will be on the ability and a quantitative comparison of organic nanostructures capable of circularly polarized emission.

      <title>Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Nanoassemblies: Generation, Amplification, and Application</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent development of circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials has aroused extensive attention. The self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed to address the barriers of tedious syntheses and the restricted substitutes during the development of CPL&#8208;active materials. By highlighting the meritorious findings, the present status and progress in this field are reviewed, with the aim of boosting the development of chiroptical materials.








Abstract
Currently, the development of circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials has drawn extensive attention due to the numerous potential applications in optical data storage, displays, backlights in 3D displays, and so on. While the fabrication of CPL&#8208;active materials generally requires chiral luminescent molecules, the introduction of the &#8220;self&#8208;assembly&#8221; concept offers a new perspective in obtaining the CPL&#8208;active materials. Following this approach, various self&#8208;assembled materials, including organic&#8208;, inorganic&#8208;, and hybrid systems can be endowed with CPL properties. Benefiting from the advantages of self&#8208;assembly, not only chiral molecules, but also achiral species, as well as inorganic nanoparticles have potential to be self&#8208;assembled into chiral nanoassemblies showing CPL activity. In addition, the dissymmetry factor, an important parameter of CPL materials, can be enhanced through various pathways of self&#8208;assembly. Here, the present status and progress of self&#8208;assembled nanomaterials with CPL activity are reviewed. An overview of the key factors in regulating chiral emission materials at the supramolecular level will largely boost their application in multidisciplinary fields.

      <title>Supramolecular Chiral Nanoarchitectonics</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral&#8208;featured materials fabricated with the supramolecular nanoarchitectonics concept are discussed. Chiral features and functions are considered with various supramolecular materials, including metal&#8211;organic frameworks and liquid crystals. Amplification of chiral molecular information from a molecule to material&#8208;level structures and the creation of chirality from achiral components upon temporal statistic fluctuations are universal, regardless of nature of assemblies.








Abstract
Exploration of molecular functions and material properties based on the control of chirality would be a scientifically elegant approach. Here, the fabrication and function of chiral&#8208;featured materials from both chiral and achiral components using a supramolecular nanoarchitectonics concept are discussed. The contents are classified in to three topics: i) chiral nanoarchitectonics of rather general molecular assemblies; ii) chiral nanoarchitectonics of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs); iii) chiral nanoarchitectonics in liquid crystals. MOF structures are based on nanoscopically well&#8208;defined coordinations, while mesoscopic orientations of liquid&#8208;crystalline phases are often flexibly altered. Discussion on the effects and features in these representative materials systems with totally different natures reveals the universal importance of supramolecular chiral nanoarchitectonics. Amplification of chiral molecular information from molecules to materials&#8208;level structures and the creation of chirality from achiral components upon temporal statistic fluctuations are universal, regardless of the nature of the assemblies. These features are thus surely advantageous characteristics for a wide range of applications.

      <title>Chirality and Surface Bonding Correlation in Atomically Precise Metal Nanoclusters</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomically precise, ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters provide an excellent opportunity to reveal that chirality is intrinsic and &#8220;outside&#8208;in.&#8221; A unified picture of metal&#8211;ligand surface bonding&#8208;induced chirality is provided; that is, the Aun(SR)n+1 staple motifs, Agn(SR)m mount motifs, and even the whole Ag&#8208;SR cage are responsible for the chirality in Au&#8208;SR and Ag&#8208;SR nanoclusters.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and occurs at all length scales. The development of applications for chiral nanostructures is rising rapidly. With the recent achievements of atomically precise nanochemistry, total structures of ligand&#8208;protected Au and other metal nanoclusters (NCs) are successfully obtained, and the origins of chirality are discovered to be associated with different parts of the cluster, including the surface ligands (e.g., swirl patterns), the organic&#8211;inorganic interface (e.g., helical stripes), and the kernel. Herein, a unified picture of metal&#8211;ligand surface bonding&#8208;induced chirality for the nanoclusters is proposed. The different bonding modes of M&#8211;X (where M = metal and X = the binding atom of ligand) lead to different surface structures on nanoclusters, which in turn give rise to various characteristic features of chirality. A comparison of Au&#8211;thiolate NCs with Au&#8211;phosphine ones further reveals the important roles of surface bonding. Compared to the Au&#8211;thiolate NCs, the Ag/Cu/Cd&#8211;thiolate systems exhibit different coordination modes between the metal and the thiolate. Other than thiolate and phosphine ligands, alkynyls are also briefly discussed. Several methods of obtaining chiroptically active nanoclusters are introduced, such as enantioseparation by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography and enantioselective synthesis. Future perspectives on chiral NCs are also proposed.

      <title>Plasmonic Chirality and Circular Dichroism in Bioassembled and Nonbiological Systems: Theoretical Background and Recent Progress</title>
      <dc:description>
The recent progress in the field of plasmonic chirality of both bio and inorganic systems is summarized, focusing on both the theoretical background and the experimental advances in the study of molecular&#8208;plasmonic assemblies, chiral plasmonic nanostructures, chiral assemblies of interacting plasmonic nanoparticles, and chiral metal metasurfaces and metamaterials. The new directions in this rapidly growing field are also discussed.








Abstract
Nature is chiral, thus chirality is a key concept required to understand a multitude of systems in physics, chemistry, and biology. The field of optics offers valuable tools to probe the chirality of nanosystems, including the measurement of circular dichroism, the differential interaction strength between matter and circularly polarized light with opposite helicity. Simultaneously, the use of plasmonic systems with giant light&#8208;interaction cross&#8208;sections opens new paths to investigate and manipulate systems on the nanoscale. Consequently, the interest in chiral plasmonic and hybrid systems has continually grown in recent years, due to their potential applications in biosensing, polarization&#8208;encoded optical communication, polarization&#8208;selective chemical reactions, and materials with polarization&#8208;dependent light&#8211;matter interaction. Experimentally, chiral properties of nanostructures can be either created artificially using modern fabrication techniques involving inorganic materials, or borrowed from nature using bioassembly or biomolecular templating. Herein, the recent progress in the field of plasmonic chirality is summarized, with a focus on both the theoretical background and the experimental advances in the study of chirality in various systems, including molecular&#8208;plasmonic assemblies, chiral plasmonic nanostructures, chiral assemblies of interacting plasmonic nanoparticles, and chiral metal metasurfaces and metamaterials. The growth prospects of this field are also discussed.

Consequently, the interest in chiral plasmonic and hybrid systems has continually grown in recent years, due to their potential applications in biosensing, polarization&#8208;encoded optical communication, polarization&#8208;selective chemical reactions, and materials with polarization&#8208;dependent light&#8211;matter interaction. Experimentally, chiral properties of nanostructures can be either created artificially using modern fabrication techniques involving inorganic materials, or borrowed from nature using bioassembly or biomolecular templating. Herein, the recent progress in the field of plasmonic chirality is summarized, with a focus on both the theoretical background and the experimental advances in the study of chirality in various systems, including molecular&#8208;plasmonic assemblies, chiral plasmonic nanostructures, chiral assemblies of interacting plasmonic nanoparticles, and chiral metal metasurfaces and metamaterials. The growth prospects of this field are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reconfigurable Plasmonic Chirality: Fundamentals and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The chiroptical response of artificial metal nanostructures can be manipulated postfabrication. Different approaches to reconfigure the chiroptical spectral signature, the structural conformation of the plasmonic systems, or both, are presented. The discussed concepts have the potential to serve as key elements in future optical systems and chiral sensing.








Abstract
Molecular chirality is a geometric property that is of great importance in chemistry, biology, and medicine. Recently, plasmonic nanostructures that exhibit distinct chiroptical responses have attracted tremendous interest, given their ability to emulate the properties of chiral molecules with tailored and pronounced optical characteristics. However, the optical chirality of such human&#8208;made structures is in general static and cannot be manipulated postfabrication. Herein, different concepts to reconfigure the chiroptical responses of plasmonic nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;objects are outlined. Depending on the utilized strategies and stimuli, the chiroptical signature, the 3D structural conformation, or both can be reconfigured. Optical devices based on plasmonic nanostructures with reconfigurable chirality possess great potential in practical applications, ranging from polarization conversion elements to enantioselective analysis, chiral sensing, and catalysis.

Abstract
Liquid crystals (LCs) are omnipresent in living matter, whose chirality is an elegant and distinct feature in certain plant tissues, the cuticles of crabs, beetles, arthropods, and beyond. Taking inspiration from nature, researchers have recently devoted extensive efforts toward developing chiral liquid crystalline materials with self&#8208;organized nanostructures and exploring their potential applications in diverse fields ranging from dynamic photonics to energy and safety issues. In this review, an account on the state of the art of emerging chiral liquid crystalline nanostructured materials and their technological applications is provided. First, an overview on the significance of chiral liquid crystalline architectures in various living systems is given. Then, the recent significant progress in different chiral liquid crystalline systems including thermotropic LCs (cholesteric LCs, cubic blue phases, achiral bent&#8208;core LCs, etc.) and lyotropic LCs (DNA LCs, nanocellulose LCs, and graphene oxide LCs) is showcased.

      <title>Enantiomeric Control of Intrinsically Chiral Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Chiral nanocrystals can be prepared with high enantioselectivity by utilizing chiral biomolecules. The several chiral nanocrystal systems that have been studied so far are reviewed with insights on the role of the chiral molecules and the possible mechanisms that may lead to chiral shape formation. The imprinting of the chiral shape to achiral functional materials is discussed.








Abstract
The chiral aspect of inorganic crystals that crystallize in chiral space groups has been largely ignored until recently, partly due to difficulties in characterizing the chiroptical properties of bulk crystals, and also due to the difficulty in separating (sub)micrometer&#8208;scale chiral crystal enantiomers. In recent years, the colloidal synthesis of intrinsically chiral nanocrystals (NCs) of several chiral inorganic compounds with significant enantiomeric excess has been demonstrated. This is achieved through the use of chiral molecular ligands, which bind to the atomic/ionic components of the crystals, preferentially forming one crystal enantiomorph. Here, recent progress on several aspects of these NCs is described, including the connection between ligand structure and its ability to direct NC handedness, chiral amplification in the synthesis leading to enantiopure NC samples, spontaneous symmetry breaking, the formation of NCs with chiral shapes, the connection between lattice and shape chirality and mixed contributions of atomic&#8208;scale and shape chirality to the chiroptical properties.

Abstract
Chiral materials are widely applied in various fields such as enantiomeric separation, asymmetric catalysis, and chiroptical effects, providing stereospecific conditions and environments. Supramolecular concepts to create the chiral materials can provide an insight for emerging chiro&#8208;optical properties due to their well&#8208;defined scaffolds and the precise functionalization of the surfaces or skeletons. Among the various supramolecular chiral structures, 2D chiral sheet structures are particularly interesting materials because of their extremely high surface area coupled with many unique chemical and physical properties, thereby offering potential for the next generation of functional materials for optically active systems and optoelectronic devices. Nevertheless, relatively limited examples for 2D chiral materials exhibiting specific functionality have been reported because incorporation of molecular chirality into 2D architectures is difficult at the present stage.

      <title>Chiral Surface and Geometry of Metal Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
The fundamentals needed to crystallographically define the surface chirality in metal are summarized, and synthetic strategies to produce the corresponding chiral geometries by controlling chiral high&#8208;Miller&#8208;index facets are provided. The surface and overall geometry are linked, and thus a guide for producing various chiral metallic nanoparticles for metamaterials, biosensors, catalysts, and optical applications is given.








Abstract
Chirality is a basic property of nature and has great importance in photonics, biochemistry, medicine, and catalysis. This importance has led to the emergence of the chiral inorganic nanostructure field in the last two decades, providing opportunities to control the chirality of light and biochemical reactions. While the facile production of 3D nanostructures has remained a major challenge, recent advances in nanocrystal synthesis have provided a new pathway for efficient control of chirality at the nanoscale by transferring molecular chirality to the geometry of nanocrystals. Interestingly, this discovery stems from a purely crystallographic outcome: chirality can be generated on high&#8208;Miller&#8208;index surfaces, even for highly symmetric metal crystals.

     alt="Chiral Surface and Geometry of Metal Nanocrystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fundamentals needed to crystallographically define the surface chirality in metal are summarized, and synthetic strategies to produce the corresponding chiral geometries by controlling chiral high&#8208;Miller&#8208;index facets are provided. The surface and overall geometry are linked, and thus a guide for producing various chiral metallic nanoparticles for metamaterials, biosensors, catalysts, and optical applications is given.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chirality is a basic property of nature and has great importance in photonics, biochemistry, medicine, and catalysis. This importance has led to the emergence of the chiral inorganic nanostructure field in the last two decades, providing opportunities to control the chirality of light and biochemical reactions. While the facile production of 3D nanostructures has remained a major challenge, recent advances in nanocrystal synthesis have provided a new pathway for efficient control of chirality at the nanoscale by transferring molecular chirality to the geometry of nanocrystals. Interestingly, this discovery stems from a purely crystallographic outcome: chirality can be generated on high&#8208;Miller&#8208;index surfaces, even for highly symmetric metal crystals. This is the starting point herein, with an overview of the scientific history and a summary of the crystallographic definition. With the advance of nanomaterial synthesis technology, high&#8208;Miller&#8208;index planes can be selectively exposed on metallic nanoparticles. The enantioselective interaction of chiral molecules and high&#8208;Miller&#8208;index facets can break the mirror symmetry of the metal nanocrystals. Herein, the fundamental principle of chirality evolution is emphasized and it is shown how chiral surfaces can be directly correlated with chiral morphologies, thus serving as a guide for researchers in chiral catalysts, chiral plasmonics, chiral metamaterials, and photonic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magnetic Circular Dichroism in Nanomaterials: New Opportunity in Understanding and Modulation of Excitonic and Plasmonic Resonances</title>
      <dc:description>
Magnetic circular dichroism shows indispensable capability in elucidating the Zeeman splitting of the excitonic transition in semiconductor nanocrystals, the electronic information of discrete optical transitions in noble metal nanoclusters, and the geometry modulation of plasmon resonance in noble metal nanostructures. Key strategies in designing magneto&#8208;optically active advanced nanomaterials are highlighted for potential applications in fields of sensing, spintronics, and nanophotonics.








Abstract
The unique capability of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) in revealing geometry and electronic information has provided new opportunities in exploring the relationship between structure and magneto&#8208;optical properties in nanomaterials with extraordinary optical absorption. Here, the representative studies referring to application of the MCD technique in semiconductor and noble metal nanomaterials are overviewed. MCD is powerful in elucidating the structural information of the excitonic transition in semiconductor nanocrystals, electronic transitions in noble metal nanoclusters, and plasmon resonance in noble metal nanostructures. By virtue of these advantages, the MCD technique shows its unrivalled ability in evaluating the magnetic modulation of excitonic and plasmonic optical activity of nanomaterials with varied chemical composition, geometry, assembly conformation, and coupling effect. Knowledge of the key factors in manipulating magneto&#8208;optical properties at the nanoscale acquired with the MCD technique will largely boost the application of semiconductor and noble nanomaterials in the fields of sensing, spintronic, nanophotonics, etc.

      <title>Shedding Light on the Role of Misfit Strain in Controlling Core&#8211;Shell Nanocrystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent investigations on heterogeneous core&#8211;shell nanocrystals containing misfit strains are summarized, with a focus on mechanistic understanding of strain and strain&#8208;induced effects such as tuning the epitaxial habit, modulating the optical emission, and enhancing the catalytic activity and magnetic coercivity.








Abstract
Heteroepitaxial modification of nanomaterials has become a powerful means to create novel functionalities for various applications. One of the most elementary factors in heteroepitaxial nanostructures is the misfit strain arising from mismatched lattices of the constituent parts. Misfit strain not only dictates epitaxy kinetics for diversifying nanocrystal morphologies but also provides rational control over materials properties. In recent years, advances in chemical synthesis along with the rapid development of electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques have enabled a substantial understanding of strain&#8208;related processes, which offers theoretical foundation and experimental guidance for researchers to refine heteroepitaxial nanostructures and their properties. Herein, recent investigations on heterogeneous core&#8211;shell nanocrystals containing misfit strains are summarized, with a focus on the mechanistic understanding of strain and strain&#8208;induced effects such as tuning the epitaxial habit, modulating the optical emission, and enhancing the catalytic activity and magnetic coercivity.

      <title>Tumor&#8208;Targeting Glycol Chitosan Nanoparticles for Cancer Heterogeneity</title>
      <dc:description>
Glycol chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) are widely utilized for tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of various theranostic agents. The continuing efforts to develop tumor&#8208;targeting CNPs for the delivery of therapeutics and imaging agents are reviewed. Furthermore, various targeting strategies and interesting stimulus&#8208;responsive designs of CNPs are discussed to overcome multiple physiological barriers, such as tumor heterogeneity and the complex tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Nanomedicine is extensively employed for cancer treatment owing to its unique advantages over conventional drugs and imaging agents. This increased attention to nanomedicine, however, has not fully translated into clinical utilization and patient benefits due to issues associated with reticuloendothelial system clearance, tumor heterogeneity, and complexity of the tumor microenvironment. To address these challenges, efforts are being made to modify the design of nanomedicines, including optimization of their physiochemical properties, active targeting, and response to stimuli, but these studies are often performed independently. Combining favorable nanomedicine designs from individual studies may improve therapeutic outcomes, but, this is difficult to achieve as the effects of different designs are interconnected and often conflicting. Glycol chitosan nanoparticles (CNPs) are shown to accumulate in tumors, suggesting that this type of nanoparticle may constitute a good basis for the additional modification of nanoparticles. Here, multifunctional glycol CNPs designed to overcome multiple obstacles to their use are described and key factors influencing in vivo targeted delivery, targeting strategies, and interesting stimulus&#8208;responsive designs for improving cancer nanomedicine are discussed.

      <title>Computation&#8208;Guided Synthesis of New Garnet&#8208;Type Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes via an Ultrafast Sintering Technique</title>
      <dc:description>
New members of the family of garnet&#8208;type solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) including LNZTO, LSZTO, and L&#8208;LSZTO are predicted by computation and synthesized by an ultrafast sintering technique. This study demonstrates the successful realization of computational predictions through the ultrafast sintering technique for the rapid optimization and screening of high&#8208;performance SSEs.








Abstract
The discovery of new solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) can be guided by computation for next&#8208;generation Li batteries toward higher energy density and better safety. However, conventional synthetic methods often suffer from severe loss of Li and poor material quality, therefore preventing the promise of the predicted SSE candidates to be realized. In this study, computationally predicted SSEs with desirable material quality are synthesized via an ultrafast sintering technique. Three new garnet&#8208;type Li+ conductors, including Li6.5Nd3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LNZTO), Li6.5Sm3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (LSZTO), and Li6.5(Sm0.5La0.5)3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 (L&#8208;LSZTO), are screened by density functional theory to exhibit good synthesizability and stability. The ultrafast sintering method by Joule heating effectively shorten the sintering time from several hours to &lt;25&#160;s, thereby reducing the Li loss and effectively merging the grains toward high material quality. In agreement with the computational prediction, LNZTO demonstrates the best synthesizability and phase stability, thereby achieving the highest conductivity of 2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 among the three new SSE candidates. Using a current density of 0.2 mA cm&#8722;2, the Li/LNZTO/Li symmetric cell can cycle for &#8776;90 h without obvious increase of overpotentials. This study showcases the successful realization of computational predictions by the ultrafast sintering technique for the rapid optimization and screening of high&#8208;performance SSEs.

In agreement with the computational prediction, LNZTO demonstrates the best synthesizability and phase stability, thereby achieving the highest conductivity of 2.3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; among the three new SSE candidates. Using a current density of 0.2 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the Li/LNZTO/Li symmetric cell can cycle for &#8776;90 h without obvious increase of overpotentials. This study showcases the successful realization of computational predictions by the ultrafast sintering technique for the rapid optimization and screening of high&#8208;performance SSEs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ultrafast Exciton Transport with a Long Diffusion Length in Layered Perovskites with Organic Cation Functionalization</title>
      <dc:description>
Apart from exciton&#8211;phonon coupling, the octahedral distortion is revealed to significantly affect exciton diffusion process. A simple fluorine substitution to phenethylammonium for the organic cations to tune the structural rigidity and octahedral distortion yields a record exciton diffusivity of 1.91 cm2 s&#8722;1 and a diffusion length of 405&#160;nm along the in&#8208;plane direction.








Abstract
Layered perovskites have been employed for various optoelectronic devices including solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes for improved stability, which need exciton transport along both the in&#8208;plane and the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane directions. However, it is not clear yet what determines the exciton transport along the in&#8208;plane direction, which is important to understand its impact toward electronic devices. Here, by employing both steady&#8208;state and transient photoluminescence mapping, it is found that in&#8208;plane exciton diffusivities in layered perovskites are sensitive to both the number of layers and organic cations. Apart from exciton&#8211;phonon coupling, the octahedral distortion is revealed to significantly affect the exciton diffusion process, determined by temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence, light&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, and density function theory calculations. A simple fluorine substitution to phenethylammonium for the organic cations to tune the structural rigidity and octahedral distortion yields a record exciton diffusivity of 1.91 cm2 s&#8722;1 and a diffusion length of 405 nm along the in&#8208;plane direction. This study provides guidance to manipulate exciton diffusion by modifying organic cations in layered perovskites.

      <title>A Zinc&#8211;Dual&#8208;Halogen Battery with a Molten Hydrate Electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>
A new aqueous zinc&#8208;based battery exploiting dual redox couples of Br0/Br&#8722; and Cl0/Cl&#8722; at a graphite cathode is presented. The battery achieves both a high average working voltage of 1.71&#160;V and a remarkable capacity of 257 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. This work provides an affordable, easily scalable, membrane&#8208;free, and high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage system.








Abstract
Halogen redox couples offer several advantages for energy storage such as low cost, high solubility in water, and high redox potential. However, the operational complexity of storing halogens at the oxidation state via liquid&#8208;phase media hampers their widespread application in energy&#8208;storage devices. Herein, an aqueous zinc&#8211;dual&#8208;halogen battery system taking the advantages of redox flow batteries (inherent scalability) and intercalation chemistry (high capacity) is designed and fabricated. To enhance specific energy, the designed cell exploits both bromine and chlorine as the cathode redox couples that are present as halozinc complexes in a newly developed molten hydrate electrolyte, which is distinctive to the conventional zinc&#8211;bromine batteries. Benefiting from the reversible uptake of halogens at the graphite cathode, exclusive reliance on earth&#8208;abundant elements, and membrane&#8208;free and possible flow&#8208;through configuration, the proposed battery can potentially realize high&#8208;performance massive electric energy storage at a reasonable cost.

      <title>Eppur si Muove: Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
      <dc:description>
Various phenomena and techniques can be explained by ambient&#8208;temperature ion diffusion in halide perovskites. It is shown that the really fast diffusers are protons, rather than halides, using deuterium isotope tracing in MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, and FAPbBr3, and other methods; that water is critical for proton diffusion, and that already reported results are compatible with this new insight.








Abstract
Ion diffusion affects the optoelectronic properties of halide&#8208;perovskites (HaPs). Until now, the fastest diffusion has been attributed to the movement of the halides, largely neglecting the contribution of protons, on the basis of computed density estimates. Here, the process of proton diffusion inside HaPs, following deuterium&#8211;hydrogen exchange and migration in MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, and FAPbBr3 single crystals, is proven through D/H NMR quantification, Raman spectroscopy, and elastic recoil detection analysis, challenging the original assumption of halide&#8208;dominated diffusion. The results are confirmed by impedance spectroscopy, where MAPbBr3&#8208; and CsPbBr3&#8208;based solar cells respond at very different frequencies. Water plays a key role in allowing the migration of protons as deuteration is not detected in its absence. The water contribution is modeled to explain and forecast its effect as a function of its concentration in the perovskite structure. These findings are of great importance as they evidence how unexpected, water&#8208;dependent proton diffusion can be at the basis of the &#8776;7 orders of magnitude spread of diffusion (attributed to I&#8722; and Br&#8722;) coefficient values, reported in the literature. The reported enhancement of the optoelectronic properties of HaP when exposed to small amounts of water may be related to the finding.

      <title>Recent Progress in Interconnection Layer for Hybrid Photovoltaic Tandems</title>
      <dc:description>
The introduction of an intermediate layer to bridge different solar cell technologies, which have become mature for the optimization of single&#8208;junction cells, is a critical technology of fabricating efficient hybrid tandem solar cells. The design and classification of an efficient interconnection layer that leverages the full potential of the hybrid tandems are discussed.








Abstract
Hybrid tandem solar cells offer the benefits of low cost and full solar spectrum utilization. Among the hybrid tandem structures explored to date, the most popular ones have four (simple stacking design) or two (terminal/tunneling layer addition design) terminal electrodes. Although the latter design is more cost&#8208;effective than the former, its widespread application is hindered by the difficulty of preparing an interface between two solar cell materials. The oldest approach to the in&#8208;series bonding of two or more bandgap solar cells relies on the introduction of a tunneling layer in multijunction III&#8211;V solar cells, but it has some limitations, e.g., the related materials/technologies are applicable only to III&#8211;V and certain other solar cells. Thus, alternative methods of realizing junction contacts based on the use of novel materials are highly sought after. Here, the strategies used to realize high&#8208;performance tandem cells are described, focusing on interface control in terms of bonding two or more solar cells for tandem approaches. The presented information is expected to aid the establishment of ideal methods of connecting two or more solar cells to obtain the highest performance for different solar cell choices with minimized energy loss through the interface.

      <title>Repeatable and Reprogrammable Shape Morphing from Photoresponsive Gold Nanorod/Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
      <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive gold nanorod/liquid crystal elastomer film is prepared, demonstrating excellent photothermal performance with fast actuation and recovery speed, cyclability, and the ability to achieve multiple shapes (both symmetric and asymmetric) from a single film with monodomain alignment of the liquid crystal director field through spatial modulation of the projected light to the film.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are of interest for applications such as soft robotics and shape&#8208;morphing devices. Among the different actuation mechanisms, light offers advantages such as spatial and local control of actuation via the photothermal effect. However, the unwanted aggregation of the light&#8208;absorbing nanoparticles in the LCE matrix will limit the photothermal response speed, actuation performance, and repeatability. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive LCE composite consisting of up to 0.20 wt% poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified gold nanorods (AuNRs) without apparent aggregation is demonstrated. The high Young's modulus, 20.3&#160;MPa, and excellent photothermal performance render repeated and fast actuation of the films (actuation within 5 s and recovery in 2 s) when exposed to 800&#160;nm light at an average output power of &#8776;1.0 W cm&#8722;2, while maintaining a large actuation strain (56%). Further, it is shown that the same sheet of AuNR/LCE film (100&#160;&#181;m thick) can be morphed into different shapes simply by varying the motifs of the photomasks.

Herein, a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive LCE composite consisting of up to 0.20 wt% poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified gold nanorods (AuNRs) without apparent aggregation is demonstrated. The high Young's modulus, 20.3&#160;MPa, and excellent photothermal performance render repeated and fast actuation of the films (actuation within 5 s and recovery in 2 s) when exposed to 800&#160;nm light at an average output power of &#8776;1.0 W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while maintaining a large actuation strain (56%). Further, it is shown that the same sheet of AuNR/LCE film (100&#160;&#181;m thick) can be morphed into different shapes simply by varying the motifs of the photomasks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Controlled Assembly of Liquid Metal Inclusions as a General Approach for Multifunctional Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
A general approach to synthesize soft material composites that incorporate liquid metal is described. The approach extends functionalities imparted by liquid metal inclusions to functional matrix materials. A key to this study is the understanding of the influence of processing parameters to activate electrical conductivity in the composites.








Abstract
Soft composites that use droplets of gallium&#8208;based liquid metal (LM) as the dispersion phase have the potential for transformative impact in multifunctional material engineering. However, it is unclear whether percolation pathways of LM can support high electrical conductivity in a wide range of matrix materials. This issue is addressed through an approach to LM composite synthesis that focuses on the interrelated effects of matrix curing/solidification and droplet formation. The combined influence of LM concentration, particle size, and sedimentation is explored. By developing this approach, the functionalities that have been demonstrated with LM composites can be generalized to other matrix materials that impart additional functionality. Specifically, composites are synthesized using a biodegradable/reprocessable plastic (polycaprolactone), a hydrogel (poly(vinyl alcohol)), and a processable rubber (a styrene&#8211;ethylene&#8211;butylene&#8211;styrene derivative) to demonstrate wide applicability. This method enables synthesis of composites: i) with high stretchability and negligible electromechanical coupling (&gt;600% strain); ii) with Joule&#8208;heated healing and reprocessability; iii) with electrical and mechanical self&#8208;healing; and iv) that can be printed. This approach to controlled assembly represents a widely applicable technique for creating new classes of LM composites with unprecedented multifunctionality.

      <title>Fractal Web Design of a Hemispherical Photodetector Array with Organic&#8208;Dye&#8208;Sensitized Graphene Hybrid Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;web&#8208;inspired fractal design is integrated with a high&#8208;performance photodetector array, providing a viable possibility for hemispherical light detection to replicate the vision system of arthropods such as insects and crustaceans. The enhanced photoresponsivity (&gt;1000 A W&#8722;1) and mechanical reliability of the hemisherical photodetector are enabled by the use of organic&#8208;dye&#8208;sensitized graphene hybrid composites.








Abstract
The vision system of arthropods consists of a dense array of individual photodetecting elements across a curvilinear surface. This compound&#8208;eye architecture could be a useful model for optoelectronic sensing devices that require a large field of view and high sensitivity to motion. Strategies that aim to mimic the compound&#8208;eye architecture involve integrating photodetector pixels with a curved microlens, but their fabrication on a curvilinear surface is challenged by the use of standard microfabrication processes that are traditionally designed for planar, rigid substrates (e.g., Si wafers). Here, a fractal web design of a hemispherical photodetector array that contains an organic&#8208;dye&#8208;sensitized graphene hybrid composite is reported to serve as an effective photoactive component with enhanced light&#8208;absorbing capabilities. The device is first fabricated on a planar Si wafer at the microscale and then transferred to transparent hemispherical domes with different curvatures in a deterministic manner. The unique structural property of the fractal web design provides protection of the device from damage by effectively tolerating various external loads. Comprehensive experimental and computational studies reveal the essential design features and optoelectronic properties of the device, followed by the evaluation of its utility in the measurement of both the direction and intensity of incident light.

      <title>Bloch Lines Constituting Antiskyrmions Captured via Differential Phase Contrast</title>
      <dc:description>
Recently, the discovery of transformations between magnetic spin textures, antiskyrmions and skyrmions, has generated a flurry of interest. The mechanism by which these topologically protected spin textures transform may be the creation and annihilation of Bloch lines. In this work, Bloch lines constituting antiskyrmions are directly measured, a significant advancement in the understanding of and quest to manipulate magnetic spin textures.








Abstract
Much scientific capital has been directed toward exotic magnetic spin textures called Bloch lines, that is, N&#233;el&#8208;type line boundaries within domain walls, because their geometry promises high&#8208;density magnetic storage. While predicted to arise in high&#8208;anisotropy magnets, bulk soft magnets, and thin films with in&#8208;plane magnetization, Bloch lines also constitute magnetic antiskyrmions, that is, topological antiparticles of skyrmions. Most domain walls occur as Bloch&#8208;type or N&#233;el&#8208;type, in which the magnetization rotates parallel or perpendicular to the domain wall across its profile, respectively. The Bloch lines&#8217; N&#233;el&#8208;type rotation and their minute size make them difficult to directly measure. This work utilizes differential phase contrast (DPC) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) to measure the in&#8208;plane magnetization of Bloch lines within antiskyrmions emergent in a non&#8208;centrosymmetric Heusler magnet with D2d symmetry, Mn1.4Pt0.9Pd0.1Sn, in addition to Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions in an FeGe magnet with B20&#8208;type crystal structure to benchmark the DPC technique. Both in&#8208;focus measurement and identification of Bloch lines at the antiskyrmion's corners are provided.

      <title>Record&#8208;Low Subthreshold&#8208;Swing Negative&#8208;Capacitance 2D Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
A 2D MoS2 negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistor based on a ferroelectric LiNbO3 platform performs a record&#8208;low subthreshold swing of 4.97&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and quasi&#8208;free hysteresis at room temperature, which can be attributed to the excellent capacitance matching under modulation of Vds, Vg, and channel length.








Abstract
Power consumption is one of the most challenging bottlenecks for complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8211;semiconductor integration. Negative&#8208;capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) offer a promising platform to break the thermionic limit defined by the Boltzmann tyranny and architect energy&#8208;efficient devices. However, it is a great challenge to achieving ultralow&#8208;subthreshold&#8208;swing (SS) (10&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and small&#8208;hysteresis NC&#8208;FETs simultaneously at room temperature, which has only been reported using the hafnium zirconium oxide system. Here, based on a ferroelectric LiNbO3 thin film with great spontaneous polarization, an ultralow&#8208;SS NC&#8208;FET with small hysteresis is designed. The LiNbO3 NC&#8208;FET platform exhibits a record&#8208;low SS of 4.97&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 with great repeatability due to the superior capacitance matching characteristic as evidenced by the negative differential resistance phenomenon. By modulating the structure and operating parameters (such as channel length (Lch), drain&#8211;sourse bias (Vds), and gate bias (Vg)) of devices, an optimized SS from &#8776;40 to &#8776;10&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and hysteresis from &#8776;900 to &#8776;60&#160;mV are achieved simultaneously. The results provide a new potential method for future highly integrated electronic and optical integrated energy&#8208;efficient devices.

      <dc:description>
The recent advancements in miniaturized cavity resonators employing three light engineering methods are discussed: 1) cladding engineering in subwavelength metal&#8208;clad cavities for room&#8208;temperature lasing and efficient waveguide coupling; 2) low&#8208;loss plasmonic cavities and waveguides engineered by plasmonic crystals; and 3) geometric engineering for photon squeezing into a deep&#8208;subwavelength space.








Abstract
Significant advances have been made in photonic integrated circuit technology, similar to the development of electronic integrated circuits. However, the miniaturization of cavity resonators, which are the essential components of photonic circuits, still requires considerable improvement. Over the past decades, various optical cavities have been utilized to implement next&#8208;generation light sources in photonic circuits with low energy, high data traffic, and integrable physical sizes. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to reduce the size of most commercialized cavities beyond the diffraction limit while maintaining high performance. Herein, recent advancements in subwavelength metallic cavities that can improve performance, even with the use of lossy plasmonic modes, are reviewed. The discussion is divided in three parts according to light engineering methods: subwavelength metal&#8208;clad cavities engineered using intermediate dielectric cladding; implementation of plasmonic cavities and waveguides using plasmonic crystals; and development of deep&#8208;subwavelength plasmonic waveguides and cavities using geometric engineering. A direction for further developments in photonic integrated circuit technology is also discussed, along with its practical application.

&lt;p&gt;Significant advances have been made in photonic integrated circuit technology, similar to the development of electronic integrated circuits. However, the miniaturization of cavity resonators, which are the essential components of photonic circuits, still requires considerable improvement. Over the past decades, various optical cavities have been utilized to implement next&#8208;generation light sources in photonic circuits with low energy, high data traffic, and integrable physical sizes. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to reduce the size of most commercialized cavities beyond the diffraction limit while maintaining high performance. Herein, recent advancements in subwavelength metallic cavities that can improve performance, even with the use of lossy plasmonic modes, are reviewed. The discussion is divided in three parts according to light engineering methods: subwavelength metal&#8208;clad cavities engineered using intermediate dielectric cladding; implementation of plasmonic cavities and waveguides using plasmonic crystals; and development of deep&#8208;subwavelength plasmonic waveguides and cavities using geometric engineering. A direction for further developments in photonic integrated circuit technology is also discussed, along with its practical application.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organic Semiconductor&#8211;DNA Hybrid Assemblies</title>
      <dc:description>
By virtue of the active role of DNAs, even conventional organic molecules widely used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes can become bioactive and generate biospecific photonics. The fabrication of emerging hybrid assemblies of DNAs complexed with various organic semiconductors is described, together with their applications in the field of biophotonic electronics resulting from their endowed biofunctions.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors are photonic and electronic materials with high luminescence, quantum efficiency, color tunability, and size&#8208;dependent optoelectronic properties. The self&#8208;assembly of organic molecules enables the establishment of a fabrication technique for organic micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;architectures with well&#8208;defined shapes, tunable sizes, and defect&#8208;free structures. DNAs, a class of biomacromolecules, have recently been used as an engineering material capable of intricate nanoscale structuring while simultaneously storing biological genetic information. Here, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date research on hybrid materials made from organic semiconductors and DNAs is presented. The trends in photonic and electronic phenomena discovered in DNA&#8208;functionalized and DNA&#8208;driven organic semiconductor hybrids, comprising small molecules and polymers, are observed. Various hybrid forms of solutions, arrayed chips, nanowires, and crystalline particles are discussed, focusing on the role of DNA in the hybrids. Furthermore, the recent technical advances achieved in the integration of DNAs in light&#8208;emitting devices, transistors, waveguides, sensors, and biological assays are presented. DNAs not only serve as a recognizing element in organic&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based sensors, but also as an active charge&#8208;control material in high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

      <title>A Multistage Cooperative Nanoplatform Enables Intracellular Co&#8208;Delivery of Proteins and Chemotherapeutics for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
A multistage cooperative drug delivery nanoplatform is developed to concurrently load doxorubicin and phenylboronic&#8208;acid&#8208;modified RNase A through hydrophobic interactions and dynamic covalent conjugation, respectively. This nanoplatform efficiently delivers both cargos into tumor sites with high systemic stability and mediates low&#8208;pH&#8208; and ROS&#8208;triggered cooperative release of doxorubicin and RNase A within tumor cells, leading to enhanced combined anticancer efficacy.








Abstract
Combining intracellularly active proteins with chemotherapeutics represents a promising strategy for synergistic cancer therapy. However, the lack of nanocarrier systems for delivery into cancer cells and controlled intracellular release of both physicochemically very distinct cargos significantly impedes the biomedical translation of this combination strategy in cancer therapy. Here, a well&#8208;designed triblock copolymer, mPEG&#8208;b&#8208;PGCA&#8208;b&#8208;PGTA, is reported for application in a multistage cooperative drug delivery nanoplatform that accomplishes effective intracellular co&#8208;delivery of hydrophilic ribonuclease A (RNase A) and hydrophobic doxorubicin (DOX). RNase A bioreversibly modified with phenylboronic acid groups via a ROS&#8208;cleavable carbamate linker is incorporated into the triblock copolymer nanoparticles with high efficiency through a pH&#8208;reversible phenylboronic acid&#8211;catechol linkage. The reversible covalent conjugations between RNase A and the triblock copolymer endow the nanoparticles with high stability under normal physiological conditions. Upon cellular internalization, the cooperative release of DOX and RNase A from the triblock copolymer nanoparticles is triggered at multiple stages by endosomal acidic environment and subsequent DOX&#8208;enhanced intracellular ROS environment. This leads to enhanced synergistic anticancer effects as demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Given the versatility of dynamic covalent conjugations, this work provides a universal and stable platform for intracellular co&#8208;delivery of various combinations of proteins and chemotherapeutics.

      <title>Historical Analysis of High&#8208;Efficiency, Large&#8208;Area Solar Cells: Toward Upscaling of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Lessons learned from the historical analysis of diverse solar cells provide a fundamental diagnosis of the relative and absolute development status of perovskite solar cells. The upscaling of perovskite solar cells and commercialization of various solar cells are comparatively analyzed and feasible technologies that can be applied to the perovskite upscaling process, both now and in the future, are suggested.








Abstract
The status and problems of upscaling research on perovskite solar cells, which must be addressed for commercialization efforts to be successful, are investigated. An 804 cm2 perovskite solar module has been reported with 17.9% efficiency, which is significantly lower than the champion perovskite solar cell efficiency of 25.2% reported for a 0.09 cm2 aperture area. For the realization of upscaling high&#8208;quality perovskite solar cells, the upscaling and development history of conventional silicon, copper indium gallium sulfur/selenide and CdTe solar cells, which are already commercialized with modules of sizes up to &#8776;25&#160;000 cm2, are reviewed. GaAs, organic, dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are also reviewed. The similarities of the operating mechanisms between the various solar cells and the origin of different development pathway are investigated, and the ideal upscaling direction of perovskite solar cells is subsequently proposed. It is believed that lessons learned from the historical analysis of various solar cells provide a fundamental diagnosis of relative and absolute development status of perovskite solar cells. The unique perspective proposed here can pave the way toward the upscaling of perovskite solar cells.

      <title>Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Design for Lithium Dendrite Suppression</title>
      <dc:description>
According to the proposed principles for the suppression of dendrite formation, a Li3N&#8211;LiF composite that is thermodynamically stable and has high interface energy against Li metal is designed as an interlayer for dendrite&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. A Li3N&#8211;LiF layer coating on a Li3PS4 solid&#8208;state electrolyte achieves a record&#8208;high critical current of &gt;6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 even at a high capacity of 6.0 mAh cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries have attracted extensive attention due to their high safety and high energy density. However, Li dendrite growth in solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) still hinders their application. Current efforts mainly aim to reduce the interfacial resistance, neglecting the intrinsic dendrite&#8208;suppression capability of SSEs. Herein, the mechanism for the formation of Li dendrites is investigated, and Li&#8208;dendrite&#8208;free SSE criteria are reported. To achieve a high dendrite&#8208;suppression capability, SSEs should be thermodynamically stable with a high interface energy against Li, and they should have a low electronic conductivity and a high ionic conductivity. A cold&#8208;pressed Li3N&#8211;LiF composite is used to validate the Li&#8208;dendrite&#8208;free design criteria, where the highly ionic conductive Li3N reduces the Li plating/stripping overpotential, and LiF with high interface energy suppresses dendrites by enhancing the nucleation energy and suppressing the Li penetration into the SSEs. The Li3N&#8211;LiF layer coating on Li3PS4 SSE achieves a record&#8208;high critical current of &gt;6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 even at a high capacity of 6.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Coulombic efficiency also reaches a record 99% in 150 cycles. The Li3N&#8211;LiF/Li3PS4 SSE enables LiCoO2 cathodes to achieve 101.6 mAh g&#8722;1 for 50 cycles. The design principle opens a new opportunity to develop high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

      <title>Dual&#8208;Metal Interbonding as the Chemical Facilitator for Single&#8208;Atom Dispersions</title>
      <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;metal (Rh&#63743;Fe) interbonding facilitates each metal species to be atomically dispersed. The presence of Rh&#63743;Fe bonding between adjacent Fe and Rh single atoms contributes to thermodynamic stability, which facilitates the stripping of a single Fe atom from Fe nanoparticles, leading to a stabilized single atom. The existence of Fe prevents the aggregation of Rh nanoparticles before pyrolysis.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed catalysts, with maximized atom utilization of expensive metal components and relatively stable ligand structures, offer high reactivity and selectivity. However, the formation of atomic&#8208;scale metals without aggregation remains a formidable challenge due to thermodynamic stabilization driving forces. Here, a top&#8208;down process is presented that starts from iron nanoparticles, using dual&#8208;metal interbonds (Rh&#63743;Fe bonding) as a chemical facilitator to spontaneously convert Fe nanoparticles to single atoms at low temperatures. The presence of Rh&#63743;Fe bonding between adjacent Fe and Rh single atoms contributes to the thermodynamic stability, which facilitates the stripping of a single Fe atom from the Fe nanoparticles, leading to the stabilized single atom. The dual single&#8208;atom Rh&#8211;Fe catalyst renders excellent electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction in an acidic electrolyte. This discovery of dual&#8208;metal interbonding as a chemical facilitator paves a novel route for atomic dispersion of chemical metals and the design of efficient catalysts at the atomic scale.

     alt="Dual&#8208;Metal Interbonding as the Chemical Facilitator for Single&#8208;Atom Dispersions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual&#8208;metal (Rh&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Fe) interbonding facilitates each metal species to be atomically dispersed. The presence of Rh&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Fe bonding between adjacent Fe and Rh single atoms contributes to thermodynamic stability, which facilitates the stripping of a single Fe atom from Fe nanoparticles, leading to a stabilized single atom. The existence of Fe prevents the aggregation of Rh nanoparticles before pyrolysis.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersed catalysts, with maximized atom utilization of expensive metal components and relatively stable ligand structures, offer high reactivity and selectivity. However, the formation of atomic&#8208;scale metals without aggregation remains a formidable challenge due to thermodynamic stabilization driving forces. Here, a top&#8208;down process is presented that starts from iron nanoparticles, using dual&#8208;metal interbonds (Rh&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Fe bonding) as a chemical facilitator to spontaneously convert Fe nanoparticles to single atoms at low temperatures. The presence of Rh&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Fe bonding between adjacent Fe and Rh single atoms contributes to the thermodynamic stability, which facilitates the stripping of a single Fe atom from the Fe nanoparticles, leading to the stabilized single atom. The dual single&#8208;atom Rh&#8211;Fe catalyst renders excellent electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction in an acidic electrolyte. This discovery of dual&#8208;metal interbonding as a chemical facilitator paves a novel route for atomic dispersion of chemical metals and the design of efficient catalysts at the atomic scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Magnetic&#8208;Pole Flip by Millimeter Wave</title>
      <dc:description>
A new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR)&#8221;, is demonstrated by irradiating a focused millimeter wave onto epsilon iron oxide. In F&#8208;MIMR, the magnetic pole direction is instantly switched by the focused millimeter wave generated from terahertz light, and the heat&#8208;up effect of the recording media is suppressed. Thus, F&#8208;MIMR can be applied to high&#8208;density magnetic recordings.








Abstract
In the era of Big Data and the Internet of Things, data archiving is a key technology. From this viewpoint, magnetic recordings are drawing attention because they guarantee long&#8208;term data storage. To archive an enormous amount of data, further increase of the recording density is necessary. Herein a new magnetic recording methodology, &#8220;focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave&#8208;assisted magnetic recording (F&#8208;MIMR),&#8221; is proposed. To test this methodology, magnetic films based on epsilon iron oxide nanoparticles are prepared and a focused&#8208;millimeter&#8208;wave generator is constructed using terahertz (THz) light. Irradiating the focused millimeter wave to epsilon iron oxide instantly switches its magnetic pole direction. The spin dynamics of F&#8208;MIMR are also calculated using the stochastic Landau&#8211;Lifshitz&#8211;Gilbert model considering all of the spins in an epsilon iron oxide nanoparticle. In F&#8208;MIMR, the heat&#8208;up effect of the recording media is expected to be suppressed. Thus, F&#8208;MIMR can be applied to high&#8208;density magnetic recordings.

An A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule, COi6&#8208;4Cl, is synthesized and exploited in tumor theranostics. COi6&#8208;4Cl absorbs 880 nm light to emit bright NIR&#8208;II emission and exert type&#8208;I/II combined photodynamic reactions, which can realize deep&#8208;penetration fluorescence imaging and hypoxia&#8208;tolerant photodynamic therapy simultaneously by the same NIR&#8208;light irradiation. These features make COi6&#8208;4Cl a distinguished single&#8208;NIR&#8208;wavelength&#8208;activated phototheranostic material.








Abstract
As a common feature in a majority of malignant tumors, hypoxia has become the Achilles&#8217; heel of photodynamic therapy (PDT). The development of type&#8208;I photosensitizers that show hypoxia&#8208;tolerant PDT efficiency provides a straightforward way to address this issue. However, type&#8208;I PDT materials have rarely been discovered. Herein, a &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecule with A&#8211;D&#8211;A configuration, COi6&#8208;4Cl, is reported. The H2O&#8208;dispersible nanoparticle of COi6&#8208;4Cl can be activated by an 880 nm laser, and displays hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I/II combined PDT capability, and more notably, a high NIR&#8208;II fluorescence with a quantum yield over 5%. Moreover, COi6&#8208;4Cl shows a negligible photothermal conversion effect. The non&#8208;radiative decay of COi6&#8208;4Cl is suppressed in the dispersed and aggregated state due to the restricted molecular vibrations and distinct intermolecular steric hindrance induced by its four bulky side chains. These features make COi6&#8208;4Cl a distinguished single&#8208;NIR&#8208;wavelength&#8208;activated phototheranostic material, which performs well in NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided PDT treatment and shows an enhanced in vivo anti&#8208;tumor efficiency over the clinically approved Chlorin e6, by the equal stresses on hypoxia&#8208;tolerant anti&#8208;tumor therapy and deep&#8208;penetration imaging. Therefore, the great potential of COi6&#8208;4Cl in precise PDT cancer therapy against hypoxia challenges is demonstrated.

      <title>A New Highly Anisotropic Rh&#8208;Based Heusler Compound for Magnetic Recording</title>
      <dc:description>
Rh2CoSb is introduced as a potential hard magnet for heat&#8208;assisted magnetic recording. The hardness parameter of 3.7 is the highest observed for any rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free hard magnet. The temperature dependence of the anisotropy, together with the high anisotropic thermal conductivity of 20 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, makes Rh2CoSb a candidate for heat&#8208;assisted writing with a high recording density.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;density magnetic recording media is limited by superparamagnetism in very small ferromagnetic crystals. Hard magnetic materials with strong perpendicular anisotropy offer stability and high recording density. To overcome the difficulty of writing media with a large coercivity, heat&#8208;assisted magnetic recording was developed, rapidly heating the media to the Curie temperature Tc before writing, followed by rapid cooling. Requirements are a suitable Tc, coupled with anisotropic thermal conductivity and hard magnetic properties. Here, Rh2CoSb is introduced as a new hard magnet with potential for thin&#8208;film magnetic recording. A magnetocrystalline anisotropy of 3.6 MJ m&#8722;3 is combined with a saturation magnetization of &#956;0Ms&#160;= 0.52 T at 2 K (2.2 MJ m&#8722;3 and 0.44 T at room temperature). The magnetic hardness parameter of 3.7 at room temperature is the highest observed for any rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free hard magnet. The anisotropy is related to an unquenched orbital moment of 0.42 &#956;B on Co, which is hybridized with neighboring Rh atoms with a large spin&#8211;orbit interaction. Moreover, the pronounced temperature dependence of the anisotropy that follows from its Tc of 450 K, together with a thermal conductivity of 20 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, make Rh2CoSb a candidate for the development of heat&#8208;assisted writing with a recording density in excess of 10&#160;Tb in.&#8722;2.

      <title>Discovery of Real&#8208;Space Topological Ferroelectricity in Metallic Transition Metal Phosphides</title>
      <dc:description>
Ferroelectric metals are an intriguing frontier research field. Real&#8208;space topological ferroelectricity in asymmetric Ni2P metal is reported. Governed by a balance of the polyhedral polarity, the in&#8208;plane compressive strain creates a tunable bilinear double&#8208;well potential, and the reversible polarity couples with the momentum&#8208;dependent spin polarization. These findings open up a field for exploring valence&#8211;polarity&#8211;spin correlation in metallic systems with non&#8208;centrosymmetry.








Abstract
Ferroelectric metals&#8212;with coexisting ferroelectricity and structural asymmetry&#8212;challenge traditional perceptions because free electrons screen electrostatic forces between ions, the driving force of breaking the spatial inversion symmetry. Despite ferroelectric metals having been unveiled one after another, topologically switchable polar objects with metallicity have never been identified so far. Here, the discovery of real&#8208;space topological ferroelectricity in metallic and non&#8208;centrosymmetric Ni2P is reported. Protected by the rotation&#8211;inversion symmetry operation, it is found that the balanced polarity of alternately stacked polyhedra couples intimately with elemental valence states, which are verified using quantitative electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that an applied in&#8208;plane compressive strain creates a tunable bilinear double&#8208;well potential and reverses the polyhedral polarity on a unit&#8208;cell scale. The dual roles of nickel cations, including polar displacement inside polyhedral cages and a 3D bonding network, facilitate the coexistence of topological polarity with metallicity. In addition, the switchable in&#8208;plane polyhedral polarity gives rise to a spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupling&#8208;induced spin texture with large momentum&#8208;dependent spin splitting. These findings point out a new direction for exploring valence&#8211;polarity&#8211;spin correlative interactions via topological ferroelectricity in metallic systems with structural asymmetry.

First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that an applied in&#8208;plane compressive strain creates a tunable bilinear double&#8208;well potential and reverses the polyhedral polarity on a unit&#8208;cell scale. The dual roles of nickel cations, including polar displacement inside polyhedral cages and a 3D bonding network, facilitate the coexistence of topological polarity with metallicity. In addition, the switchable in&#8208;plane polyhedral polarity gives rise to a spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupling&#8208;induced spin texture with large momentum&#8208;dependent spin splitting. These findings point out a new direction for exploring valence&#8211;polarity&#8211;spin correlative interactions via topological ferroelectricity in metallic systems with structural asymmetry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence from a Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Compound</title>
      <dc:description>
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence from an organic thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) compound is demonstrated. It is also shown that this phenomenon can occur in a number of chemically distinct host matrices. Furthermore, this work reveals the important role that photoinduced charges play in TADF&#8208;emitter&#8208;doped films, which has a significant impact on their photophysical properties.








Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) is one of the most promising methods for long&#8208;lived&#8208;emission applications. However, present room&#8208;temperature OLPL emitters are mainly based on a bimolecular exciplex system which usually needs an expensive small molecule such as 2,8&#8208;bis(diphenyl&#8208;phosphoryl)dibenzo[b,d]thiophene (PPT) as the acceptor. In this study, a new thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) compound, 3&#8208;(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]pyrazine&#8208;8,9&#8208;dicarbonitrile (CzPhAP), is designed, which also shows OLPL in many well&#8208;known hosts such as PPT, 2,2&#8242;,2&#8243;&#8208;(1,3,5&#8208;benzinetriyl)&#8208;tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1&#8208;H&#8208;benzimidazole) (TPBi), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), without any exciplex formation, and its OLPL duration reaches more than 1&#160;h at room temperature. Combining the low cost of PMMA manufacture and flexible designs of TADF molecules, pure organic, large&#8208;scale, color tunable, and low&#8208;cost room&#8208;temperature OLPL applications become possible. Moreover, it is found that the onset of the 77&#160;K afterglow spectra from a TADF&#8208;emitter&#8208;doped film is not necessarily reliable for determining the lowest triplet state energy level. This is because in some TADF&#8208;emitter&#8208;doped films, optical excitation can generate charges (electron and holes) that can later recombine to form singlet excitons during the phosphorescence spectrum measurement. The spectrum taken in the phosphorescence time window at low temperature may consequently consist of both singlet and triplet emission.

      <title>Quantum Computing: Exploiting a Single&#8208;Crystal Environment to Minimize the Charge Noise on Qubits in Silicon (Adv. Mater. 40/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Atom qubits in silicon provide a promising platform for realising a scalable quantum computer. In article number 2003361, Michelle Simmons and co&#8208;workers present a qubit environment with a notably low level of charge noise achieved by hosting phosphorus atoms in an all&#8208;crystalline silicon substrate well&#8208;separated from surface and interface states. The level of charge noise experienced by the phosphorus atoms is sufficiently low to enable two&#8208;qubit gate fidelities above 99.99%, well within the 99% threshold required for error&#8208;correction.

In article number 2004300, Young Keun Kim, Heemin Kang, and co&#8208;workers report a magnetic nano&#8208;barcoding system that enables unique tunability of ligand frequency and nano&#8208;sequences to effectively regulate stem cell adhesion with no systemic toxicity in vivo.

      <title>Functional Fibers and Fabrics for Soft Robotics, Wearables, and Human&#8211;Robot Interface</title>
      <dc:description>
A relation map of dynamic fibers/fabrics with responsive functions, including actuation, sensing, and energy harvesting, is built for potential construction of a soft, safe, user&#8208;friendly human&#8211;robot interface. It promises the seamless integration between actuators, sensors, and power sources into fibers/fabrics, envisaging self&#8208;regulated, autonomous, and intelligent robotic fibers/fabrics for daily functions and biomedical services.








Abstract
Soft robotics inspired by the movement of living organisms, with excellent adaptability and accuracy for accomplishing tasks, are highly desirable for efficient operations and safe interactions with human. With the emerging wearable electronics, higher tactility and skin affinity are pursued for safe and user&#8208;friendly human&#8211;robot interactions. Fabrics interlocked by fibers perform traditional static functions such as warming, protection, and fashion. Recently, dynamic fibers and fabrics are favorable to deliver active stimulus responses such as sensing and actuating abilities for soft&#8208;robots and wearables. First, the responsive mechanisms of fiber/fabric actuators and their performances under various external stimuli are reviewed. Fiber/yarn&#8208;based artificial muscles for soft&#8208;robots manipulation and assistance in human motion are discussed, as well as smart clothes for improving human perception. Second, the geometric designs, fabrications, mechanisms, and functions of fibers/fabrics for sensing and energy harvesting from the human body and environments are summarized. Effective integration between the electronic components with garments, human skin, and living organisms is illustrated, presenting multifunctional platforms with self&#8208;powered potential for human&#8211;robot interactions and biomedicine. Lastly, the relationships between robotic/wearable fibers/fabrics and the external stimuli, together with the challenges and possible routes for revolutionizing the robotic fibers/fabrics and wearables in this new era are proposed.

      <title>Scalable Functionalization of Optical Fibers Using Atomically Thin Semiconductors</title>
      <dc:description>
Chemical vapor deposition of monolayer MoS2 and WS2 on microstructured optical fibers is used to integrate atomically thin materials into optical fibers. This approach yields novel opportunities in integrated photonics. In two proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments excitation, and collection of excitonic photoluminescence with the fiber modes and third&#8208;harmonic enhancement due to nonlinear polarization of the monolayers is demonstrated.








Abstract
Atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides are highly promising for integrated optoelectronic and photonic systems due to their exciton&#8208;driven linear and nonlinear interactions with light. Integrating them into optical fibers yields novel opportunities in optical communication, remote sensing, and all&#8208;fiber optoelectronics. However, the scalable and reproducible deposition of high&#8208;quality monolayers on optical fibers is a challenge. Here, the chemical vapor deposition of monolayer MoS2 and WS2 crystals on the core of microstructured exposed&#8208;core optical fibers and their interaction with the fibers&#8217; guided modes are reported. Two distinct application possibilities of 2D&#8208;functionalized waveguides to exemplify their potential are demonstrated. First, the excitonic 2D material photoluminescence is simultaneously excited and collected with the fiber modes, opening a novel route to remote sensing. Then it is shown that third&#8208;harmonic generation is modified by the highly localized nonlinear polarization of the monolayers, yielding a new avenue to tailor nonlinear optical processes in fibers. It is anticipated that the results may lead to significant advances in optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;based technologies.

      <title>Progress in Materials, Solution Processes, and Long&#8208;Term Stability for Large&#8208;Area Organic Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials and processing technologies are promising for transitioning of OPV devices from laboratory&#8208;scale to large&#8208;area industrial scale modules. Recent breakthroughs attained by development of nonfullerene acceptors have led to significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency. It is essential to elucidate degradation mechanisms of OPV devices for improving device long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Organic solar cells based on bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) are attractive energy&#8208;conversion devices that can generate electricity from absorbed sunlight by dissociating excitons and collecting charge carriers. Recent breakthroughs attained by development of nonfullerene acceptors result in significant enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCEs) exceeding 17%. However, most of researches have focused on pursuing high efficiency of small&#8208;area (&lt;1 cm2) unit cells fabricated usually with spin coating. For practical application of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) from lab&#8208;scale unit cells to industrial products, it is essential to develop efficient technologies that can extend active area of devices with minimized loss of performance and ensured operational stability. In this progress report, an overview of recent advancements in materials and processing technologies is provided for transitioning from small&#8208;area laboratory&#8208;scale devices to large&#8208;area industrial scale modules. First, development of materials that satisfy requirements of high tolerability in active layer thickness and large&#8208;area adaptability is introduced. Second, morphology control using various coating techniques in a large active area is discussed. Third, the recent research progress is also underlined for understanding mechanisms of OPV degradation and studies for improving device long&#8208;term stability along with reliable evaluation procedures.

      <title>Continuous Synthesis of Hollow High&#8208;Entropy Nanoparticles for Energy and Catalysis Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
The rapid and continuous synthesis of hollow high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) nanoparticles by a &#8220;droplet&#8208;to&#8208;particle&#8221; nanomanufacturing method is reported. The formation of hollow HEA nanoparticles is enabled by the introduction of a blowing agent. The high active sites per mass ratio of such hollow HEA nanoparticles makes them promising candidates for electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Mixing multimetallic elements in hollow&#8208;structured nanoparticles is a promising strategy for the synthesis of highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective catalysts. However, the synthesis of multimetallic hollow nanoparticles is limited to two or three elements due to the difficulties in morphology control under the harsh alloying conditions. Herein, the rapid and continuous synthesis of hollow high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) nanoparticles using a continuous &#8220;droplet&#8208;to&#8208;particle&#8221; method is reported. The formation of these hollow HEA nanoparticles is enabled through the decomposition of a gas&#8208;blowing agent in which a large amount of gas is produced in situ to &#8220;puff&#8221; the droplet during heating, followed by decomposition of the metal salt precursors and nucleation/growth of multimetallic particles. The high active sites per mass ratio of such hollow HEA nanoparticles makes them promising candidates for energy and electrocatalysis applications. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, it is demonstrated that these materials can be applied as the cathode catalyst for Li&#8211;O2 battery operations with a record&#8208;high current density per catalyst mass loading of 2000&#160;mA gcat.&#8722;1, as well as good stability and durable catalytic activity. This work offers a viable strategy for the continuous manufacturing of hollow HEA nanomaterials that can find broad applications in energy and catalysis.

      <title>Biomineralized Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles Potentiate Safe and Efficient Tumor Microenvironment Reprogramming for Anticancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Outer membrane vesicle (OMV)&#8208;based platform is developed through biomineralization, in which biocompatible calcium phosphate is employed to cover the surface of OMVs. Such a &#8220;shielding&#8221; strategy not only enables safe and flexible deployment of OMVs for tumor accumulation and tumor microenvironment (TME) reprogramming, but also brings an additional functionality of neutralizing the acidic TME, leading to a potent anticancer therapeutic effect.








Abstract
The highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in solid tumors often dampens the efficacy of immunotherapy. In this study, bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are demonstrated as powerful immunostimulants for TME reprogramming. To overcome the obstacles of antibody&#8208;dependent clearance and high toxicity induced by OMVs upon intravenous injection (a classic clinically relevant delivery mode), calcium phosphate (CaP) shells are employed to cover the surface of OMVs, which enables potent OMV&#8208;based TME reprograming without side effects. Meanwhile, the pH&#8208;sensitive CaP shells facilitate the neutralization of acidic TME, leading to highly beneficial M2&#8208;to&#8208;M1 polarization of macrophages for improved antitumor effect. Moreover, the outer shells can be integrated with functional components like folic acid or photosensitizer agents, which facilitates the use of the OMV&#8208;based platform in combination therapies for a synergic therapeutic effect.

      <title>Pressure&#8208;Dependent Behavior of Defect&#8208;Modulated Band Structure in Boron Arsenide</title>
      <dc:description>
Impurities and defects play a significant role in the thermal, electrical, and optical properties of boron arsenide (BAs). Si&#8208;/C&#8208; donor&#8211;acceptor pair transitions are identified within the indirect bandgap. With high pressure/strain applied by a diamond anvil cell, the intrinsic band structure of BAs can be modified, suggesting potential applications in electronic devices by strain.








Abstract
The recent observation of unusually high thermal conductivity exceeding 1000 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal boron arsenide (BAs) has led to interest in the potential application of this semiconductor for thermal management. Although both the electron/hole high mobilities have been calculated for BAs, there is a lack of experimental investigation of its electronic properties. Here, a photoluminescence (PL) measurement of single&#8208;crystal BAs at different temperatures and pressures is reported. The measurements reveal an indirect bandgap and two donor&#8211;acceptor pair (DAP) recombination transitions. Based on first&#8208;principles calculations and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry results, the two DAP transitions are confirmed to originate from Si and C impurities occupying shallow energy levels in the bandgap. High&#8208;pressure PL spectra show that the donor level with respect to the conduction band minimum shrinks with increasing pressure, which affects the release of free carriers from defect states. These findings suggest the possibility of strain engineering of the transport properties of BAs for application in electronic devices.

      <title>Emerging Prospects of Exosomes for Cancer Treatment: From Conventional Therapy to Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Exosomes are nano&#8208;sized vesicles secreted by cells that reflect features of parental cells and play critical roles in intercellular communication. Exosomes are suitable for cancer treatment by providing an optimal environment to convey various bioactive molecules. This review covers advantages of using exosomes for cancer treatment from conventional therapy to immunotherapy, and challenges to be solved for clinical usage.








Abstract
Exosomes are a class of extracellular vesicles of around 100&#160;nm in diameter that are secreted by most cells and contain various bioactive molecules reflecting their cellular origin and mediate intercellular communication. Studies of these exosomal features in tumor pathogenesis have led to the development of therapeutic and diagnostic approaches using exosomes for cancer therapy. Exosomes have many advantages for conveying therapeutic agents such as small interfering RNAs, microRNAs, membrane&#8208;associated proteins, and chemotherapeutic compounds; thus, they are considered a prime candidate as a delivery tool for cancer treatment. Since exosomes also provide an optimal microenvironment for the effective function of immunomodulatory factors, exosomes harboring bioactive molecules have been bioengineered as cancer immunotherapies that can effectively activate each stage of the cancer immunity cycle to successfully elicit cancer&#8208;specific immunity. This review discusses the advantages of exosomes for treating cancer and the challenges that must be overcome for their successful clinical development.

      <title>Tunable Ferromagnetism and Thermally Induced Spin Flip in Vanadium&#8208;Doped Tungsten Diselenide Monolayers at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
Strong and tunable room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism is achieved in vanadium&#8208;doped tungsten diselenide monolayers using a reproducible and atmospheric&#8208;pressure film sulfidation growth method. As the vanadium concentration increases, the saturation magnetization increases, which is optimal at &#8776;4 at% vanadium&#8212;the highest doping level ever achieved for V&#8208;doped WSe2 monolayers. A novel thermally induced spin flipping effect is also discovered in these monolayers.








Abstract
The outstanding optoelectronic and valleytronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have triggered intense research efforts by the scientific community. An alternative to induce long&#8208;range ferromagnetism (FM) in TMDs is by introducing magnetic dopants to form a dilute magnetic semiconductor. Enhancing ferromagnetism in these semiconductors not only represents a key step toward modern TMD&#8208;based spintronics, but also enables exploration of new and exciting dimensionality&#8208;driven magnetic phenomena. To this end, tunable ferromagnetism at room temperature and a thermally induced spin flip (TISF) in monolayers of V&#8208;doped WSe2 are shown. As vanadium concentration increases, the saturation magnetization increases, which is optimal at &#8776;4 at% vanadium; the highest doping level ever achieved for V&#8208;doped WSe2 monolayers. The TISF occurs at &#8776;175 K and becomes more pronounced upon increasing the temperature toward room temperature. The TISF can be manipulated by changing the vanadium concentration. The TISF is attributed to the magnetic&#8208;field&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent flipping of the nearest W&#8208;site magnetic moments that are antiferromagnetically coupled to the V magnetic moments in the ground state. This is fully supported by a recent spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory study. The findings pave the way for the development of novel spintronic and valleytronic nanodevices and stimulate further research.

The achieved cycling durability (3000 cycles), ultrafast charging (71% state of charge in 1.9 min), high energy and power densities (193.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 7200 W kg&#8722;1) highlight it as a promising new cathode category for Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safety aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are an exceptionally compelling technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, their development has been plagued by the lack of stable cathode materials allowing fast Zn2+&#8208;ion insertion and scalable synthesis. Here, a lattice&#8208;water&#8208;rich, inorganic&#8208;open&#8208;framework (IOF) phosphovanadate cathode, which is mass&#8208;producible and delivers high capacity (228 mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (193.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 or 513&#160;Wh L&#8722;1), is reported. The abundant lattice waters functioning as a &#8220;charge shield&#8221; enable a low Zn2+&#8208;migration energy barrier, (0.66&#160;eV) even close to that of Li+ within LiFePO4. This fast intrinsic ion&#8208;diffusion kinetics, together with nanostructure effect, allow the achievements of ultrafast charging (71% state of charge in 1.9 min) and an ultrahigh power density (7200 W kg&#8722;1 at 107&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1). Equally important, the IOF exhibits a quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain feature (&lt;1% lattice change upon (de)zincation), which ensures ultrahigh cycling durability (3000 cycles) and Coulombic efficiencies of 100%. The cell&#8208;level energy and power densities reach &#8776;90&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and &#8776;3320 W kg&#8722;1, far surpassing commercial lead&#8211;acid, Ni&#8211;Cd, and Ni&#8211;MH batteries. Lattice&#8208;water&#8208;rich IOFs may open up new opportunities for exploring stable and fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

      <title>Six Birds with One Stone: Versatile Nanoporphyrin for Single&#8208;Laser&#8208;Triggered Synergistic Phototheranostics and Robust Immune Activation</title>
      <dc:description>
A versatile nanoporphyrin (Pp18&#8208;lipo) that self&#8208;assembled from lipid&#8211;purpurin 18 conjugates (Pp18&#8208;lipids) and pure lipids is developed for multifunctional cancer theranostics. Upon exposure to a single 705&#160;nm&#8208;laser, the as&#8208;prepared Pp18&#8208;lipos with two different proportions of Pp18&#8208;lipids can simultaneously realize photoacoustic imaging, fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and immune activation.








Abstract
Simultaneous photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) can reduce the risks of drug leakage, body burden, and preparation complexity in traditional combination PDT/PTT. Here, a versatile nanoporphyrin (Pp18&#8208;lipos) self&#8208;assembled from lipid&#8211;purpurin 18 conjugates (Pp18&#8208;lipids) and pure lipids is presented. The as&#8208;prepared Pp18&#8208;lipos with 2 mol% Pp18&#8208;lipids can perform effective PDT and fluorescence imaging. The Pp18&#8208;lipos with 65 mol% Pp18 can perform potent PTT and photoacoustic imaging. The chelation of Mn2+ endows the Pp18&#8208;lipids&#8208;Mn2+ a high T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging contrast. Notably, pretreatment of low&#8208;dose PDT facilitates the endocytosis and tumor accumulation of Pp18&#8208;lipos, thus achieving synergistic PDT/PTT. Upon exposure to a single 705&#160;nm&#8208;laser, the combination of PDT/PTT achieves a significantly higher tumor growth inhibition rate than PDT or PTT alone. In addition, it is found that the synergistic PDT/PTT triggers more potent anti&#8208;tumor immune response including tumor infiltration of immune cells and release of related cytokines.

Upon exposure to a single 705&#160;nm&#8208;laser, the as&#8208;prepared Pp18&#8208;lipos with two different proportions of Pp18&#8208;lipids can simultaneously realize photoacoustic imaging, fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and immune activation.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) can reduce the risks of drug leakage, body burden, and preparation complexity in traditional combination PDT/PTT. Here, a versatile nanoporphyrin (Pp18&#8208;lipos) self&#8208;assembled from lipid&#8211;purpurin 18 conjugates (Pp18&#8208;lipids) and pure lipids is presented. The as&#8208;prepared Pp18&#8208;lipos with 2 mol% Pp18&#8208;lipids can perform effective PDT and fluorescence imaging. The Pp18&#8208;lipos with 65 mol% Pp18 can perform potent PTT and photoacoustic imaging. The chelation of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; endows the Pp18&#8208;lipids&#8208;Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; a high &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging contrast. Notably, pretreatment of low&#8208;dose PDT facilitates the endocytosis and tumor accumulation of Pp18&#8208;lipos, thus achieving synergistic PDT/PTT. Upon exposure to a single 705&#160;nm&#8208;laser, the combination of PDT/PTT achieves a significantly higher tumor growth inhibition rate than PDT or PTT alone. In addition, it is found that the synergistic PDT/PTT triggers more potent anti&#8208;tumor immune response including tumor infiltration of immune cells and release of related cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bioinspired Anti&#8208;Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh&#8208;Instability on Dual Parallel Fibers</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired by the unique topological structure of mulberry silk, a facile strategy is proposed to overcome the fluidic Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instability (PRI) during the fibrous solution coating process using dual parallel cylindrical fibers, by which a uniform and smooth coating on fibers is realized.








Abstract
The Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instability (PRI) is a well&#8208;known phenomenon where a liquid column always breaks up into droplets to achieve the minimization of surface energy. It normally leads to the non&#8208;uniformity of a liquid film, which, however, is unfavorable for the fluid coating process. So far, strategies to overcome this instability rely on either the surfactants, UV/high&#8208;temp curing treatments, or specific chemical reactions, which suffer from both limited liquid composition and complicated experimental conditions. Natural mulberry silk, a typical composite fiber, is produced by silkworms through a similar fluidic coating process, but exhibits a remarkably uniform and smooth surface. Drawing inspiration, it is revealed that the unique dual parallel fibers are capable of overcoming the PRI during the fluid coating process. Such anti&#8208;PRI ability is attributable to the changes in the Laplace pressure difference caused by the alternative asymmetry of the liquid film, as has been demonstrated by both a force analysis on the irregular liquid film and theoretical simulation according to the stability of the liquid on parallel fibers in the fluid coating process. The strategy is applicable for preparing various smooth functional coatings on fibers, which offers new perspectives for fluid coating and microfluidic technologies.

      <title>An Organelle&#8208;Specific Nanozyme for Diabetes Care in Genetically or Diet&#8208;Induced Models</title>
      <dc:description>
Iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) subcellularly induce adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate&#8208;activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation via organelle&#8208;specific peroxidase&#8208;like activity. Administration of Fe3O4 NPs enhances the glucose uptake capacity and insulin sensitivity, demonstrating therapeutic effects on hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in Drosophila and mouse models of type 2 diabetes.








Abstract
The development of nanozymes has made active impact in diagnosis and therapeutics. However, understanding of the full effects of these nanozymes on biochemical pathways and metabolic homeostasis remains elusive. Here, it is found that iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs), a type of well&#8208;established nanozyme, can locally regulate the energy sensor adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;monophosphate&#8208;activated protein kinase (AMPK) via their peroxidase&#8208;like activity in the acidic lysosomal compartment, thereby promoting glucose metabolism and insulin response. Fe3O4 NPs induce AMPK activation and enhance glucose uptake in a variety of metabolically active cells as well as in insulin resistant cell models. Dietary Fe3O4 NPs display therapeutic effects on hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in Drosophila models of diabetes induced by genetic manipulation or high&#8208;sugar diet. More importantly, intraperitoneal administration of Fe3O4 NPs stimulates AMPK activities in metabolic tissues, reduces blood glucose levels, and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diabetic ob/ob mice. The study reveals intrinsic organelle&#8208;specific properties of Fe3O4 NPs in AMPK activation, glycemic control, and insulin&#8208;resistance improvement, suggesting their potential efficacy in diabetes care.

      <title>Hole&#8208;Trapping&#8208;Induced Stabilization of Ni4&#8201;+ in SrNiO3/LaFeO3 Superlattices</title>
      <dc:description>
The otherwise unstable Ni4+ can be stabilized in perovskite oxides by artificial structuring in carefully designed (SrNiO3)1/(LaFeO3)n superlattices. Spectroscopy measurements in combination with density functional theory calculations reveal that the B&#8208;site cation valences can be tuned by controlling the magnitude of the FeO6 octahedral rotations, which in turn drive the energy balance between Ni3+/Fe4+ and Ni4+/Fe3+, thus controlling emergent electrical properties.








Abstract
Creating new functionality in materials containing transition metals is predicated on the ability to control the associated charge states. For a given transition metal, there is an upper limit on valence that is not exceeded under normal conditions. Here, it is demonstrated that this limit of 3+ for Ni and Fe can be exceeded via synthesis of (SrNiO3)m/(LaFeO3)n superlattices by tuning n and m. The Goldschmidt tolerance constraints are lifted, and SrNi4+O3 with holes on adjacent O anions is stabilized as a perovskite at the single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell level (m&#160;= 1). Holding m&#160;= 1, spectroscopy reveals that the n&#160;= 1 superlattice contains Ni3+ and Fe4+, whereas Ni4+ and Fe3+ are observed in the n&#160;= 5 superlattice. It is revealed that the B&#8208;site cation valences can be tuned by controlling the magnitude of the FeO6 octahedral rotations, which, in turn, determine the energy balance between Ni3+/Fe4+ and Ni4+/Fe3+, thus controlling emergent electrical properties such as the band alignment and resulting hole confinement. This approach can be extended to other systems for synthesizing novel, metastable layered structures with new functionalities.

Cross&#8208;reactive colorimetric barcode combinatorics and deep convolutional neural networks are combined to form a portable, automatic, and accurate, real&#8208;time platform for monitoring of meat freshness.








Abstract
Artificial scent screening systems (known as electronic noses, E&#8208;noses) have been researched extensively. A portable, automatic, and accurate, real&#8208;time E&#8208;nose requires both robust cross&#8208;reactive sensing and fingerprint pattern recognition. Few E&#8208;noses have been commercialized because they suffer from either sensing or pattern&#8208;recognition issues. Here, cross&#8208;reactive colorimetric barcode combinatorics and deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are combined to form a system for monitoring meat freshness that concurrently provides scent fingerprint and fingerprint recognition. The barcodes&#8212;comprising 20 different types of porous nanocomposites of chitosan, dye, and cellulose acetate&#8212;form scent fingerprints that are identifiable by DCNN. A fully supervised DCNN trained using 3475 labeled barcode images predicts meat freshness with an overall accuracy of 98.5%. Incorporating DCNN into a smartphone application forms a simple platform for rapid barcode scanning and identification of food freshness in real time. The system is fast, accurate, and non&#8208;destructive, enabling consumers and all stakeholders in the food supply chain to monitor food freshness.

      <title>Emerging Memristive Artificial Synapses and Neurons for Energy&#8208;Efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <dc:description>
Memristors hold the limelight as emerging electronic devices that can apply to both an artificial synapse and neuron for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing technologies. In this progress report, the recent advances of the memristive electronic system are comprehensively introduced and discussed in terms of various types of the memristors, their functional principles, representative learning algorithms, and hardware implementations.








Abstract
Memristors have recently attracted significant interest due to their applicability as promising building blocks of neuromorphic computing and electronic systems. The dynamic reconfiguration of memristors, which is based on the history of applied electrical stimuli, can mimic both essential analog synaptic and neuronal functionalities. These can be utilized as the node and terminal devices in an artificial neural network. Consequently, the ability to understand, control, and utilize fundamental switching principles and various types of device architectures of the memristor is necessary for achieving memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic hardware systems. Herein, a wide range of memristors and memristive&#8208;related devices for artificial synapses and neurons is highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;Memristors hold the limelight as emerging electronic devices that can apply to both an artificial synapse and neuron for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing technologies. In this progress report, the recent advances of the memristive electronic system are comprehensively introduced and discussed in terms of various types of the memristors, their functional principles, representative learning algorithms, and hardware implementations.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memristors have recently attracted significant interest due to their applicability as promising building blocks of neuromorphic computing and electronic systems. The dynamic reconfiguration of memristors, which is based on the history of applied electrical stimuli, can mimic both essential analog synaptic and neuronal functionalities. These can be utilized as the node and terminal devices in an artificial neural network. Consequently, the ability to understand, control, and utilize fundamental switching principles and various types of device architectures of the memristor is necessary for achieving memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic hardware systems. Herein, a wide range of memristors and memristive&#8208;related devices for artificial synapses and neurons is highlighted. The device structures, switching principles, and the applications of essential synaptic and neuronal functionalities are sequentially presented. Moreover, recent advances in memristive artificial neural networks and their hardware implementations are introduced along with an overview of the various learning algorithms. Finally, the main challenges of the memristive synapses and neurons toward high&#8208;performance and energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing are briefly discussed. This progress report aims to be an insightful guide for the research on memristors and neuromorphic&#8208;based computing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Prebiotics&#8208;Encapsulated Probiotic Spores Regulate Gut Microbiota and Suppress Colon Cancer</title>
      <dc:description>
Through host&#8211;guest chemistry between Clostridium butyricum and chemically modified prebiotic dextran, prebiotics&#8208;encapsulated probiotic spores (spores&#8208;dex) are prepared to achieve oral bacterial treatment of colon cancer.








Abstract
While microbial&#8208;based therapy has been considered as an effective strategy for treating diseases such as colon cancer, its safety remains the biggest challenge. Here, probiotics and prebiotics, which possess ideal biocompatibility and are extensively used as additives in food and pharmaceutical products, are combined to construct a safe microbiota&#8208;modulating material. Through the host&#8211;guest chemistry between commercial Clostridium butyricum and chemically modified prebiotic dextran, prebiotics&#8208;encapsulated probiotic spores (spores&#8208;dex) are prepared. It is found that spores&#8208;dex can specifically enrich in colon cancers after oral administration. In the lesion, dextran is fermented by C. butyricum, and thereby produces anti&#8208;cancer short&#8208;chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Additionally, spores&#8208;dex regulate the gut microbiota, augment the abundance of SCFA&#8208;producing bacteria (e.g., Eubacterium and Roseburia), and markedly increase the overall richness of microbiota. In subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor models, drug&#8208;loaded spores&#8208;dex inhibit tumor growth up to 89% and 65%, respectively. Importantly, no obvious adverse effect is found. The work sheds light on the possibility of using a highly safe strategy to regulate gut microbiota, and provides a promising avenue for treating various gastrointestinal diseases.

      <dc:description>
Piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) aims to generate sufficient power to operate targeting devices from limited ambient energy. PEH includes mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;mechanical, mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical, and electrical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversions, which are related to structures, materials, and circuits, respectively; these should be efficient for increasing total power.

This critical review focuses on PEH structures and materials associated with the two major energy conversions to improve PEH performance. First, the resonance tuning mechanisms for PEH structures maintaining continuous resonance, regardless of a change in the vibration frequency, are presented. Based on the manual tuning technique, the electrically&#8208; and mechanically&#8208;driven self&#8208;resonance tuning (SRT) techniques are introduced in detail. The representative SRT harvesters are summarized in terms of tunability, power consumption, and net power. Second, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits of the piezoelectric materials for output power are summarized based on the operating conditions, and optimal piezoelectric materials are suggested. Piezoelectric materials with large kij, dij, and gij values are suitable for most PEHs, whereas those with large kij and Qm values should be used for on&#8208;resonance conditions, wherein the mechanical energy is directly supplied to the piezoelectric material. This comprehensive review provides insights for designing efficient structures and selection of proper piezoelectric materials for PEHs.

      <title>Energy Manipulation in Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles for Tunable Dual&#8208;Mode Luminescence toward Advanced Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
      <dc:description>
A new mechanistic strategy for achieving efficient dual&#8208;mode emissions with multicolor outputs in a designed core&#8211;shell nanostructure is proposed via Gd3+&#8208;mediated interfacial energy transfer and Ce3+&#8208;assisted cross&#8208;relaxation processes, which is of great significance for understanding and controlling energy transfer at the nanoscale and provides valuable references to the design of novel luminescent materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Developing advanced luminescent materials and techniques is of significant importance for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications, and remains a huge challenge. In this work, a new and efficient approach for achieving efficient dual&#8208;mode luminescence with tunable color outputs via Gd3+&#8208;mediated interfacial energy transfer, Ce3+&#8208;assisted cross&#8208;relaxation, and core&#8211;shell nanostructuring strategy is reported. The introduction of Ce3+ into the inner core not only serves the regulation of upconversion emission, but also facilitates the ultraviolet photon harvesting and subsequent energy transfer to downshifting (DS) activators in the outer shell layer. Furthermore, the construction of the core@shell nanoarchitecture enables the spatial separation of upconverting activators and DS centers, which greatly suppresses their adverse cross&#8208;relaxation processes. Consequently, efficient and multicolor&#8208;tunable dual&#8208;mode emissions can be simultaneously observed in the pre&#8208;designed NaGdF4:Yb/Ho/Ce@NaYF4:X (X = Eu, Tb, Sm, Dy) core&#8211;shell nanostructures under 254 nm ultraviolet light and 980 nm laser excitation. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment demonstrates that 2D&#8208;encoded patterns based on dual&#8208;mode emitting nanomaterials are very promising for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications. It is believed that this preliminary study will advance the development of the fluorescent materials for potential applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and optical multiplexing.

Abstract
Smart and wearable electronics have aroused substantial demand for flexible portable power sources, but it remains a large challenge to realize scalable production of wearable batteries/supercapacitors with high electrochemical performance and remarkable flexibility simultaneously. Here, a scalable approach is developed to prepare wearable solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs) with superior performance enabled by synergetic engineering from materials to device architecture. Nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical carbon (HC) composed of 1D carbon nanofibers welded with 2D carbon nanosheets is synthesized via a unique self&#8208;propagating high&#8208;temperature synthesis (SHS) technique, which exhibits superior electrochemical performance. Subsequently, inspired by origami, here, wave&#8208;shaped LIC punch&#8208;cells based on the above materials are designed by employing a compatible and scalable post&#8208;imprint technology. Finite elemental analysis (FEA) confirms that the bending stress of the punch&#8208;cell can be offset effectively, benefiting from the wave architecture. The wearable solid&#8208;state LIC punch&#8208;cell exhibits large energy density, long cyclic stability, and superior flexibility. This study demonstrates great promise for scalable fabrication of wearable energy&#8208;storage systems.

      <title>Exploiting Unique Alignment of Cobalt Ferrite Nanoparticles, Mild Hyperthermia, and Controlled Intrinsic Cobalt Toxicity for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Trimodal cancer therapy using cobalt ferrite nanocubes (Co&#8211;Fe NCs) is proposed. Heat damage by mild hyperthermia effect; mechanical damage by collective movement of unique chains formed during hyperthermia treatment; and intrinsic cobalt toxicity by the slow and controlled degradation of nanoparticle within a tumor, all lead to a reduced tumor burden and improved overall survival in a preclinical animal model.








Abstract
Nanoparticle&#8208;based magnetic hyperthermia is a well&#8208;known thermal therapy platform studied to treat solid tumors, but its use for monotherapy is limited due to incomplete tumor eradication at hyperthermia temperature (45&#160;&#176;C).&#160;It is often combined with chemotherapy for obtaining a more effective therapeutic outcome. Cubic&#8208;shaped cobalt ferrite nanoparticles (Co&#8211;Fe NCs) serve as magnetic hyperthermia agents and as a cytotoxic agent due to the known cobalt ion toxicity, allowing the achievement of both heat and cytotoxic effects from a single platform. In addition to this advantage, Co&#8211;Fe NCs have the unique ability to form growing chains under an alternating magnetic field (AMF). This unique chain formation, along with the mild hyperthermia and intrinsic cobalt toxicity, leads to complete tumor regression and improved overall survival in an in vivo murine xenograft model, all under clinically approved AMF conditions. Numerical calculations identify magnetic anisotropy as the main Co&#8211;Fe NCs&#8217; feature to generate such chain formations. This novel combination therapy can improve the effects of magnetic hyperthermia, inaugurating investigation of mechanical behaviors of nanoparticles under AMF, as a new avenue for cancer therapy.

      <title>Direct Optical Patterning of Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via In Situ Ligand Exchange</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution direct optical patterning of quantum dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes is demonstrated using photoacid generators that induce photochemical reactions and in situ ligand exchange in QD films. Uniform electroluminescence patterns of QDs are produced with feature size down to 1.5 &#181;m while preserving the structural, optical, and electronic properties of patterned QDs.








Abstract
Precise patterning of quantum dot (QD) layers is an important prerequisite for fabricating QD light&#8208;emitting diode (QLED) displays and other optoelectronic devices. However, conventional patterning methods cannot simultaneously meet the stringent requirements of resolution, throughput, and uniformity of the pattern profile while maintaining a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the patterned QD layers. Here, a specially designed nanocrystal ink is introduced, &#8220;photopatternable emissive nanocrystals&#8221; (PENs), which satisfies these requirements. Photoacid generators in the PEN inks allow photoresist&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution optical patterning of QDs through photochemical reactions and in situ ligand exchange in QD films. Various fluorescence and electroluminescence patterns with a feature size down to &#8776;1.5 &#181;m are demonstrated using red, green, and blue PEN inks. The patterned QD films maintain &#8776;75% of original PLQY and the electroluminescence characteristics of the patterned QLEDs are comparable to thopse of non&#8208;patterned control devices. The patterning mechanism is elucidated by in&#8208;depth investigation of the photochemical transformations of the photoacid generators and changes in the optical properties of the QDs at each patterning step. This advanced patterning method provides a new way for additive manufacturing of integrated optoelectronic devices using colloidal QDs.

      <title>Highly Tunable Thiol&#8208;Ene Photoresins for Volumetric Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;ene resins are adapted for volumetric 3D printing by incorporating a threshold response using a polymerization inhibitor. This feature, combined with quantitative spatial control of the absorbed optical energy dose, makes volumetric additive manufacturing possible with a large new class of materials. Adjusting the monomer compositions of these thiol&#8208;enes accesses a broad range of mechanical properties.








Abstract
Volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) forms complete 3D objects in a single photocuring operation without layering defects, enabling 3D printed polymer parts with mechanical properties similar to their bulk material counterparts. This study presents the first report of VAM&#8208;printed thiol&#8208;ene resins. With well&#8208;ordered molecular networks, thiol&#8208;ene chemistry accesses polymer materials with a wide range of mechanical properties, moving VAM beyond the limitations of commonly used acrylate formulations. Since free&#8208;radical thiol&#8208;ene polymerization is not inhibited by oxygen, the nonlinear threshold response required in VAM is introduced by incorporating 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1&#8208;piperidinyloxy (TEMPO) as a radical scavenger. Tuning of the reaction kinetics is accomplished by balancing inhibitor and initiator content. Coupling this with quantitative measurements of the absorbed volumetric optical dose allows control of polymer conversion and gelation during printing. Importantly, this work thereby establishes the first comprehensive framework for spatial&#8211;temporal control over volumetric energy distribution, demonstrating structures 3D printed in thiol&#8208;ene resin by means of tomographic volumetric VAM. Mechanical characterization of this thiol&#8208;ene system, with varied ratios of isocyanurate and triethylene glycol monomers, reveals highly tunable mechanical response far more versatile than identical acrylate&#8208;based resins. This broadens the range of materials and properties available for VAM, taking another step toward high&#8208;performance printed polymers.

      <title>Visualizing the Anomalous Charge Density Wave States in Graphene/NbSe2 Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Prominent suppression of the charge density wave (CDW) orders in graphene/NbSe2 heterostructures is observed by Raman spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The findings propose a new criterion to determine the TCDW through monitoring the line shape of the A1g mode. First&#8208;principles calculations imply that interfacial electron doping suppresses the CDW states by impeding the lattice distortion of 2H&#8208;NbSe2.








Abstract
Metallic layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) host collective many&#8208;body interactions, including the competing superconducting and charge density wave (CDW) states. Graphene is widely employed as a heteroepitaxial substrate for the growth of TMD layers and as an ohmic contact, where the graphene/TMD heterostructure is naturally formed. The presence of graphene can unpredictably influence the CDW order in 2D CDW conductors. This work reports the CDW transitions of 2H&#8208;NbSe2 layers in graphene/NbSe2 heterostructures. The evolution of Raman spectra demonstrates that the CDW phase transition temperatures (TCDW) of NbSe2 are dramatically decreased when capped by graphene. The induced anomalous short&#8208;range CDW state is confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. The findings propose a new criterion to determine the TCDW through monitoring the line shape of the A1g mode. Meanwhile, the 2D band is also discovered as an indicator to observe the CDW transitions. First&#8208;principles calculations imply that interfacial electron doping suppresses the CDW states by impeding the lattice distortion of 2H&#8208;NbSe2. The extraordinary random CDW lattice suggests deep insight into the formation mechanism of many collective electronic states and possesses great potential in modulating multifunctional devices.

      <dc:description>
The development of smart inks that change color and transparency in response to external stimuli is important in safety and anticounterfeiting.

     alt="Smart Inks: Imidazolium&#8208;Functionalized Diacetylene Amphiphiles: Strike a Lighter and Wear Polaroid Glasses to Decipher the Secret Code (Adv. Mater. 39/2020)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of smart inks that change color and transparency in response to external stimuli is important in safety and anticounterfeiting. In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2020039802003980&lt;/a&gt;, Kwang&#8208;Un Jeong and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that a secret code, written with thermoresponsive and polarization&#8208;dependent secret inks consisting of imidazolium&#8208;functionalized diacetylenes, can be deciphered by wearing polaroid glasses and the heat from torchlight.

      <dc:description>
In article number 2002652, Lumin Wang and co&#8208;workers report that a nanoscale hierarchical dual&#8208;phase structure forms in a nanocrystalline NiFeCoCrCu high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy film via an ion&#8208;irradiation&#8208;induced face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) to body&#8208;centeredcubic (bcc) phase transformation. The microstructure of the material is represented in the top and bottom TEM images: a five&#8208;component high&#8208;entropy alloy, before (top) and after (bottom) ion&#8208;beam irradiation. Atoms are displaced in the induced &#8220;displacement cascade&#8221; (as shown in the top image). The two crystal models (top and bottom) show the atomic arrangement (bcc or fcc) in the resultant dual&#8208;phase structure.

In nanofibers composed of self&#8208;assembling helical peptides, &#8220;capping&#8221; peptides can limit fiber growth and influence the character of immune responses raised by the materials. In article number 2003310, Joel H. Collier and co&#8208;workers design short peptides such that they self&#8208;assemble into immunologically active helical nanofibers.

      <title>IFlowPlate&#8212;A Customized 384&#8208;Well Plate for the Culture of Perfusable Vascularized Colon Organoids</title>
      <dc:description>
In recent years, there has been significant interest in organoid systems for biological modeling. However, organoids usually lack vascularization and are cultured under static conditions. In this work, a customized 384&#8208;well plate platform is developed, named IFlowPlate, which can be used to vascularize and perfuse organoids readily. This is the first system that has demonstrated organoid vascularization with intravascular perfusion.








Abstract
Despite the complexity and structural sophistication that 3D organoid models provide, their lack of vascularization and perfusion limit the capability of these models to recapitulate organ physiology effectively. A microfluidic platform named IFlowPlate is engineered, which can be used to culture up to 128 independently perfused and vascularized colon organoids in vitro. Unlike traditional microfluidic devices, the vascularized organoid&#8208;on&#8208;chip device with an &#8220;open&#8208;well&#8221; design does not require any external pumping systems and allows tissue extraction for downstream analyses, such as histochemistry or even in vivo transplantation. By optimizing both the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the culture media formulation, patient&#8208;derived colon organoids are co&#8208;cultured successfully within a self&#8208;assembled vascular network, and it is found that the colon organoids grow significantly better in the platform under constant perfusion versus conventional static condition. Furthermore, a colon inflammation model with an innate immune function where circulating monocytes can be recruited from the vasculature, differentiate into macrophage, and infiltrate the colon organoids in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#8208; inflammatory cytokine stimulation is developed using the platform. With the ability to grow vascularized colon organoids under intravascular perfusion, the IFlowPlate platform could unlock new possibilities for screening potential therapeutic targets or modeling relevant diseases.

&lt;p&gt;Despite the complexity and structural sophistication that 3D organoid models provide, their lack of vascularization and perfusion limit the capability of these models to recapitulate organ physiology effectively. A microfluidic platform named IFlowPlate is engineered, which can be used to culture up to 128 independently perfused and vascularized colon organoids in vitro. Unlike traditional microfluidic devices, the vascularized organoid&#8208;on&#8208;chip device with an &#8220;open&#8208;well&#8221; design does not require any external pumping systems and allows tissue extraction for downstream analyses, such as histochemistry or even in vivo transplantation. By optimizing both the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the culture media formulation, patient&#8208;derived colon organoids are co&#8208;cultured successfully within a self&#8208;assembled vascular network, and it is found that the colon organoids grow significantly better in the platform under constant perfusion versus conventional static condition. Furthermore, a colon inflammation model with an innate immune function where circulating monocytes can be recruited from the vasculature, differentiate into macrophage, and infiltrate the colon organoids in response to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)&#8208; inflammatory cytokine stimulation is developed using the platform. With the ability to grow vascularized colon organoids under intravascular perfusion, the IFlowPlate platform could unlock new possibilities for screening potential therapeutic targets or modeling relevant diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dopant&#8208;Driven Positive Reinforcement in Ex&#8208;Solution Process: New Strategy to Develop Highly Capable and Durable Catalytic Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
The in situ growth of Ir nanoparticles on a binary oxide as a new class in ex&#8208;solution phenomena is described. The Ir nanoparticles are uniformly anchored on WO3 host oxides and their formation mechanism is demonstrated by in situ analysis and simulations. The Ir&#8208;catalyst&#8208;loaded WO3 shows extremely high selectivity to H2S with outstanding stability.








Abstract
The ex&#8208;solution phenomenon, a central platform for growing metal nanoparticles on the surface of host oxides in real time with high durability and a fine distribution, has recently been applied to various scientific and industrial fields, such as catalysis, sensing, and renewable energy. However, the high&#8208;temperature processing required for ex&#8208;solutions (&gt;700&#160;&#176;C) limits the applicable material compositions and has hindered advances in this technique. Here, an unprecedented approach is reported for low&#8208;temperature particle ex&#8208;solution on important nanoscale binary oxides. WO3 with a nanosheet structure is selected as the parent oxide, and Ir serves as the active metal species that produces the ex&#8208;solved metallic particles. Importantly, Ir doping facilitates a phase transition in the WO3 bulk lattice, which further promotes Ir ex&#8208;solution at the oxide surface and eventually enables the formation of Ir particles (&lt;3&#160;nm) at temperatures as low as 300&#160;&#176;C. Low&#8208;temperature ex&#8208;solution effectively inhibits the agglomeration of WO3 sheets while maintaining well&#8208;dispersed ex&#8208;solved particles. Furthermore, the Ir&#8208;decorated WO3 sheets show excellent durability and H2S selectivity when used as sensing materials, suggesting that this is a generalizable synthetic strategy for preparing highly robust heterogeneous catalysts for a variety of applications.

      <title>Human&#8208;Recombinant&#8208;Elastin&#8208;Based Bioinks for 3D Bioprinting of Vascularized Soft Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>
New biocompatible and elastic bioinks based on recombinant human tropoelastin and gelatin for bioprinting of complex soft tissues is introduced. As proof of the concept, highly vascularized and functional 3D cardiac tissue constructs are bioprinted using a freeform reversible embedding of suspended hydrogels (FRESH) printing technique. The in vitro functionality and in vivo biocompatibility of the bioprinted structures are characterized.








Abstract
Bioprinting has emerged as an advanced method for fabricating complex 3D tissues. Despite the tremendous potential of 3D bioprinting, there are several drawbacks of current bioinks and printing methodologies that limit &#160;the ability to print elastic and highly vascularized tissues. In particular, fabrication of complex biomimetic structure that are entirely based on 3D bioprinting is still challenging primarily due to the lack of suitable bioinks with high printability, biocompatibility, biomimicry, and proper mechanical properties. To address these shortcomings, in this work the use of recombinant human tropoelastin as a highly biocompatible and elastic bioink for 3D printing of complex soft tissues is demonstrated. As proof of the concept, vascularized cardiac constructs are bioprinted and their functions are assessed in vitro and in vivo. The printed constructs demonstrate endothelium barrier function and spontaneous beating of cardiac muscle cells, which are important functions of cardiac tissue in vivo. Furthermore, the printed construct elicits minimal inflammatory responses, and is shown to be efficiently biodegraded in vivo when implanted subcutaneously in rats. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of the elastic bioink for printing 3D functional cardiac tissues, which can eventually be used for cardiac tissue replacement.

      <title>Realizing Few&#8208;Layer Iodinene for High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomically thin iodinene nanosheets are successfully fabricated by a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy. When explored as cathodes for Na+ ions batteries, they exhibit a high specific capacity and an extraordinary rate performance owing to their unique 2D ultrathin architecture with largely lower energy barrier and totally different ion&#8208;diffusion path versus the bulk counterpart.








Abstract
Elemental 2D materials with fascinating characteristics are regarded as an influential portion of the 2D family. Iodine is as a typical monoelemental molecular crystal and exhibits great prospects of applications. To realize 2D iodine, not only is it required to separate the weak interlayer van der Waals interactions, but also to reserve the weak intramolecular halogen bonds; thus, 2D iodine is still unexploited until now. Herein, atomically thin iodine nanosheets (termed &#8220;iodinene&#8221;) with the thickness around 1.0&#160;nm and lateral sizes up to hundreds of nanometers are successfully fabricated by a liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation strategy. When used for the cathode of rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the ultrathin iodinene exhibits superb rate properties with a high specific capacity of 109.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at the high rate of 10 A g&#8722;1 owing to its unique 2D ultrathin architecture with remarkably enhanced pseudocapacitive behavior. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the diffusion of sodium ions in few&#8208;layered iodinene changes from the original horizontal direction in bulk to the vertical with a small energy barrier of 0.07&#160;eV because of the size effect. The successful preparation and intensive structural investigation of iodinene paves the way for the development of novel iodine&#8208;based science and technologies.
