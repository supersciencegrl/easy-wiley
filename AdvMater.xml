      <title>Combining Qdot Nanotechnology and DNA Nanotechnology for Sensitive Single&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly multiplexed and high&#8208;sensitivity immunohistochemistry imaging is achieved by combining Qdot nanotechnology with DNA nanotechnology. The Qdots' unique optical properties and primer exchange reaction's programmability allow rapid, sensitive, and specific immunostaining in single cells.








Abstract
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can provide detailed information about protein expression within the cell microenvironment and is one of the most common techniques in biology and medicine due to the broad availability of highly specific antibodies and well&#8208;established bioconjugation methods for modification of these antibodies with chromogens and fluorophores. Despite recent advances in this field, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve high multiplexing, sensitivity, and throughput in single&#8208;cell profiling experiments. Here, the combination of two powerful technologies is reported, quantum dot and signal amplification by exchange reaction (QD&#8208;SABER), for sensitive and multiplexed imaging of endogenous proteins. Compared to the conventional IHC process using dye&#8208;labeled secondary antibodies (which already has a built&#8208;in signal amplification mechanism), QD&#8208;SABER provides an additional 7.6&#8208;fold signal amplification. In addition, the DNA hybridization&#8208;based IHC can be rapidly removed to regenerate the sample for subsequent cycles of immunostaining (&gt;10 cycles), greatly expanding the multiplexing capability.

      <title>Engineered Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticles Directly Present Tumor Antigens to Promote Anticancer Immunity</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer cells are genetically engineered to express a co&#8208;stimulatory marker that enables them to directly present their own antigens under an immunostimulatory context. Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles sourced from these modified cells elicit antitumor immunity in vivo while bypassing the need for traditional cell&#8208;mediated antigen presentation. This approach may ultimately enable the facile design of personalized artificial antigen presentation platforms.








Abstract
The recent success of immunotherapies has highlighted the power of leveraging the immune system in the fight against cancer. In order for most immune&#8208;based therapies to succeed, T cell subsets with the correct tumor&#8208;targeting specificities must be mobilized. When such specificities are lacking, providing the immune system with tumor antigen material for processing and presentation is a common strategy for stimulating antigen&#8208;specific T cell populations. While straightforward in principle, experience has shown that manipulation of the antigen presentation process can be incredibly complex, necessitating sophisticated strategies that are difficult to translate.

&lt;p&gt;Cancer cells are genetically engineered to express a co&#8208;stimulatory marker that enables them to directly present their own antigens under an immunostimulatory context. Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles sourced from these modified cells elicit antitumor immunity in vivo while bypassing the need for traditional cell&#8208;mediated antigen presentation. This approach may ultimately enable the facile design of personalized artificial antigen presentation platforms.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent success of immunotherapies has highlighted the power of leveraging the immune system in the fight against cancer. In order for most immune&#8208;based therapies to succeed, T cell subsets with the correct tumor&#8208;targeting specificities must be mobilized. When such specificities are lacking, providing the immune system with tumor antigen material for processing and presentation is a common strategy for stimulating antigen&#8208;specific T cell populations. While straightforward in principle, experience has shown that manipulation of the antigen presentation process can be incredibly complex, necessitating sophisticated strategies that are difficult to translate. Herein, the design of a biomimetic nanoparticle platform is reported that can be used to directly stimulate T cells without the need for professional antigen&#8208;presenting cells. The nanoparticles are fabricated using a cell membrane coating derived from cancer cells engineered to express a co&#8208;stimulatory marker. Combined with the peptide epitopes naturally presented on the membrane surface, the final formulation contains the necessary signals to promote tumor antigen&#8208;specific immune responses, priming T cells that can be used to control tumor growth. The reported approach represents an emerging strategy that can be used to develop multiantigenic, personalized cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coupling a Crystal Graph Multilayer Descriptor to Active Learning for Rapid Discovery of 2D Ferromagnetic Semiconductors/Half&#8208;Metals/Metals</title>
      <dc:description>
An adaptive framework with the combination of machine&#8208;learning (ML) techniques and high&#8208;throughput density functional theory calculations is designed to discover novel 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors, half&#8208;metals, and metals. Additionally, a new universal material descriptor is proposed for thermal, magnetic, and electronic properties of diverse 2D materials, with which ML models achieve high prediction accuracy over 90%.








Abstract
2D ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors/half&#8208;metals/metals are the key materials toward next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. However, such materials are still rather rare and the material search space is too large to explore exhaustively. Here, an adaptive framework to accelerate the discovery of 2D intrinsic FM materials is developed, by combining advanced machine&#8208;learning (ML) techniques with high&#8208;throughput density functional theory calculations. Successfully, about 90 intrinsic FM materials with desirable bandgap and excellent thermodynamic stability are screened out and a database containing 1459 2D magnetic materials is set up. To improve the performance of ML models on small&#8208;scale datasets like diverse 2D materials, a crystal graph multilayer descriptor using the elemental property is proposed, with which ML models achieve prediction accuracy over 90% on thermodynamic stability, magnetism, and bandgap. This study not only provides dozens of compelling FM candidates for future spintronics, but also paves a feasible route for ML&#8208;based rapid screening of diverse structures and/or complex properties.

      <title>Mesoporous PdAg Nanospheres for Stable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
      <dc:description>
Mesoporous PdAg nanospheres can enable electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with high activity, selectivity, and most remarkably excellent stability superior to most previous reports. The great performance is believed to arise from the strong electronic coupling between Pd and Ag upon alloying, which effectively alleviates the CO poisoning on surface.








Abstract
Palladium is a promising material for electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with high Faradaic efficiency near the equilibrium potential. It unfortunately suffers from problematic operation stability due to CO poisoning on surface. Here, it is demonstrated that alloying is an effective strategy to alleviate this problem. Mesoporous PdAg nanospheres with uniform size and composition are prepared from the co&#8208;reduction of palladium and silver precursors in aqueous solution using dioctadecyldimethylammonium chloride as the structure&#8208;directing agent. The best candidate can initiate CO2 reduction at zero overpotential and achieve high formate selectivity close to 100% and great stability even at &lt;&#8208;0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The high selectivity and stability are believed to result from the electronic coupling between Pd and Ag, which lowers the d&#8208;band center of Pd and thereby significantly enhances its CO tolerance, as evidenced by both electrochemical analysis and theoretical simulations.

      <title>Electro&#8208;Optic Upconversion in van der Waals Heterostructures via Nonequilibrium Photocarrier Tunneling</title>
      <dc:description>
Nonthermalized photocarrier energy is harnessed to achieve near&#8208;infrared to visible light upconversion in a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor van der Waals heterostructure tunnel diode consisting of few&#8208;layer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and monolayer tungsten disulfide.

Abstract
Ultrafast interlayer charge transfer is one of the most distinct features of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. Its dynamics competes with carrier thermalization such that the energy of nonthermalized photocarriers may be harnessed by band engineering. In this study, nonthermalized photocarrier energy is harnessed to achieve near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to visible light upconversion in a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (MIS) vdW heterostructure tunnel diode consisting of few&#8208;layer graphene (FLG), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2). Photoexcitation of the electrically biased heterostructure with 1.58 eV NIR laser in the linear absorption regime generates emission from the ground exciton state of WS2, which corresponds to upconversion by &#8776;370 meV. The upconversion is realized by electrically assisted interlayer transfer of nonthermalized photoexcited holes from FLG to WS2, followed by formation and radiative recombination of excitons in WS2. The photocarrier transfer rate can be described by Fowler&#8211;Nordheim tunneling mechanism and is electrically tunable by two orders of magnitude by tuning voltage bias applied to the device. This study highlights the prospects for realizing novel electro&#8208;optic upconversion devices by exploiting electrically tunable nonthermalized photocarrier relaxation dynamics in vdW heterostructures.

      <title>Gas Diffusion Strategy for Inserting Atomic Iron Sites into Graphitized Carbon Supports for Unusually High&#8208;Efficient CO2 Electroreduction and High&#8208;Performance Zn&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A universal gas diffusion strategy is developed for fabricating a series of single&#8208;atom catalysts with atomic Fe sites at trace amount supported by dimension&#8208;controlled graphitized carbons. Benefitting from highly catalytic active isolated Fe&#8208;N3 sites and graphitic N species, the optimized Fe1NC/S1&#8208;1000 exhibits superior CO2 electroreduction activity and outstanding Zn&#8211;CO2 battery performance.








Abstract
Emerging single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) hold great promise for CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER), but the design of highly active and cost&#8208;efficient SACs is still challenging. Herein, a gas diffusion strategy, along with one&#8208;step thermal activation, for fabricating N&#8208;doped porous carbon polyhedrons with trace isolated Fe atoms (Fe1NC) is developed. The optimized Fe1NC/S1&#8208;1000 with atomic Fe&#8208;N3 sites supported by N&#8208;doped graphitic carbons exhibits superior CO2ER performance with the CO Faradaic efficiency up to 96% at &#8722;0.5 V, turnover frequency of 2225 h&#8722;1, and outstanding stability, outperforming almost all previously reported SACs based on N&#8208;doped carbon supported nonprecious metals. The observed excellent CO2ER performance is attributed to the greatly enhanced accessibility and intrinsic activity of active centers due to the increased electrochemical surface area through size modulation and the redistribution of doped N species by thermal activation. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Fe&#8208;N3 sites possess balanced adsorption energies of *COOH and *CO intermediates, facilitating CO formation. A universal gas diffusion strategy is used to exclusively yield a series of dimension&#8208;controlled carbon&#8208;supported SACs with single Fe atoms while a rechargeable Zn&#8211;CO2 battery with Fe1NC/S1&#8208;1000 as cathode is developed to deliver a maximal power density of 0.6 mW cm&#8722;2.

      <title>Controllable Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Splitting of Graphene Quantum Dots through Oxidation: From Phosphorescence to TADF</title>
      <dc:description>
Oxidation control of graphene quantum dots can tune singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting, which induces a dramatic afterglow transition from phosphorescence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Matrix&#8208;assisted stabilization of triplet excited states provides ultralong lifetimes to such afterglow emissions. A new design approach for engineering singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting through facile molecular manipulation will enable the realization of smart multimodal afterglow materials.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lived afterglow emissions, such as room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), are beneficial in the fields of displays, bioimaging, and data security. However, it is challenging to realize a single material that simultaneously exhibits both RTP and TADF properties with their relative strengths varied in a controlled manner. Herein, a new design approach is reported to control singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting (&#8710;EST) in graphene quantum dots (GQD)/graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) by varying the ratio of oxygenated carbon to sp2 carbon (&#947;OC). It is demonstrated that &#8710;EST decreases from 0.365 to 0.123 eV as &#947;OC increases from 4.63% to 59.6%, which in turn induces a dramatic transition from RTP to TADF. Matrix&#8208;assisted stabilization of triplet excited states provides ultralong lifetimes to both RTP and TADF. Embedded in boron oxynitride, the low oxidized (4.63%) GQD exhibits an RTP lifetime (&#964;Tavg) of 783 ms, and the highly oxidized (59.6%) GOQD exhibits a TADF lifetime (&#964;DFavg) of 125 ms. Furthermore, the long&#8208;lived RTP and TADF materials enable the first demonstration of anticounterfeiting and multilevel information security using GQD. These results will open up a new approach to the engineering of singlet&#8211;triplet splitting in GQD for controlled realization of smart multimodal afterglow materials.

     alt="Controllable Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Splitting of Graphene Quantum Dots through Oxidation: From Phosphorescence to TADF"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidation control of graphene quantum dots can tune singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting, which induces a dramatic afterglow transition from phosphorescence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Matrix&#8208;assisted stabilization of triplet excited states provides ultralong lifetimes to such afterglow emissions. A new design approach for engineering singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting through facile molecular manipulation will enable the realization of smart multimodal afterglow materials.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long&#8208;lived afterglow emissions, such as room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), are beneficial in the fields of displays, bioimaging, and data security. However, it is challenging to realize a single material that simultaneously exhibits both RTP and TADF properties with their relative strengths varied in a controlled manner. Herein, a new design approach is reported to control singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting (&#8710;&lt;i&gt;E &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;) in graphene quantum dots (GQD)/graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) by varying the ratio of oxygenated carbon to sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; carbon (&#947;&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;). It is demonstrated that &#8710;&lt;i&gt;E &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; decreases from 0.365 to 0.123 eV as &#947;&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; increases from 4.63% to 59.6%, which in turn induces a dramatic transition from RTP to TADF. Matrix&#8208;assisted stabilization of triplet excited states provides ultralong lifetimes to both RTP and TADF. Embedded in boron oxynitride, the low oxidized (4.63%) GQD exhibits an RTP lifetime (&#964;&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;) of 783 ms, and the highly oxidized (59.6%) GOQD exhibits a TADF lifetime (&#964;&lt;sup&gt;DF&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;avg&lt;/sub&gt;) of 125 ms. Furthermore, the long&#8208;lived RTP and TADF materials enable the first demonstration of anticounterfeiting and multilevel information security using GQD. These results will open up a new approach to the engineering of singlet&#8211;triplet splitting in GQD for controlled realization of smart multimodal afterglow materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Plant Nanomaterials and Inspiration from Nature: Water Interactions and Hierarchically Structured Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired from nature, wood&#8208;based and man&#8208;made hydrogels are produced taking advantage of the properties and structure of elements present in the cell walls of plants, including (nano)celluloses. They endow new materials with features that include directionality, hierarchy, responsiveness, and function, all of which are associated to the composition and morphology of the building blocks.








Abstract
Recent developments in the area of plant&#8208;based hydrogels are introduced, especially those derived from wood as a widely available, multiscale, and hierarchical source of nanomaterials, as well as other cell wall elements. With water being fundamental in a hydrogel, water interactions, hydration, and swelling, all critically important in designing, processing, and achieving the desired properties of sustainable and functional hydrogels, are highlighted. A plant, by itself, is a form of a hydrogel, at least at given states of development, and for this reason phenomena such as fluid transport, diffusion, capillarity, and ionic effects are examined. These aspects are highly relevant not only to plants, especially lignified tissues, but also to the porous structures produced after removal of water (foams, sponges, cryogels, xerogels, and aerogels). Thus, a useful source of critical and comprehensive information is provided regarding the synthesis of hydrogels from plant materials (and especially wood nanostructures), and about the role of water, not only for processing but for developing hydrogel properties and uses.

      <title>Changes of Structure and Bonding with Thickness in Chalcogenide Thin Films</title>
      <dc:description>
A first&#8208;principles study of the structure, bonding, and ferroelectricity in quasi 2D monochalcogenides (GeSe, GeTe, SnSe, SnTe) is carried out. It is found that a few bilayers are sufficient to recover the bulk behavior in selenides, while the tellurides deviate strongly from the bulk, even for thick models. These differences stem from the effects of depolarizing fields and the different bonding mechanisms.








Abstract
Extreme miniaturization is known to be detrimental for certain properties, such as ferroelectricity in perovskite oxide films below a critical thickness. Remarkably, few&#8208;layer crystalline films of monochalcogenides display robust in&#8208;plane ferroelectricity with potential applications in nanoelectronics. These applications critically depend on the electronic properties and the nature of bonding in the 2D limit. A fundamental open question is thus to what extent bulk properties persist in thin films. Here, this question is addressed by a first&#8208;principles study of the structural, electronic, and ferroelectric properties of selected monochalcogenides (GeSe, GeTe, SnSe, and SnTe) as a function of film thickness up to 18 bilayers. While in selenides a few bilayers are sufficient to recover the bulk behavior, the Te&#8208;based compounds deviate strongly from the bulk, irrespective of the slab thickness. These results are explained in terms of depolarizing fields in Te&#8208;based slabs and the different nature of the chemical bond in selenides and tellurides. It is shown that GeTe and SnTe slabs inherit metavalent bonding of the bulk phase, despite structural and electronic properties being strongly modified in thin films. This understanding of the nature of bonding in few&#8208;layers structures offers a powerful tool to tune materials properties for applications in information technology.

      <title>Lipid&#8208;Bilayer&#8208;Supported 3D Printing of Human Cerebral Cortex Cells Reveals Developmental Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
The human cerebral cortex contains distinguishable cell arrangements that are important for brain function. The 3D droplet printing technique reported allows the assembly of human cortical neurons and glial cells into defined patterns in extracellular matrix. The engineered human cortical tissues are functional and able to recapitulate aspects of brain development.








Abstract
Current understanding of human brain development is rudimentary due to suboptimal in vitro and animal models. In particular, how initial cell positions impact subsequent human cortical development is unclear because experimental spatial control of cortical cell arrangement is technically challenging. 3D cell printing provides a rapid customized approach for patterning. However, it has relied on materials that do not represent the extracellular matrix (ECM) of brain tissue. Therefore, in the present work, a lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;supported printing technique is developed to 3D print human cortical cells in the soft, biocompatible ECM, Matrigel. Printed human neural stem cells (hNSCs) show high viability, neural differentiation, and the formation of functional, stimulus&#8208;responsive neural networks. By using prepatterned arrangements of neurons and astrocytes, it is found that hNSC process outgrowth and migration into cell&#8208;free matrix and into astrocyte&#8208;containing matrix are similar in extent. However, astrocytes enhance the later developmental event of axon bundling. Both young and mature neurons migrate into compartments containing astrocytes; in contrast, astrocytes do not migrate into neuronal domains signifying nonreciprocal chemorepulsion. Therefore, precise prepatterning by 3D printing allows the construction of natural and unnatural patterns that yield important insights into human cerebral cortex development.

      <title>Ligand Diffusion Enables Force&#8208;Independent Cell Adhesion via Activating &#945;5&#946;1 Integrin and Initiating Rac and RhoA Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>
Cell adhesion and stem cell fate specification exhibit unexpected behaviors in response to ligand diffusivity. Fast ligand diffusion enables cell adhesion independent of myosin&#8208;based force generation. An atypical pathway utilizing &#945;5&#946;1 integrin, RhoA, and Rac is detected to induce cell adhesion in such situations where &#945;v&#946;3 integrin&#8208;related mechanotransduction pathways are inactive.








Abstract
Cells reside in a dynamic microenvironment in which adhesive ligand availability, density, and diffusivity are key factors regulating cellular behavior. Here, the cellular response to integrin&#8208;binding ligand dynamics by directly controlling ligand diffusivity via tunable ligand&#8211;surface interactions is investigated. Interestingly, cell spread on the surfaces with fast ligand diffusion is independent of myosin&#8208;based force generation. Fast ligand diffusion enhances &#945;5&#946;1 but not &#945;v&#946;3 integrin activation and initiates Rac and RhoA but not ROCK signaling, resulting in lamellipodium&#8208;based fast cell spreading. Meanwhile, on surfaces with immobile ligands, &#945;v&#946;3 and &#945;5&#946;1 integrins synergistically initiate intracellular&#8208;force&#8208;based canonical mechanotransduction pathways to enhance cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. These results indicate the presence of heretofore&#8208;unrecognized pathways, distinct from canonical actomyosin&#8208;driven mechanisms, that are capable of promoting cell adhesion.

      <title>Biodegradable Laser Arrays Self&#8208;Assembled from Plant Resources</title>
      <dc:description>
The study demonstrates sustainable, switchable, and biodegradable laser devices self&#8208;assembled from cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as the resonator and dye&#8208;doped water&#8208;soluble polymers as the gain medium.








Abstract
The transition toward future sustainable societies largely depends on disruptive innovations in biobased materials to substitute nonsustainable advanced functional materials. In the field of optics, advanced devices (e.g., lasers or metamaterial devices) are typically manufactured using top&#8208;down engineering and synthetic materials. This work breaks with such concepts and switchable lasers self&#8208;assembled from plant&#8208;based cellulose nanocrystals and fluorescent polymers at room temperature and from water are shown. Controlled structure formation allows laser&#8208;grade cholesteric photonic bandgap materials, in which the photonic bandgap is matched to the fluorescence emission to function as an efficient resonator for low threshold multimode lasing. The lasers can be switched on and off using humidity, and can be printed into pixelated arrays. Additionally, the materials exhibit stiffness above typical thermoplastic polymers and biodegradability in soil. The concept showcases that highly advanced functions can be encoded into biobased materials, and opens the design space for future sustainable optical devices of unprecedented function.

This work breaks with such concepts and switchable lasers self&#8208;assembled from plant&#8208;based cellulose nanocrystals and fluorescent polymers at room temperature and from water are shown. Controlled structure formation allows laser&#8208;grade cholesteric photonic bandgap materials, in which the photonic bandgap is matched to the fluorescence emission to function as an efficient resonator for low threshold multimode lasing. The lasers can be switched on and off using humidity, and can be printed into pixelated arrays. Additionally, the materials exhibit stiffness above typical thermoplastic polymers and biodegradability in soil. The concept showcases that highly advanced functions can be encoded into biobased materials, and opens the design space for future sustainable optical devices of unprecedented function.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Piezocatalytic Tumor Therapy by Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered and BaTiO3&#8208;Mediated Piezoelectricity</title>
      <dc:description>
Piezocatalytic tumor therapy initiated by piezoelectric tetragonal BaTiO3 (T&#8208;BTO) nanoparticles confined by thermogel under ultrasound irradiation is demonstrated. Band alignment modulation resulting from piezopotential tilts the band to the energetically favorable side. Subsequently, electrons and holes are separated and piezocatalyze the &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; generation for tumor eradication.








Abstract
Ultrasound theranostics features non&#8208;invasiveness, minor energy attenuation, and high tissue&#8208;penetrating capability, and is playing ever&#8208;important roles in the diagnosis and therapy of diseases in clinics. Herein, ultrasound is employed as a microscopic pressure resource to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for piezocatalytic tumor therapy under catalytic mediation by piezoelectric tetragonal BaTiO3 (T&#8208;BTO). Under the ultrasonic vibration, the electrons and holes are unpaired and they are separated by the piezoelectricity, resulting in the establishment of a strong built&#8208;in electric field, which subsequently catalyzes the generation of ROS such as toxic hydroxyl (&#8226;OH) and superoxide radicals (&#8226;O2&#8722;) in situ for tumor eradication. This modality shows intriguing advantages over typical sonoluminescence&#8208;activated sonodynamic therapy, such as more stable sensitizers and dynamical control of redox reaction outcomes. Furthermore, according to the finite element modeling simulation, the built&#8208;in electric field is capable of modulating the band alignment to make the toxic ROS generation energetically favorable. Both detailed in vitro cellular level evaluation and in vivo tumor xenograft assessment have demonstrated that an injectable T&#8208;BTO&#8208;nanoparticles&#8208;embedded thermosensitive hydrogel will substantially induce ultrasound irradiation&#8208;triggered cytotoxicity and piezocatalytic tumor eradication, accompanied by high therapeutic biosafety in vivo.

      <dc:description>
Owing to their biocompatibility, renewability, and sustainability, cellulose nanomaterials are highly attractive supporting substrate materials in solar evaporators for sustainable desalination. The physiochemical properties of extracted cellulose nanoparticles and natural cellulose are discussed, and recent progress in utilizing cellulose&#8208;based materials such as wood, bacterial nanocellulose, cellulose nanofibrils, air&#8208;laid paper, cellulose paper, and cotton fabric in solar desalination is summarized.








Abstract
Herein, the recent advances in realizing highly efficient cellulose&#8208;based solar evaporators for alleviating the global water crisis are summarized. Fresh water scarcity is one of the most threatening issues for sustainable development. Solar steam generation, which harnesses the abundant sunlight, has been recognized as a sustainable approach to harvest fresh water. In contrast to synthetic polymeric materials that can pose serious negative environmental impacts, cellulose&#8208;based materials, owing to their biocompatibility, renewability, and sustainability, are highly attractive for realizing solar steam generators. The molecular and macromolecular features of cellulose and the physicochemical properties of extracted cellulose nanoparticles (cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF)) and natural cellulose materials (wood and bacterial nanocellulose (BNC)) that make them attractive as supporting substrate materials in solar steam generators are briefly discussed. Recent progress in designing highly efficient cellulose&#8208;based solar evaporators, including utilizing extracted cellulose nanoparticles via bottom&#8208;up assembly CNF, natural cellulose materials with intrinsic hierarchical structure (wood and BNC), and commercial planar cellulose substrates (air&#8208;laid paper, cellulose paper, and cotton fabric) is reviewed. The outstanding challenges that need to be addressed for these materials and devices to be utilized in the real&#8208;world and in overcoming global water crisis are also briefly highlighted.

      <title>Micro&#8208; and Nanopatterning of Halide Perovskites Where Crystal Engineering for Emerging Photoelectronics Meets Integrated Device Array Technology</title>
      <dc:description>
Micro&#8208; and nanopatterned halide perovskites (HPs) have recently attracted significant attention due to their controllable photophysical properties and unprecedented photoelectronic functionalities. A comprehensive overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art micro&#8208; and nanopatterning technologies based on top&#8208;down lithography and bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembled structures is provided. The technological use of structured HPs is also discussed.








Abstract
Tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing thin film halide perovskites (HPs) for use in high&#8208;performance photoelectronic devices, including solar cells, displays, and photodetectors. Furthermore, structured HPs with periodic micro&#8208; or nanopatterns have recently attracted significant interest due to their potential to not only improve the efficiency of an individual device via the controlled arrangement of HP crystals into a confined geometry, but also to technologically pixelate the device into arrays suitable for future commercialization. However, micro&#8208; or nanopatterning of HPs is not usually compatible with conventional photolithography, which is detrimental to ionic HPs and requires special techniques. Herein, a comprehensive overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies used to develop micro&#8208; and nanometer&#8208;scale HP patterns, with an emphasis on their controlled microstructures based on top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches, and their potential for future applications, is provided. Top&#8208;down approaches include modified conventional lithographic techniques and soft&#8208;lithographic methods, while bottom&#8208;up approaches include template&#8208;assisted patterning of HPs based on lithographically defined prepatterns and self&#8208;assembly. HP patterning is shown here to not only improve device performance, but also to reveal the unprecedented functionality of HPs, leading to new research areas that utilize their novel photophysical properties.

      <title>Near&#8208;Unity Polarization of Valley&#8208;Dependent Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Stacked TMDC Layers and Heterostructures at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
Enhanced SHG intensity with near&#8208;unity polarization from inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;broken 2D TMDC atomic layers, spiral structures, and heterostructures are realized at room temperature.

Abstract
With unique valley&#8208;dependent optical and optoelectronic properties, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) are promising materials for valleytronics. Second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) in 2D TMDCs monolayers has shown valley&#8208;dependent optical selection rules. However, SHG in monolayer TMDCs is generally weak; it is important to obtain materials with both strong SHG signals and a large degree of polarization. In the work, a variety of inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking (3R&#8208;like phase) TMDCs (WSe2, WS2, MoS2) atomic layers, spiral structures, and heterostructures are prepared, and their SHG polarization is studied. Through circular&#8208;polarization&#8208;resolved SHG experiments, it is demonstrated that the SHG intensity is enhanced in thicker samples by breaking inversion symmetry while maintaining the degree of polarization close to unity at room temperature. By studying TMDCs with different twist angles and the spiral structures, it is found that there is no significant effect of multilayer interlayer interaction on valley&#8208;dependent SHG. The realization of strong SHG with high degree of polarization may pave the way toward a new platform for nonlinear optical valleytronics devices based on 2D semiconductors.

      <title>Large Single&#8208;Crystal Cu Foils with High&#8208;Index Facets by Strain&#8208;Engineered Anomalous Grain Growth</title>
      <dc:description>
Large single&#8208;crystal Cu foils with high&#8208;index facets are successfully achieved by using strain&#8208;engineered anomalous grain growth, in which a graphite susceptor provides moderate strain on the Cu foil. The minimization of the strain energy leads to the formation of anomalous Cu grains with high&#8208;index facets, which is investigated by the theoretical calculations.








Abstract
The rich and complex arrangements of metal atoms in high&#8208;index metal facets afford appealing physical and chemical properties, which attracts extensive research interest in material science for the applications in catalysis and surface chemistry. However, it is still a challenge to prepare large&#8208;area high&#8208;index single crystals in a controllable and cost&#8208;efficient manner. Herein, entire commercially available decimeter&#8208;sized polycrystalline Cu foils are successfully transformed into single crystals with a series of high&#8208;index facets, relying on a strain&#8208;engineered anomalous grain growth technique. The introduction of a moderate thermal&#8208;contact stress upon the Cu foil during the annealing leads to the formation of high&#8208;index grains dominated by the thermal strain of the Cu foils, rather than the (111) surface driven by the surface energy. Besides, the designed static gradient of the temperature enables the as&#8208;formed high&#8208;index grain seed to expand throughout the entire Cu foil. The as&#8208;received high&#8208;index Cu foils can serve as the templates for producing high&#8208;index single&#8208;crystal Cu&#8208;based alloys. This work provides an appealing material basis for the epitaxial growth of 2D materials, and the applications that require the unique surface structures of high&#8208;index metal foils and their alloys.

However, it is still a challenge to prepare large&#8208;area high&#8208;index single crystals in a controllable and cost&#8208;efficient manner. Herein, entire commercially available decimeter&#8208;sized polycrystalline Cu foils are successfully transformed into single crystals with a series of high&#8208;index facets, relying on a strain&#8208;engineered anomalous grain growth technique. The introduction of a moderate thermal&#8208;contact stress upon the Cu foil during the annealing leads to the formation of high&#8208;index grains dominated by the thermal strain of the Cu foils, rather than the (111) surface driven by the surface energy. Besides, the designed static gradient of the temperature enables the as&#8208;formed high&#8208;index grain seed to expand throughout the entire Cu foil. The as&#8208;received high&#8208;index Cu foils can serve as the templates for producing high&#8208;index single&#8208;crystal Cu&#8208;based alloys. This work provides an appealing material basis for the epitaxial growth of 2D materials, and the applications that require the unique surface structures of high&#8208;index metal foils and their alloys.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Direct Conversion of Rice Husks to Nanostructured SiC/C for CO2 Photoreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step and template&#8208;free molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical method efficiently converts rice husks to SiC nanowires/C for enhanced CO2 photoreduction, which in theory bridges a closed&#8208;loop carbon cycle in the whole production&#8211;utilization of biomass. This nanostructured SiC nanowires/C composite shows much enhanced activity for CO2 photoreduction to CO without employing any cocatalyst or sacrificial agents.








Abstract
A one&#8208;step and template&#8208;free synthesis of a SiC nanowires/C (SiC&#8208;NW/C) composite from rice husks (RHs) is realized via a molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical method. The process integrates simultaneously carbonization, electrodeoxidation, nanostructuring, and self&#8208;purification for converting RHs to a SiC&#8208;NW/C hybrid that is assembled from SiC NWs embedded in porous N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon with strong coupling. The SiC&#8208;NW/C nanostructure enables efficient CO2 adsorption and fast separation and transfer of charge carriers. Benefiting from the structural and compositional merits, the SiC&#8208;NW/C composite shows superior activity for photoreduction of CO2 to CO, in the absence of any additional cocatalysts or sacrificial agents. The process proposed herein might help to bridge a closed&#8208;loop carbon cycle in the whole production&#8211;utilization of biomass.

      <title>Thermomechanical Nanocutting of 2D Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
A thermomechanical lithography technique for direct nanocutting of 2D materials is demonstrated. A heated scanning nanotip performs the cutting of the 2D material by thermomechanically cleaving the chemical bonds in concert with the rapid sublimation of the polymer layer underneath. A resolution of 20 nm is obtained in monolayer MoTe2, MoS2, and MoSe2.








Abstract
Atomically thin materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, are promising candidates for future applications in micro/nanodevices and systems. For most applications, functional nanostructures have to be patterned by lithography. Developing lithography techniques for 2D materials is essential for system integration and wafer&#8208;scale manufacturing. Here, a thermomechanical indentation technique is demonstrated, which allows for the direct cutting of 2D materials using a heated scanning nanotip. Arbitrarily shaped cuts with a resolution of 20 nm are obtained in monolayer 2D materials, i.e., molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), by thermomechanically cleaving the chemical bonds and by rapid sublimation of the polymer layer underneath the 2D material layer. Several micro/nanoribbon structures are fabricated and electrically characterized to demonstrate the process for device fabrication. The proposed direct nanocutting technique allows for precisely tailoring nanostructures of 2D materials with foreseen applications in the fabrication of electronic and photonic nanodevices.

      <title>Boosting Catalysis of Pd Nanoparticles in MOFs by Pore Wall Engineering: The Roles of Electron Transfer and Adsorption Energy</title>
      <dc:description>
Pd nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated into UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X = H, OMe, NH2, 2OH, 2OH(Hf)) show drastically different activities toward the hydrogenation of benzoic acid. This work highlights the influence of the surface microenvironment of guest metal NPs, the catalytic activity of which is dominated by electron transfer and the adsorption energy, via the systematic modification of host metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs).








Abstract
The chemical environment of metal nanoparticles (NPs) possesses significant influence on their catalytic performance yet is far from being well understood. Herein, tiny Pd NPs are encapsulated into the pore space of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X = H, OMe, NH2, 2OH, 2OH(Hf)), affording Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X composites. The surface microenvironment of the Pd NPs is readily modulated by pore wall engineering, via the functional group and metal substitution in the MOFs. Consequently, the catalytic activity of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X follows the order of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH &gt; Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;2OH(Hf) &gt; Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 &gt; Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OMe &gt; Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H toward the hydrogenation of benzoic acid. It is found that the activity difference is not only ascribed to the distinct charge transfer between Pd and the MOF, but is also explained by the discriminated substrate adsorption energy of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (&#8211;OH &lt; &#8211;2OH(Hf) &lt; &#8211;NH2 &lt; &#8211;OMe &lt; &#8211;H), based on CO&#8208;diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH, featuring a high Pd electronic state and moderate adsorption energy, displays the highest activity. This work highlights the influence of the surface microenvironment of guest metal NPs, the catalytic activity of which is dominated by electron transfer and the adsorption energy, via the systematic substitution of metal and functional groups in host MOFs.

Abstract
Intensive research on chiral liquid crystals (LCs) has been fueled by their actively tunable physicochemical properties and structural complexity, comparable to those of sophisticated natural materials. Herein, recent progress in the discovery of new classes of chiral LCs, enabled by a combination of nano&#8208; and macroscale investigations is reviewed.

Then, recent progress in the discovery of new classes of chiral LCs, particularly enabled by the application of resonant X&#8208;ray scattering is described. It is shown that the method is sensitive to modulations of molecular orientation and therefore provides information hardly accessible by means of other techniques, such as the sense of helical structures or chirality transfer across length scales. Finally, a perspective is presented on the future scope, opportunities, and challenges in the field of chiral LCs, in particular related to nanocomposites.

      <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Quantum Dot Hybrid Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells with Near&#8208;Zero Driving Force</title>
      <dc:description>
CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) hybrid nonfullerene organic solar cells are fabricated. The devices based on a PTB7&#8208;Th:FOIC blend with PQDs yield higher efficiency of 13.2% even at near&#8208;zero driving force than that without PQDs (11.6%). Incorporation of PQDs also leads to efficiency enhancement from 15.4% to 16.6% for a PM6:Y6 blend.








Abstract
To take advantages of the intense absorption and fluorescence, high charge mobility, and high dielectric constant of CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), PQD hybrid nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) are fabricated. Addition of PQDs leads to simultaneous enhancement of open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF); power conversion efficiencies are boosted from 11.6% to 13.2% for PTB7&#8208;Th:FOIC blend and from 15.4% to 16.6% for PM6:Y6 blend. Incorporation of PQDs dramatically increases the energy of the charge transfer state, resulting in near&#8208;zero driving force and improved VOC. Interestingly, at near&#8208;zero driving force, the PQD hybrid OSCs show more efficient charge generation than the control device without PQDs, contributing to enhanced JSC, due to the formation of cascade band structure and increased molecular ordering. The strong fluorescence of the PQDs enhances the external quantum efficiency of the electroluminescence of the active layer, which can reduce nonradiative recombination voltage loss. The high dielectric constant of the PQDs screens the Coulombic interactions and reduces charge recombination, which is beneficial for increased FF. This work may open up wide applicability of perovskite quantum dots and an avenue toward high&#8208;performance nonfullerene solar cells.

&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;), and fill factor (FF); power conversion efficiencies are boosted from 11.6% to 13.2% for PTB7&#8208;Th:FOIC blend and from 15.4% to 16.6% for PM6:Y6 blend. Incorporation of PQDs dramatically increases the energy of the charge transfer state, resulting in near&#8208;zero driving force and improved &lt;i&gt;V &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;. Interestingly, at near&#8208;zero driving force, the PQD hybrid OSCs show more efficient charge generation than the control device without PQDs, contributing to enhanced &lt;i&gt;J &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;, due to the formation of cascade band structure and increased molecular ordering. The strong fluorescence of the PQDs enhances the external quantum efficiency of the electroluminescence of the active layer, which can reduce nonradiative recombination voltage loss. The high dielectric constant of the PQDs screens the Coulombic interactions and reduces charge recombination, which is beneficial for increased FF. This work may open up wide applicability of perovskite quantum dots and an avenue toward high&#8208;performance nonfullerene solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Synthesis of Ionic Ultramicroporous Polymers for Selective Separation of Acetylene from Ethylene</title>
      <dc:description>
Ionic ultramicroporous polymers featuring high&#8208;density inorganic anions and narrowly distributed ultramicroporosity are reported and used for highly selective separation of acetylene from ethylene. A covalent and ionic dual&#8208;crosslinking strategy is proposed to engineer the ultramicroporosity and functionality of amorphous polymers. Record&#8208;high selectivity (286.1&#8211;474.4) for acetylene over ethylene is realized, along with excellent thermal and water stability.








Abstract
The design of highly stable and efficient porous materials is essential for developing breakthrough hydrocarbon separation methods based on physisorption to replace currently used energy&#8208;intensive distillation/absorption technologies. Efforts to develop advanced porous materials such as zeolites, coordination frameworks, and organic polymers have met with limited success. Here, a new class of ionic ultramicroporous polymers (IUPs) with high&#8208;density inorganic anions and narrowly distributed ultramicroporosity is reported, which are synthesized by a facile free&#8208;radical polymerization using branched and amphiphilic ionic compounds as reactive monomers. A covalent and ionic dual&#8208;crosslinking strategy is proposed to manipulate the pore structure of amorphous polymers at the ultramicroporous scale. The IUPs exhibit exceptional selectivity (286.1&#8211;474.4) for separating acetylene from ethylene along with high thermal and water stability, collaboratively demonstrated by gas adsorption isotherms and experimental breakthrough curves. Modeling studies unveil the specific binding sites for acetylene capture as well as the interconnected ultramicroporosity for size sieving. The porosity&#8208;engineering protocol used in this work can also be extended to the design of other ultramicroporous materials for the challenging separation of other key gas constituents.

      <title>Observation of Electrically Tunable van Hove Singularities in Twisted Bilayer Graphene from NanoARPES</title>
      <dc:description>
An electrostatically gated van der Waals heterostructure composed of twisted bilayer graphene is investigated using nanoscale angle&#8208;resolved photoemission during device operation. The dispersion of the superlattice bands and the energy of the associated van Hove singularities are tuned by varying the charge carrier density in the two twisted graphene layers using the back&#8208;gate voltage.








Abstract
The possibility of triggering correlated phenomena by placing a singularity of the density of states near the Fermi energy remains an intriguing avenue toward engineering the properties of quantum materials. Twisted bilayer graphene is a key material in this regard because the superlattice produced by the rotated graphene layers introduces a van Hove singularity and flat bands near the Fermi energy that cause the emergence of numerous correlated phases, including superconductivity. Direct demonstration of electrostatic control of the superlattice bands over a wide energy range has, so far, been critically missing. This work examines the effect of electrical doping on the electronic band structure of twisted bilayer graphene using a back&#8208;gated device architecture for angle&#8208;resolved photoemission measurements with a nano&#8208;focused light spot. A twist angle of 12.2&#176; is selected such that the superlattice Brillouin zone is sufficiently large to enable identification of van Hove singularities and flat band segments in momentum space. The doping dependence of these features is extracted over an energy range of 0.4 eV, expanding the combinations of twist angle and doping where they can be placed at the Fermi energy and thereby induce new correlated electronic phases in twisted bilayer graphene.

      <title>Epitaxially Strained CeO2/Mn3O4 Nanocrystals as an Enhanced Antioxidant for Radioprotection</title>
      <dc:description>
Inducing surface strains of CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals produces highly catalytic antioxidants that is powerful enough to protect intestinal stem cells from irradiation&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species damage. Only a small dose of the CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals prevents acute radiation syndrome in a human intestinal organoid model and increased survival rate of mice treated with a lethal dose of total body irradiation.








Abstract
Nanomaterials with antioxidant properties are promising for treating reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related diseases. However, maintaining efficacy at low doses to minimize toxicity is a critical for clinical applications. Tuning the surface strain of metallic nanoparticles can enhance catalytic reactivity, which has rarely been demonstrated in metal oxide nanomaterials. Here, it is shown that inducing surface strains of CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals produces highly catalytic antioxidants that can protect tissue&#8208;resident stem cells from irradiation&#8208;induced ROS damage. Manganese ions deposited on the surface of cerium oxide (CeO2) nanocrystals form strained layers of manganese oxide (Mn3O4) islands, increasing the number of oxygen vacancies. CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals show better catalytic activity than CeO2 or Mn3O4 alone and can protect the regenerative capabilities of intestinal stem cells in an organoid model after a lethal dose of irradiation. A small amount of the nanocrystals prevents acute radiation syndrome and increases the survival rate of mice treated with a lethal dose of total body irradiation.

      <dc:description>
In article number 1908007, Jia Ding, Cheng Zhong, David Mitlin, and co&#8208;workers review emerging potassium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Like the mountains, potassium&#8208;metal batteries are an exciting new challenge, waiting to be explored. Potassium&#8208;metal anodes are extremely susceptible to dendrite growth, giving relevance to the jagged alpine topography. This drawing also explores the topical theme of spiritual connectedness at a time of physical solitude. It may be achievable through hiking alone or through writing reviews with friends.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2019080071908007&lt;/a&gt;, Jia Ding, Cheng Zhong, David Mitlin, and co&#8208;workers review emerging potassium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Like the mountains, potassium&#8208;metal batteries are an exciting new challenge, waiting to be explored. Potassium&#8208;metal anodes are extremely susceptible to dendrite growth, giving relevance to the jagged alpine topography. This drawing also explores the topical theme of spiritual connectedness at a time of physical solitude. It may be achievable through hiking alone or through writing reviews with friends.

      <title>Photodetectors: Graphdiyne&#8208;Based Flexible Photodetectors with High Responsivity and Detectivity (Adv. Mater. 23/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
A flexible photodetector based on ultrathin graphdiyne nanosheets is constructed and applied in a three&#8208;electrode photoelectrochemical (PEC)&#8208;type system to study its photoresponse behaviors. As described by Xiuwen Zhang, Jialiang Xu, Han Zhang, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001082, the prepared PDs show excellent photoresponse after bending or twisting for 1000 cycles. Moreover, the PDs exhibit pronounced long&#8208;term stability after being kept in an alkaline electrolyte for more than 1 month.

      <title>Flat Lenses Based on 2D Perovskite Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Flat lenses based on 2D perovskite nanosheets with a subwavelength focusing capability (&#8776;0.5&#955;) are reported, which are fabricated by using a cost&#8208;effective mask&#8208;free femtosecond direct laser writing system. Halide elemental substitution could further reveal potential tunable focus capability (0.5&#8211;0.9&#955;).








Abstract
Ultrathin flat lenses based on metasurfaces or metamaterials have shown great promise in recent years as essential components in nano&#8208;optical system, with capability of abrupt changes of light wavefronts. However, such structural designs require complex nanopatterns and a time&#8208;consuming nanofabrication process. In this regard, flat lenses are developed based on 2D perovskite nanosheets, using a cost&#8208;effective mask&#8208;free femtosecond direct laser writing system. The optical properties of the 2D perovskite are rationally adjusted through facile composition engineering as well as thickness&#8208;dependent quantum&#8208;size confinement. A diffraction theory model is derived to understand the focusing mechanism of the 2D perovskite nanosheets flat lenses. The as&#8208;fabricated lenses exploit the tunable material property variations to effectively manipulate not only the amplitude but also the phase of the incident light to focus into a 3D focal spot with a sub&#8208;wavelength resolution in the range of 0.5&#8211;0.9&#955;. The results pave the way toward low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale high&#8208;resolution imaging applications in the future.

      <title>External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 24% with CIEy Value of 0.08 using a Novel Carbene&#8208;Based Iridium Complex in Deep&#8208;Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A high external quantum efficiency for deep&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes is developed using a novel carbene&#8208;based Ir(III) complex, which enhances the carrier balance in the emission layer. A high quantum efficiency of 24% with a deep&#8208;blue CIE(x, y) coordinate of (0.149, 0.085) is achieved, which satisfies the stringent National Television System Committee (NTSC) requirements with high efficiency.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;blue triplet emitters remain far inferior to standard red and green triplet emitters in terms of exhibiting high&#8208;color&#8208;purity Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) y values of &#8804;0.1, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs), and high electroluminescent brightnesses in phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. In fact, no deep&#8208;blue triplet emitter with color purity and high device performance has previously been reported. In this study, a deep&#8208;blue triplet emitter, mer&#8208;tris(N&#8208;phenyl, N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;pyridoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)iridium(III) (mer&#8208;Ir1) is developed, which meets the requirements of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) CIE(x, y) coordinates of (0.149, 0.085) with an extremely high EQE of 24.8% and maximum brightness (Lmax) of 6453 cd m&#8722;2, by a device with a 40 vol% doping ratio. Moreover, another device demonstrates an EQEmax of 21.3%, an Lmax of 5247 cd m&#8722;2, and CIE(x, y) coordinates of (0.151, 0.086) at a 30 vol% doping ratio. This is the first report of a high&#8208;performance, deep&#8208;blue phosphor, carbene&#8208;based Ir(III) complex device with outstanding CIE(x, y) color coordinates and a high EQE. The results of this study indicate that the novel dopant mer&#8208;Ir1 is a promising candidate for reducing power consumption in display applications.

      <title>Biradical&#8208;Featured Stable Organic&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Photothermal Materials for Highly Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Water Evaporation</title>
      <dc:description>
A stable croconium derivative, &#8220;CR&#8208;TPE&#8208;T&#8221;, is designed to exhibit the unique biradical property and strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the solid state, which facilitate not only broad absorption spectrum from 300 to 1600 nm for effective sunlight harvesting, but also highly efficient photothermal conversion by boosting nonradiative decay, enabling a high solar&#8208;energy&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 87.2% under one sun irradiation.








Abstract
With recent progress in photothermal materials, organic small molecules featured with flexibility, diverse structures, and tunable properties exhibit unique advantages but have been rarely applied in solar&#8208;driven water evaporation owing to limited sunlight absorption resulting in low solar&#8211;thermal conversion. Herein, a stable croconium derivative, named CR&#8208;TPE&#8208;T, is designed to exhibit the unique biradical property and strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the solid state, which facilitate not only a broad absorption spectrum from 300 to 1600 nm for effective sunlight harvesting, but also highly efficient photothermal conversion by boosting nonradiative decay. The photothermal efficiency is evaluated to be 72.7% under 808 nm laser irradiation. Based on this, an interfacial&#8208;heating evaporation system based on CR&#8208;TPE&#8208;T is established successfully, using which a high solar&#8208;energy&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 87.2% and water evaporation rate of 1.272 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1 sun irradiation are obtained, thus making an important step toward the application of organic&#8208;small&#8208;molecule photothermal materials in solar energy utilization.

      <title>Photonic Multishells Composed of Cholesteric Liquid Crystals Designed by Controlled Phase Separation in Emulsion Drops</title>
      <dc:description>
Photonic multishells are created by controlled phase separation of cholesteric liquid crystals and hydrophilic liquid confined in emulsion drops. The material exchange between the dispersed and continuous phases triggers the consecutive steps of phase separation, through which onion&#8208;like drops are formed. Multiple photonic stopbands are spontaneously developed by uneven partitioning of the chiral dopant, which provides advanced photonic functionality.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), also known as chiral nematic LCs, show a photonic stopband, which is promising for various optical applications. In particular, CLCs confined in microcompartments are useful for sensing, lasing, and optical barcoding at the microscale. The integration of distinct CLCs into single microstructures can provide advanced functionality. In this work, CLC multishells with multiple stopbands are created by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) in a simple yet highly controlled manner. A homogeneous ternary mixture of LC, hydrophilic liquid, and co&#8208;solvent is microfluidically emulsified to form uniform oil&#8208;in&#8208;water drops, which undergo LLPS to form onion&#8208;like drops composed of alternating CLC&#8208;rich and CLC&#8208;depleted layers. The multiplicity is controlled from one to five by adjusting the initial composition of the ternary mixture, which dictates the number of consecutive steps of LLPS. Interestingly, the concentration of the chiral dopant becomes reduced from the outermost to the innermost CLC drop due to uneven partitioning during LLPS, which results in multiple stopbands. Therefore, the photonic multishells show multiple structural colors. In addition, dye&#8208;doped multishells provide band&#8208;edge lasing at two different wavelengths. This new class of photonic multishells will provide new opportunities for advanced optical applications.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by n&#8208;Type Polymers with an Ultranarrow Bandgap Down to 1.28 eV</title>
      <dc:description>
n&#8208;Type polymer semiconductors with a broad absorption and ultranarrow bandgap down to 1.28 eV are synthesized. When applied as electron acceptor materials, a power conversion efficiency of over 10% with a photoresponse reaching 950 nm is realized for all&#8208;polymer solar cells.








Abstract
Compared to organic solar cells based on narrow&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene small&#8208;molecule acceptors, the performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) lags much behind due to the lack of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers, which should have low&#8208;aligned frontier molecular orbital levels and narrow bandgap with broad and intense absorption extended to the near&#8208;infrared region. Herein, two novel polymer acceptors, DCNBT&#8208;TPC and DCNBT&#8208;TPIC, are synthesized with ultranarrow bandgaps (ultra&#8208;NBG) of 1.38 and 1.28 eV, respectively. When applied in transistors, both polymers show efficient charge transport with a highest electron mobility of 1.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 obtained for DCNBT&#8208;TPC. Blended with a polymer donor, PBDTTT&#8208;E&#8208;T, the resultant all&#8208;PSCs based on DCNBT&#8208;TPC and DCNBT&#8208;TPIC achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 9.26% and 10.22% with short&#8208;circuit currents up to 19.44 and 22.52 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. This is the first example that a PCE of over 10% can be achieved using ultra&#8208;NBG polymer acceptors with a photoresponse reaching 950 nm in all&#8208;PSCs. These results demonstrate that ultra&#8208;NBG polymer acceptors, in line with nonfullerene small&#8208;molecule acceptors, are also available as a highly promising class of electron acceptors for maximizing device performance in all&#8208;PSCs.

      <dc:description>
The strain&#8208;engineered anisotropic optical and electrical properties in solution&#8208;grown, sub&#8208;millimeter&#8208;size 2D Te are systematically investigated through designing and introducing a controlled buckled geometry in its intriguing chiral&#8208;chain lattice.

Abstract
Atomically thin materials, leveraging their low&#8208;dimensional geometries and superior mechanical properties, are amenable to exquisite strain manipulation with a broad tunability inaccessible to bulk or thin&#8208;film materials. Such capability offers unexplored possibilities for probing intriguing physics and materials science in the 2D limit as well as enabling unprecedented device applications. Here, the strain&#8208;engineered anisotropic optical and electrical properties in solution&#8208;grown, sub&#8208;millimeter&#8208;size 2D Te are systematically investigated through designing and introducing a controlled buckled geometry in its intriguing chiral&#8208;chain lattice. The observed Raman spectra reveal anisotropic lattice vibrations under the corresponding straining conditions. The feasibility of using buckled 2D Te for ultrastretchable strain sensors with a high gauge factor (&#8776;380) is further explored. 2D Te is an emerging material boasting attractive characteristics for electronics, sensors, quantum devices, and optoelectronics.

      <title>Deep&#8208;Learning&#8208;Enabled Fast Optical Identification and Characterization of 2D Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Microscopy data of nanomaterials often contains rich yet complicated information that reflects the material properties, but is mostly overlooked by researchers. Deep learning is an ideal approach to finding these highly correlated and non&#8208;linear features. As a case study, a neural network model called &#8220;2DMOINet&#8221; is trained for optical identification and characterization of exfoliated 2D materials.








Abstract
Advanced microscopy and/or spectroscopy tools play indispensable roles in nanoscience and nanotechnology research, as they provide rich information about material processes and properties. However, the interpretation of imaging data heavily relies on the &#8220;intuition&#8221; of experienced researchers. As a result, many of the deep graphical features obtained through these tools are often unused because of difficulties in processing the data and finding the correlations. Such challenges can be well addressed by deep learning. In this work, the optical characterization of 2D materials is used as a case study, and a neural&#8208;network&#8208;based algorithm is demonstrated for the material and thickness identification of 2D materials with high prediction accuracy and real&#8208;time processing capability. Further analysis shows that the trained network can extract deep graphical features such as contrast, color, edges, shapes, flake sizes, and their distributions, based on which an ensemble approach is developed to predict the most relevant physical properties of 2D materials. Finally, a transfer learning technique is applied to adapt the pretrained network to other optical identification applications. This artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;based material characterization approach is a powerful tool that would speed up the preparation, initial characterization of 2D materials and other nanomaterials, and potentially accelerate new material discoveries.

This artificial&#8208;intelligence&#8208;based material characterization approach is a powerful tool that would speed up the preparation, initial characterization of 2D materials and other nanomaterials, and potentially accelerate new material discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thermal Management by Engineering the Alignment of Nanocellulose</title>
      <dc:description>
A summary of how nanocellulose can be used to fabricate bioinspired building materials, including thermally super&#8208;insulating transparent and translucent aerogels and designable photonic reflectors, like the ones found in cuticles of beetles, is presented. These materials promise a boost of the energy efficiency of building envelopes, especially windows, so that no or very little supplemental energy would be needed to provide year&#8208;round occupant comfort.








Abstract
One of the grand current research challenges is to improve the energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings, which cumulatively consume more than 40% of the energy generated globally. In addition to improving the comfort of the inhabitants and mitigating the growing energy consumption problem, new building materials and technologies could provide a safe strategy for geoengineering to mitigate global climate change. Herein, recent progress in developing such advanced materials from nanocellulose, which is often derived from wood or even dirty feedstocks like waste, is reviewed. By using chemical and bacteria&#8208;enabled processing, nanocellulose can be used to fabricate broadband photonic reflectors, thermally super&#8208;insulating aerogels, solar gain regulators, and low&#8208;emissivity coatings, with potential applications in windows, roofs, walls, and other components of buildings envelopes. These material developments draw inspiration from advanced energy management found in nature, such as the nanoporous photonic structures that evolved in cuticles of beetles. Fabrication of such materials takes advantage of mesoscale liquid crystalline self&#8208;assembly, which allows for pre&#8208;designed control of cellulose nanoparticle orientations at the mesoscale. With the potential fully realized, such materials could one day transform the current energy&#8208;lossy buildings into energy plants on Earth and possibly even enable extraterrestrial habitats.

      <title>Ferroelectric Exchange Bias Affects Interfacial Electronic States</title>
      <dc:description>
A 2D superconductor is formed at the interface between a ferroelectric insulator and a polar oxide. Transport properties at low temperatures are anomalous and hysteretic as a function of external electrostatic gating. Imaging of the spatial distribution of the current flow is combined to show that an intrinsic electrostatic bias (analogous to the magnetic exchange bias) explains the observations.








Abstract
In polar oxide interfaces phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, 1D conductivity, and quantum Hall states can emerge at the polar discontinuity. Combining controllable ferroelectricity at such interfaces can affect the superconducting properties and sheds light on the mutual effects between the polar oxide and the ferroelectric oxide. Here, the interface between the polar oxide LaAlO3 and the ferroelectric Ca&#8208;doped SrTiO3 is studied by means of electrical transport combined with local imaging of the current flow with the use of scanning a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Anomalous behavior of the interface resistivity is observed at low temperatures. The scanning SQUID maps of the current flow suggest that this behavior originates from an intrinsic bias induced by the polar LaAlO3 layer. Such intrinsic bias combined with ferroelectricity can constrain the possible structural domain tiling near the interface. The use of this intrinsic bias is recommended as a method of controlling and tuning the initial state of ferroelectric materials by the design of the polar structure. The hysteretic dependence of the normal and the superconducting state properties on gate voltage can be utilized in multifaceted controllable memory devices.

      <title>Spider&#8208;Web&#8208;Inspired PM0.3 Filters Based on Self&#8208;Sustained Electrostatic Nanostructured Networks</title>
      <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;web&#8208;inspired network generator (SWING)&#8208;based air filter constructed from 2D electrostatic nanostructured networks is created by a unique electrospraying&#8211;netting technique. Due to the self&#8208;sustained electrostatic adhesion driven by aeolian vibration and Steiner&#8208;tree&#8208;structured pores (size 200&#8211;300 nm) consisting of nanowires (diameter 12 nm), the SWING filters achieve &gt;99.995% PM0.3 removal, &lt;0.09% atmosphere pressure, &gt;82% transmittance, and remarkable bioprotective activity.








Abstract
Particulate matter (PM) pollution has become a serious public health issue, especially with outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases. However, most present filters are bulky, opaque, and show low&#8208;efficiency PM0.3/pathogen interception and inevitable trade&#8208;off between PM removal and air permeability. Here, a unique electrospraying&#8211;netting technique is used to create spider&#8208;web&#8208;inspired network generator (SWING) air filters. Manipulation of the dynamic of the Taylor cone and phase separation of its ejected droplets enable the generation of 2D self&#8208;charging nanostructured networks on a large scale. The resultant SWING filters show exceptional long&#8208;range electrostatic property driven by aeolian vibration, enabling self&#8208;sustained PM adhesion. Combined with their Steiner&#8208;tree&#8208;structured pores (size 200&#8211;300 nm) consisting of nanowires (diameter 12 nm), the SWING filters exhibit high efficiency (&gt;99.995% PM0.3 removal), low air resistance (&lt;0.09% atmosphere pressure), high transparency (&gt;82%), and remarkable bioprotective activity for biohazard pathogens. This work may shed light on designing new fibrous materials for environmental and energy applications.

Additive manufacturing has revolutionized the building of materials, and 3D&#8208;printing has become a useful tool for complex electrode assembly for batteries and supercapacitors.

      <title>Wettability&#8208;Guided Screen Printing of Perovskite Microlaser Arrays for Current&#8208;Driven Displays</title>
      <dc:description>
Large&#8208;scale multicolor perovskite microlaser arrays with controllable physical dimensions and spatial locations are rapidly constructed with a universal and robust strategy, which is subsequently utilized to develop high&#8208;performance display panels. The results provide new opportunities to explore the concepts and device architectures of flat&#8208;panel laser display technology.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have shown tremendous potential for next&#8208;generation flat&#8208;panel laser displays due to their remarkable optoelectronic properties and outstanding material processability; however, the lack of a general approach for the fast growth of perovskite laser arrays capable of electrical operations impedes actualization of their display applications. Herein, a universal and robust wettability&#8208;guided screen&#8208;printing technique is reported for the rapid growth of large&#8208;scale multicolor perovskite microdisk laser arrays, which can serve as laser display panels and further be used to realize current&#8208;driven displays. The perovskite microlasers are precisely defined with controlled physical dimensions and spatial locations by such a printing strategy, and each perovskite microlaser serves as a pixel of a display panel. Moreover, the screen&#8208;printing procedure is highly compatible with light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) device architectures, which is favorable for the mass production of micro&#8208;LED arrays. On this basis, a prototype of a current&#8208;driven display is demonstrated with desired functionalities. The outstanding performance and feasible fabrication of screen&#8208;printed perovskite microlaser arrays embedded in LEDs provide deep insights into the concepts and device architectures of electrically driven laser display technology.

The electrochemical synthesis of these 2D graphitic films is accomplished at room temperature (with only a small energy input, an onset voltage of 0.45 V) and they self&#8208;exfoliate from the nonpolar surface of the liquid metal by applying higher voltages.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature synthesis of 2D graphitic materials (2D&#8208;GMs) remains an elusive aim, especially with electrochemical means. Here, it is shown that liquid metals render this possible as they offer catalytic activity and an ultrasmooth templating interface that promotes Frank&#8211;van der Merwe regime growth, while allowing facile exfoliation due to the absence of interfacial forces as a nonpolar liquid. The 2D&#8208;GMs are formed at low onset potential and can be in situ doped depending on the choice of organic precursors and the electrochemical set&#8208;up. The materials are tuned to exhibit porous or pinhole&#8208;free morphologies and are engineered for their degree of oxidation and number of layers. The proposed liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature electrochemical route can be expanded to many other 2D materials.

      <title>Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystal Microwire&#8208;Array Photodetectors with Performance Stability beyond 1 Year</title>
      <dc:description>
MAPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal microwire arrays with designable shape, controllable size, and high crystalline quality are fabricated. The combination of the hydrophobic molecular protective layer, high crystalline quality, and highly ordered microstructures, improve the intrinsic stability of MAPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal microwire arrays. Thus, a flexible photodetector with long&#8208;term performance stability of more than 1 year is achieved.








Abstract
Compared with thin&#8208;film morphology, 1D perovskite structures such as micro/nanowires with fewer grain boundaries and lower defect density are very suitable for high&#8208;performance photodetectors with higher stability. Although the stability of perovskite microwire&#8208;based photodetectors has been substantially enhanced in comparison with that of photodetectors based on thin&#8208;film morphology, practical applications require further improvements to the stability before implementation. In this study, a template&#8208;assisted method is developed to prepare methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) micro/nanowire structures, which are encapsulated in situ by a protective hydrophobic molecular layer. The combination of the protective layer, high crystalline quality, and highly ordered microstructures significantly improve the stability of the MAPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal microwire arrays. Consequently, these MAPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal microwire&#8208;array&#8208;based photodetectors exhibit significant long&#8208;term stability, maintaining 96% of the initial photocurrent after 1 year without further encapsulation. The lifetime of such photodetectors is hence approximately four times longer than that of the most stable previously reported perovskite micro/nanowire&#8208;based photodetector; this is thought to be the most stable perovskite photodetector reported thus far. Furthermore, this work should contribute further toward the realization of perovskite 1D structures with long&#8208;term stability.

      <dc:description>
To narrow the gap between biological and artificial systems and to accomplish direct human&#8211;computer interfaces, electronic/ionic couplers are needed.

Abstract
All biological systems, including animals and plants, communicate in a language of ions and small molecules, while the modern information infrastructures and technologies rely on a language of electrons. Although electronics and bioelectronics have made great progress in the past several decades, they still face the disadvantage of signal transformation when communicating with biology.

      <title>Magnetic Structure and Metamagnetic Transitions in the van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrPS4</title>
      <dc:description>
The magnetic structure of CrPS4 is determined. CrPS4 shows an antiferromagnetic ground state formed by out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferromagnetic monolayers with interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling along the c axis below TN = 38 K. The low&#8208;field metamagnetic transitions, that is, a spin&#8208;flop transition at &#8776;0.7 T and a spin&#8208;flip transition of 8 T, can be realized for H&#8741;c.








Abstract
In 2D magnets, interlayer exchange coupling is generally weak due to the van der Waals layered structure but it still plays a vital role in stabilizing the long&#8208;range magnetic ordering and determining the magnetic properties. Using complementary neutron diffraction, magnetic, and torque measurements, the complete magnetic phase diagram of CrPS4 crystals is determined. CrPS4 shows an antiferromagnetic ground state (A&#8208;type) formed by out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferromagnetic monolayers with interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling along the c axis below TN = 38 K. Due to small magnetic anisotropy energy and weak interlayer coupling, the low&#8208;field metamagnetic transitions in CrPS4, that is, a spin&#8208;flop transition at &#8776;0.7 T and a spin&#8208;flip transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic under a relatively low field of 8 T, can be realized for H&#8741;c. Intriguingly, with an inherent in&#8208;plane lattice anisotropy, spin&#8208;flop&#8208;induced moment realignment in CrPS4 for H&#8741;c is parallel to the quasi&#8208;1D chains of CrS6 octahedra. The peculiar metamagnetic transitions and in&#8208;plane anisotropy make few&#8208;layer CrPS4 flakes a fascinating platform for studying 2D magnetism and for exploring prototype device applications in spintronics and optoelectronics.

      <title>Switchable Cavitation in Silicone Coatings for Energy&#8208;Saving Cooling and Heating</title>
      <dc:description>
Silicone coatings that can be switched between radiative cooling and solar heating state are reported. The switching mechanism is based on mechanocontrolled dynamic cavities. In the cavity&#8208;open state, the coatings exhibit 93% solar reflection with 94% infrared emission for cooling, while in the cavity&#8208;closed state, they show 95% solar absorption for heating.








Abstract
Space cooling and heating currently result in huge amounts of energy consumption and various environmental problems. Herein, a switching strategy is described for efficient energy&#8208;saving cooling and heating based on the dynamic cavitation of silicone coatings that can be reversibly and continuously tuned from a highly porous state to a transparent solid. In the porous state, the coatings can achieve efficient solar reflection (93%) and long&#8208;wave infrared emission (94%) to induce a subambient temperature drop of about 5 &#176;C in hot weather (&#8776;35 &#176;C). In the transparent solid state, the coatings allow active sunlight permeation (95%) to induce solar heating to raise the ambient temperature from 10 to 28 &#176;C in cold weather. The coatings are made from commercially available, cheap materials via a facile, environmentally friendly method, and are durable, reversible, and patternable. They can be applied immediately to various existed objects including rigid substrates.

      <title>Bioinspired Multifunctional Organic Transistors Based on Natural Chlorophyll/Organic Semiconductors</title>
      <dc:description>
Bioinspired multifunctional organic transistors based on natural chlorophyll and organic semiconductors are fabricated. Phototdetection and light&#8208;stimulated synaptic transistor function can be realized by the single device under gate&#8208;voltage control. The devices show excellent photoresponsivity up to 2 &#215; 106 A W&#8722;1 as photodetectors and ultralow operating voltage of 10&#8211;5 V as synaptic devices.








Abstract
Inspired by the photosynthesis process of natural plants, multifunctional transistors based on natural biomaterial chlorophyll and organic semiconductors (OSCs) are reported. Functions as photodetectors (PDs) and light&#8208;stimulated synaptic transistors (LSSTs) can be switched by gate voltage. As PDs, the devices exhibit ultrahigh photoresponsivity up to 2 &#215; 106 A W&#8722;1, detectivity of 6 &#215; 1015 Jones, and Iphoto/Idark ratio of 2.7 &#215; 106, which make them among the best reported organic PDs.

&lt;p&gt;Bioinspired multifunctional organic transistors based on natural chlorophyll and organic semiconductors are fabricated. Phototdetection and light&#8208;stimulated synaptic transistor function can be realized by the single device under gate&#8208;voltage control. The devices show excellent photoresponsivity up to 2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; as photodetectors and ultralow operating voltage of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;5&lt;/sup&gt; V as synaptic devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the photosynthesis process of natural plants, multifunctional transistors based on natural biomaterial chlorophyll and organic semiconductors (OSCs) are reported. Functions as photodetectors (PDs) and light&#8208;stimulated synaptic transistors (LSSTs) can be switched by gate voltage. As PDs, the devices exhibit ultrahigh photoresponsivity up to 2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, detectivity of 6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Jones, and &lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;photo&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;I &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;dark&lt;/sub&gt; ratio of 2.7 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, which make them among the best reported organic PDs. As LSSTs, important synaptic functions similar to biological synapses are demonstrated, together with a dynamic learning and forgetting process and image&#8208;processing function. Significantly, benefiting from the ultrahigh photosensitivity of chlorophyll, the lowest operating voltage and energy consumption of the LSSTs can be 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;5&lt;/sup&gt; V and 0.25 fJ, respectively. The devices also exhibit high flexibility and long&#8208;term air stability. This work provides a new guide for developing organic electronics based on natural biomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Iron Oxide Nanoparticles as T1 Contrast Agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Fundamentals, Challenges, Applications, and Prospectives</title>
      <dc:description>
The fundamentals of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) as T1 contrast agents, the past advances, and current challenges in developing IONPs are reviewed. The key material properties and environmental variables influencing T1 and T2 contrast, and their relationships are discussed. Strategies for improving T1 contrast enhancement and directions for future research are provided.








Abstract
Gadolinium&#8208;based chelates are a mainstay of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the clinic. However, their toxicity elicits severe side effects and the Food and Drug Administration has issued many warnings about their potential retention in patients' bodies, which causes safety concerns. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) are a potentially attractive alternative, because of their nontoxic and biodegradable nature. Studies in developing IONPs as T1 contrast agents have generated promising results, but the complex, interrelated parameters influencing contrast enhancement make the development difficult, and IONPs suitable for T1 contrast enhancement have yet to make their way to clinical use. Here, the fundamental principles of MRI contrast agents are discussed, and the current status of MRI contrast agents is reviewed with a focus on the advantages and limitations of current T1 contrast agents and the potential of IONPs to serve as safe and improved alternative to gadolinium&#8208;based chelates. The past advances and current challenges in developing IONPs as a T1 contrast agent from a materials science perspective are presented, and how each of the key material properties and environment variables affects the performance of IONPs is assessed. Finally, some potential approaches to develop high&#8208;performance and clinically relevant T1 contrast agents are discussed.

      <title>Artificial Chemist: An Autonomous Quantum Dot Synthesis Bot</title>
      <dc:description>
Fully autonomous colloidal synthesis studies implementing a self&#8208;driving microfluidic platform with machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based experiment selection achieve unassisted material exploration. Halide&#8208;exchanged cesium lead bromide quantum dots are optimized simultaneously for photoluminescence quantum yield, polydispersity, and peak emission energy, independent of user intervention. Eleven target emissions are reached within 30 h and 210 mL of starting quantum dots and without prior knowledge.








Abstract
The optimal synthesis of advanced nanomaterials with numerous reaction parameters, stages, and routes, poses one of the most complex challenges of modern colloidal science, and current strategies often fail to meet the demands of these combinatorially large systems. In response, an Artificial Chemist is presented: the integration of machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based experiment selection and high&#8208;efficiency autonomous flow chemistry. With the self&#8208;driving Artificial Chemist, made&#8208;to&#8208;measure inorganic perovskite quantum dots (QDs) in flow are autonomously synthesized, and their quantum yield and composition polydispersity at target bandgaps, spanning 1.9 to 2.9 eV, are simultaneously tuned. Utilizing the Artificial Chemist, eleven precision&#8208;tailored QD synthesis compositions are obtained without any prior knowledge, within 30 h, using less than 210 mL of total starting QD solutions, and without user selection of experiments. Using the knowledge generated from these studies, the Artificial Chemist is pre&#8208;trained to use a new batch of precursors and further accelerate the synthetic path discovery of QD compositions, by at least twofold. The knowledge&#8208;transfer strategy further enhances the optoelectronic properties of the in&#8208;flow synthesized QDs (within the same resources as the no&#8208;prior&#8208;knowledge experiments) and mitigates the issues of batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch precursor variability, resulting in QDs averaging within 1 meV from their target peak emission energy.

      <title>Selectively Suppressing Tumor Angiogenesis for Targeted Breast Cancer Therapy by Genetically Engineered Phage</title>
      <dc:description>
Angiogenin&#8208;binding peptides are evolutionarily selected from a phage library. By genetic means, the angiogenin&#8208;binding peptides and tumor&#8208;homing peptides are displayed on the side wall and at the tip of filamentous phages, respectively. The resultant phage nanofibers are then intravenously injected into breast&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice. They are found to home to the tumors, suppress tumor angiogenesis, and inhibit tumor growth significantly.








Abstract
Antiangiogenesis is a promising approach to cancer therapy but is limited by the lack of tumor&#8208;homing capability of the current antiangiogenic agents. Angiogenin, a protein overexpressed and secreted by tumors to trigger angiogenesis for their growth, has never been explored as an antiangiogenic target in cancer therapy. Here it is shown that filamentous fd phage, as a biomolecular biocompatible nanofiber, can be engineered to become capable of first homing to orthotopic breast tumors and then capturing angiogenin to prevent tumor angiogenesis, resulting in targeted cancer therapy without side effects. The phage is genetically engineered to display many copies of an identified angiogenin&#8208;binding peptide on its side wall and multiple copies of a breast&#8208;tumor&#8208;homing peptide at its tip. Since the tumor&#8208;homing peptide can be discovered and customized virtually toward any specific cancer by phage display, the angiogenin&#8208;binding phages are thus universal &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;play&#8221; tumor&#8208;homing cancer therapeutics.

      <title>Designing Champion Nanostructures of Tungsten Dichalcogenides for Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Atomically curved 2H&#8208;WS2 nanosheets with precisely tunable strain and sulfur vacancies are synthesized by a simple one&#8208;step procedure based on confined epitaxy growth in mesoporous graphene derived from self&#8208;assembled Fe3O4 nanocrystal superlattices. Fine&#8208;tuning the WS2 layer number, strain, and sulfur vacancies enables arguably the best&#8208;performing 2H&#8208;WS2 electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction ever reported.








Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning strain and vacancies in 2H&#8208;phase transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides, although extremely challenging, is crucial for activating the inert basal plane for boosting the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, atomically curved 2H&#8208;WS2 nanosheets with precisely tunable strain and sulfur vacancies (S&#8208;vacancies) along with rich edge sites are synthesized via a one&#8208;step approach by harnessing geometric constraints. The approach is based on the confined epitaxy growth of WS2 in ordered mesoporous graphene derived from nanocrystal superlattices. The spherical curvature imposed by the graphitic mesopores enables the generation of uniform strain and S&#8208;vacancies in the as&#8208;grown WS2 nanosheets, and simultaneous manipulation of these two key parameters can be realized by simply adjusting the pore size. In addition, the formation of unique mesoporous WS2@graphene van der Waals heterostructures ensures the ready access of active sites. Fine&#8208;tuning the WS2 layer number, strain, and S&#8208;vacancies enables arguably the best&#8208;performing HER 2H&#8208;WS2 electrocatalysts ever reported. Density functional theory calculations indicate that compared with strain, S&#8208;vacancies play a more critical role in enhancing the HER activity.

      <title>Ammonia Thermal Treatment toward Topological Defects in Porous Carbon for Enhanced Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
NH3 thermal treatment on N&#8208;enriched carbon materials is adopted for creating a high density of topological defects by eliminating pyrrolic&#8208;N and pyridinic&#8208;N dopants from carbon materials. It is found that content of pyridinic&#8208;N and pyrrolic&#8208;N in the carbon precursor and the NH3 thermal&#8208;treatment temperature play critical roles in the creation of topological defects during the NH3&#8208;induced removal process, determining the CO2RR performance.








Abstract
Topological defects, with an asymmetric local electronic redistribution, are expected to locally tune the intrinsic catalytic activity of carbon materials. However, it is still challenging to deliberately create high&#8208;density homogeneous topological defects in carbon networks due to the high formation energy. Toward this end, an efficient NH3 thermal&#8208;treatment strategy is presented for thoroughly removing pyrrolic&#8208;N and pyridinic&#8208;N dopants from N&#8208;enriched porous carbon particles, to create high&#8208;density topological defects. The resultant topological defects are systematically investigated by near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements and local density of states analysis, and the defect formation mechanism is revealed by reactive molecular dynamics simulations. Notably, the as&#8208;prepared porous carbon materials possess an enhanced electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance, yielding a current density of 2.84 mA cm&#8722;2 with Faradaic efficiency of 95.2% for CO generation. Such a result is among the best performances reported for metal&#8208;free CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. Density functional theory calculations suggest that the edge pentagonal sites are the dominating active centers with the lowest free energy (&#916;G) for CO2 reduction. This work not only presents deep insights for the defect engineering of carbon&#8208;based materials but also improves the understanding of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on carbon defects.

&lt;p&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thermal treatment on N&#8208;enriched carbon materials is adopted for creating a high density of topological defects by eliminating pyrrolic&#8208;N and pyridinic&#8208;N dopants from carbon materials. It is found that content of pyridinic&#8208;N and pyrrolic&#8208;N in the carbon precursor and the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thermal&#8208;treatment temperature play critical roles in the creation of topological defects during the NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;induced removal process, determining the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR performance.

      <dc:description>
A tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive lanthanide&#8211;cyanine F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer nanosensor is designed for lifetime&#8208;based hepatocellular carcinoma in situ detection in the second near&#8208;infrared window (1000&#8211;1700 nm). Given lifetime measurement is immune to a constant background from ambient light, augmented reality can be integrated to enable a wide range of preclinical biomedical applications.








Abstract
Deep tissue imaging in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window holds great promise for widespread fundamental research. However, inhomogeneous signal attenuation due to tissue absorption and scattering hampers its application for accurate in vivo biosensing. Here, lifetime&#8208;based in situ hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detection in NIR&#8208;II region is presented using a tumor&#8208;microenvironment (peroxynitrite, ONOO&#8722;)&#8208;responsive lanthanide&#8211;cyanine F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanosensor. A specially designed ONOO&#8722;&#8208;responsive NIR&#8208;II dye, MY&#8208;1057, is synthesized as the FRET acceptor. Robust lifetime sensing is demonstrated to be independent of tissue penetration depth. Tumor lesions are accurately distinguished from normal tissue due to the recovery lifetime. Magnetic resonance imaging and liver dissection results illustrate the reliability of lifetime&#8208;based detection in single and multiple HCC models. Moreover, the ONOO&#8722; amount can be calculated according to the standard curve.

      <title>Low&#8208;Loss Organic Hyperbolic Materials in the Visible Spectral Range: A Joint Experimental and First&#8208;Principles Study</title>
      <dc:description>
A natural, low&#8208;loss organic hyperbolic material (OHM) in the visible spectral range is investigated. Hyperbolic dispersion is controlled by changing the alignment of the crystalline domains. The highly tunable optical properties make it possible to control the wavelength, which has a high figure of merit. Evidently, the OHM outperforms traditional hyperbolic materials in the visible spectral range.








Abstract
Hyperbolic media strengthen numerous attractive applications in optics such as super&#8208;resolution imaging, enhanced spontaneous emission, and nanoscale waveguiding. Natural hyperbolic materials exist at visible frequencies; however, implementations of these materials suffer substantial compromises resulting from the high loss in the currently available candidates. Here, the first experimental and theoretical investigation of regioregular poly(3&#8208;alkylthiophenes) (rr&#8208;P3ATs), a naturally low&#8208;loss organic hyperbolic material (OHM) in the visible frequency range, is shown. These hyperbolic properties arise from a highly ordered structure of layered electron&#8208;rich conjugated thiophene ring backbones separated by insulating alkyl side chains. The optical and electronic properties of the rr&#8208;P3AT can be tuned by controlling the degree of crystallinity and alkyl side chain length. First&#8208;principles calculations support the experimental observations, which result from the rr&#8208;P3AT's structural and optical anisotropy. Conveniently, rr&#8208;P3AT&#8208;based OHMs are facile to fabricate, flexible, and biocompatible, which may lead to tremendous new opportunities in a wide range of applications.

      <title>Infrared Permittivity of the Biaxial van der Waals Semiconductor &#945;&#8208;MoO3 from Near&#8208; and Far&#8208;Field Correlative Studies</title>
      <dc:description>
The IR permittivity of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is extracted by correlative far&#8208; and near&#8208;field measurements using FTIR reflectance spectroscopy and s&#8208;SNOM polariton interferometry, thus providing a novel approach to extracting dielectric functions of nanomaterials.

Abstract
The biaxial van der Waals semiconductor &#945;&#8208;phase molybdenum trioxide (&#945;&#8208;MoO3) has recently received significant attention due to its ability to support highly anisotropic phonon polaritons (PhPs)&#8212;infrared (IR) light coupled to lattice vibrations&#8212;offering an unprecedented platform for controlling the flow of energy at the nanoscale. However, to fully exploit the extraordinary IR response of this material, an accurate dielectric function is required. Here, the accurate IR dielectric function of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is reported by modeling far&#8208;field polarized IR reflectance spectra acquired on a single thick flake of this material. Unique to this work, the far&#8208;field model is refined by contrasting the experimental dispersion and damping of PhPs, revealed by polariton interferometry using scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy (s&#8208;SNOM) on thin flakes of &#945;&#8208;MoO3, with analytical and transfer&#8208;matrix calculations, as well as full&#8208;wave simulations. Through these correlative efforts, exceptional quantitative agreement is attained to both far&#8208; and near&#8208;field properties for multiple flakes, thus providing strong verification of the accuracy of this model, while offering a novel approach to extracting dielectric functions of nanomaterials. In addition, by employing density functional theory (DFT), insights into the various vibrational states dictating the dielectric function model and the intriguing optical properties of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are provided.

      <title>Canonic&#8208;Like HER Activity of Cr1&#8211;xMoxB2 Solid Solution: Overpowering Pt/C at High Current Density</title>
      <dc:description>
An unusual canonic&#8208;like behavior of the c lattice parameter in the AlB2&#8208;type solid solution Cr1&#8211;xMoxB2 is found to directly correlate to its hydrogen evolution reaction activity in 0.5 m H2SO4 solution. The best catalyst, Cr0.4Mo0.6B2, outperforms Pt/C at high current density. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the (110) mixed metal/B layer promotes hydrogen evolution more efficiently for x = 0.6, supporting the experimental results.








Abstract
Abundant transition metal borides are emerging as substitute electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for noble metals. Herein, an unusual canonic&#8208;like behavior of the c lattice parameter in the AlB2&#8208;type solid solution Cr1&#8211;xMoxB2 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, 1) and its direct correlation to the HER activity in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution are reported. The activity increases with increasing x, reaching its maximum at x = 0.6 before decreasing again. At high current densities, Cr0.4Mo0.6B2 outperforms Pt/C, as it needs 180 mV less overpotential to drive an 800 mA cm&#8722;2 current density. Cr0.4Mo0.6B2 has excellent long&#8208;term stability and durability showing no significant activity loss after 5000 cycles and 25 h of operation in acid. First&#8208;principles calculations have correctly reproduced the nonlinear dependence of the c lattice parameter and have shown that the mixed metal/B layers, such as (110), promote hydrogen evolution more efficiently for x = 0.6, supporting the experimental results.

&lt;/i&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x &lt;/i&gt; = 0, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.75, 1) and its direct correlation to the HER activity in 0.5 M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; solution are reported. The activity increases with increasing &lt;i&gt;x &lt;/i&gt;, reaching its maximum at &lt;i&gt;x &lt;/i&gt; = 0.6 before decreasing again. At high current densities, Cr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; outperforms Pt/C, as it needs 180 mV less overpotential to drive an 800 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current density. Cr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has excellent long&#8208;term stability and durability showing no significant activity loss after 5000 cycles and 25 h of operation in acid. First&#8208;principles calculations have correctly reproduced the nonlinear dependence of the &lt;i&gt;c &lt;/i&gt; lattice parameter and have shown that the mixed metal/B layers, such as (110), promote hydrogen evolution more efficiently for &lt;i&gt;x &lt;/i&gt; = 0.6, supporting the experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;

Novel thin&#8208;film composite membranes containing entrapped structural submicroporosity (pore size of &lt;4 &#197;) exhibit superb performance for removal of small solutes from aqueous or organic solutions, as discussed by Ingo Pinnau and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001132.

Optical activity of surface lattice resonances is demonstrated by Nicolas Vogel and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001330. The controlled arrangement of chiral crescent&#8208;shaped nanoantennae allows a selective response of the surface lattice resonances to the handedness of incident circularly polarized light.

      <title>Cancer Therapy: Harnessing the Formation of Natural Killer&#8211;Tumor Cell Immunological Synapses for Enhanced Therapeutic Effect in Solid Tumors (Adv. Mater. 22/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2000020, Won Jong Kim and co&#8208;workers describe a reinforced natural killer (ReNK) system, adopting the formation of NK&#8211;tumor cell immunological synapses (IS) as a trigger for delivery of tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapeutics. NK cells are decorated with the IS environment&#8208;responsive micellar system to ensure the release of drug when they attack cancer cells. The strategy enables the NK cells to inhibit the growth of solid tumors by efficient penetration of the delivered drug into the tumor tissue; otherwise, its penetration is hindered by the dense extracellular matrix of the tumor tissue.

      <title>Magnetic Patterning: Local Photothermal Control of Phase Transitions for On&#8208;Demand Room&#8208;Temperature Rewritable Magnetic Patterning (Adv. Mater. 22/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Patterned magnetic nanostructures are foundational to magnetic memory and logic devices. In article number 2001080, Antonio B. Mei, Gregory D. Fuchs, and co&#8208;workers design a platform for reconfigurable magnetic nanostructures in FeRh by tuning the transition temperature from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic such that both phases are stable at room temperature. Focused laser heating is used to write ferromagnetic patterns of arbitrary shape at ultrafast speeds, which can be erased by cooling below room temperature.

The interconnected macroporous structure with abundant accessible active sites significantly improves the mass transport and accelerates the diffusion of reactants, thus contributing to efficient and robust bifunctionality for oxygen electrocatalysis and achieving long&#8208;life rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Nanostructures derived from zeolitic&#8208;imidazole frameworks (ZIFs) gain much interest in bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. However, they are not satisfied well for long&#8208;life rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries due to the limited single particle morphology. Herein, the preparation of an interconnected macroporous carbon matrix with a well&#8208;defined 3D architecture by the pyrolysis of silica templated ZIF&#8208;67 assemblies is reported. The matrix catalyst assembled zinc&#8211;air battery exhibits a high power density of 221.1 mW cm&#8722;2 as well as excellent stability during 500 discharging/charging cycles, surpassing that of a commercial Pt/C assembled battery. The synergistic effect from the interconnected macroporous structure together with abundant cobalt&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon active sites justify the excellent electrocatalytic activity and battery performance. Considering the advanced nanostructures and performance, the as&#8208;synthesized hybrid would be promising for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries and other energy technologies. This work may also provide significant concept in the view of electrocatalysis design for long&#8208;life battery.

      <title>A Flexi&#8208;PEGDA Upconversion Implant for Wireless Brain Photodynamic Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Biocompatible upconversion hydrogel implants synergistically conserve the light guiding and near&#8208;infrared transducing properties into a wireless light&#8208;delivery implant. Such hydrogel&#8208;based upconversion designs are explored to activate clinically relevant photosensitizer in wireless photodynamic therapy of glioblastoma multiforme. Upconversion implantable is potentially translatable to other phototherapies and as medical implants.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) activatable upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) enable wireless&#8208;based phototherapies by converting deep&#8208;tissue&#8208;penetrating NIR to visible light. UCNPs are therefore ideal as wireless transducers for photodynamic therapy (PDT) of deep&#8208;sited tumors. However, the retention of unsequestered UCNPs in tissue with minimal options for removal limits their clinical translation. To address this shortcoming, biocompatible UCNPs implants are developed to deliver upconversion photonic properties in a flexible, optical guide design. To enhance its translatability, the UCNPs implant is constructed with an FDA&#8208;approved poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) core clad with fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP). The emission spectrum of the UCNPs implant can be tuned to overlap with the absorption spectra of the clinically relevant photosensitizer, 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (5&#8208;ALA). The UCNPs implant can wirelessly transmit upconverted visible light till 8 cm in length and in a bendable manner even when implanted underneath the skin or scalp. With this system, it is demonstrated that NIR&#8208;based chronic PDT is achievable in an untethered and noninvasive manner in a mouse xenograft glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model. It is postulated that such encapsulated UCNPs implants represent a translational shift for wireless deep&#8208;tissue phototherapy by enabling sequestration of UCNPs without compromising wireless deep&#8208;tissue light delivery.

Abstract
The progress of the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things in the past few years has necessitated the support of high&#8208;performance sensors. Schottky&#8208;contacted nanowire sensors have attracted considerable attention owing to their high sensitivity and fast response time. Their progress is reviewed here, based on several kinds of important nanowires, for applications such as bio/chemical sensors, gas sensors, photodetectors, and strain sensors. Although Schottky&#8208;contacted nanowire sensors deliver excellent performance in these fields, they can be further improved by various methods, including defect engineering, surface modification, the piezotronic effect, and the piezophototronic effect, all of which are discussed here. With regard to practical applications, further efforts are required to address challenges such as the stability, selectivity, ultrafast response, multifunctionality, flexibility, distributed energy supply, and sustainability of Schottky&#8208;contacted nanowire sensors.

      <title>Tunable Magnetic Antiskyrmion Size and Helical Period from Nanometers to Micrometers in a D2d Heusler Compound</title>
      <dc:description>
The size of an antiskyrmion in a D2d Heusler compound is observed to vary significantly by more than one order of magnitude as the thickness of the host material is varied. Experiments establish that the antiskyrmion is preserved even in micrometer&#8208;thick samples. These properties are a result of an interplay between Heisenberg and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya exchange and magnetic dipolar interactions.








Abstract
Skyrmions and antiskyrmions are magnetic nano&#8208;objects with distinct chiral, noncollinear spin textures that are found in various magnetic systems with crystal symmetries that give rise to specific Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya exchange vectors. These magnetic nano&#8208;objects are associated with closely related helical spin textures that can form in the same material. The skyrmion size and the period of the helix are generally considered as being determined, in large part, by the ratio of the magnitude of the Heisenberg to that of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya exchange interaction. In this work, it is shown by real&#8208;space magnetic imaging that the helix period &#955; and the size of the antiskyrmion daSk in the D2d compound Mn1.4PtSn can be systematically tuned by more than an order of magnitude from &#8776;100 nm to more than 1.1 &#181;m&#8197;by varying the thickness of the lamella in which they are observed. The chiral spin texture is verified to be preserved even up to micrometer&#8208;thick layers. This extreme size tunability is shown to arise from long&#8208;range magnetodipolar interactions, which typically play a much less important role for B20 skyrmions. This tunability in size makes antiskyrmions very attractive for technological applications.

      <title>Disorder&#8208;Induced Signal Filtering with Topological Metamaterials</title>
      <dc:description>
Contrary to the general intuition that disorder is detrimental to analog devices, it is shown that, in certain topological systems, strong randomness can be leveraged as an asset to trigger desired analog filtering operations.








Abstract
Disorder, ubiquitously present in realistic structures, is generally thought to disturb the performance of analog wave devices, as it often causes strong multiple scattering effects that largely arrest wave transportation. Contrary to this general view, here, it is shown that, in some wave systems with nontrivial topological character, strong randomness can be highly beneficial, acting as a powerful stimulator to enable desired analog filtering operations. This is achieved in a topological Anderson sonic crystal that, in the regime of dominating randomness, provides a well&#8208;defined filtering response characterized by a Lorentzian spectral line&#8208;shape. The theoretical and experimental results, serving as the first realization of topological Anderson insulator phase in acoustics, suggest the striking possibility of achieving specific, nonrandom analog filtering operations by adding randomness to clean structures.

&lt;p&gt;Disorder, ubiquitously present in realistic structures, is generally thought to disturb the performance of analog wave devices, as it often causes strong multiple scattering effects that largely arrest wave transportation. Contrary to this general view, here, it is shown that, in some wave systems with nontrivial topological character, strong randomness can be highly beneficial, acting as a powerful stimulator to enable desired analog filtering operations. This is achieved in a topological Anderson sonic crystal that, in the regime of dominating randomness, provides a well&#8208;defined filtering response characterized by a Lorentzian spectral line&#8208;shape. The theoretical and experimental results, serving as the first realization of topological Anderson insulator phase in acoustics, suggest the striking possibility of achieving specific, nonrandom analog filtering operations by adding randomness to clean structures.&lt;/p&gt;
