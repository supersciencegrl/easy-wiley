         <title>Giant Exchange&#8208;Bias&#8208;Like Effect at Low Cooling Fields Induced by Pinned Magnetic Domains in Y2NiIrO6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The octahedral distortion in Y2NiIrO6 favors orbital&#8208;lattice coupling with the orbital moment along the short Ir&#8211;O bonds, eventually leading to the pinning of magnetic domains. It results in substantial vertical shifts of the magnetic loops under small cooling fields and in turn the huge asymmetry of left and right coercive fields, namely giant exchange&#8208;bias&#8208;like fields.








Abstract
Exchange bias (EB) is highly desirable for widespread technologies. Generally, conventional exchange&#8208;bias heterojunctions require excessively large cooling fields for sufficient bias fields, which are generated by pinned spins at the interface of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic layers. It is crucial for applicability to obtain considerable exchange&#8208;bias fields with minimum cooling fields. Here, an exchange&#8208;bias&#8208;like effect is reported in a double perovskite, Y2NiIrO6, which shows long&#8208;range ferrimagnetic ordering below 192 K. It displays a giant bias&#8208;like field of 1.1 T with a cooling field of only 15&#160;Oe at 5 K. This robust phenomenon appears below 170 K. This fascinating bias&#8208;like effect is the secondary effect of the vertical shifts of the magnetic loops, which is attributed to the pinned magnetic domains due to the combination of strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling on Ir, and antiferromagnetically coupled Ni&#8208; and Ir&#8208;sublattices. The pinned moments in Y2NiIrO6 are present throughout the full volume, not just at the interface as in conventional bilayer systems.

         <title>Constructing a Uniform and Stable Mixed Conductive Layer to Stabilize the Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte/Li Interface by Cold Bonding at Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The great potential of the application of room&#8208;temperature in the situ cold bonding technique for the rational design and optimization of LLZ/Li interfaces with low cost, high safety and operability is highlighted. The prepared RT&#8208;MCL shows good interfacial compatibility and excellent electrochemical properties.








Abstract
Garnet&#8208;type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZ) electrolyte&#160;is a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries, while its applications are hindered by interfacial problems. Although the utilization of functional coatings and molten lithium (Li) effectively solves the LLZ interfacial compatibility problem with Li metal, it poses problems such as high cost, high danger, and structural damage. Herein, a mixed conductive layer (MCL) is introduced at the LLZ/Li interface (RT&#8208;MCL) via an in situ cold bonding process at room temperature. Such a stable and compact RT&#8208;MCL can effectively suppress side reactions and protect the crystal structure of LLZ, and it also inhibits growth of Li dendrites and promotes uniform Li deposition. The critical current density (CCD) of the Li symmetric cell composed of RT&#8208;MCL&#8208;LLZ is increased to 1.8&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and provides stable cycling performance over 2000 h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8208;2. Additionally, this in situ cold bonding treatment can significantly reduce cost and eliminate potential safety issues caused by the high&#8208;temperature processing of Li metal. This work highlights tremendous potential of this cold bonding technique in the reasonable design and optimization of the LLZ/Li interface.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Regulation of the Microenvironment of Ni(II)&#8208;Porphyrin Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins (o&#8208;NiTPyP, m&#8208;NiTPyP, p&#8208;NiTPyP) are prepared as model catalysts for fine&#8208;tuning the microenvironment around the active site via affecting the H&#8208;bonding interaction and N&#63743;Ni&#63743;N bond angles. Among them, m&#8208;NiTPyP as the electrocatalyst delivers the lowest overpotentials of 267/138&#160;mV for the OER/HER, and as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline electrolyzer only requires a cell voltage of 1.62&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 current density.








Abstract
Accurately regulating the microenvironment around active sites is an important approach for boosting the overall water splitting performance of bifunctional electrocatalysts,&#160;which&#160;can drive both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the same electrolyte. Herein, pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins (o&#8208;NiTPyP, m&#8208;NiTPyP, and p&#8208;NiTPyP) with pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atoms located at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, or para&#8208;position are prepared and used as model catalysts for alkaline water splitting. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atom positions can regulate the microenvironment around the active sites and the adsorption free energy of H&#8208;donating substances by affecting the H&#8208;bonding interaction and the N&#63743;Ni&#63743;N bond angles of active sites, and thus those pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins deliver better electrocatalytic activity than the Ni(II)&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin (NiTPP) without pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atoms. Among them, m&#8208;NiTPyP on carbon nanotubes delivers the lowest overpotentials of 267 and 138&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER and HER, respectively. Specifically, m&#8208;NiTPyP as bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline electrolyzer requires only 1.62&#160;V to drive efficient overall water splitting at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 while remaining durable. This work proposes a new H&#8208;bond&#8208;regulating approach of the microenvironment of electrocatalysts for effectively boosting the overall water splitting activity and deeply understanding its related mechanism.

         <title>From Nanoscopic to Macroscopic Materials by Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticle Aggregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of the different length&#8208;scale materials by stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) aggregation is presented. The design strategy for NP aggregation by external stimuli, the recent progress, and the applications are summarized. The main challenges for the development of functional materials at different length scales are analyzed and prospects for the potential applications in different fields are discussed.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) aggregation plays an increasingly important role in regulating NP assembly into microscopic superstructures, macroscopic 2D, and 3D functional materials. Diverse external stimuli are widely used to adjust the aggregation of responsive NPs, such as light, temperature, pH, electric, and magnetic fields. Many unique structures based on responsive NPs are constructed including disordered aggregates, ordered superlattices, structural droplets, colloidosomes, and bulk solids. In this review, the strategies for NP aggregation by external stimuli, and their recent progress ranging from nanoscale aggregates, microscale superstructures to macroscale bulk materials along the length scales as well as their applications are summarized. The future opportunities and challenges for designing functional materials through NP aggregation at different length scales are also discussed.

         <title>A Whole&#8208;Course&#8208;Repair System Based on Neurogenesis&#8208;Angiogenesis Crosstalk and Macrophage Reprogramming Promotes Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis crosstalk and macrophage reprogramming can pave way for the next generation of regenerative hydrogels to accelerate the recovery of chronic wounds. The work presents a novel approach to deliver drug&#8208;loaded extracellular vesicles and magnesium ions by an in situ injectable hydrogel for concurrent supportive cycles of neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis under a favorable immune&#8208;microenvironment to heal diabetic wounds.








Abstract
Diabetic wound (DW) therapy is currently a big challenge in medicine and strategies to enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis have appeared to be a promising direction. However, the current treatments have failed to coordinate neurogenesis and angiogenesis simultaneously, leading to an increased disability rate caused by DWs. Herein, a whole&#8208;course&#8208;repair system is introduced by a hydrogel to concurrently achieve a mutually supportive cycle of neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis under a favorable immune&#8208;microenvironment. This hydrogel can first be one&#8208;step packaged in a syringe for later in situ local injections to cover wounds long&#8208;termly for accelerated wound healing via the synergistic effect of magnesium ions (Mg2+) and engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The self&#8208;healing and bio&#8208;adhesive properties of the hydrogel make it an ideal physical barrier for DWs. At the inflammation stage, the formulation can recruit bone marrow&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells to the wound sites and stimulate them toward neurogenic differentiation, while providing a favorable immune microenvironment via macrophage reprogramming. At the proliferation stage of wound repair, robust angiogenesis occurs by the synergistic effect of the newly differentiated neural cells and the released Mg2+, allowing a regenerative neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis cycle to take place at the wound site. This whole&#8208;course&#8208;repair system provides a novel platform for combined DW therapy.

         <title>Ethanol&#8208;Induced Ni2+&#8208;Intercalated Cobalt Organic Frameworks on Vanadium Pentoxide for Synergistically Enhancing the Performance of 3D&#8208;Printed Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hollow structure is synthesized by controlling the amount of Ni doping by using the different coordination abilities of Ni2+ and Co2+ with N and O atoms and the incompatibility between the d8 electronic configuration of Ni2+ and the 3D structure of ZIF&#8208;67. The composite material applied to 3D printing micro supercapacitor has excellent specific capacitance and energy density.








Abstract
The synthesis of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanocomposites with high energy density and excellent mechanical strength is limited by the degree of lattice matching and crystal surface structure. In this study, dodecahedral ZIF&#8208;67 is synthesized uniformly on vanadium pentoxide nanowires. The influence of the coordination mode on the surface of ZIF&#8208;67 in ethanol is also investigated. Benefitting from the different coordination abilities of Ni2+, Co2+, and N atoms, spatially separated surface&#8208;active sites are created through metal&#8208;ion exchange. Furthermore, the incompatibility between the d8 electronic configuration of Ni2+ and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure of ZIF&#8208;67 afforded the synthesis of hollow structures by controlling the amount of Ni doping. The formation of NiCo&#8208;MOF@CoOOH@V2O5 nanocomposites is confirmed using X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis. The high performance of the obtained composite is illustrated by fabricating a 3D&#8208;printed micro&#8208;supercapacitor, exhibiting a high area specific capacitance of 585 mF cm&#8722;2 and energy density of 159.23 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2 (at power density = 0.34&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). The solvent/coordination tuning strategy demonstrated in this study provides a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage applications.

         <title>Encoded Structural Color Microneedle Patches for Multiple Screening of Wound Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection of biomarkers associated with wound conditions provides in&#8208;depth healthcare information and benefits wound healing treatment.

Abstract
Detection of biomarkers associated with wound conditions provides in&#8208;depth healthcare information and benefits wound healing treatment. The current aim of wound detection is to achieve in situ multiple detections. Novel encoded structural color microneedle patches (EMNs) combining photonic crystals (PhCs) and microneedle arrays (MNs) for multiple wound biomarker detection in situ are described here. Using a partitioned and layered casting strategy, the EMNs can be divided into different modules and each serves for the detection of small molecules , including pH, glucose, and histamine. pH sensing is based on the interaction between hydrogen ions and carboxyl groups from hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PAM); glucose sensing is achieved with the help of glucose&#8208;responsive fluorophenylboronic acid (FPBA); while histamine sensing relies on specific recognition of aptamers and target molecules. Owing to the responsive volume change of these three modules in the presence of target molecules, the EMNs can create structural color change and characteristic peak shift of the PhCs, thus realizing the qualitative measurement of target molecules with a spectrum analyzer. It is further demonstrated that the EMNs behave well in the multivariate detection of rat wound molecules. These features indicate that the EMNs can be valuable smart detection systems for wound status screening.

         <title>Emerging 2D Metal Oxides: From Synthesis to Device Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging 2D metal oxides exhibit intriguing electronic and optical properties, which have great potential in emerging functional devices. Diverse structures and various synthesis methods open a new field of vision for device&#8208;fabrication&#8208;based 2D metal oxides. Their unique properties can bring new vigor and vitality into 2D material family.








Abstract
2D metal oxides have aroused increasing attention in the field of electronics and optoelectronics due to their intriguing physical properties. In this review, an overview of recent advances on synthesis of 2D metal oxides and their electronic applications is presented. First, the tunable physical properties of 2D metal oxides that relate to the structure (various oxidation&#8208;state forms, polymorphism, etc.), crystallinity and defects (anisotropy, point defects, and grain boundary), and thickness (quantum confinement effect, interfacial effect, etc.) are discussed. Then, advanced synthesis methods for 2D metal oxides besides mechanical exfoliation are introduced and classified into solution process, vapor&#8208;phase deposition, and native oxidation on a metal source. Later, the various roles of 2D metal oxides in widespread applications, i.e., transistors, inverters, photodetectors, piezotronics, memristors, and potential applications (solar cell, spintronics, and superconducting devices) are discussed. Finally, an outlook of existing challenges and future opportunities in 2D metal oxides is proposed.

         <title>Lead(II) 2&#8208;Ethylhexanoate for Simultaneous Modulated Crystallization and Surface Shielding to Boost Perovskite Solar Cell Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead(II) 2&#8208;ethylhexanoate (LDE) is introduced via an antisolvent process into perovskite films to change the kinetics of crystallization, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite film. The carboxyl functional group coordinates with the Pb cation, reducing the defect concentration. Meanwhile, the long alkyl chains form a protecting layer to prevent chemical attack by water and air, prolonging the lifetime of perovskite devices.








Abstract
The bulk and surface of a perovskite light&#8208;harvesting layer are two pivotal aspects affecting its carrier transport and long&#8208;term stability. In this work, lead(II) 2&#8208;ethylhexanoate (LDE) is introduced via an antisolvent process into perovskite films to change the reaction kinetics of the crystallization process, resulting in a high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Meanwhile, a carboxyl functional group with a long alkyl chain coordinates with the Pb cation, reducing the defect density related to unsaturated Pb atoms. Moreover, the long alkyl chains form a protecting layer at the surface of the perovskite film to prevent chemical attack by water and air, prolonging the lifetime of perovskite devices. Consequently, the assembled device demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.84%. Both of the thermal and operational stability are significantly improved due to reduced ion&#8208;migration channels.

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled compartments from nanoscale components are found in all life forms. Their characteristic dimensions are in 50&#8211;1000&#160;nm scale, typically assembled from a variety of bioorganic &#8220;building blocks&#8221;. Among various functions that these mesoscale compartments carry out, protection of the content from the environment is central. Finding synthetic pathways to similarly complex and functional particles from technologically friendly inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) is needed for multitude of biomedical, biochemical, and biotechnological processes. Here, we show that FeS2 NPs stabilized by L&#8208;cysteine self&#8208;assemble into multicompartment supraparticles (mSPs). The NPs initially produce &#8764;55&#160;nm concave assemblies that reconfigure into &#8764;75&#160;nm closed mSPs with &#8764;340 interconnected compartments with an average size of &#8764;5&#160;nm. The inter&#8208;compartmental partitions and mSP surface are formed primarily from FeS2 and Fe2O3 NPs, respectively. The intermediate formation of cup&#8208;like particles enables encapsulation of biological cargo. This capability was demonstrated by loading mSPs with DNA and subsequent transfection of mammalian cells. We also found that the temperature stability of the DNA cargo was enhanced compared to the traditional delivery vehicles. These findings demonstrate that biomimetic compartmentalized particles can be used to successfully encapsulate and enhance temperature stability of nucleic acid cargo for a variety of bioapplications.

         <title>Electrochemical Syntheses of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have surfaced as increasingly viable components in optoelectronics and material sciences. The development of highly efficient and atom&#8208;economic tools to prepare PAHs under exceedingly mild conditions constitutes a long&#8208;term goal. Traditional syntheses of PAHs have largely relied on multistep approaches or the conventional Scholl reaction. However, Scholl reactions are largely inefficient with electron&#8208;deficient substrates, require stoichiometric chemical oxidants, and typically occur in the presence of strong acid. In sharp contrast, electrochemistry has gained considerable momentum during the past decade as an alternative for the facile and straightforward PAHs assembly, generally via electro&#8208;oxidative dehydrogenative annulation, releasing molecular hydrogen as the sole stoichiometric byproduct by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This review provides an overview on the recent and significant advances in the field of electrochemical syntheses of various PAHs until January 2023.

         <title>Graphene Biointerface for Cardiac Arrhythmia Diagnosis and Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Heart rhythm disorders, known as arrhythmias, cause significant morbidity and are one of the leading causes of mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are frequently treated by implantable devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators, or by ablation therapy guided by electroanatomical mapping. Both implantable and ablation therapies require sophisticated biointerfaces for electrophysiological measurements of electrograms and delivery of therapeutic stimulation or ablation energy. In this work, we report for the first time on graphene biointerface for in vivo cardiac electrophysiology. Leveraging sub&#8208;micrometer thick tissue&#8208;conformable graphene arrays, we demonstrate sensing and stimulation of the open mammalian heart both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate the graphene biointerface treatment of atrioventricular block (the kind of arrhythmia where the electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles is interrupted). The graphene arrays show effective electrochemical properties, namely interface impedance down to 40 Ohm&#215;cm2 at 1&#160;kHz, charge storage capacity up to 63.7 mC/cm2, and charge injection capacity up to 704 &#956;C/cm2. Transparency of the graphene structures allows for simultaneous optical mapping of cardiac action potentials, calcium transients, and optogenetic stimulation while performing electrical measurements and stimulation. Our report presents evidence of the significant potential of graphene biointerfaces for advanced cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia therapy.

         <title>Ionogel&#8208;Electrode for the Study of Protein Tunnel Junctions under Physiologically Relevant Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The study of charge transport through proteins is essential for understanding complicated electrochemical processes in biological activities while the reasons for the co&#8208;existence of tunneling and hopping phenomena in protein junctions still remain unclear. In this work, we synthesized a flexible and conductive ionogel electrode and used it as a top contact to form highly reproducible protein junctions. The junctions of proteins, including human serum albumin, cytochrome C and hemoglobin, show temperature&#8208;independent electron tunneling characteristics when junctions are in solid states while with a different mechanism of temperature&#8208;dependent electron hopping when junctions are hydrated under physiologically relevant conditions. We demonstrate the solvent reorganization energy plays an important role in the electron hopping process and for the first time, experimentally show that it requires &#8764;100 meV for electrons hopping through one heme group inside a hydrated protein molecule connected between two electrodes.

         <title>Plant&#8208;like tropisms in artificial muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Helical plants have the ability of tropisms to respond to natural stimuli and biomimicry of such helical shapes into artificial muscles has been vastly popular. However, the shape mimicked actuators only respond to artificially provided stimulus, they are not adaptive to variable natural conditions, thus being unsuitable for real&#8208;life applications where on&#8208;demand, autonomous operations are required. We here demonstrate novel artificial muscles made of hierarchically patterned helically wound yarns that are self&#8208;adaptive to environmental humidity and temperature changes. Unlike shape mimicked artificial muscles, we adopt a unique microstructural biomimicking approach, where the muscle yarns can effectively replicate the hydrotropism and thermotropism of helical plants to their microfibril level using plant&#8208;like microstructural memories. Large strokes, with rapid movement, were obtained when the individual microfilament of yarn is inlaid with hydrogel and further twisted into a coil shaped hierarchical structure. The developed artificial muscle provided average actuation speed of &#8764;5.2%/sec at expansion and &#8764;3.1%/sec at contraction cycles, being the fastest amongst previously demonstrated actuators of similar type. We demonstrate that these muscle yarns can autonomously close a window in wet climates. The building block yarns are washable without any material degradation, making them suitable for smart, reusable textile and soft robotic devices.

         <title>Organic Persistent RTP Crystals: From Brittle to Flexible by Tunable Self&#8208;Partitioned Molecular Packing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aiming to solve trade&#8208;off of &#8220;RTP&#8208;flexibility&#8221; in principle, organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) crystals with elastic/plastic deformation have been realized. These properties are mainly due to the divisional aggregation structures of aromatics and alkoxy chains, and can be modulated by the controllable molecular configurations. The longest RTP lifetime of 972.3&#160;ms has been achieved as the highest record for organic flexible crystals. The plastic crystals with persistent RTP were realized for the first time, which can be applied into biomedical optical technologies by afterglow delivery. Moreover, relationship among elastic/plastic deformation, RTP property and aggregated structures have been established. Elastic/plastic deformation is mainly determined by difference of interaction energies from aromatics and alkoxy chains. For BP&#8208;OR series with twisted configurations, the alkoxy chain with the middle length is favorable for RTP property, while the strength of &#960;&#8208;&#960; coupling is the cruical factor to RTP property of Xan&#8208;OR series with planar skeletons. It explored a new way to promote the development of flexible RTP crystals, by modulation of aggregated structures as well as rational distribution of intermolecular interactions.

Abstract
Morphology optimization is critical for achieving high efficiency and stable bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, we propose the use of 3,5&#8208;dichlorobromobenzene (DCBB) with high volatility and low cost to manipulate evolution of the BHJ morphology and improve the operability and photostability of OSCs. Systematic simulations reveal the charge distribution of DCBB and its non&#8208;covalent interaction with the active layer materials. The addition of DCBB can effectively tune the aggregation of PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl during film formation, resulting in a favorable phase separation and a reinforced molecular packing. As a result, we obtain a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.2% (certified as 19.0% by the National Institute of Metrology) for DCBB&#8208;processed PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based OSCs, which is the highest reported value for binary OSCs. Importantly, the DCBB&#8208;processed devices exhibit superior photostability and have thus considerable application potential in the printing of large&#8208;area devices, demonstrating outstanding universality in various BHJ systems. Our study provides a facile approach to control the BHJ morphology and enhance the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

Abstract
T cell immunotherapy offers outstanding advantages in the treatment of various diseases, and with the selection of appropriate targets, efficient disease treatment can be achieved. T cell immunotherapy has made great progress, but clinical results show that only a small proportion of patients can benefit from T&#8208;cell immunotherapy. The extensive mechanistic work outlines a blueprint for using T cells as a new option for immunotherapy, but also presents new challenges, including the balance between different fractions of T cells, the inherent T cell suppression patterns in the disease microenvironment, the acquired loss of targets, and the decline of T cell viability. The diversity, flexibility, and intelligence of nanomedicines give them great potential for enhancing T&#8208;cell immunotherapy. Here, we discuss how T&#8208;cell immunotherapy strategies can be adapted with different nanomaterials to enhance therapeutic efficacy. For two different pathological states, immunosuppression and immune activation, we summarize recent advances in nanomedicines for T&#8208;cell immunotherapy in diseases such as cancers, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, ulcerative colitis and diabetes. With a focus on T&#8208;cell immunotherapy, this review highlights the outstanding advantages of nanomedicines in disease treatment, and helps advance our understanding of the use of nanotechnology to enhance T cell immunotherapy.

         <title>Electrochemical Biomass Upgrading Coupled with Hydrogen Production under Industrial&#8208;level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As promising hydrogen energy carrier, formic acid (HCOOH) plays the indispensable roles in building a complete industry chain of a hydrogen economy. Currently, the biomass upgrading assisted water electrolysis has emerged as an attractive alternative for co&#8208;producing green HCOOH and H2 in a cost&#8208;effective manner, yet simultaneously affording high current density and Faradaic efficiency (FE) still remains a big challenge. Here we report a ternary NiVRu&#8208;layered double hydroxides (LDHs) nanosheet arrays for selective glycerol oxidation and hydrogen evolution catalysis, which yields an industry&#8208;level 1 A cm&#8722;2 at voltage of 1.933&#160;V, meanwhile showing considerable HCOOH and H2 productivities of 12.5 and 17.9&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, with FEs of almost 80% and 96%, respectively. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the introduced Ru atoms could tune the local electronic structure of Ni&#8208;based LDHs, which not only optimizes hydrogen adsorption kinetics for HER, but also reduces the reaction energy barrier for both the conversion of NiII into GOR&#8208;active Ni&#1064; and carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) bond cleavage. In short, this work highlights the potential of large&#8208;scale H2 and HCOOH productions from integrated electrocatalytic system, and provides new insights for designing advanced electrocatalyst for low&#8208;cost and sustainable energy conversion.

         <title>Tunable Interfacial Charge Transfer in 2D&#8208;2D Composite for Efficient Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 conversion for hydrocarbon fuel production has been known as one of the most promising strategies for achieving carbon neutrality. Yet, its conversion efficiency remains unsatisfactory mainly due to its severe charge transfer resistance and slow charge kinetics. Herein, we demonstrate tunable interfacial charge transfer on oxygen vacancies modified bismuth molybdate nanoflower assembled by two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanosheets (BMOVs) and 2D bismuthene composite (Bi/BMOVs) for photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Specifically, the meticulous design of the Ohmic contact formed between BMOVs and bismuthene can allow the modulation of the interfacial charge transfer resistance. According to the density functional theory (DFT) simulations, it is ascertained that such exceptional charge kinetics is attributed to the tunable built&#8208;in electric field (IEF) of the Ohmic contact. As such, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance of the optimized Bi/BMOVs (CO and CH4 productions rate of 169.93 and 4.65&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively) is ca. 10 times higher than that of the pristine BMO (CO and CH4 productions rate of 16.06 and 0.51&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively). The tunable interfacial resistance of the Ohmic contact reported in this work can shed some important light on the design of highly efficient photocatalysts for both energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Wood&#8208;derived continuously oriented three&#8208;phase interfacial channels for high&#8208;performance quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state alkaline zinc batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although recently developed hybrid zinc (Zn) batteries integrate the benefits of both alkaline Zn and Zn&#8211;air batteries, the kinetics of the electrocatalytic oxygen reaction and mass transfer of the electrolyte, which are limited by the mismatched and disordered multiphase reaction's interfacial transfer channels, considerably inhibit the performance of hybrid Zn batteries. In this study, we developed novel, continuously oriented three&#8208;phase interfacial channels at the cathode derived from the natural structure of pine wood to address these challenges. A pine wood chip was carbonized and asymmetrically loaded with a hydrophilic active material to achieve the creation of a wood&#8208;derived cathode that integrated the active material, current collector, and continuously oriented three&#8208;phase reaction interfacial channels, which allowed the reaction dynamics to be accelerated. Consequently, the assembled quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state hybrid battery performs an extra charge&#8208;discharge process beyond that performed by a typical Ni&#8211;Zn battery, resulting in a wide operating voltage range of 0.6&#8211;2.0&#160;V and a superior specific capacity of 656.5 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, in addition to an excellent energy density (644.7&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1) and good durability. The approximately 370% capacity improvement relative to a Ni&#8211;Zn battery alone makes our hybrid battery one of the best&#8208;performing alkaline Zn batteries.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Formation of Stable Mononuclear Cu(I)Cl Species on Carbon for Low&#8208;Footprint Vinyl Chloride Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Copper catalysts are attractive candidates for Hg&#8208;free vinyl chloride (VCM) production via acetylene hydrochlorination due to their non&#8208;toxic nature and high stability. However, the optimal architecture for Cu&#8208;based catalysts at the nanoscale is not yet fully understood. To address this gap, we modified the metal precursor and the annealing temperature to prepare copper nanoparticles or single atoms, either in chlorinated or ligand&#8208;free form, on an unmodified carbon support. Evaluation in the reaction reveals a remarkable convergence of the performance of all materials to the stable VCM productivity of the single&#8208;atom catalyst. In&#8208;depth characterization by advanced microscopy, quasi in situ and operando spectroscopy, and simulations uncover a reaction&#8208;induced formation of low&#8208;valent, single atom Cu(I)Cl site motif, regardless of the initial nanostructure.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper catalysts are attractive candidates for Hg-free vinyl chloride (VCM) production via acetylene hydrochlorination due to their non-toxic nature and high stability. However, the optimal architecture for Cu-based catalysts at the nanoscale is not yet fully understood. To address this gap, we modified the metal precursor and the annealing temperature to prepare copper nanoparticles or single atoms, either in chlorinated or ligand-free form, on an unmodified carbon support. Evaluation in the reaction reveals a remarkable convergence of the performance of all materials to the stable VCM productivity of the single-atom catalyst. In-depth characterization by advanced microscopy, quasi in situ and operando spectroscopy, and simulations uncover a reaction-induced formation of low-valent, single atom Cu(I)Cl site motif, regardless of the initial nanostructure. Various surface oxygen groups promote nanoparticle redispersion by stabilizing single atom CuCl&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; species. The anchoring site structure does not strongly influence the acetylene adsorption energy or the crucial role they play in stabilizing key reaction intermediates. A life-cycle assessment demonstrates the potential environmental benefits of copper catalysts over state-of-the-art alternatives. Our work contributes to a better understanding of optimal metal speciation and highlights the sustainability of Cu-based catalysts for VCM production.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Self&#8208;Healing Soft Composite Network with Unprecedented Crack Propagation Resistance Enabled by Supramolecular Assembled Lamellar Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Soft self&#8208;healing materials are compelling candidates for stretchable devices because of their excellent compliance, extensibility, and self&#8208;restorability. However, most existing soft self&#8208;healing polymers suffer from crack propagation and irreversible fatigue failure due to easy breakage of their dynamic amorphous low&#8208;energy polymer networks. Herein, inspired by distinct structure&#8208;property relationship of biological tissues, we propose a supramolecular interfacial assembly strategy of preparing soft self&#8208;healing composites with unprecedented crack propagation resistance by structurally engineering preferentially&#8208;aligned lamellar structures within dynamic and super&#8208;stretchable poly(urea&#8208;ureathane) matrixes (which can be elongated to 24750&#215; its original length). Such a design affords world&#8208;record fracture energy (501.6&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), ultra&#8208;high fatigue threshold (4064.1 J m&#8722;2), and outstanding elastic restorability (dimensional recovery from 13 times elongation), and preserving low modulus (1.2&#160;MPa), high stretchability (3200%), high room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing efficiency (97%). Thereby, the resultant composite represents the best of its kind and even surpasses most natural biological tissues. The lamellar MXene (2D transition metal carbide/carbonitride) structure also leads to a relatively high in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity, enabling composite as stretchable thermo&#8208;conductive skins applied in joints of robotics to enable thermal dissipation. The present work illustrates a viable approach how autonomous self&#8208;healing, crack tolerance and fatigue resistance can be merged in future material design.

         <title>Ablation of Gap Junction Protein Improves the Efficiency of Nanozyme&#8208;Mediated Catalytic/Starvation/Mild&#8208;Temperature Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mediated tumor catalytic therapy is typically hindered by gap junction proteins that form cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell channels to remove cytotoxic ROS, thereby protecting tumor cells from oxidative damage. Herein, a multifunctional nanozyme, FePGOGA, is designed and prepared by Fe(III)&#8208;mediated oxidative polymerization (FeP), followed by glucose oxidase (GOx) and GAP19 co&#8208;loading through electrostatic and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. The FePGOGA nanozyme exhibits excellent cascade peroxidase&#8208; and glutathione&#8208;oxidase&#8208;like activities that efficiently catalyze hydrogen peroxide conversion to hydroxyl radicals and convert reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione disulfide. The loaded GOx starves the tumors and aggravates tumor oxidative stress through glucose decomposition, while GAP19 peptides block the hemichannels by inducing degradation of Cx43, thus increasing the accumulation of intracellular ROS, and decreasing the transport of intracellular glucose. Furthermore, the ROS reacts with primary amines of heat shock proteins to destroy their structure and function, enabling tumor photothermal therapy at the widely sought&#8208;after mild temperature (mildPTT, &#8804;45&#176;C). In vivo experiments demonstrate the significant anti&#8208;tumor effects of FePGOGA on cal27 xenograft tumors under near&#8208;infrared light irradiation. This study demonstrates the successful ablation of gap junction proteins to overcome resistance to ROS&#8208;mediated therapy, providing a regulator to suppress tumor self&#8208;preservation during tumor starvation, catalytic therapy, and mildPTT.

         <title>2,2&#8208;Azodi(2&#8208;Methylbutyronitrile)&#8208;coordinated Intermediate Phase Engineering for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Sequential deposition has been widely employed to modulate the crystallization of perovskite solar cells because it can avoid the formation of nucleation centers and even initial crystallization in the precursor solution. However, challenges remain in overcoming the incomplete and random transformation of PbI2 films with organic ammonium salts. Herein, a unique intermediate phase engineering strategy has been developed by simultaneously introducing 2,2&#8208;Azodi(2&#8208;Methylbutyronitrile) (AMBN) to both PbI2 and ammonium salt solutions to regulate perovskite crystallization. AMBN not only coordinated with PbI2 to form a favorably mesoporous PbI2 film due to the coordination between Pb2+ and the cyano group (C&#2301;N), but also suppressed the vigorous activity of FA+ ions by interacting with FAI, leading to the full PbI2 transformation with the preferred orientation. Therefore, perovskites with favorable facet orientations were obtained, and the defects were largely suppressed owing to the passivation of uncoordinated Pb2+ and FA+. As a result, a champion power conversion efficiency over 25% with a stabilized efficiency of 24.8% was achieved. Moreover, the device exhibited an improved operational stability, retaining 96% of initial power conversion efficiency under 1000&#8208;h continuous white light illumination with an intensity of 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at approximately 55&#176;C in N2 atmosphere.

         <title>Recent Progress for Concurrent Realization of Shuttle&#8208;Inhibition and Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have become one of the most promising new&#8208;generation energy storage systems owing to their ultrahigh energy density (2675&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, their practical applications are seriously impeded by the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPS), and the uncontrolled dendrites growth of metallic Li, which result in rapid capacity fading and battery safety problems. A systematic and comprehensive review of the cooperative combination effect and tackling the fundamental problems in terms of cathode and anode synchronously is still lacking. Herein, for the first time, the strategies for inhibiting shuttle behavior and dendrite&#8208;free Li&#8208;S batteries simultaneously are summarized and classified into three parts, including &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; S&#8208;cathode and Li&#8208;anode host materials toward Li&#8208;S full cell, &#8220;two birds with one stone&#8221; modified functional separators, and tailoring electrolyte for stabilizing sulfur and lithium electrodes. This review also emphasizes the fundamental Li&#8208;S chemistry mechanism and catalyst principles for improving electrochemical performance; advanced characterization technologies to monitor real&#8208;time LiPS evolution are also discussed in detail. The problems, perspectives, and challenges with respect to inhibiting the shuttle effect and dendrite growth issues as well as the practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries are also proposed.

         <title>Brightening Blue Photoluminescence in Non&#8208;emission MOF&#8208;2 by Pressure Treatment Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As equally essential as the synthesis of new materials, manoeuvring new structure configurations can endow the brand&#8208;new functional properties to existing materials, which is also one of the core goals in the synthesis community. In this respect, pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) that triggers photoluminescence (PL) in non&#8208;emission materials is an emerging stimuli&#8208;responsive smart materials technology. In the PIE paradigms, harvesting bright PL at ambient conditions, however, has remained elusive. Herein, we report a remarkable PIE phenomenon in initially non&#8208;emission MOF&#8208;2, which shows bright blue&#8208;emission at 455&#160;nm under pressure. Intriguingly, the bright blue PL with an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield up to 70.4% is unprecedentedly retained to ambient conditions upon decompression from 16.2&#160;GPa. The detailed structural analyses combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that hydrogen bonding cooperativity effect elevates powerfully the rotational barrier of the linker rotor to 3.87&#160;eV/mol from initial 0.91&#160;eV/mol through pressure treatment. The downgrade rotational freedom turns on PL of MOF&#8208;2 after releasing pressure completely. This is the first case of harvesting PIE to ambient conditions. Our findings offer a new platform for the creation of promising alternatives to high&#8208;performance PL materials based on initially non&#8208;emission counterparts.

Herein, we report a remarkable PIE phenomenon in initially non-emission MOF-2, which shows bright blue-emission at 455&#160;nm under pressure. Intriguingly, the bright blue PL with an excellent photoluminescence quantum yield up to 70.4% is unprecedentedly retained to ambient conditions upon decompression from 16.2&#160;GPa. The detailed structural analyses combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that hydrogen bonding cooperativity effect elevates powerfully the rotational barrier of the linker rotor to 3.87&#160;eV/mol from initial 0.91&#160;eV/mol through pressure treatment. The downgrade rotational freedom turns on PL of MOF-2 after releasing pressure completely. This is the first case of harvesting PIE to ambient conditions. Our findings offer a new platform for the creation of promising alternatives to high-performance PL materials based on initially non-emission counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Clinical Validation of Wearable Piezoelectric Blood Pressure Sensor for Continuous Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wearable blood pressure sensors have recently attracted attention as healthcare devices for continuous non&#8208;invasive arterial pressure (CNAP) monitoring. However, the accuracy of wearable blood pressure (BP) monitoring devices has been controversial due to the low signal quality of sensors, the absence of an accurate transfer function to convert the sensor signals into BP values, and the lack of clinical validation regarding measurement precision. Here, we report a wearable piezoelectric blood pressure sensor (WPBPS), which achieved a high normalized sensitivity (0.062 kPa&#8722;1), fast response time (23&#160;ms) for CNAP monitoring. The transfer function of a linear regression model was designed, offering a simple solution to convert the flexible piezoelectric sensor signals into BP values. In order to verify the measurement accuracy of WPBPS, clinical trials were performed on 35 subjects aged from 20s to 80s after screening. The mean difference between the WPBPS and a commercial sphygmomanometer of 175 BP data pairs was &#8208;0.89 &#177; 6.19&#160;mmHg and &#8208;0.32 &#177; 5.28&#160;mmHg for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respectively. By building a WPBPS&#8208;embedded wristwatch, we demonstrated the potentially promising use of a convenient, portable continuous BP monitoring system for cardiovascular disease diagnosis in this study.

         <title>Jellybean Quantum Dots in Silicon for Qubit Coupling and On&#8208;Chip Quantum Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly elliptical, elongated, quantum dots&#8212;so&#8208;called jellybean quantum dots&#8212;can be used for qubit&#8211;qubit coupling over short&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate distances and alleviate crowding in scaled&#8208;up quantum processors. Such a jellybean dot is formed in a silicon&#8208;MOS quantum device and reported to support controlled charge filling and well&#8208;defined spin states for higher charge occupations, corroborating its potential for qubit&#8211;qubit couplers in quantum computing architectures.








Abstract
The small size and excellent integrability of silicon metal&#8208;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot spin qubits make them an attractive system for mass&#8208;manufacturable, scaled&#8208;up quantum processors. Furthermore, classical control electronics can be integrated on&#8208;chip, in&#8208;between the qubits, if an architecture with sparse arrays of qubits is chosen. In such an architecture qubits are either transported across the chip via shuttling or coupled via mediating quantum systems over short&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate distances. This paper investigates the charge and spin characteristics of an elongated quantum dot&#8212;a so&#8208;called jellybean quantum dot&#8212;for the prospects of acting as a qubit&#8211;qubit coupler. Charge transport, charge sensing, and magneto&#8208;spectroscopy measurements are performed on a SiMOS quantum dot device at mK temperature and compared to Hartree&#8211;Fock multi&#8208;electron simulations. At low electron occupancies where disorder effects and strong electron&#8211;electron interaction dominate over the electrostatic confinement potential, the data reveals the formation of three coupled dots, akin to a tunable, artificial molecule. One dot is formed centrally under the gate and two are formed at the edges. At high electron occupancies, these dots merge into one large dot with well&#8208;defined spin states, verifying that jellybean dots have the potential to be used as qubit couplers in future quantum computing&#160;architectures.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Reversal of Phase Segregation in Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced halide segregation is a major barrier to the implementation of mixed&#8208;halide perovskites in tandem solar cells. Increasing temperature from 125&#160;K kinetically enhances halide segregation up to 290&#160;K, but higher temperatures are found to hinder it owing to entropic remixing. Increasing the incident light intensity can also induce remixing, but this effect is transient.








Abstract
Understanding the mechanism of light&#8208;induced halide segregation in mixed&#8208;halide perovskites is essential for their application in multijunction solar cells. Here, photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to uncover how both increases in temperature and light intensity can counteract the halide segregation process. It is observed that, with increasing temperature, halide segregation in CH3NH3Pb(Br0.4I0.6)3 first accelerates toward &#8776;290&#160;K, before slowing down again toward higher temperatures. Such reversal is attributed to the trade&#8208;off between the temperature activation of segregation, for example through enhanced ionic migration, and its inhibition by entropic factors. High light intensities meanwhile can also reverse halide segregation; however, this is found to be only a transient process that abates on the time scale of minutes. Overall, these observations pave the way for a more complete model of halide segregation and aid the development of highly efficient and stable perovskite multijunction and concentrator&#160;photovoltaics.

         <title>Volumetric Printing of Thiol&#8208;Ene Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linkable Poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone): A Tunable Material Platform Serving Biomedical Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;ene cross&#8208;linkable poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#160;is introduced and the effect of the cross&#8208;link density on the networks&#8217; physico&#8208;chemical properties, volumetric printability, and biocompatibility is investigated. Notably, this is the first report on volumetric 3D&#8208;printing of polyesters and 3D&#8208;printing of the smallest features to date, for non&#8208;acrylate&#8208;based resins, is illustrated.








Abstract
Current thoroughly described biodegradable and cross&#8208;linkable polymers mainly rely on acrylate cross&#8208;linking. However, despite the swift cross&#8208;linking kinetics of acrylates, the concomitant brittleness of the resulting materials limits their applicability. Here, photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#160;networks through orthogonal thiol&#8208;ene chemistry are introduced. The step&#8208;growth polymerized networks are tunable, predictable by means of the rubber elasticity theory and it is shown that their mechanical properties are significantly improved over their acrylate cross&#8208;linked counterparts. Tunability is introduced to the materials, by altering Mc (or the molar mass between cross&#8208;links), and its effect on the thermal properties, mechanical strength and degradability of the materials is evaluated. Moreover, excellent volumetric printability is illustrated and the smallest features obtained via volumetric 3D&#8208;printing to date are reported, for thiol&#8208;ene systems. Finally, by means of in vitro and in vivo characterization of 3D&#8208;printed constructs, it is illustrated that the volumetrically 3D&#8208;printed materials are biocompatible. This combination of mechanical stability, tunability, biocompatibility, and rapid fabrication by volumetric 3D&#8208;printing charts a new path toward bedside manufacturing of biodegradable patient&#8208;specific implants.

         <title>Controllable Oxidation of ZrS2 to Prepare High&#8208;&#954;, Single&#8208;crystal m&#8208;ZrO2 for 2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controllable preparation of ultrathin monoclinic ZrO2 (m&#8208;ZrO2) single crystals (EOT&#8776;0.29 nm, EOT is equivalent oxide thickness) via thermal oxidation of ZrS2 is achieved. By using K3[Fe(CN)6] as seeding, the large&#8208;scale parent ZrS2 is easily grown. The grown m&#8208;ZrO2 presents a high dielectric constant of &#8776;19 and a breakdown voltage of &#8776;7.22 MV cm&#8722;1. Using m&#8208;ZrO2 as top gate dielectric, the MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) shows excellent device performance.








Abstract

Research on all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is currently transitioning from lab&#8208;scale fundamental study to industry&#8208;scale application research. This review provides a timely summary of the current progress on inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, analyzes their technical challenges, and outlines future research targets for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion and lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries have piqued global research interest because of their unprecedented safety and high energy density. Significant advances have been made in achieving high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity and good air stability of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs), mitigating the challenges at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, and developing feasible manufacturing processes. Along with the advances in fundamental study, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells using inorganic SSEs have been widely demonstrated, revealing their immense potential for industrialization. This review provides an overview of inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, focusing on ultrathin SSE membranes, sheet&#8208;type thick solid&#8208;state electrodes, and bipolar stacking. Moreover, several critical parameters directly influencing the energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion and lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells are outlined. Finally, perspectives on all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells are provided and specific metrics to meet certain energy density targets are specified. This review looks to facilitate the development of inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells with high energy density and excellent safety.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Regulated 2D ReSe2: A Universal Platform Boostin Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;level regulated ReSe2 nanosheets serve as the general platform to significantly advance the photocatalytic H2 evolution on various semiconductors, such as TiO2, CdS, ZnIn2S4, and C3N4. The outstanding activity is attributed to the existence of abundant Re/Se active sites and strongly coupled interface between atomic&#8208;level regulated ReSe2 and the semiconductor photocatalyst.








Abstract
Solar hydrogen (H2) generation via photocatalytic water splitting is practically promising, environmentally benign, and sustainably carbon neutral. It is important therefore to understand how to controllably engineer photocatalysts at the atomic level. In this work, atomic&#8208;level engineering of defected ReSe2 nanosheets (NSs) is reported to significantly boost photocatalytic H2 evolution on various semiconductor photocatalysts including TiO2, CdS, ZnIn2S4, and C3N4. Advanced characterizations, such as atomic&#8208;resolution aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;STEM), synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient&#8208;state surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy, and transient&#8208;state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, together with theoretical computations confirm that the strongly coupled ReSe2/TiO2 interface and substantial atomic&#8208;level active sites of defected ReSe2 NSs result in the significantly raised activity of ReSe2/TiO2. This work not only for the first time realizes the atomic&#8208;level engineering of ReSe2 NSs as a versatile platform to significantly raise the activities on different photocatalysts, but, more importantly, underscores the immense importance of atomic&#8208;level synthesis and exploration on 2D materials for energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Piezocatalytic 2D WS2 Nanosheets for Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Piezodynamic Cancer Therapy Synergized with Energy Metabolism&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezocatalytic 2D WS2 nanosheets are developed for efficient cancer treatment via ultrasound&#8208;triggered piezodynamic cancer therapy. 2D WS2 nanosheets are functionalized with mitochondrial&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphonium to significantly enhance their anticancer efficacy via mitochondria&#8208;targeted piezodynamic therapy. FX11, a potent glycolysis inhibitor that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism, is loaded into WS2 nanosheets to synergistically potentiate the piezodynamic cancer therapy.








Abstract
Piezoelectric nanomaterials that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by piezoelectric polarization under an external mechanical force have emerged as an effective platform for cancer therapy. In this study, piezoelectric 2D WS2 nanosheets are functionalized with mitochondria&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphonium (TPP) for ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted piezodynamic cancer therapy. In addition, a glycolysis inhibitor (FX11) that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism is loaded into TPP&#8208; and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;conjugated WS2 nanosheet (TPEG&#8208;WS2) to potentiate its therapeutic efficacy. Upon US irradiation, the sono&#8208;excited electrons and holes generated in the WS2 are efficiently separated by piezoelectric polarization, which subsequently promotes the production of ROS. FX11&#8208;loaded&#160;TPEG&#8208;WS2 (FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2)&#160;selectively accumulates in the mitochondria of human breast cancer cells. In addition, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 effectively inhibits the&#160;production of adenosine triphosphate . Thus, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 exhibits outstanding anticancer effects under US irradiation. An in vivo study using tumor&#8208;xenograft mice demonstrates that FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 effectively accumulated in the tumors. Its&#160;tumor accumulation is visualized using in vivo computed tomography . Notably, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 with US irradiation remarkably suppresses the tumor growth of mice without systemic toxicity. This study demonstrates that the combination of piezodynamic therapy and energy metabolism&#8208;targeted chemotherapy using mitochondria&#8208;targeting 2D WS2 is a novel strategy for the selective and effective treatment of tumors.

         <title>PIP2 Alteration Caused by Elastic Modulus and Tropism of Electrospun Scaffolds Facilitates Altered BMSCs Proliferation and Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high expression of PIP2 on the tropic fibers with low elastic modulus is the main reason for the increased potential of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The cells on random fibers or high elastic modulus aligned fibers&#160;were&#160;altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to be consistent with cells on low elastic modulus aligned fibers.








Abstract
Aligned submicron fibers have played an essential role in inducing stem cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, it is aimed to identify the differential causes of stem cell proliferation and differentiation between bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on aligned&#8208;random fibers with different elastic modulus, and to change the differential levels through a regulatory mechanism mediated by B&#8208;cell lymphoma 6 protein(BCL&#8208;6) and miRNA&#8208;126&#8208;5p(miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p). The results showed that phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate alterations are found in the aligned fibers compared with the random fibers, which has a regular and oriented structure, excellent cytocompatibility, regular cytoskeleton, and high differentiation potential. The same trend is actual for the aligned fibers with a lower elastic modulus. The level of proliferative differentiation genes in cells is altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to make the cell distribution nearly consistent with the cell state on low elastic modulus aligned fibers. This work demonstrates the reason for the difference of cells between the two kinds of fibers and on fibers with different elastic modulus. These findings provide more insights for understanding the gene&#8208;level regulation of cell growth in tissue engineering.

&lt;p&gt;The high expression of PIP2 on the tropic fibers with low elastic modulus is the main reason for the increased potential of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The cells on random fibers or high elastic modulus aligned fibers&#160;were&#160;altered by BCL-6 and miR-126-5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to be consistent with cells on low elastic modulus aligned fibers.

         <title>13% Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells based on Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers with Pendent Y&#8208;Series Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regular and random double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with pendent Y&#8208;series acceptors are designed and synthesized, in which the random copolymer provides a high efficiency of 13.02% compared to the regular polymer with an efficiency of 2.75% in single&#8208;component organic solar cells.








Abstract
Double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with pendent electron acceptors, including fullerene, rylene diimides, and nonfused acceptors, have been developed for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with efficiencies approaching 10%. In this work, Y&#8208;series electron acceptors have been firstly incorporated into double&#8208;cable polymers in order to further improve the efficiencies of SCOSCs. A highly crystalline Y&#8208;series acceptor based on quinoxaline core and the random copolymerized strategy are used to optimize the ambipolar charge transport&#160;and the nanophase separation of the double&#8208;cable polymers. As a result, an efficiency of 13.02% is obtained in the random double&#8208;cable polymer, representing the highest performance in SCOSCs, while the regular double&#8208;cable polymer only provides a low efficiency of 2.75%. The significantly enhanced efficiencies are attributed to higher charge carrier mobilities, better ordering conjugated backbones and Y&#8208;series acceptors in random double&#8208;cable polymers.

         <title>Fibro&#8208;Gel: An All&#8208;Aqueous Hydrogel Consisting of Microfibers with Tunable Release Profile and its Application in Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable fibro&#8208;gel with controllable physicochemical properties and tunable drug release rates is demonstrated. The release of distinct drugs at different rates from fibro&#8208;gels can accelerate wound healing with high efficiency. These properties enable precise tailoring of the fibro&#8208;gel for potential applications, such as in situ tissue engineering.








Abstract
Injectable hydrogels are valuable tools in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their unique advantages of injectability with minimal invasiveness and usability for irregularly shaped sites. However, it remains challenging to achieve scalable manufacturing together with matching physicochemical properties and on&#8208;demand drug release for a high level of control over biophysical and biomedical cues to direct endogenous cells. Here, the use of an injectable fibro&#8208;gel is demonstrated, a water&#8208;filled network of entangled hydrogel microfibers, whose physicochemical properties and drug release profiles can be tailored to overcome these shortcomings. This fibro&#8208;gel exhibits favorable in vitro biocompatibility and the capability to aid vascularization. The potential use of the fibro&#8208;gel for advancing tissue regeneration is explored with a mice excision skin model. Preliminary in vivo tests indicate that the fibro&#8208;gel promotes wound healing and new healthy tissue regeneration at a faster rate than a commercial gel. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the release of distinct drugs at different rates can further accelerate wound healing with higher efficiency, by using a two&#8208;layer fibro&#8208;gel model. The combination of injectability and tailorable properties of this fibro&#8208;gel offers a promising approach in biomedical fields such as therapeutic delivery, medical dressings, and 3D tissue scaffolds for tissue engineering.

         <title>Next&#8208;generation Photodetectors Beyond van der Waals Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With the continuous advancement of nano&#8208;fabrication techniques, development of novel materials, and discovery of useful manipulation mechanisms in high&#8208;performance applications, especially photodetectors, the morphology of junction devices and the way junction devices are used have been fundamentally revolutionised. Simultaneously, new types of photodetectors that do not rely on any junction, providing high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and multidimensional modulation, have also emerged. This review outlines a unique category of material systems supporting novel junction devices for high&#8208;performance detection, namely the van der Waals materials, and systematically discusses new trends in the development of various types of devices beyond junctions. This field is far from mature and there are numerous methods to correctly measure and evaluate photodetectors. Therefore, we also aim to provide a solution from the perspective of applications in this review. Finally, based on the insight into the unique properties of the material systems and the underlying microscopic mechanisms, emerging trends in junction devices are discussed, a new morphology of photodetectors is proposed, and some potential innovative directions in the subject area are suggested.

         <title>Programmable Tissue Folding Patterns in Structured Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Folding of mucosal tissues, such as within the epithelium of the upper respiratory airways, is critical for organ function. Studying the influence of folded tissue patterns on cellular function is challenging mainly due to the lack of suitable cell culture platforms that can recreate dynamic tissue folding in vitro. Here, we describe a bilayer hydrogel folding system composed of alginate/polyacrylamide double network (DN) and hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels to generate static folding patterns based on mechanical instabilities. By encapsulating human fibroblasts into patterned HA hydrogels, human bronchial epithelial cells formed a folded pseudostratified monolayer. Using micromagnetic particles, DN hydrogels reversibly folded into pre&#8208;defined patterns and enabled programmable on&#8208;demand folding of cell&#8208;laden hydrogel systems upon applying a magnetic field. This hydrogel construct provides a dynamic culture system for mimicking tissue folding in vitro, which is extendable to other cell types and organ systems.

A dynamic conformal interlayer with the reversible phase&#8208;changeable feature is developed. This interlayer (P&#8208;P&#8208;I) comprises PCL polymer skeleton, PC cosolvent, and LiTFSI salt, exhibiting high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S&#160;cm&#8722;1, strong adhesion bonding (250 N pulling&#8208;out resistance), and reversible phase&#8208;change property, disengaging Li&#8208;SSBs from pressure dependence and solving the issue of SSE/Li interfacial morphological degeneration.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries (Li&#8208;SSBs) are one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their high energy densities. However, under insufficient pressure constraints (&lt;MPa&#8208;level), Li&#8208;SSBs usually exhibit poor electrochemical performances owing to the continuous interfacial degradation between the solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) and electrodes. Herein, a phase&#8208;changeable interlayer is developed to construct the self&#8208;adhesive and dynamic conformal electrode/SSE contact in Li&#8208;SSBs. The strong adhesive and cohesive strengths of the phase&#8208;changeable interlayer enable Li&#8208;SSBs to resist up to 250 N pulling force (=1.9&#160;MPa), affording Li&#8208;SSBs ideal interfacial integrality even without extra stack pressure. Remarkably, this interlayer exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1, attributed to the shortened steric solvation hindrance and optimized Li+ coordination structure. Furthermore, the changeable phase property of the interlayer endows Li&#8208;SSBs with a healable Li/SSE interface, accommodating the stress&#8211;strain evolution of the lithium metal and constructing the dynamic conformal interface. Consequently, the contact impedance of the modified solid symmetric cell exhibits a pressure&#8208;independent manner and does not increase over 700&#160;h (0.2&#160;MPa). The LiFePO4 pouch cell with the phase&#8208;changeable interlayer shows 85% capacity retention after 400 cycles at a low pressure of 0.1&#160;MPa.

&lt;p&gt;A dynamic conformal interlayer with the reversible phase-changeable feature is developed. This interlayer (P-P-I) comprises PCL polymer skeleton, PC cosolvent, and LiTFSI salt, exhibiting high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, strong adhesion bonding (250 N pulling-out resistance), and reversible phase-change property, disengaging Li-SSBs from pressure dependence and solving the issue of SSE/Li interfacial morphological degeneration.

         <title>Anisotropic Excitons Reveal Local Spin Chain Directions in a van der Waals Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, sharp exciton resonances in antiferromagnet NiPS3 have been reported to correlate with magnetic order. It is found that the polarization of maximal exciton emission in NiPS3 rotate locally, revealing three possible spin chain directions. This discovery establishes a new understanding of the antiferromagnetic order hidden in previous neutron scattering and optical experiments.








Abstract
A long&#8208;standing pursuit in materials science is to identify suitable magnetic semiconductors for integrated information storage, processing, and transfer. Van der Waals magnets have brought forth new material candidates for this purpose. Recently, sharp exciton resonances in antiferromagnet NiPS3 have been reported to correlate with magnetic order, that is, the exciton photoluminescence intensity diminishes above the N&#233;el temperature. Here, it is found that the polarization of maximal exciton emission rotates locally, revealing three possible spin chain directions. This discovery establishes a new understanding of the antiferromagnet order hidden in previous neutron scattering and optical experiments. Furthermore, defect&#8208;bound states are suggested as an alternative exciton formation mechanism that has yet to be explored in NiPS3. The supporting evidence includes chemical analysis, excitation power, and thickness dependent photoluminescence and first&#8208;principles calculations. This mechanism for exciton formation is also consistent with the presence of strong phonon side bands. This study shows that anisotropic exciton photoluminescence can be used to read out local spin chain directions in antiferromagnets and realize multi&#8208;functional devices via spin&#8208;photon transduction.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Induced Chirality&#8208;Selective Routing of Valley Photons via Metallic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chirality&#8208;selective routing of valley photons is demonstrated in Au/WS2 hybrid nanostructures. The electron beam can locally excite valley excitons and affect the coupling between excitons and nanostructures, which further controls the interference of multipolar electric modes. The separation degree can be altered by steering the electron beam, showing the capability of routing valley photons in the far field.








Abstract
Valleytronics in 2D&#160;transition metal dichalcogenides has raised a great impact in nanophotonic information processing and transport as it provides the pseudospin degree of freedom for carrier control. The imbalance of carrier occupation in inequivalent valleys can be achieved by external stimulations such as helical light and electric field. With metasurfaces, it is feasible to separate the valley exciton in real space and momentum space, which is significant for logical nanophotonic circuits. However, the control of valley&#8208;separated far&#8208;field emission by a single nanostructure is rarely reported, despite the fact that it is crucial for subwavelength research of valley&#8208;dependent directional emission. Here, it is demonstrated that the electron beam permits the chirality&#8208;selective routing of valley photons in a monolayer WS2 with Au nanostructures. The electron beam can locally excite valley excitons and regulate the coupling between excitons and nanostructures, hence controlling the interference effect of multipolar electric modes in nanostructures. Therefore, the separation degree can be modified by steering the electron beam, exhibiting the capability of subwavelength control of valley separation. This work provides a novel method to create and resolve the variation of valley emission distribution in momentum space, paving the way for the design of future nanophotonic integrated devices.

         <title>Comment on &#8220;Vapor Lubrication for Reducing Water and Ice Adhesion on Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Brushes&#8221;: Vapor Alteration Alone Reduces Water Droplet Adhesion</title>

Abstract
A reduction in lateral adhesion of water droplets on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brush surfaces exposed to various vapor conditions&#160;was&#160;recently reported. It&#160;was&#160;suggested that the mobility of droplets is due to swelling of the PDMS brushes. When changing the vapor surrounding sliding droplets on bare surfaces, a similar phenomenon is observed, presenting a much simpler explanation of the observed results.

         <title>Carbon Dots for Electroluminescent Light&#8208;emitting Diodes: Recent Progress and Future Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs), as emerging carbon nanomaterials, have been regarded as promising alternatives for electroluminescent light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their distinct characteristics, such as low toxicity, tuneable photoluminescence, and good photostability. In the last few years, despite remarkable progress achieved in CD&#8208;based LEDs, their device performance is still inferior to that of well&#8208;developed organic, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;based QDs and perovskite LEDs. To better exploit LED applications and boost device performance, in this review, we present a comprehensive overview of currently explored CDs, focusing on their key optical characteristics, which are closely related to the structural design of CDs from their carbon core to surface modifications to macroscopic structural engineering, including the embedding of CDs in the matrix or spatial arrangement of CDs. The design of CD&#8208;based LEDs for display and lighting applications based on the fluorescence, phosphorescence, and delayed fluorescence emission of CDs is also highlighted. Finally, we conclude with a discussion regarding the key challenges and plausible prospects in this field. We hope this review inspires more extensive research on CDs from a new perspective and promotes practical applications of CD&#8208;based LEDs in multiple directions of current and future research.

         <title>Giant Nonlinear Optical Response via Coherent Stacking of In&#8208;Plane Ferroelectric Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thin ferroelectric materials hold great promise for compact nonvolatile memory, nonlinear optical and optoelectronic devices. Herein, we report an ultrathin in&#8208;plane ferroelectric material that exhibits a giant nonlinear optical effect: group&#8208;IV monochalcogenide SnSe. Nanometer&#8208;scale ferroelectric domains with &#8764;90&#176;/270&#176; twin boundaries or &#8764;180&#176; domain walls are revealed in physical vapor deposited SnSe by lateral piezoresponse force microscopy. Atomic structure characterization reveals both parallel and antiparallel stacking of neighboring van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric layers, leading to ferroelectric or antiferroelectric ordering. Ferroelectric domains exhibit giant nonlinear optical activity due to coherent enhancement of second harmonic fields, and the as&#8208;resulted second&#8208;harmonic generation was observed to be 100 times more intense than monolayer WS2. This work demonstrates in&#8208;plane ferroelectric ordering and giant nonlinear optical activity in SnSe, which paves the way for applications in on&#8208;chip nonlinear optical components and nonvolatile memory devices.

         <title>Porous Metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework/ReS2 Heterojunction Phototransistor for Polarization&#8208;sensitive Visual Adaptation Emulation</title>

Abstract
Visual adaptation allows organisms to accurately perceive the external world even in dramatically changing environments, from dim starlight to bright sunlight. In particular, polarization&#8208;sensitive visual adaptation can effectively process the polarized visual information that is ubiquitous in nature. However, such an intriguing characteristic still remains to be a great challenge in the semiconductor device. Herein, a novel porous metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework phototransistor with anisotropic&#8208;ReS2&#8208;based heterojunction is demonstrated for the polarization&#8208;sensitive visual adaptation emulation. The device exhibits the intriguing polarized sensitivity and adaptive ability due to its strong anisotropic and trapping&#8208;detrapping characteristics, respectively. A series of polarization&#8208;sensitive neuromorphic behaviors like polarization&#8208;perceptual excitatory postsynaptic current, multimode adjustable dichroic ratio, and reconfigurable sensory adaption, are experimentally demonstrated through this porous heterojunction phototransistor. More importantly, with the polarization&#8208;electricity cooperation strategy, the advanced polarization&#8208;sensitive visual adaptation with strong bottom&#8208;gate control and environment dependence is successfully realized for the first time. These results represent a significant step toward the new generation of intelligent visual perception systems in autonomous navigation and human&#8208;machine interaction, etc.

         <title>Topological Spin Textures in a Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topologically protected magnetic &#8220;whirls&#8221; such as skyrmions in antiferromagnetic materials have recently attracted extensive interests due to their nontrivial band topology and potential application in antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, the room&#8208;temperature skyrmions in natural metallic antiferromagnetic materials with merit of probably conveniently electrical manipulation have not been reported. Here, we realize room&#8208;temperature skyrmions in a non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn capped with a Pt overlayer. The evolution of spin textures from coplanar inverted triangular structures to Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions is achieved via tuning the magnitude of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii &#8211; Moriya interaction. Beyond that, the temperature can induce an unconventional transition from skyrmions to antiferromagnetic meron&#8208;like spin textures at approximately 220 K in our Mn3Sn/Pt samples. Combining with the theoretical calculations, we find the transition is originated from the temperature dependence of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between kagome sublayers within the Mn3Sn crystalline unitcell. Our findings open the avenue for the development of topological spin&#8208;swirling&#8208;based antiferromagnetic spintronics.

         <title>A Superconducting Micro&#8208;Magnetometer for Quantum Vortex in Superconducting Nanoflakes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting quantum interferometer devices are important in investigating magnetic properties in quantum materials, but cannot probe micro&#8208;scale samples with small magnetic signals. Based on the superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer, the density of vortex pinning centers in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 nanoflake can be determined as 1.1 &#215; 1012 m&#8722;2. This superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer sheds light on the detection of small magnetic signals of nanoflakes.








Abstract
Superconducting quantum interferometer device (SQUID) plays a key role in understanding electromagnetic properties and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. The technological appeal of SQUID is that its detection accuracy for the electromagnetic signal can precisely reach the quantum level of a single magnetic flux. However, conventional SQUID techniques normally can only be applied to a bulky sample and do not have the capability to probe the magnetic properties of micro&#8208;scale samples with small magnetic signals. Herein, it is demonstrated that, based on a specially designed superconducting nano&#8208;hole array, the contactless detection of magnetic properties and quantized vortices in micro&#8208;sized superconducting nanoflakes is realized. An anomalous hysteresis loop and a suppression of Little&#8211;Parks oscillation are observed in the detected magnetoresistance signal, which originates from the disordered distribution of the pinned vortices in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948;. Therefore, the density of pinning centers of the quantized vortices on such micro&#8208;sized superconducting samples can be quantitatively evaluated, which is technically inaccessible for conventional SQUID detection. The superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer provides a new approach to exploring mesoscopic electromagnetic phenomena of quantum materials.

         <title>Hierarchical Superstructure of Plant Polyphenol and Arginine Surfactant for Long&#8208;Lasting and Target&#8208;Selective Antimicrobial Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial agent with anti&#8208;water washing property and broad substrate adhesion is constructed by bottom&#8211;up assembly from plant polyphenol and amino acid surfactant. The antimicrobial molecules dissociate from the secondary structure of hexagonal column by multi&#8208;stage and on&#8208;demand release to selectively kill the pathogen without generating toxicity and irritation to the normal human tissue.








Abstract
Antimicrobial agents are massively used to disinfect the pathogen contaminated surfaces since the Corona&#160;Virus&#160;Disease&#160;2019&#160;(COVID&#8208;19) outbreak. However, their defects of poor durability, strong irritation, and high environmental accumulation are exposed. Herein, a convenient strategy is developed to fabricate long&#8208;lasting and target&#8208;selective antimicrobial agent with the special hierarchical structure through bottom&#8211;up assembly of natural gallic acid with arginine surfactant. The assembly starts from rodlike micelles, further stacking into hexagonal columns and finally interpenetrating into spherical assemblies, which avoid explosive release of antimicrobial units. The assemblies show anti&#8208;water washing and high adhesion on various surfaces; and thus, possess highly efficient and broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activities even after using up to eleven cycles. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments prove that the assemblies are highly selective in killing pathogens without generating toxicity. The excellent antimicrobial virtues well satisfy the increasing anti&#8208;infection demands and the hierarchical assembly exhibits great potential as a clinical candidate.

         <title>Semiconductor Thermal and Electrical Properties Decoupled by Localized Phonon Resonances</title>

Abstract
Thermoelectric materials convert heat into electricity through thermally driven charge transport in solids, or vice versa for cooling. To be competitive with conventional energy&#8208;generation technologies, a thermoelectric material must possess the properties of both an electrical conductor and a thermal insulator.&#160;However, these properties are normally mutually exclusive because of the interconnection of the scattering mechanisms for charge carriers and phonons. Recent theoretical investigations on sub&#8208;device scales have revealed that silicon membranes covered by nanopillars exhibit a multitude of local phonon resonances, spanning the full spectrum, that couple with the heat&#8208;carrying phonons in the membrane and collectively cause a reduction in the in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity&#8722;while, in principle, not affecting the electrical properties because the nanopillars are external to the pathway of voltage generation and charge transport. Here this effect is demonstrated experimentally for the first time by investigating device&#8208;scale suspended silicon membranes with GaN nanopillars grown on the surface. The nanopillars cause up to 21&#160;% reduction in the thermal conductivity while the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient remain unaffected, thus demonstrating an unprecedented decoupling in the semiconductor's thermoelectric properties.&#160;The measured thermal conductivity behavior for coalesced nanopillars and corresponding lattice&#8208;dynamics calculations provide further evidence that the reductions are mechanistically tied to the phonon resonances. This finding breaks a longstanding trade&#8208;off between competing properties in thermoelectricity and paves the way for engineered high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state energy recovery and cooling.

         <title>Vesicular Antibodies: Shedding Light on Antibody Therapeutics with Cell Membrane Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent breakthroughs in membrane&#8208;derived vesicle nanotechnology have enabled vesicular&#8208;antibody&#8208;based therapy. By proposing the concept of vesicular antibodies, reviewing their engineering strategies and biomedical applications, and highlighting their unique advantages, this perspective intends to provide new insights on the development of vesicular antibodies.








Abstract
The high stability of antibodies and their ability to precisely bind to antigens and endogenous immune receptors, as well as their susceptibility to protein engineering, enable antibody&#8208;based therapeutics to be widely applied in cancer, inflammation, infection, and other disorders. Nevertheless, the application of traditional antibody&#8208;based therapeutics has certain limitations, such as high price, limited permeability, and protein engineering complexity. Recent breakthroughs in cell membrane nanotechnology have deepened the understanding of the critical role of membrane protein receptors in disease treatment, enabling vesicular&#8208;antibody&#8208;based therapeutics. Here, the concept of vesicular antibodies that are obtained by modifying target antibodies onto cell membranes for biomedical applications is proposed. Given that an antibody is basically a protein, as an extension of this concept, vesicles or membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles that use surface antibodies and protein receptors on cell membranes for biomedical applications as vesicular antibodies are defined. Furthermore, several engineering strategies for vesicular antibodies are summarized and how vesicular antibodies can be used in a variety of situations is highlighted. In addition, current challenges and future prospects of vesicular antibodies are also discussed. It is anticipated this perspective will provide new insights on the development of next&#8208;generation antibodies for enhanced therapeutics.

         <title>High&#8208;Gain of NdIII Complex Doped Optical Waveguide Amplifiers at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m Wavelengths Based on Intramolecular Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on intramolecular energy transfer mechanism, high gains of 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m are achieved simultaneously in complex Nd (TTA)3(XPO)&#8208;doped polymer waveguides by utilizing light&#8208;emitting diodes(LEDs) rather than semiconductor lasers as pumping sources. The novel complex is a high&#8208;gain material that can be easily spin&#8208;coated on different types of waveguides and is expected to have a critical role in planar photonic integration.








Abstract
Chelate phosphine oxide ligand (9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;xanthene&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl) bis (diphenylphosphineoxide) (XPO) is prepared as a neutral ligand to synthesize complex Nd (TTA)3 (XPO) (TTA = 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone). An appropriate energy gap between the XPO and TTA ligands, which can support two additional energy transfer routines from the first excited triplet state (T1) energy level of the XPO to that of the TTA, improves energy transfer in the Nd complex. Based on intramolecular energy transfer mechanism, optical gains at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m are demonstrated in Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped polymer waveguides with the excitation of low&#8208;power light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) instead of semiconductor lasers as pump sources. Using the vertical top&#8208;pumping mode of a 365&#160;nm LED, relative gains of 22.5 and 8.4&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1 are obtained at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m, respectively, in a 0.2 cm long embedded waveguide with a cross&#8208;section of 8&#160;&#215;&#160;5&#160;&#181;m2. The active core layer is Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped SU&#8208;8 polymer. Moreover, relative gains are achieved in evanescent&#8208;field waveguide with a cross&#8208;section of 6&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;&#181;m2. The 21.0 and 5.6&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1 relative gains are achieved at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#181;m, respectively, with a net gain of 13.8&#160;&#177;&#160;0.3&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1 obtained at 1.06&#160;&#181;m in a 0.9 cm long SU&#8208;8 waveguide with Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped polymethylmethacrylate as upper cladding.

NiSx&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2/Ni is elaborately designed for the efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to valuable 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), along with green hydrogen production. The reaction path and mechanism are comprehensively understood by ex/in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, and the high&#8208;valence Ni2+&#948; is identified as the real active species.








Abstract
An efficient NiSx&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrode is reported for the selective oxidation reaction of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) with excellent electrocatalytic 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) selectivity (99.4%), conversion (97.7%), and Faradaic efficiency (98.3%). The decoration of NiSx will evoke high&#8208;valence Ni2+&#948; species in the reconstructed &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrode, which are the real active species for HMFOR. The generated NiSx/Ni(OH)O modulates the proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer (PCET) process of HMFOR, where the electrocatalytically generated Ni(OH)O can effectively trap the protons from the CHO&#63743; end in HMF to realize electron transfer. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) competes with the HMFOR when NiSx/Ni(OH)O continues to accumulate, to generate the NiSx/NiOx(OH)y intermediate. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results verify that the adsorption energy of HMF can be optimized through the increased NiSx composition for more efficient capture of protons and electrons in the HMFOR.

         <title>Enhanced Moisture Stability of Lithium&#8208;Rich Antiperovskites for Sustainable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hygroscopicity of lithium&#8208;rich antiperovskites (LiRAPs) is successfully suppressed by weakening the intermolecular hydrogen bond between LiRAPs and H2O with fluorine doping. Based on the high moisture resistivity and the low melting point of LiRAPs, two prototypes of all ceramic lithium batteries (ACLBs) are assembled in ambient air by means of co&#8208;coating sintering and melt&#8208;infiltration, respectively.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich antiperovskites (LiRAPs) solid electrolytes have attracted extensive interest due to their advantages of structural tunability, mechanical flexibility, and low cost. However, LiRAPs are instinctively hygroscopic and suffer from decomposition in air, which not only diversifies their electrochemical performances in present reports but also hinders their application in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, the origin of the hygroscopicity, and also the effect of the hygroscopicity on the electrochemical performances of Li3&#8722;x(OHx)Cl are systematically investigated. Li3&#8722;x(OHx)Cl is demonstrated to be unstable in the air and prone to decompose into LiOH and LiCl. Nevertheless, with fluorine doping on chlorine sites, the hygroscopicity of LiRAPs is suppressed by weakening the intermolecular hydrogen bond between LiRAPs and H2O, forming a moisture&#8208;resistive Li3&#8722;x(OHx)Cl0.9F0.1. Taking advantage of its low melting point (274&#160;&#176;C), two prototypes of ASSLBs are assembled in the ambient air by means of co&#8208;coating sintering and melt&#8208;infiltration. With LiRAPs as the solder, low&#8208;temperature sintering of the ASSLBs with low interfacial resistance is demonstrated as feasible. The understanding of the hygroscopic behavior of LiRAPs and the integration of the moisture&#8208;resistive LiRAPs with ASSLBs provide an effective way toward the fabrication of the ASSLBs.

&lt;/sub&gt;)Cl&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;. Taking advantage of its low melting point (274&#160;&#176;C), two prototypes of ASSLBs are assembled in the ambient air by means of co-coating sintering and melt-infiltration. With LiRAPs as the solder, low-temperature sintering of the ASSLBs with low interfacial resistance is demonstrated as feasible. The understanding of the hygroscopic behavior of LiRAPs and the integration of the moisture-resistive LiRAPs with ASSLBs provide an effective way toward the fabrication of the ASSLBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Assisted Compressed Flux Growth: A Universal and High&#8208;Yield Method for Dimension&#8208;Controlled Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;yield crystal growth method utilizing a polymer flux in a compressed growth space is invented to cast molecules or precursors into dimension&#8208;defined single crystals. This compressed flux growth is universally applicable to various materials and scalable to mass production, and the grown single crystals can be directly integrated into electronic devices.








Abstract
Single crystals possess the most perfect and stable morphology and represent the intrinsic and upper limits of performance when integrated into various application scenarios. However, for a large portion of the newly emerging low&#8208;dimensional and molecular materials, the mass production of crystals with a desirable shape is still challenging. Here, a universal and high&#8208;yield method to grow functional single crystals with controlled dimensions is provided that can be directly integrated into a device. By utilizing a polymeric flux in combination with a compressed growth space, numerous materials can be grown into size&#8208;controllable single crystalline flakes, with millions produced in one batch. This scalable growth method shows promise for the large&#8208;scale integration of micro&#8208;single&#8208;crystals as functional components, as exemplified by the construction of a 5 in. field&#8208;effect transistor array.

         <title>Formation and Applications in Electronic Devices of Lattice&#8208;Aligned Gallium Oxynitride Nanolayer on Gallium Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ &#8220;oxidation&#8211;reconfiguration&#8221; process is developed to form lattice&#8208;aligned gallium oxynitride (GaON) epitaxial nanolayer on gallium nitride (GaN) substrate. Two metastable GaON phases are formed through oxygen segregation following kinetic&#8211;thermodynamic reaction pathways. The GaN&#8208;derived GaON nanolayer is a tailored structure for surface reinforcement and can be leveraged to enhance the performance of GaN&#8208;based devices in various applications.








Abstract
Gallium nitride (GaN), a promising alternative semiconductor to Si, is widely used in photoelectronic and electronic technologies. However, the vulnerability of the GaN surface is a critical restriction that hinders the development of GaN&#8208;based devices, especially in terms of device stability and reliability. In this study, this challenge is overcome by converting the GaN surface into a gallium oxynitride (GaON) epitaxial nanolayer through an in situ two&#8208;step &#8220;oxidation&#8211;reconfiguration&#8221; process. The O plasma treatment overcomes the chemical inertness of the GaN surface, and sequential thermal annealing manipulates the kinetic&#8211;thermodynamic reaction pathways to create a metastable GaON nanolayer with a wurtzite lattice. The GaN&#8208;derived GaON nanolayer is a tailored structure for surface reinforcement and possesses several advantages, including a wide bandgap, high thermodynamic stability, and large valence band offset with a GaN substrate. These physical properties can be further leveraged to enhance the performance of GaN&#8208;based devices in various applications, such as power systems, complementary logic integrated circuits, photoelectrochemical water splitting, and ultraviolet photoelectric&#160;conversion.

         <title>In Situ Fabrication of Benzoquinone Crystal Layer on the Surface of Nest&#8208;Structural Ionohydrogel for Flexible &#8220;All&#8208;in&#8208;One&#8221; Supercapattery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzoquinone crystal&#8211;gel interface (CGI) membrane is fabricated on the surface of nest&#8208;structural ionohydrogel through the in situ electrochemical deposition of benzoquinone. Thus, an integrated CGI&#8208;gel platform with a middle body as electrolyte and the surficial redox&#8208;active CGI membrane for electrochemical energy conversion and storage is achieved. This CGI&#8208;gel platform greatly simplifies the fabrication of flexible energy&#8208;storage devices and dramatically improves its electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Flexible energy&#8208;storage devices lay the foundation for a convenient, advanced, fossil fuel&#8208;free society. However, the fabrication of flexible energy&#8208;storage devices remains a tremendous challenge due to the intrinsic dissimilarities between electrode and electrolyte. In this study, a strategy is proposed for fabricating a flexible electrode and electrolyte entirely inside a matrix. First, a nest&#8208;structural and redox&#8208;active ionohydrogel with excellent stretchability (up to 3000%) and conductivity (167.9 mS cm&#8722;1) is designed using a hydrated ionic liquid (HIL) solvent and chemical foaming strategy. The nest&#8208;structure ionohydrogel provides sufficient &#8220;highways&#8221; and &#8220;service area&#8221;, and the cation in HIL facilitates the reaction, transportation, and deposition of benzoquinone. Subsequently, in situ, a novel benzoquinone crystal&#8211;gel interface (CGI) is in situ fabricated on the surface of the ionohydrogel through electrochemical deposition of benzoquinone. Thus, an integrated CGI&#8208;gel platform is successfully achieved with a middle body as an electrolyte and the surficial redox&#8208;active CGI membrane for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Based on the CGI&#8208;gel platform, an extreme simple and effective &#8220;stick&#8208;to&#8208;use&#8221; strategy is proposed for constructing flexible energy&#8208;storage devices and then a series of flexible supercapatteries are fabricated with high stretchability and capacitance (5222.1 mF cm&#8722;2 at 600% strain), low self&#8208;discharge and interfacial resistance and a wearable, self&#8208;power and intelligent display.

         <title>Elastomers Grow into Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastomer that can grow automatically and finally becomes a soft actuator is presented. The whole process does not need energy input or external stimuli other than a single pre&#8208;stretch. The growth can output mechanical work. The material has an uncommon liquid crystal phase. The formation of soft actuators is associated with a usually unnoticed reaction.








Abstract
It is common knowledge that when an elastomer (rubber) is stretched, its length will be&#160;maintained if its two ends are fixed. Here, it is serendipitously found that when&#160;an elastomer is&#160;slowly elongated further to achieve buckling under such conditions, the final length is much longer than the pre&#8208;stretched length. This allows the design&#160;of untethered autonomous synthetic&#8208;material&#8208;based soft robots that do not need any other chemical or electrical energy sources or external stimuli after the pre&#8208;strain is installed. Once the growth starts, the elongation continues to proceed even when the applied force is removed. Moreover, the elastomer, after growing, eventually forms a robust soft actuator that can be reshaped for different purposes. Few synthetic materials can grow like this, so far. This investigation shows that the material has an uncommon liquid crystal phase. Contrary to normal liquid crystals, it becomes birefringent only at high temperatures. The formation and the reshaping of the resulting soft actuators relate to a usually unnoticed reversible reaction. The work is promising to promote further understanding of dynamic covalent chemistry and liquid crystal elastomers, as well as to foster new designs and high&#8208;impact applications of bioinspired sustainable soft actuators in areas other than soft robots.

The proof&#8208;to&#8208;concept sensor structure, with high sensitivity, stability, and selectivity, is demonstrated. It is integrated to&#160;a USB interface for on&#8208;field vehicle&#8208;exhaust measurement. This work promises a new family of self&#8208;powered sensors made of III&#8211;V compound semiconductor nanostructures, for future mega&#8208;scale Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things systems.








Abstract
The fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven an increasing consumer demand for self&#8208;powered gas sensors for real&#8208;time data collection and autonomous responses in industries such as environmental monitoring, workplace safety, smart cities, and personal healthcare. Despite intensive research and rapid progress in the field, most reported self&#8208;powered devices, specifically NO2 sensors for air pollution monitoring, have limited sensitivity, selectivity, and scalability. Here, a novel photovoltaic self&#8208;powered NO2 sensor is demonstrated based on axial p&#8211;i&#8211;n homojunction InP nanowire (NW) arrays, that overcome these limitations. The optimized innovative InP NW array device is designed by numerical simulation for insights into sensing mechanisms and performance enhancement. Without a power source, this InP NW sensor achieves an 84% sensing response to 1&#160;ppm NO2 and records a limit of detection down to the sub&#8208;ppb level, with little dependence on the incident light intensity, even under &lt;5% of 1 sun illumination. Based on this great environmental fidelity, the sensor is integrated into a commercial microchip interface to evaluate its performance in the context of dynamic environmental monitoring of motor vehicle exhaust. The results show that compound semiconductor nanowires can form promising self&#8208;powered sensing platforms suitable for future mega&#8208;scale IoT systems.

         <title>Metasurface Enabled On&#8208;Chip Generation and Manipulation of Vector Beams from Vertical Cavity Surface&#8208;Emitting Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;chip generation and manipulation of vector beams are demonstrated by monolithically integrating vectorial metasurfaces with standard vertical cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers (VCSELs). The developed approach enables a powerful tool to structure the complex wavefronts of a VCSEL in an ultracompact way, providing the access to previously unattainable both phase and polarization degrees of freedom.








Abstract
Metasurface polarization optics that consist of 2D array of birefringent nano&#8208;antennas have proven remarkable capabilities to generate and manipulate vectorial fields with subwavelength resolution and high efficiency. Integrating this new type of metasurface with the standard vertical cavity surface&#8208;emitting laser (VCSEL) platform enables an ultracompact and powerful solution to control both phase and polarization properties of the laser on a chip, which allows to structure a VCSEL into vector beams with on&#8208;demand wavefronts. Here, this concept is demonstrated by directly generating versatile vector beams from commercially available VCSELs through on&#8208;chip integration of high&#8208;index dielectric metasurfaces. Experimentally, the versatility of the approach for the development of vectorial VCSELs are validated by implementing a variety of functionalities, including directional emission of multibeam with specified polarizations, vectorial holographic display, and vector vortex beams generations. Notably, the proposed vectorial VCSELs integrated with a single layer of beam shaping metasurface bypass the requirements of multiple cascaded optical components, and thus have the potential to promote the advancements of ultracompact, lightweight, and scalable vector beams sources, enriching and expanding the applications of VCSELs in optical communications, laser manipulation and processing, information encryption, and quantum optics.

         <title>An Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Bioadhesive Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Instant Wound Sealing and Electrically Accelerated Healing in Emergencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy of instant wound sealing and electrically assisted wound healing by an ultrasound&#8208;driven bioadhesive triboelectric nanogenerator is used to treat wounds in an emergency, to avoid serving hemostasis and infection, and the electrical stimulation driven by ultrasound promotes skin wound healing significantly via cell migration and proliferation, being a potential first&#8208;aid rescue and self&#8208;help method of portable medical devices.








Abstract
A bioadhesive triboelectric nanogenerator (BA&#8208;TENG), as a first&#8208;aid rescue for instant and robust wound sealing and ultrasound&#8208;driven accelerated wound healing, is designed. This BA&#8208;TENG is fabricated with biocompatible materials, and integrates a flexible TENG as the top layer and bioadhesive as the bottom layer, resulting in effective electricity supply and strong sutureless sealing capability on wet tissues. When driven by ultrasound, the BA&#8208;TENG can produce a stable voltage of 1.50&#160;V and current of 24.20&#160;&#181;A underwater. The ex vivo porcine colon organ models show that the BA&#8208;TENG seals defects instantly (&#8776;5 s) with high interfacial toughness (&#8776;150 J m&#8722;2), while the rat bleeding liver incision model confirms that the BA&#8208;TENG performs rapid wound closure and hemostasis, reducing the blood loss by about 82%. When applied in living rats, the BA&#8208;TENG not only seals skin injuries immediately but also produces a strong electric field (E&#8208;field) of about 0.86&#160;kV m&#8722;1 stimulated by ultrasound to accelerate skin wound healing significantly. The in vitro studies confirm that these effects are attributed to the E&#8208;field&#8208;accelerated cell migration and proliferation. In addition, these TENG adhesives can be applied to not only wound treatment, nerve stimulation and regeneration, and charging batteries in implanted devices.

         <title>Conformal Volumetric Grayscale Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformal volumetric grayscale metamaterials are presented as a new class of artificially structured media capable of multiplexing electromagnetic responses as a function of frequency and incident beam form. These materials can realize new classes of multifunctional devices including conformal microwave carpet cloaks, which render an object invisible to observers for a wide range of probing frequencies and incidence angles.








Abstract
Conformal artificial electromagnetic media that feature tailorable responses as a function of incidence wavelength and angle represent universal components for optical engineering. Conformal grayscale metamaterials are introduced as a new class of volumetric electromagnetic media capable of supporting highly multiplexed responses and arbitrary, curvilinear form factors. Subwavelength&#8208;scale voxels based on irregular shapes are designed to accommodate a continuum of dielectric values, enabling the freeform design process to reliably converge to exceptionally high figures of merit (FOMs) for a given multi&#8208;objective design problem. Through additive manufacturing of ceramic&#8211;polymer composites, microwave metamaterials, designed for the radio&#8208;frequency range of 8&#8211;12&#160;GHz, are experimentally fabricated and devices with extreme dispersion profiles, an airfoil&#8208;shaped beam&#8208;steering device, and a broadband, broad&#8208;angle conformal carpet cloak, are demonstrated. It is anticipated that conformal volumetric metamaterials will lead to new classes of compact and multifunctional imaging, sensing, and communications systems.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Detection of DNA Nanostructures Using a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glass nanopores with 3&#8211;4&#160;nm diameters demonstrate super&#8208;resolution single&#8208;molecule sensing capability, which can be used to detect DNA nanostructures separated only by 18&#160;bp (&#8776;6&#160;nm). The super&#8208;resolution is attributed to the electric field enhancement at the nanopore tip and the slowdown of the&#160;DNA, with great potential for label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution DNA sequence mapping and digital information storage.








Abstract
High&#8208;resolution analysis of biomolecules has brought unprecedented insights into fundamental biological processes and dramatically advanced biosensing. Notwithstanding the ongoing resolution revolution in electron microscopy and optical imaging, only a few methods are presently available for high&#8208;resolution analysis of unlabeled single molecules in their native states. Here, label&#8208;free electrical sensing of structured single molecules with a spatial resolution down to single&#8208;digit nanometers is demonstrated. Using a narrow solid&#8208;state nanopore, the passage of a series of nanostructures attached to a freely translocating DNA molecule is detected, resolving individual nanostructures placed as close as 6&#160;nm apart and with a surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface gap distance of only 2&#160;nm. Such super&#8208;resolution ability is attributed to the nanostructure&#8208;induced enhancement of the electric field at the tip of the nanopore. This work demonstrates a general approach to improving the resolution of single&#8208;molecule nanopore sensing and presents a critical advance towards label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution DNA sequence mapping, and digital information storage independent of molecular motors.

This work demonstrates a general approach to improving the resolution of single-molecule nanopore sensing and presents a critical advance towards label-free, high-resolution DNA sequence mapping, and digital information storage independent of molecular motors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Colloid Electrolyte with Changed Li+ Solvation Structure for High&#8208;Power, Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel colloid electrolyte constructs a weak Li+ solvation environment by introducing lithium thiocarbonate colloids to coordinate with solvents and anions competitively. Thus, the Li+ conductivity, desolvation process, and configuration of the&#160;cathode electrolyte interface are optimized. The enhanced interfacial Li+ transfer kinetics endow lithium&#8208;ion batteries with excellent fast charging/discharging capability and long lifespan at room and low temperatures.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries currently suffer from low capacity and fast degradation under fast charging and/or low temperatures. In&#160;this&#160;work, a colloid liquid electrolyte (CLE) is designed, where the trace amount of lithium thiocarbonate (LTC) colloids in commercial carbonate electrolyte (1&#160;m LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate) not only boosts up &#963;Li+ but also improves the Li+ transfer kinetics at LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) cathode/electrolyte interface. The competitive coordination of LTCs with anions and solvents facilitates the dissociation of lithium salts and Li+ decoupling, dramatically enhancing the &#963;Li+ (15 to 4.5 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, respectively); meanwhile, the desolvation process is accelerated. It demonstrates that LTC colloids induce an&#160;&#8776;5&#160;nm ultrathin Li2CO3&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interface&#160;and infuse the grain boundary of NCA particles, enhancing interfacial Li+ transfer and inhibiting the particle cracks during cycling. Consequently, the Li||CLE||NCA battery delivers a maximum capacity of 135 mAh g&#8722;1 at a 10 C rate with 80% retention after 2000 cycles. Moreover, the fast&#8208;charging capability under a sub&#8208;zero environment is proved (122 mAh g&#8722;1 with 90% retention after 400 cycles at 2 C and &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C). This strategy for tailoring the interfacial charge transfer appears generalizable and can practically be extended to next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Selective Microporous Polymer Membranes with Hydrogen&#8208;Bond and Salt&#8208;Bridge Networks for Aqueous Organic Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance ion&#8208;selective polymer membranes are fabricated from blends of carboxylate&#8208; and amidoxime&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity by exploiting inter&#8208;/intrachain hydrogen&#8208;bond and salt&#8208;bridge interactions. They demonstrate fast ion conduction with low crossover of redox&#8208;active molecules, enabling improved power rating and stable cycling performance in aqueous organic redox flow batteries.








Abstract
Redox flow batteries (RFBs) have great potential for long&#8208;duration grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Ion&#8208;conducting membranes are a crucial component in RFBs, allowing charge&#8208;carrying ions to transport while preventing the cross&#8208;mixing of redox couples. Commercial Nafion membranes are widely used in RFBs, but their unsatisfactory ionic and molecular selectivity, as well as high costs, limit the performance and the widespread deployment of this technology. To extend the longevity and reduce the cost of RFB systems, inexpensive ion&#8208;selective membranes that concurrently deliver low ionic resistance and high selectivity toward redox&#8208;active species are highly desired. Here, high&#8208;performance RFB membranes are fabricated from blends of carboxylate&#8208; and amidoxime&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity, which exploit the beneficial properties of both polymers. The enthalpy&#8208;driven formation of cohesive interchain interactions, including hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, facilitates the microscopic miscibility of the blends, while ionizable functional groups within the sub&#8208;nanometer pores allow optimization of membrane ion&#8208;transport functions. The resulting microporous membranes demonstrate fast cation conduction with low crossover of redox&#8208;active molecular species, enabling improved power ratings and reduced capacity fade in aqueous RFBs using anthraquinone and ferrocyanide as redox couples.

         <title>Rational Design of Polymethine Dyes with NIR&#8208;II Emission and High Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for Multimodal&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

Polymethine dyes with second near&#8208;infrared emission and photoacoustic imaging capability are synthesized by the electronic&#8208;donor group regulation strategy, which demonstrates high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE = 81.1%) as an antitumor stategy in vivo and in vitro under the multimodal imaging guidance; theoretical calculation reveals the structure regulation mechanism for the polymethine&#8208;based phototheranostic agent to achieve an excellent PCE.








Abstract
Phototheranostics have emerged and flourished as a promising pattern for cancer theranostics owing to their precise photoinduced diagnosis and therapeutic to meet the demands of precision medicine. The diagnosis information and therapeutic effect are directly determined by the fluorescence imaging ability and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of phototheranostic agents. Hence, how to balance the competitive radiative and nonradiative processes of phototheranostic agents is the key factor to evaluate the phototheranostic effect. Herein, molecules named ICRs with high photostaibility&#160; are rationally designed, exhibiting fluorescence emission in the second near&#8208;infrared window&#160;(NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) and high PCE,&#160;which are related to the strong donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interaction and high reorganization energy&#160;Noteworthily, ICR&#8208;Qu with stronger D&#8211;A interaction and a&#160;large&#8208;sized conjugated unit encapsulated in nanoparticles exhibits high PCE (81.1%). In&#160;addition, ICR&#8208;QuNPs are used for fluorescence imaging (FLI), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), and photothermal imaging (PTI) to guide deep&#8208;tissue photonic hyperthermia, achieving precise removal and inhibition of breast cancer. Furthermore, combined with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;1, ICR&#8208;QuNPs show huge potential to be a facile and efficient tool for photo&#8208;immunotherapy. More importantly, this study not only reports an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; polymethine&#8208;based phototheranostic agent, but also sheds light on the exploration of versatile organic molecules for future practical applications.

         <title>A&#160;Reconfigurable Optoelectronic Synaptic Transistor with Stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 Nanocrystals for Visuomorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wavelength&#8208;aware transistor memory is designed by incorporating air&#8208;stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals. On&#8208;demand creation of an&#160;artificial synapse and non&#8208;volatile memory in such homogeneous phototransistor that can be quickly reconfigured for a specific purpose by adjusting the wavelength of the incident light is demonstrated.








Abstract
Reconfigurable phototransistor memory attracts considerable attention for adaptive visuomorphic computing, with highly&#160;efficient sensing, memory, and processing functions integrated onto a single device. However, developing reconfigurable phototransistor memory remains a challenge due to the lack of an&#160;all&#8208;optically controlled transition between short&#8208;term plasticity (STP) and long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP). Herein, an air&#8208;stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystal (PNC)&#8208;based phototransistor memory is designed,&#160;which&#160;is capable of broadband photoresponses. Benefitting from the different electron capture ability of Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 PNCs to 650 and 405&#160;nm light, an&#160;artificial synapse and non&#8208;volatile memory can be created on&#8208;demand and quickly reconfigured within a single device for specific purposes. Owing to the optically reconfigurable and wavelength&#8208;aware operation between STP and LTP modes, the integrated blue feature extraction and target recognition can be demonstrated in a homogeneous neuromorphic vision sensor array. This work suggests a new way in developing perovskite optoelectronic transistors for highly efficient in&#8208;sensor computing.

Benefitting from the different electron capture ability of Zr-CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PNCs to 650 and 405&#160;nm light, an&#160;artificial synapse and non-volatile memory can be created on-demand and quickly reconfigured within a single device for specific purposes. Owing to the optically reconfigurable and wavelength-aware operation between STP and LTP modes, the integrated blue feature extraction and target recognition can be demonstrated in a homogeneous neuromorphic vision sensor array. This work suggests a new way in developing perovskite optoelectronic transistors for highly efficient in-sensor computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Mott&#8208;Insulator&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Phase Transition in Ultrathin Intermediate&#8208;Spin Ferromagnetic Perovskite Ruthenates</title>

         <dc:description>
A&#160;photocarrier&#8208;doping&#8208;induced reversible Mott&#8208;insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal phase transition is realized by means of UV&#8208;light irradiation in a few atomic layers of intermediate&#8208;spin ferromagnetic SrRuO3&#8722;&#948;. Dynamical mean&#8208;field theory calculations further verify such photoinduced electronic phase transformation,&#160;owing to oxygen vacancies and orbital reconstruction. Therefore, a new intermediate&#8208;spin ferromagnetic metallic metastable phase of perovskite ruthenate is demonstrated.








Abstract
Light control of emergent quantum phenomena is a widely used external stimulus for quantum materials. Generally, perovskite strontium ruthenate SrRuO3 has an itinerant ferromagnetism with a low&#8208;spin state. However, the phase of intermediate&#8208;spin (IS) ferromagnetic metallic state has never been seen. Here, by means of UV&#8208;light irradiation, a photocarrier&#8208;doping&#8208;induced Mott&#8208;insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal phase transition is shown in a few atomic layers of perovskite IS ferromagnetic SrRuO3&#8722;&#948;. This new metastable IS metallic phase can be reversibly regulated due to the convenient photocharge transfer from SrTiO3 substrates to SrRuO3&#8722;&#948; ultrathin films. These dynamical mean&#8208;field theory calculations further verify such photoinduced electronic phase transformation, owing to oxygen vacancies and orbital reconstruction. The optical manipulation of charge&#8208;transfer finesse is an alternative pathway toward discovering novel metastable phases in strongly correlated systems and facilitates potential light&#8208;controlled device applications in optoelectronics and spintronics.

         <title>Scaled&#8208;Up Synthesis of Freestanding Molybdenum Disulfide Membranes for Nanopore Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to scale up freestanding synthesis of MoS2 sheets on 100 mm&#8208;diameter silicon wafers that have hundreds of nanoapertures is proposed. The MoS2 sheets cover the apertures to form ultrathin membranes that are useful in nanopore sensing.








Abstract
2D materials are ideal for nanopores with optimal detection sensitivity and resolution. Among these, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has gained traction as a less hydrophobic material than graphene. However, experiments using 2D nanopores remain challenging due to the lack of scalable methods for high&#8208;quality freestanding membranes. Herein, a site&#8208;directed, scaled&#8208;up synthesis of MoS2 membranes on predrilled nanoapertures on 4&#8208;inch wafer substrates with 75% yields is reported. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), which introduces sulfur and molybdenum dioxide vapors across the sub&#8208;100 nm nanoapertures results in exclusive formation of freestanding membranes that seal the apertures. Nucleation and growth near the nanoaperture edges is followed by nanoaperture decoration with MoS2, which proceeds until a critical flake curvature is achieved, after which fully spanning freestanding membranes form. Intentional blocking of reagent flow through the apertures inhibits MoS2 nucleation around the nanoapertures, promoting the formation of large&#8208;crystal monolayer MoS2 membranes. The in situ grown membranes along with facile membrane wetting and nanopore formation using dielectric breakdown enables the recording of dsDNA translocation events at an unprecedentedly high 1 MHz bandwidth. The methods presented here are important steps toward the development of scalable single&#8208;layer membrane manufacture for 2D nanofluidics and nanopore applications.

         <title>4D&#8208;Printed Soft and Stretchable Self&#8208;Folding Cuff Electrodes for Small&#8208;Nerve Interfacing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric peripheral nerve interface that can fold itself to a cuff around small nerves during the implantation is presented. This actuation property, combined with the use of stretchable materials, makes the device robust and straightforward to use. The stimulation and recording capabilities are shown on small nerves in vivo.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve interfacing (PNI) has a high clinical potential for treating various diseases, such as obesity or diabetes. However, currently existing electrodes present challenges to the interfacing procedure, which limit their clinical application, in particular, when targeting small peripheral nerves (&lt;200&#160;&#181;m). To improve the electrode handling and implantation, a nerve interface that can fold itself to a cuff around a small nerve, triggered by the body moisture during insertion, is fabricated. This folding is achieved by printing a bilayer of a flexible polyurethane printing resin and a highly swelling sodium acrylate hydrogel using photopolymerization. When immersed in an aqueous liquid, the hydrogel swells and folds the electrode softly around the nerve. Furthermore, the electrodes are robust, can be stretched (&gt;20%), and bent to facilitate the implantation due to the use of soft and stretchable printing resins as substrates and a microcracked gold film as conductive layer. The straightforward implantation and extraction of the electrode as well as stimulation and recording capabilities on a small peripheral nerve in vivo are demonstrated. It is believed that such simple and robust to use self&#8208;folding electrodes will pave the way for bringing PNI to a broader clinical application.

         <title>Widely Tunable Berry Curvature in the Magnetic Semimetal Cr1+&#948;Te2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Cr1+&#948;Te2 is shown to be a unique magnetic semimetal enabling widely tunable k&#8208;space Berry curvature near Fermi energy. The door has been opened for probing and tailoring the intertwined Berry curvature physics in real and momentum&#160;space in Cr1+&#948;Te2 epitaxial thin films and their heterostructures.








Abstract
Magnetic semimetals have increasingly emerged as lucrative platforms hosting spin&#8208;based topological phenomena in real and momentum spaces. Cr1+&#948;Te2 is a self&#8208;intercalated magnetic transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), which exhibits topological magnetism and tunable electron filling. While recent studies have explored real&#8208;space Berry curvature effects, similar considerations of momentum&#8208;space Berry curvature&#160;are lacking. Here, the electronic structure and transport properties of epitaxial Cr1+&#948;Te2 thin films are systematically investigated over a range of doping, &#948; (0.33 &#8211; 0.71). Spectroscopic experiments reveal the presence of a characteristic semi&#8208;metallic band region, which shows a rigid like energy shift with &#948;. Transport experiments show that the intrinsic component of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is sizable and undergoes a sign flip across &#948;. Finally, density functional theory calculations establish a link between the doping evolution of the band structure and AHE: the AHE sign flip is shown to emerge from the sign change of the Berry curvature, as the semi&#8208;metallic band region crosses the Fermi energy. These findings underscore the increasing relevance of momentum&#8208;space Berry curvature in magnetic TMDs and provide a unique platform for intertwining topological physics in real and momentum spaces.

         <title>A Highly Active, Long&#8208;Lived Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst Derived from Open&#8208;Framework Iridates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Open&#8208;framework iridate is employed as a pre&#8208;electrocatalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The structure undergoes an unusual crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;crystalline phase transition during OER, with ultrasmall, (200) crystal plane&#8208;oriented rutile nanocrystallites as final active phase. The resulting nanocatalyst affords high activity, while remaining greatly stable for beyond 1000 h.








Abstract
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction underpins several important electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversions, and this energy&#8208;intensive process relies industrially on iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, phase&#8208;selective synthesis of metastable strontium iridates with open&#8208;framework structure and their unexpected transformation into a highly active, ultrastable oxygen evolution nano&#8208;electrocatalyst are presented. This transformation involves two major steps: Sr2+/H+ ion exchange in acid and in situ structural rearrangement under electrocatalysis conditions. Unlike its dense perovskite&#8208;structured polymorphs, the open&#8208;framework iridates have the ability to undergo rapid proton exchange in acid without framework amorphization. The resulting protonated iridates further reconstruct into ultrasmall, surface&#8208;hydroxylated, (200) crystal plane&#8208;oriented rutile nanocatalyst, instead of the common amorphous IrOxHy phase, during acidic oxygen evolution. Such microstructural characteristics are found to benefit both the oxidation of hydroxyls and the formation of O&#63743;O bonds in electrocatalytic cycle. As a result, the open&#8208;framework iridate derived nanocatalyst gives a comparable catalytic activity to the most active iridium&#8208;based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts in acid, and retains its catalytic activity for more than 1000&#160;h.

         <title>Bioinspired Self&#8208;Growing Hydrogels by Harnessing Interfacial Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the self&#8208;growing behaviors of keratin proteins, the fabrication of synthetic hydrogels by harnessing free radical polymerization at the interface between a&#160;monomer precursor solution and a&#160;liquid metal is reported, which can be further exploited for functional actuators and soft robotics.








Abstract
The production of natural materials is achieved through a bottom&#8208;up approach, in which materials spontaneously grow and adapt to the external environment. Synthetic materials are specifically designed and fabricated as engineered materials; however, they are far away from these natural self&#8208;growing attributes. Thus, design and fabrication of synthetic material systems to replicate the self&#8208;growing characteristics of those natural prototypes (i.e., hairs and nails) remains challenging. Inspired by the self&#8208;growing behaviors of keratin proteins, here the fabrication of synthetic hydrogels (i.e., polyacrylamide (PAAm)) from the free radical polymerization at the interface between AAm precursor solution and liquid metals (i.e., eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn)) is reported. The newly formed hydrogel materials at the EGaIn/AAm precursor interface gradually push the whole hydrogel upward, enabling the self&#8208;growing of these synthetic hydrogel materials. This work not only endows the fabrication of synthetic materials with unprecedented self&#8208;growing characters, but also broadens the potential applications of self&#8208;growing materials in actuation and soft robotics.

         <title>Seeding and Emergence of Composite Skyrmions in a van der Waals Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composite skyrmions with non&#8208;unitary topological charge are imaged in exfoliated flakes of the 2D magnet Fe3GeTe2. Transitions between skyrmion, skyrmionium, skyrmion bag, and skyrmion sack states reveal details concerning the topological protection of the observed objects. The general nature of the seeding and emergence formation mechanism highlights that composite skyrmions may await discovery in both well&#8208;known and future skyrmion materials.








Abstract
Topological charge plays a significant role in a range of physical systems. In particular, observations of real&#8208;space topological objects in magnetic materials have been largely limited to skyrmions &#8211; states with a unitary topological charge. Recently, more exotic states with varying topology, such as antiskyrmions, merons, or bimerons and 3D states such as skyrmion strings, chiral bobbers, and hopfions, have been experimentally reported. Along these lines, the realization of states with higher&#8208;order topology has the potential to open new avenues of research in topological magnetism and its spintronic applications. Here, real&#8208;space imaging of such spin textures, including skyrmion, skyrmionium, skyrmion bag, and skyrmion sack states, observed in exfoliated flakes of the van der Waals magnet Fe3&#8722;xGeTe2 (FGT) is reported. These composite skyrmions may emerge from seeded, loop&#8208;like states condensed into the stripe domain structure, demonstrating the possibility to realize spin textures with arbitrary integer topological charge within exfoliated flakes of 2D magnets. The general nature of the formation mechanism motivates the search for composite skyrmion states in both well&#8208;known and new magnetic materials, which may yet reveal an even richer spectrum of higher&#8208;order topological&#160;objects.

         <title>21.15%&#8208;Efficiency and Stable &#947;&#8201;&#8208;CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by an Acyloin Ligand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acyloin ligand (1,2&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione (DED)) is developed to construct &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Comprehensive characterizations confirm that the&#160;carbonyl and thienyl in DED can synergistically bind with Pb2+&#8208;related defects by forming a&#160;chelate (one DED bind with two Pb2+ ions), yielding a stable &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 film. Consequently, DED&#8208;CsPbI3 yields a champion PCE of 21.15% among the reported CsPbI3 PSCs to date.








Abstract
Cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) is a promising light&#8208;absorbing material for constructing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to its favorable bandgap and thermal tolerance. However, the high density of defects in the CsPbI3 film not only act as recombination centers, but also facilitate ion migration, leading to lower PCE and inferior stability compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PSC counterpart. Theoretical analyses suggest that the effective suppression of defects in CsPbI3 film is helpful for improving the device performance. Herein, the stable and efficient &#947;&#8201;&#8208;CsPbI3 PSCs are demonstrated by developing an&#160;acyloin ligand (1,2&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione (DED)) as a&#160;phase stabilizer and defect passivator. The experiment and calculation results confirm that carbonyl and thienyl in DED can synergistically interact with CsPbI3 by forming a&#160;chelate to effectively passivate Pb&#8208;related defects and further suppress ion migration. Consequently, DED&#8208;treated CsPbI3 PSCs yield a champion PCE of 21.15%, which is one of the highest PCE among all the reported CsPbI3 PSCs to date. In addition, the unencapsulated DED&#8208;CsPbI3 PSC can retain 94.9% of itsinitial PCE when stored under ambient conditions for 1000&#160;h and 92.8% of its initial PCE under constant illumination for 250&#160;h.

         <title>Electrically Switchable Polarization in Bi2O2Se Ferroelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Switchable ferroelectric polarization in Bi2O2Se semiconductors is experimentally and theoretically investigated. The interplay between ferroelectricity and semiconducting characteristics of Bi2O2Se is explored on device&#8208;level operation. Leveraging its ferroelectric polarization, the fabricated device exhibits &#8220;smart&#8221; photoresponse tunability. This research provides valuable insights into the synergistic effect of ferroelectricity with semiconducting characteristics in 2D ferroelectric semiconductors, toward device simplification and miniaturization.








Abstract
Atomically 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductors, in which the polarization switching process occurs within the channel material itself, offer a new material platform that can drive electronic components toward structural simplification and high&#8208;density integration. Here, a room&#8208;temperature 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductor, bismuth oxychalcogenides (Bi2O2Se), is investigated with a thickness down to 7.3&#160;nm (&#8776;12 layers) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 4.4 &#177; 0.1 pm V&#8722;1. The random orientations and electrically dependent polarization of the dipoles in Bi2O2Se are separately uncovered owing to the structural symmetry&#8208;breaking at room temperature. Specifically, the interplay between ferroelectricity and semiconducting characteristics of Bi2O2Se is explored on device&#8208;level operation, revealing the hysteresis behavior and memory window (MW) formation. Leveraging the ferroelectric polarization originating from Bi2O2Se, the fabricated device exhibits &#8220;smart&#8221; photoresponse tunability and excellent electronic characteristics, e.g., a high on/off current ratio &gt;&#160;104 and a large MW to the sweeping range of 47% at VGS&#160;=&#160;&#177;5&#160;V. These results demonstrate the synergistic combination of ferroelectricity with semiconducting characteristics in Bi2O2Se, laying the foundation for integrating sensing, logic, and memory functions into a single material system that can overcome the bottlenecks in von Neumann architecture.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Sub&#8208;Millimeter Nonlayered WO2 Nanoplates via a WSe2&#8208;Assisted Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality and nonlayered WO2 nanoplates with tunable thickness and lateral dimension by a WSe2&#8208;assisted strategy are reported. Electrical measurements demonstrate that&#160;the WO2 nanoplates exhibit metallic behavior with excellent conductivity, ultrahigh breakdown current density, and strong anisotropic resistance. Magnetotransport studies show quantum&#8208;interference&#8208;induced weak&#8208;localization behavior. These studies demonstrate that 2D&#160;metal oxides are promising candidates for interconnecting and other novel electronic devices.








Abstract
2D&#160;metal oxides (2DMOs) have stimulated tremendous attention due to their distinct electronic structures and abundant surface chemistry. However, it remains a standing challenge for the synthesis of 2DMOs because of their intrinsic 3D&#160;lattice structure and ultrahigh synthesis temperature. Here, a reliable WSe2&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy to grow nonlayered WO2 nanoplates with tunable thickness and lateral dimension is reported. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy studies demonstrate that the&#160;WO2 nanoplates exhibit a well&#8208;faceted rhombic geometry with a lateral dimension up to the sub&#8208;millimeter level (&#8776;135&#160;&#181;m), which is the largest size of 2DMO single crystals obtained by CVD to date. Scanning transmission electron microscopy studies reveal that the nanoplates are high&#8208;quality single crystals. Electrical measurements show the nanoplates exhibit metallic behavior with strong anisotropic resistance, outstanding conductivity of 1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1, and breakdown current density of 7.1&#160;&#215;&#160;107&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. More interestingly, low&#8208;temperature magnetotransport studies demonstrate that the nanoplates show a quantum&#8208;interference&#8208;induced weak&#8208;localization effect. The developed WSe2&#8208;assisted strategy for the growth of WO2 nanoplates can enrich the library of 2DMO materials and provide a material platform for other property explorations based on 2D WO2.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Manganese on Carbon Substrate for Aqueous and Aprotic CO2 Electrochemical Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematically theoretical calculations are performed to seek the optimal structure from atomically dispersed manganese for CO2 electrochemical reduction catalysts. Based on the&#160;theoretical results, Mn&#8211;N4 sites with the functionalization of epoxy groups in the second coordination spheres are designed and embedded in a&#160;bowl&#8208;like mesoporous carbon substrate, which exhibits superior electrochemical performance in both the aqueous and aprotic electrolyte.








Abstract
CO2 utilization and conversion are of great importance in alleviating the rising CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Here, a single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) is reported for electrochemical CO2 utilization in both aqueous and aprotic electrolytes. Specifically, atomically dispersed Mn&#8211;N4 sites are embedded in bowl&#8208;like mesoporous carbon particles with the functionalization of epoxy groups in the second coordination spheres. Theoretical calculations suggest that the epoxy groups near the Mn&#8211;N4 site adjust the electronic structure of the catalyst with reduced reaction energy barriers for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. The resultant Mn&#8208;single&#8208;atom carbon with N and O doped catalyst (MCs&#8208;(N,O)) exhibits extraordinary electrocatalytic performance with a high CO faradaic efficiency of 94.5%, a high CO current density of 13.7 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a low overpotential of 0.44 V in the aqueous environment. Meanwhile, as a cathode catalyst for aprotic Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the MCs&#8208;(N,O) with well&#8208;regulated active sites and unique mesoporous bowl&#8208;like morphology optimizes the nucleation behavior of discharge products. MCs&#8208;(N,O)&#8208;based batteries deliver a low overpotential and excellent cyclic stability of 1000&#160;h. The&#160;findings in this work provide a new avenue to design and fabricate SACs for various electrochemical CO2 utilization systems.

         <title>Coordinatively Stiffen and Toughen Hydrogels with Adaptable Crystal&#8208;Domain Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous dynamic cross&#8208;linking design is developed to reconcile the stiffness&#8211;toughness trade&#8208;off for hydrogels via fully triggering both deformation&#8208;resisting and energy&#8208;dissipating capacities of strong yet dynamic cross&#8208;links. Using a solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;assisted salting&#8208;out method, a class of sal&#8208;exogels with high number densities of crystalline domains embedded in homogeneous networks is constructed, which achieves coordinatively enhanced stiffness and toughness.








Abstract
Conventional hydrogels usually suffer from the inherent conflict between stiffness and toughness, severely hampering their applications as load&#8208;bearing materials. Herein, an adaptable crystal&#8208;domain cross&#8208;linking design is reported to overcome this inherent trade&#8208;off for hydrogels by taking full advantage of both deformation&#8208;resisting and energy&#8208;dissipating capacities of cross&#8208;linking points. Through solvent exchange to homogenize the polymer network, followed by salting out to foster crystallization, a class of sal&#8208;exogels with high number densities of uniform crystalline domains embedded in homogeneous networks is constructed. During the deformation, those adaptive crystalline domains initially survive to arrest deformation, while later gradually disentangle to efficiently dissipate energy, crucial to the realization of the desirable compatibility between stiffness and toughness. The resultant sal&#8208;exogel achieves coordinatively enhanced stiffness (52.3 &#177; 2.7&#160;MPa) and toughness (120.7 &#177; 11.7&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), reconciling the challenging trade&#8208;off between them. This finding provides a practical and universal route to design stiff and tough hydrogels and has a profound impact on many applications requiring hydrogels with such combined mechanical properties.

         <title>Rapid Identification and Monitoring of Multiple Bacterial Infections Using Printed Nanoarrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, fast, and accessible diagnosis tool is developed for direct point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of pathogenic bacteria in clinical and food samples at the single&#8208;cell level, by using a nanoarray&#8208;based colorimetric biosensor. It does not need enrichment, culturing, fluorescence probes, or other sample pretreatments, and can be readily extended to many microbes such as viruses, spirochetes, mycoplasma, rickettsia, and chlamydia.








Abstract
Fast and accurate detection of microbial cells in clinical samples is highly valuable but remains a challenge. Here, a simple, culture&#8208;free diagnostic system is developed for direct detection of pathogenic bacteria in water, urine, and serum samples using an optical colorimetric biosensor. It consists of printed nanoarrays chemically conjugated with specific antibodies that exhibits distinct color changes after capturing target pathogens. By utilizing the internal capillarity inside an evaporating droplet, target preconcentration is achieved within a few minutes to enable rapid identification and more efficient detection of bacterial pathogens. More importantly, the scattering signals of bacteria are significantly amplified by the nanoarrays due to strong near&#8208;field localization, which supports a visualizable analysis of the growth, reproduction, and cell activity of bacteria at the single&#8208;cell level. Finally, in addition to high selectivity, this nanoarray&#8208;based biosensor is also capable of accurate quantification and continuous monitoring of bacterial load on food over a broad linear range, with a detection limit of 10 CFU mL&#8722;1. This work provides an accessible and user&#8208;friendly tool for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of pathogens in many clinical and environmental applications, and possibly enables a breakthrough in early prevention and treatment.

Mixing a sterically bulky, electron&#8208;transporting host material into a conventional single host&#8211;guest emissive layer&#160;is&#160;demonstrated&#160;to suppress phase separation of the host matrix while increasing the efficiency by 120% and the&#160;operational lifetime of deep&#8208;blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with chromaticity coordinates of (0.14, 0.15).








Abstract
Mixing a sterically bulky, electron&#8208;transporting host material into a conventional single host&#8211;guest emissive layer is&#160;demonstrated&#160;to&#160;suppress phase separation of the host matrix while increasing the efficiency and operational lifetime of deep&#8208;blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) with chromaticity coordinates of (0.14, 0.15). The bulky host enables homogenous mixing of the molecules comprising the emissive layer while suppressing single host aggregation; a significant loss channel of nonradiative recombination. By controlling the amorphous phase of the host&#8208;matrix morphology, the mixed&#8208;host device achieves a significant reduction in nonradiative exciton decay, resulting in 120 &#177; 6% increase in external quantum efficiency relative to an analogous, single&#8208;host device. In contrast to single host PHOLEDs where electrons are transported by the host and holes by the dopants, both charge carriers are conducted by the mixed host, reducing the probability of exciton annihilation, thereby doubling of the deep&#8208;blue PHOLED operational lifetime. These findings demonstrate that the host matrix morphology affects almost every aspect of PHOLED performance.

         <title>Deciphering Adverse Detrapped Hole Transfer in Hot&#8208;Electron Photoelectric Conversion at Infrared Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing hot&#8208;carrier devices suffer from low efficiencies, particularly in the infrared region, and ambiguous physical mechanisms. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;the competitive interfacial transfer mechanisms of detrapped holes and hot electrons in hot&#8208;carrier devices are discovered. By eliminating the adverse detrapped&#8208;hole transfer, the external quantum efficiency of a hot&#8208;electron device can increase by over two orders of magnitude at 10&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Hot&#8208;carrier devices are promising alternatives for enabling path breaking photoelectric conversion. However, existing hot&#8208;carrier devices suffer from low efficiencies, particularly in the infrared region, and ambiguous physical mechanisms. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;the competitive interfacial transfer mechanisms of detrapped holes and hot electrons in hot&#8208;carrier devices are discovered. Through photocurrent polarity research and optical&#8208;pump&#8211;THz&#8208;probe (OPTP) spectroscopy, it is verified that detrapped hole transfer (DHT) and hot&#8208;electron transfer (HET) dominate the low&#8208; and high&#8208;density excitation responses, respectively. The photocurrent ratio assigned to DHT and HET increases from 6.6% to over 1133.3% as the illumination intensity decreases. DHT induces severe degeneration of the external quantum efficiency (EQE), especially at low illumination intensities. The EQE of a hot&#8208;electron device can theoretically increase by over two orders of magnitude at 10&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 through DHT elimination. The OPTP results show that competitive transfer arises from the carrier oscillation type and carrier&#8208;density&#8208;related Coulomb screening. The screening intensity determines the excitation weight and hot&#8208;electron cooling scenes and thereby the transfer dynamics.

         <title>A Physiologically Responsive Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Treatment of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma via Proteolysis&#8208;Targeting Chimeras Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>

A PP&#8208;RC&#8208;H hydrogel confers potent immuno&#8208; and bio&#8208;chemotherapeutic effects against tumor growth and metastasis by exploiting multiple known vulnerabilities of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This synergistic strategy reverses the immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumor tissues for immunotherapy and also used a proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras drug and paclitaxel to induce tumor apoptosis and suppression of immune escape to further promote the immunotherapy against HNSCC.








Abstract
Although immunotherapy has revolutionized oncotherapy, only &#8776;15% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients benefit from the current therapies. An immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and dysregulation of the polycomb ring finger oncogene BMI1 are potential reasons for the failure. Herein, to promote immunotherapeutic efficacy against HNSCC, an injectable nanocomposite hydrogel is developed with a polymer framework (PLGA&#8208;PEG&#8208;PLGA) that is loaded with both imiquimod encapsulated CaCO3 nanoparticles (RC) and cancer cell membrane (CCM)&#8208;coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles containing a peptide&#8208;based proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTAC) for BMI1 and paclitaxel (PepM@PacC). Upon injection, this nanocomposite hydrogel undergoes in situ gelation, after which it degrades in the TME over time, releasing RC and PepM@PacC nanoparticles to respectively perform immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Specifically, the RC particles selectively manipulate tumor&#8208;associated macrophages and dendritic cells to activate a T&#8208;cell immune response, while CCM&#8208;mediated homologous targeting and endocytosis delivers the PepM@PacC particles into cancer cells, where endogenous glutathione promotes disulfide bond cleavage to release the PROTAC peptide for BMI1 degradation and frees the paclitaxel from the particle pores to elicit apoptosis meanwhile enhance immunotherapy. Thus, the nanocomposite hydrogel, which is designed to exploit multiple known vulnerabilities of HNSCC, succeeds in suppressing both growth and metastasis of HNSCC.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new pyridine&#8208;based polymer hole&#8208;transporting material is developed through backbone engineering strategy to simultaneously modulate the interface and crystallinity of inverted perovskite solar cells, resulting in a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24.89% (certified 24.50%) with outstanding stability.








Abstract
The interface and crystallinity of perovskite films play a decisive role in determining the device performance, which is significantly influenced by the bottom hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, a simple design strategy of polymer HTMs&#160;is&#160;reported, which can modulate the wettability and promote the anchoring by introducing pyridine units into the polyarylamine backbone, so as to realize efficient and stable inverted PVSCs. The HTM properties can be effectively modified by varying the linkage sites of pyridine units, and 3,5&#8208;linked PTAA&#8208;P1&#160;particularly demonstrates a more regulated molecular configuration for interacting with perovskites, leading to highly crystalline perovskite films with uniform back contact and reduced defect density. Dopant&#8208;free PTAA&#8208;P1&#8208;based inverted PVSCs have realized remarkable efficiencies of 24.89% (certified value: 24.50%) for small&#8208;area (0.08&#160;cm2) as well as 23.12% for large&#8208;area (1&#160;cm2) devices. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintains over 93% of its initial efficiency after 800&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM 1.5G illumination.

         <title>Versatile Assembly of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network Foams Enabled by Tannin&#8211;Cellulose Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;phenolic network foams are prepared using tannin&#8211;cellulose nanofibers as a structured background. The method relies on ice&#8208;templating the nanofibers to promote the metal&#8211;phenolic networking in situ, during thawing in ethanol solutions of metal nitrates. This leads to strong and homogenous lightweight foams, whose properties are tailorable by adjusting the tannin type and content, as well as the metal ion.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN) foams are prepared using colloidal suspensions of tannin&#8208;containing cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) that are ice&#8208;templated and thawed in ethanolic media in the presence of metal nitrates. The MPN facilitates the formation of solid foams by air drying, given the strength and self&#8208;supporting nature of the obtained tannin&#8211;cellulose nanohybrid structures. The porous characteristics and (dry and wet) compression strength of the foams are rationalized by the development of secondary, cohesive&#160;metal&#8208;phenolic layers combined with a hydrogen bonding network involving the CNF. The shrinkage of the MPN foams is as low as 6% for samples prepared with 2.5&#8211;10% tannic acid (or condensed tannin at 2.5%) with respect to CNF content. The strength of the MPN foams reaches a maximum at 10% tannic acid (using Fe(III) ions), equivalent to a compressive strength 70% higher than that produced with tannin&#8208;free CNF foams. Overall, a straightforward framework is introduced to synthesize MPN foams whose physical and mechanical properties are tailored by the presence of tannins as well as the metal ion species that enable the metal&#8211;phenolic networking. Depending on the metal ion, the foams are amenable to modification according to the desired application.

         <title>Inhibiting Formation and Reduction of Li2CO3 to LiCx at Grain Boundaries in Garnet Electrolytes to Prevent Li Penetration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanism for Li penetration is discovered within Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) where Li2CO3 at the grain boundaries (GBs) of LLZO is reduced to an electron&#8208;conductive LiCx network. The ion/electron transfer properties of GBs within LLZO are regulated via F&#8208;doping and LiAlO2 infusion, which significantly reduce the formation of Li2CO3 and promote homogenous Li plating/stripping.








Abstract
Poor ion and high electron transport at the grain boundaries (GBs) of ceramic electrolytes are the primary reasons for lithium filament infiltration and short&#8208;circuiting of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASLMBs). Herein, it is discovered that Li2CO3 at the GBs of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) sheets is reduced to highly electron&#8208;conductive LiCx during cycling, resulting in lithium penetration of LLZO. The ionic and electronic conductivity of the GBs within LLZO can be simultaneously tuned using sintered Li3AlF6. The generated LiAlO2 (LAO) infusion and F&#8208;doping at the GBs of LLZO (LAO&#8208;LLZOF) significantly reduce the Li2CO3 content and broaden the energy bandgap of LLZO, which decreases the electronic conductivity of LAO&#8208;LLZOF. LAO forms a 3D continuous ion transport network at the GB that significantly improves the total ionic conductivity. Lithium penetration within LLZO is suppressed and an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4/LAO&#8208;LLZOF/Li battery stably cycled for 5500 cycles at 3&#160;C. This work reveals the chemistry of Li2CO3 at the LLZO GBs during cycling, presents a novel lithium penetration mechanism within garnet electrolytes, and provides an innovative method to simultaneously regulate the ion and electron transport at the GBs in garnet electrodes for advanced ASLMBs.

         <title>Hydrogel Nanoarchitectonics of a Flexible and Self&#8208;Adhesive Electrode for Long&#8208;Term Wireless Electroencephalogram Recording and High&#8208;Accuracy Sustained Attention Evaluation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multichannel and wirelessly operated hydrogel electrode for long&#8208;term electroencephalography (EEG) signal recording and real&#8208;time sustained attention evaluation is presented. Due to the combined merits of conductivity, self&#8208;adhesion, low modulus, flexibility, and transparency of the hydrogel, it is able to construct an effective and stable bioelectrical interface for high&#8208;quality EEG signal acquisition.








Abstract
Hydrogels are ideal building blocks to fabricate the next generation of electrodes for acquiring high&#8208;quality physiological electrical signals, for example, electroencephalography (EEG). However, collection of EEG signals still suffers from electrode deformation, sweating, extensive body motion and vibration, and environmental interference. Herein, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone are selected to prepare a hydrogel network with tissue&#8208;like modulus and excellent flexibility. Additionally, polydopamine nanoparticles, obtained by polydopamine peroxidation, are integrated into the hydrogel to endow them with higher transparency, higher self&#8208;adhesion, and lower impedance. Consequently, a multichannel and wirelessly operated hydrogel electrode can establish a conformal and stable interface with tissue and illustrate high channel uniformity, low interfacial contact impedance, low power noise, long&#8208;term stability, and a tolerance to sweat and motion. Furthermore, the hydrogel electrode shows the unprecedented ability to classify the recorded high&#8208;quality prefrontal EEG signals into seven&#8208;category sustained attention with high accuracy (91.5%), having great potential applications in the assessment of human consciousness and in multifunctional diagnoses.

         <title>Revisiting Lithium&#8208; and Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage in Hard Carbon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive comparison of the lithium&#8208; and sodium&#8208;ion storage behaviors of hard carbon is conducted, yielding the key findings: the sloping voltage section is presented by the lithium&#8208;ion intercalation in the graphitic lattices of hard carbons, whereas it mainly arises from the chemisorption of sodium ions. The intercalation preference and the plateau capacity have an inverse correlation.








Abstract
The galvanostatic lithiation/sodiation voltage profiles of hard carbon anodes are simple, with a sloping drop followed by a&#160;plateau. However, a precise understanding of the corresponding redox sites and storage mechanisms is still elusive, which hinders further development in commercial applications. Here, a comprehensive comparison of the lithium&#8208; and sodium&#8208;ion storage behaviors of hard carbon is conducted, yielding the following key findings: 1) the sloping voltage section is presented by the lithium&#8208;ion intercalation in the graphitic lattices of hard carbons, whereas it mainly arises from the chemisorption of sodium ions on their inner surfaces constituting closed pores, even if the graphitic lattices are unoccupied; 2) the redox sites for the plateau capacities are the same as those for the closed pores regardless of the alkali ions; 3) the sodiation plateau capacities are mostly determined by the volume of the available closed pore, whereas the lithiation plateau capacities are primarily affected by the intercalation propensity; and 4) the intercalation preference and the plateau capacity have an inverse correlation. These findings from extensive characterizations and theoretical investigations provide a relatively clear elucidation of the electrochemical footprint of hard carbon anodes in relation to the redox mechanisms and storage sites for lithium and sodium ions, thereby providing a more rational design strategy for constructing better hard carbon anodes.

         <title>Enhancement of Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque by Interfacial Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation in CuPt/ferromagnet interface is found to be able to enhance the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) torque and associated spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) switching efficiency with remaining threefold rotational symmetry. The enhancement is independent of the device shapes, magnetic materials, or magnetization easy axis. This work offers an industrial&#8208;compatible route to improve the performance of low&#8208;symmetry crystal&#8208;based spintronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT)&#8208;induced switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of magnetic field is crucial for the application of SOT&#8208;based spintronic devices. Recent works have demonstrated that the low&#8208;symmetry crystal structure in CuPt/CoPt can give rise to an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) spin torque and lead to deterministic magnetization switching without an external field. However, it is essential to improve OOP effective field for the efficient switching. In this work, the impact of interface oxidation on the generation of OOP effective field in a CuPt/ferromagnet heterostructure is systematically studied. By introducing an oxidized CuPt surface, it is found that the field&#8208;free switching performance shows remarkable improvement. OOP effective field measurement indicates that the oxidation treatment can enhance the OOP effective field by more than two times. It is also demonstrated that this oxidation&#8208;induced OOP SOT efficiency enhancement is independent of the device shapes, magnetic materials, or magnetization easy axis. This work contributes to improve the performance of SOT devices and provides an effective fabrication guidance for future spintronic devices that utilize OOP SOT.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Transfer of Freestanding Large&#8208;Area Conjugated Polymer Films for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A technique to enable deposition of large&#8208;area, freestanding, ultra&#8208;thin, conjugated polymer films, which can be transferred to a desired substrate without using solvents, is demonstrated. The quality of these films is assessed by a variety of techniques, and limiting factors and strategies are identified.








Abstract
Conventional processes for depositing thin films of conjugated polymers are restricted to those based on vapor, liquid, and solution&#8208;phase precursors. Each of these methods bear some limitations. For example, low&#8208;bandgap polymers with alternating donor&#8211;acceptor structures cannot be deposited from the vapor phase, and solution&#8208;phase deposition is always subject to issues related to the incompatibility of the substrate with the solvent. Here, a technique to enable deposition of large&#8208;area, ultra&#8208;thin films (&#8776;20 nm or more), which are transferred from the surface of water, is demonstrated. From the water, these pre&#8208;solidified films can then be transferred to a desired substrate, circumventing limitations such as solvent orthogonality. The quality of these films is characterized by a variety of imaging and electrochemical measurements. Mechanical toughness is identified as a limiting property of polymer compatibility, along with some strategies to address this limitation. As a demonstration, the films are used as the hole&#8208;transport layer in perovskite solar cells, in which their performance is shown to be comparable to controls formed by&#160;spin&#8208;coating.

         <title>Perspiring Soft Robotics Skin Constituted by Dynamic Polarity&#8208;Switching Porous Liquid Crystal Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic polarity switching liquid crystal polymer network membrane skin, which enables the exchange of apolar liquid with polar liquid, is developed. This is realized by incorporating a benzoic acid derivative into the original apolar polymer network. A number of applications based on this system from anti&#8208;icing, surface friction tuning, and drug release, to surface adhesion control are demonstrated.








Abstract
Secretion of functional fluids is essential for affecting surface properties in ecosystems. The existing polymer membranes that mimic human skin functions are limited to secreting, either apolar or polar, liquid. However, the development of membranes that grant exchange liquid with different polarities remains a grand challenge. This process is prohibited by the mismatch of the polarity between the carrier polymer and the loaded liquid. To conquer this limitation, an innovative strategy is reported to dynamically switch the polarity of the porous membrane, thereby empowering the exchange of apolar liquid with polar liquid and vice versa. This approach incorporates a benzoic acid derivative into the original apolar polymer network. The benzoic acid dimerizes and forms hydrogen bonds, which supports the molecular alignment, but can be broken into the ionic state when subjected to alkaline treatment, changing the polarity of themembrane. Consequently, the apolar liquid can be replaced with a more polar one. This polar liquid is ejected upon safe&#8208;dose UV illumination from the membrane. Reabsorption occurs on demand by illumination of visible light or when left in contact with the membrane, spontaneously in the dark. Based on this, the consumed membrane is replenished with the same or different exchanging liquid.

         <title>Pd&#8211;PdO Nanodomains on Amorphous Ru Metallene Oxide for High&#8208;Performance Multifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct heterostructure engineering on an ultrathin 2D platform of Pd&#8211;PdO nanodomains confined on amorphous RuO2 yields excellent catalytic activity toward pH&#8208;universal HER, alkaline oxygen electrochemistry, and overall water splitting. The enhanced multifunctional performance is attributed to the rational integration of novel nanostructures, including atomically thin morphology, coexisting amorphous and defect&#8208;rich crystalline phases, and multicomponent heterostructural features.








Abstract
Developing highly efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial for future sustainable energy &#160;pursuits, but remains a great challenge. Herein, a facile synthetic strategy is used to confine atomically thin Pd&#8211;PdO nanodomains to amorphous Ru metallene oxide (RuO2). The as&#8208;synthesized electrocatalyst (Pd2RuOx&#8208;0.5&#160;h) exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward the pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (&#951;10&#160;=&#160;14&#160;mV in 1&#160;m KOH, &#951;10&#160;=&#160;12&#160;mV in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4, and &#951;10&#160;=&#160;22&#160;mV in 1&#160;m PBS), alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (&#951;10&#160;=&#160;225&#160;mV), and overall water splitting (E10&#160;=&#160;1.49&#160;V) with high mass activity and operational stability. Further reduction endows the material (Pd2RuOx&#8208;2&#160;h) with a promising alkaline oxygen reduction activity, evidenced by high halfway potential, four&#8208;electron selectivity, and excellent poison tolerance. The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the rational integration of favorable nanostructures, including 1) the atomically thin nanosheet morphology, 2) the coexisting amorphous and defective crystalline phases, and 3) the multi&#8208;component heterostructural features. These structural factors effectively regulate the material's electronic configuration and the adsorption of intermediates at the active sites for favorable reaction energetics.

The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the rational integration of favorable nanostructures, including 1) the atomically thin nanosheet morphology, 2) the coexisting amorphous and defective crystalline phases, and 3) the multi-component heterostructural features. These structural factors effectively regulate the material's electronic configuration and the adsorption of intermediates at the active sites for favorable reaction energetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermoresponsive Electrolytes for Safe Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermoresponsive electrolyte is introduced into a working cell to relieve the exothermic reactions between electrodes and electrolytes, the internal short circuit. The critical temperature for thermal safety, &#8220;ignition point&#8221; of battery, and internal&#8208;short&#8208;circuit temperature of batteries with thermoresponsive electrolyte increase from 71.5, 100.3, and 126.3&#160;&#176;C to 137.4, 203.6, and 176.5&#160;&#176;C compared with routine electrolyte.








Abstract
Exploring advanced strategies in alleviating the thermal runaway of lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) is critically essential. Herein, a novel electrolyte system with thermoresponsive characteristics is designed to largely enhance the thermal safety of 1.0 Ah LMBs. Specifically, vinyl carbonate (VC) with azodiisobutyronitrile is introduced as a thermoresponsive solvent to boost the thermal stability of both the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and electrolyte. First, abundant poly(VC) is formed in SEI with thermoresponsive electrolyte, which is more thermally stable against lithium hexafluorophosphate compared to the inorganic components widely acquired in routine electrolyte. This increases the critical temperature for thermal safety (the beginning temperature of obvious self&#8208;heating) from 71.5 to 137.4&#160;&#176;C. The remained VC solvents can be polymerized into poly(VC) as the battery temperature abnormally increases. The poly(VC) can not only afford as a barrier to prevent the direct contact between electrodes, but also immobilize the free liquid solvents, thereby reducing the exothermic reactions between electrodes and electrolytes. Consequently, the internal&#8208;short&#8208;circuit temperature and &#8220;ignition point&#8221; temperature (the starting temperature of thermal runaway) of LMBs are largely increased from 126.3 and 100.3&#160;&#176;C to 176.5 and 203.6&#160;&#176;C. This work provides novel insights for pursuing thermally stable LMBs with the addition of various thermoresponsive solvents in commercial electrolytes.

         <title>Sequential Deposition of Multicomponent Bulk Heterojunctions Increases Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 12, March 23, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;bulk heterojunction active layer structure for organic solar cell (OSC) is constructed by sequential deposition of a PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend on top of a D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, in which the optimal morphology of the two binary blends were&#160;retained with a vertical phase separation, resulting in a record PCE of 19.61%.








Abstract
Constructing tandem and multi&#8208;blend organic solar cells (OSCs) is&#160;an effective way to overcome the absorption limitations of conventional single&#8208;junction devices. However, these methods inevitably require tedious multilayer deposition or complicated morphology&#8208;optimization procedures. Herein, sequential deposition is utilized as an effective and simple method to fabricate multicomponent OSCs with a double&#8208;bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure of the active layer to further improve photovoltaic performance. Two efficient donor&#8208;acceptor pairs, D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 and PM6:L8&#8208;BO, are sequentially deposited to form the D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9/PM6:L8&#8208;BO double&#8208;BHJ active layer. In these double&#8208;BHJ OSCs, light absorption is significantly improved, and optimal morphology is also retained without requiring a more complicated morphology optimization involved in quaternary blends. Compared to the quaternary blend devices, energy loss (Eloss) is also reduced by rationally matching each donor with an appropriate acceptor. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved from 18.25% for D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 and 18.69% for PM6:L8&#8208;BO based binary blend OSCs to 19.61% for the double&#8208;BHJ OSCs. In contrast, a D18&#8208;Cl:PM6:L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;eC9 quaternary blend of OSCs exhibited a dramatically reduced PCE of 15.83%. These results demonstrate that a double&#8208;BHJ strategy, with a relatively simple processing procedure, can potentially enhance the device performance of OSCs and lead to more widespread use.

Electromagnetic Metamaterials
Conformal volumetric grayscale metamaterials are structured dielectric media, designed using gradient&#8208;based topology optimization, which are capable of supporting highly multiplexed electromagnetic responses and curvilinear form factors, as reported by Jonathan A. Fan and co&#8208;workers in article number 2204688. An invisibility carpet cloak that can hide arbitrary&#8208;shaped objects from electromagnetic waves featuring a range of incidence angles and wavelengths is depicted.

Gallium Nitride Surface
The vulnerability of the GaN surface is a critical restriction that hinders the development of GaN&#8208;based devices. In article number 2208960, Junting Chen, Junlei Zhao, Mengyuan Hua, and co&#8208;workers report the conversion of the GaN surface into a gallium oxynitride (GaON) epitaxial nanolayer by an in situ two&#8208;step &#8220;oxidation&#8211;reconfiguration&#8221; process. The metastable GaON nanolayer can enhance the performance of GaN&#8208;based devices in power, logic, and photoelectric applications.

Synaptic Transistors
In article 2208497, Haifeng Ling, Linghai Xie, Wei Huang, and co&#8208;workers propose a wavelength&#8208;aware reconfigurable synaptic transistor for visuomorphic computing. Based on the broadband absorption of Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals, reconfigurability between short&#8208;term plasticity and long&#8208;term plasticity for the device is realized. A vision sensor array is constructed to simulate image pre&#8208;processing and recognition with a homogeneous architecture.

Insulator&#8211;Metal Transition
In article number 2211612, Zhicheng Zhong, Xuefeng Wang, and co&#8208;workers report that UV&#8208;light irradiation on perovskite&#8208;based heterostructures can drive the photocharge transfer from SrTiO3 substrates to intermediate&#8208;spin ferromagnetic SrRuO3 ultrathin films containing oxygen vacancies. As a consequence, a reversible Mott&#8208;insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal phase transition occurs in the SrRuO3 layer, as revealed by systematic light&#8208;irradiation transport experiments and dynamical mean&#8208;field theory calculations.

The properties and application progress of hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) drug delivery system (DDS) for small&#8208;molecule and macromolecular drugs.








Abstract
Hollow&#8208;structured nanomaterials (HSNMs) have attracted increased interest in biomedical fields, owing to their excellent potential as drug delivery systems (DDSs) for clinical applications. Among HSNMs, hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMSs) exhibit properties such as high loading capacity, sequential drug release, and multi&#8208;functionalized modification and represent a new class of nanoplatforms for clinical applications. The remarkable properties of HoMS&#8208;based DDS can simultaneously satisfy and enhance DDSs for delivering small molecular drugs (e.g., antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, and imaging agents) and macromolecular drugs (e.g., protein/peptide&#8208; and nucleic acid&#8208;based drugs). First, the latest research advances in delivering small molecular drugs are summarized and highlight the inherent advantages of HoMS&#8208;based DDSs for small molecular drug targeting, combining continuous therapeutic drug delivery and theranostics to optimize the clinical benefit. Meanwhile, the macromolecular drugs DDSs are in the initial development stage and currently offer limited delivery modes. There is a growing need to analyze the deficiency of other HSNMs and integrate the advantages of HSNMs, providing solutions for the safe, stable, and cascade delivery of macromolecular drugs to meet vast treatment requirements. Therefore, the latest advances in HoMS&#8208;based DDSs are comprehensively reviewed, mainly focusing on the characteristics, research progress by drug category, and future research prospects.

Recently reported new methods to induce strain are summarized and discussed, and the latest developments on the modification of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of 2D materials are updated by strain engineering (in particular properties such as the electrochemical, magnetic and superconducting characteristics, and their strain tuning have received little attention previously), and future perspectives are presented.








Abstract
Strain engineering is a promising way to tune the electrical, electrochemical, magnetic, and optical properties of 2D&#160;materials, with the potential to achieve high&#8208;performance 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices ultimately. This review discusses the experimental and theoretical results from recent advances in the strain engineering of 2D materials. Some novel methods to induce strain are summarized and then the tunable electrical and optical/optoelectronic properties of 2D materials via strain engineering are highlighted, including particularly the previously less&#8208;discussed strain tuning of superconducting, magnetic, and electrochemical properties. Also, future perspectives of strain engineering are given for its potential applications in functional devices. The state of the survey presents the ever&#8208;increasing advantages and popularity of strain engineering for tuning properties of 2D materials. Suggestions and insights for further research and applications in optical, electronic, and spintronic devices are provided.

         <title>Response to Comment on &#8220;Vapor Lubrication for Reducing Water and Ice Adhesion on Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Brushes&#8221;:&#160;Organic Vapors Influence Water Contact Angles on Hydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mean contact angle and contact angle hysteresis of water are investigated on different hydrophobic surfaces with different organic vapors. The results show that soluble vapors influence contact angles primarily by reducing the interfacial energies while a in water&#8208;insoluble vapors, e.g. toluene vapor, surfaces can be lubricated.








Abstract
Fast removal of water drops from solid surfaces is important in many applications such as on solar panels in rain, in heat transfer, and for water collection. Recently, a reduction in lateral adhesion of water drops on poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brush surfaces after exposure to various organic vapors&#160;was&#160;reported. It&#160;was&#160;attributed to the physisorption of vapor and swelling of the PDMS brushes. However, it&#160;was&#160;later pointed out that a change in the interfacial energies by vapor adsorption could also have caused low drop adhesion. To find out how strongly each&#160;effect contributes, contact angles of water drops on three hydrophobic surfaces in different vapors are measured. In water&#8208;soluble vapors, a substantial decrease is observed in contact angles. This decrease can indeed be explained by a vapor&#8208;induced change in the interfacial tensions. The very low contact angle hysteresis on PDMS surfaces in saturated n&#8208;hexane and toluene vapor cannot be explained by a change in interfacial tensions. The observation supports the hypothesis that these vapors adsorb into the PDMS and form a lubricating layer. It is hoped that these findings help to solve fundamental problems and contribute to applications, such as anti&#8208;icing, heat transfer, and water collection.

         <title>Van der Waals&#8208;Interface&#8208;Dominated All&#8208;2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with traditional silicon&#8208;based devices, the unique features of all&#8208;2D electronics are atomic flatness and dangling&#8208;bond van der Waals interfaces, including all&#8208;2D metal/semiconductor, all&#8208;2D semiconductor/semiconductor, and all&#8208;2D dielectric/semiconductor interfaces. These interfaces provide an excellent device platform for removing lattice matching constraints, suppressing carrier scattering, and exploiting new physical effects.








Abstract
The interface is the device. As the feature size rapidly shrinks, silicon&#8208;based electronic devices are facing multiple challenges of material performance decrease and interface quality degradation. Ultrathin 2D materials are considered as potential candidates in future electronics by their atomically flat surfaces and excellent immunity to short&#8208;channel effects. Moreover, due to naturally terminated surfaces and weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions between layers, 2D materials can be freely stacked without the lattice matching limit to form high&#8208;quality heterostructure interfaces with arbitrary components and twist angles. Controlled interlayer band alignment and optimized interfacial carrier behavior allow all&#8208;2D electronics based on 2D vdW interfaces to exhibit more comprehensive functionality and better performance. Especially, achieving the same computing capacity of multiple conventional devices with small footprint all&#8208;2D devices is considered to be the key development direction of future electronics. Herein, the unique properties of all&#8208;2D vdW interfaces and their construction methods are systematically reviewed and the main performance contributions of different vdW interfaces in 2D electronics are summarized, respectively. Finally, the recent progress and challenges for all&#8208;2D vdW electronics are discussed, and how to improve the compatibility of 2D material devices with silicon&#8208;based industrial technology is pointed out as a critical challenge.

         <title>Durable and Adjustable Interfacial Engineering of Polymeric Electrolytes for Both Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes and High&#8208;Energy Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With surface in situ polymerization technology, solid polymeric ether&#8208;based electrolytes containing sulfonimide&#8208;based salts are designed as a high&#8208;performance cathode coating, enabling the durable compatibility with both Ni&#8208;rich LiNixCoyMnzO2 cathodes and metallic anodes, accompanying with anticorrosion of aluminum current collectors. This novel interface with high&#8208;voltage tolerance and adjustable components provides a new strategy toward long&#8208;term cyclability of high&#8208;voltage metal batteries.








Abstract
Achieving stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries is crucial for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries with high energy density and high safety. However, the complicated interface problems in both cathode/anode electrodes preclude their practical applications hitherto. Herein, to simultaneously solve such interfacial limitations and obtain sufficient Li+ conductivity in the electrolyte, an ultrathin and adjustable interface is developed at the cathode side through a convenient surface in situ polymerization (SIP), achieving a durable high&#8208;voltage tolerance and Li&#8208;dendrite inhibition. The integrated interfacial engineering fabricates a homogeneous solid electrolyte with optimized interfacial interactions that contributes to tame the interfacial compatibility between LiNixCoyMnzO2 and polymeric electrolyte accompanied by anticorrosion of aluminum current collector. Further, the SIP enables a uniform adjustment of solid electrolyte composition by dissolving additives such as Na+ and K+ salts, which presents prominent cyclability in symmetric Li cells (&gt;300 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2). The assembled LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (4.3 V)||Li batteries show excellent cycle life with high Coulombic efficiencies (&gt;99%). This SIP strategy is also investigated and verified in sodium metal batteries. It opens a new frontier for solid electrolytes toward high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;energy metal battery technologies.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Fabrication of Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile fabrication of ultrathin NUS&#8208;8 membranes in large area (&gt;200 cm2) with remarkable homogeneity and texture along [00l] direction is presented. This stems from the superior solution processability of the NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets synthesized via a scalable approach. The resultant NUS&#8208;8 membranes exhibit outstanding rejections toward various metal ion and dye solutions while at modest permeance compared with other reported membranes.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes, featuring potential molecular sieving effects and therefore capable of surmounting the ubiquitous trade&#8208;off between membrane selectivity and permeability, hold great promise for multitudinous chemical separations. Nevertheless, it remains highly challenging for the large&#8208;area fabrication of ultrathin MOF membranes with variable thickness, great homogeneity, and preferential orientation. Herein, this work reports the facile fabrication of ultrathin (down to 20&#160;nm) NUS&#8208;8 membranes in large&#8208;area (&gt;200 cm2) yet with great homogeneity and texture along (00l) direction due to the superior solution processability of the as&#8208;synthesized NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets. The resultant NUS&#8208;8 membranes with good adhesion properties and certain flexibility exhibit excellent rejections (&gt;98% for Mg2+ and Al3+, and dyes with molecular weights larger than 585.5 g mol&#8722;1) toward aqueous separation of various metal ions and dyes at modest permeance (1&#8211;3.2 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1) due to the well&#8208;aligned structures. Such separation performance outstands among polymetric membranes, thin&#8208;film composite membranes, mixed matrix membranes, and other MOF membranes reported in the literature. The separation mechanism is reasonably discussed based on the experimental and theoretical results. This study opens up novel perspectives for preparing ultrathin and large&#8208;area MOF membranes using the solution processability of MOFs.

         <title>A Heteroanionic Zinc Ion Conductor for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroanionic compound (ZnyO1&#8722;xFx, ZOF) with an aliovalent F&#8208;doped wurtzite motif shows selective Zn2+ conductivity to regulate zinc migration and deposition. ZOF@Zn anode exhibits a low overpotential of 13.3&#160;mV at 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 in symmetric cells, and high stability of 169.7&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8211;1 in MnO2//Zn full batteries for 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Although zinc&#8208;based batteries are promising candidates for eco&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;effective energy storage devices, their performance is severely retarded by dendrite formation. As the simplest zinc compounds, zinc chalcogenides, and halides are individually applied as a Zn protection layer due to high zinc ion conductivity. However, the mixed&#8208;anion compounds are not studied, which constrains the Zn2+ diffusion in single&#8208;anion lattices to their own limits. A heteroanionic zinc ion conductor (ZnyO1&#8722;xFx) coating layer is designed by in situ growth method with tunable F content and thickness. Strengthened by F aliovalent doping, the Zn2+ conductivity is enhanced within the wurtzite motif for rapid lattice Zn migration. ZnyO1&#8722;xFx also affords zincophilic sites for oriented superficial Zn plating to suppress dendrite growth. Therefore, ZnyO1&#8722;xFx&#8208;coated anode exhibits a low overpotential of 20.4&#160;mV for 1000&#160;h cycle life at a plating capacity of 1.0&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2 during symmetrical cell test. The MnO2//Zn full battery further proves high stability of 169.7 mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 for 1000 cycles. This work may enlighten the mixed&#8208;anion tuning for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance, Highly Stretchable, Flexible Moist&#8208;Electric Generators via Molecular Engineering of Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and stretchable moist&#8208;electric generators are developed via a molecular engineering strategy, which fully leverages the molecular structure of hydrogels, circumventing the addition of extra elastomers or conductors. It offers a record&#8208;high short&#8208;circuit current density due to enhanced moisture adsorption and ionic conductivity, holding great potential for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered protective wearables including spacesuits, helmets, medical suits.








Abstract
Harvesting energy from ubiquitous moisture has emerged as a promising technology, offering opportunities to power wearable electronics. However, low current density and inadequate stretching limit their integration into self&#8208;powered wearables. Herein, a high&#8208;performance, highly stretchable, and flexible moist&#8208;electric generator (MEG) is developed via molecular engineering of hydrogels. The molecular engineering involves the impregnation of lithium ions and sulfonic acid groups into the polymer molecular chains to create ion&#8208;conductive and stretchable hydrogels. This new strategy fully leverages the molecular structure of polymer chains, circumventing the addition of extra elastomers or conductors. A centimeter&#8208;sized hydrogel&#8208;based MEG can generate an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.81&#160;V and a short&#8208;circuit current density of up to 480&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2. This current density is more than ten times that of most reported MEGs. Moreover, molecular engineering improves the mechanical properties of hydrogels, resulting in a stretchability of 506%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art level in reported MEGs. Notably, large&#8208;scale integration of the high&#8208;performance and stretchable MEGs is demonstrated to power wearables with integrated electronics, including respiration monitoring masks, smart helmets, and medical suits. This work provides fresh insights into the design of high&#8208;performance and stretchable MEGs, facilitating their application to self&#8208;powered wearables and broadening the application scenario.

         <title>Genetically Engineering Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated BTO Nanoparticles for MMP2&#8208;Activated Piezocatalysis&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane expressed &#945;PD&#8208;L1 with MMP2 responsive shielding domain is engineered to coat on BTO NPs, the resulting M@BTO NPs generate ROS and O2 to induce immunogenic cell death under ultrasound induced piezocatalysis, effectively switching &#8220;immune&#8208;cold&#8221; tumors to &#8220;immune&#8208;hot&#8221; tumors while achieving specific immune checkpoint blockade, providing a robust stimuli&#8208;responsive bioengineering system for augmenting tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) still suffers from low host response rate and non&#8208;specific distribution of immune checkpoint inhibitors, greatly compromising the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, cellular membrane stably expressing matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;activated PD&#8208;L1 blockades is engineered to coat ultrasmall barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticle for overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of tumors. The resulting M@BTO NPs can significantly promote the BTO's tumor accumulation, while the masking domains on membrane PD&#8208;L1 antibodies are cleaved when exposure to MMP2 highly expressed in tumor. With ultrasound (US)&#160;irradiation, M@BTO NPs can simultaneously generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and O2 based on BTO mediated piezocatalysis and water splitting, significantly promoting the intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and improving the PD&#8208;L1 blockade therapy to the tumor, resulting in effective tumor growth inhibition and lung metastasis suppression in a melanoma mouse model. This nanoplatform combines MMP2&#8208;activated genetic editing cell membrane with US responsive BTO for both immune stimulation and specific PD&#8208;L1 inhibition, providing a safe and robust strategy in enhancing immune response against tumor.

         <title>Catalytic Amounts of an Antibacterial Monomer Enable the Upcycling of Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate) Waste</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimal approach for the upcycling of plastics is reported, which permits the direct manufacture of high&#8208;value advanced materials and avoids monomer regeneration. More specifically, a novel strategy is provided for directly upcycling poly(ethylene terephthalate) waste to high&#8208;value antibacterial products. This procedure, which employs a catalytic amount of an antibacterial monomer, exhibits potential for application in the polymer industry.








Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is an important polymer with an annual output second only to polyethylene. The development of PET recycling technologies is therefore necessary to not only eliminate the harm associated with white pollution and microplastics, but also to reduce carbon emissions. Antibacterial PET, one of the most high&#8208;value advanced materials, has improved the ability to treat bacterial infections. However, current methods of manufacturing commercial antibacterial PET require blending with an excess of metal&#8208;based antibacterial agents, which leads to biotoxicity and a nonpersistent antibacterial activity. In addition, high&#8208;efficiency organic antibacterial agents have yet to be employed in antibacterial PET due to their poor thermal stabilities. Herein, a solid&#8208;state reaction for the upcycling of PET waste using a novel hyperthermostable antibacterial monomer is described. This reaction is catalyzed by the residual catalyst present in the PET waste. It is found that a catalytic amount of the antibacterial monomer enabled the low&#8208;cost upcycling of PET waste to produce high&#8208;value recycled PET with a strong and persistent antibacterial activity, as well as similar thermal properties to the virgin PET. This work provides a feasible and economic strategy for the large&#8208;scale upcycling of PET waste and exhibits potential for application in the polymer industry.

         <title>Intrinsic Dipole Arrangement to Coordinate Energy Levels for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered arrangement of methylamine dipoles is induced by the polar molecule to form a top&#8208;down macroscopic polarization of the film. Reorientation of dipoles contributes to forming a gradient energy band and changes the surrounding dielectric environment, facilitating efficient separation and directional transport of carriers. The photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability of the perovskite solar cells are significantly improved.








Abstract
Despite great progress in perovskite photovoltaics, it should be noted that the intrinsic disorder dipolar cations in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites exert negative effects on the energy band structure as well as the carrier separation and transfer dynamics. However, oriented polarization achieved by applying an external electric field may cause irreversible damage to perovskites. Herein, a unique and efficient strategy is developed to modulate the intrinsic dipole arrangement in perovskite films for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The spontaneous reorientation of dipolar cation methylamine is triggered by a polar molecule, constructing a vertical polarization during crystallization regulation. The oriented dipole determines a gradient energy&#8208;level arrangement in PSCs and more favorable energetics at interfaces, effectively enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field and suppressing the nonradiative recombination. Besides, the dipole reorientation induces a local dielectric environment to remarkably reduce exciton binding energy, leading to an ultralong carrier diffusion length of up to 1708&#160;nm. Accordingly, the n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs achieve a significant increase in power conversion efficiency, reaching 24.63% with negligible hysteresis and exhibiting outstanding stabilities. This strategy also provides a facile route to eliminate the mismatched energetics and enhance carrier dynamics for other novel photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Van der Waals Epitaxy Growth of 2D Single&#8208;Element Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 2D single&#8208;element cobalt nanosheets with a sub&#8208;millimeter scale via van der Waals epitaxy is demonstrated for the first time, which is guaranteed by the synergistic effect between van der Waals interactions and surface energy minimization. Cobalt nanosheets exhibit significant in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy and magnetoresistance effects, opening up exciting opportunities for the exploration of 2D single&#8208;element magnetism.








Abstract
2D single&#8208;element materials, which are pure and intrinsically homogeneous on the nanometer scale, can cut the time&#8208;consuming material&#8208;optimization process and circumvent the impure phase, bringing about opportunities to explore new physics and applications. Herein, for the first time, the synthesis of ultrathin cobalt single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets with a sub&#8208;millimeter scale via van der Waals epitaxy is demonstrated. The thickness can be as low as &#8776;6&#160;nm. Theoretical calculations reveal their intrinsic ferromagnetic nature and epitaxial mechanism: that is, the synergistic effect between van der Waals interactions and surface energy minimization dominates the growth process. Cobalt nanosheets exhibit ultrahigh&#160;blocking temperatures above 710 K and in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy. Electrical transport measurements further reveal that cobalt nanosheets have significant magnetoresistance (MR) effect, and can realize a unique coexistence of positive MR and negative MR under different magnetic field configurations, which can be attributed to the competition and cooperation effect among ferromagnetic interaction, orbital scattering, and electronic correlation. These results provide a valuable case for synthesizing 2D elementary metal crystals with pure phase and room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism and pave the way for investigating new physics and related applications in spintronics.

         <title>Chelated Ion&#8208;Exchange Strategy toward BiOCl Mesoporous Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanosheets for Boosting Photocatalytic Selective Aromatic Alcohols Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a chelated ion&#8208;exchange strategy is proposed to synthesize BiOCl mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets (BiOCl MSCN) with ultra&#8208;thin structure by chelating interaction of Bi3+ ions and acetate ions, and ion exchange between Cl&#8722; ions and acetate ions. The prepared BiOCl MSCN exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity stability and general adaptability for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.








Abstract
The photoresponse and photocatalytic efficiency of bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) are greatly limited by rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers. The construction of porous single&#8208;crystal BiOCl photocatalyst can effectively alleviate this issue and provide accessible active sites. Herein, a facile chelated ion&#8208;exchange strategy is developed to synthesize BiOCl mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets (BiOCl MSCN) using acetic acid and ammonia solution respectively as chelating agent and ionization promoter. The strong chelation between acetate ions and Bi3+ ions introduces acetate ions into the precipitated product to exchange with Cl&#8208; ions, resulting in large lattice mismatch, strain release, and formation of void&#8208;like mesopores. The prepared BiOCl MSCN photocatalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance with 99% conversion and 98% selectivity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and superior general adaptability for various aromatic alcohols. The theoretical calculations and characterizations confirm that the superior performance is mainly attributed to the abundant oxygen vacancies, plenty of accessible adsorption/active sites and fast charge transport path without grain boundaries.

         <title>Full Control of Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Electrostatic Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled operation of solid&#8208;state electrolytes for gating applications is demonstrated via the realization of high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistor, free of the spurious effects caused by electrochemical reactions. The devices exhibit high geometrical capacitances 20&#8202;&#8211;&#8202;50&#8287;&#181;F&#8287;cm&#8722;2\[20--50\:\mu {\rm{F}}\:{\rm{c}}{{\rm{m}}^{ - 2}}\] (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges) enabling the accumulation of electron densities above 1014 cm&#8722;2, to gate&#8208;induced superconductivity, and to perform ionic&#8208;gate spectroscopy.








Abstract
Ionic gating is a powerful technique to realize field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) enabling experiments not possible otherwise. So far, ionic gating has relied on the use of top electrolyte gates, which pose experimental constraints and make device fabrication complex. Promising results obtained recently in FETs based on solid&#8208;state electrolytes remain plagued by spurious phenomena of unknown origin, preventing proper transistor operation, and causing limited control and reproducibility. Here, a class of solid&#8208;state electrolytes for gating (Lithium&#8208;ion conducting glass&#8208;ceramics, LICGCs) is explored, the processes responsible for the spurious phenomena and irreproducible behavior are identified, and properly functioning transistors exhibiting high density ambipolar operation with gate capacitance of &#8776;20&#8202;&#8722;&#8202;50&#8201;&#181;F cm&#8722;2\[20{\bm{ - }}50\;\mu F c{m^{{\bm{ - }}2}}\] (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges) are demonstrated. Using 2D semiconducting transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides, the ability to implement ionic&#8208;gate spectroscopy to determine the semiconducting bandgap, and to accumulate electron densities above 1014 cm&#8722;2 are demostrated, resulting in gate&#8208;induced superconductivity in MoS2 multilayers. As LICGCs are implemented in a back&#8208;gate configuration, they leave the surface of the material exposed, enabling the use of surface&#8208;sensitive techniques (such as scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy) impossible so far in ionic&#8208;gated devices. They also allow double ionic gated devices providing independent control of charge density and electric&#160;field.

Using 2D semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenides, the ability to implement ionic-gate spectroscopy to determine the semiconducting bandgap, and to accumulate electron densities above 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; are demostrated, resulting in gate-induced superconductivity in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; multilayers. As LICGCs are implemented in a back-gate configuration, they leave the surface of the material exposed, enabling the use of surface-sensitive techniques (such as scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy) impossible so far in ionic-gated devices. They also allow double ionic gated devices providing independent control of charge density and electric&#160;field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Genetically Programmable Vesicles for Enhancing CAR&#8208;T Therapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically programmable cellular vesicles expressing high&#8208;affinity anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 scFv loaded with glutamine antagonist (D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs) are developed to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve the infiltration and effector functions of chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cells. The combination of D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs with CAR&#8208;T cells increases the therapeutic effect against orthotopic lung cancer and generates a long&#8208;term immune memory response.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cell therapy has shown remarkable success in eradicating hematologic malignancies; however, its efficacy in treating solid tumors has always been limited due to the presence of an immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, genetically programmable cellular vesicles expressing high&#8208;affinity anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 single chain variable fragment (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#160;scFv) loaded with glutamine antagonist (D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs) are developed to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive TME and enhance the efficiency of anti&#8208;mesothelin CAR&#8208;T cells in orthotopic lung cancer. As anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 scFv can specifically bind to the programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) on tumor cells, D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs enable the targeted delivery of glutamine antagonists to the tumor site and address the upregulation of PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cells, which prevents the premature exhaustion of CAR&#8208;T cells. More importantly, D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs effectively reduce the number of immunosuppressive cells and promote the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in tumor tissues. These unique features of D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs improve the infiltration and effector functions of CAR&#8208;T cells, which ultimately enhance the anti&#8208;tumor ability and long&#8208;term memory immunity of CAR&#8208;T cells. The findings support that D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs act as a promising drug to strengthen the effectiveness of CAR&#8208;T cells against solid tumors.

         <title>The First Demonstration of Strain&#8208;Controlled Periodic Ferroelectric Domains with Superior Piezoelectric Response in Molecular Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By applying tensile strain to the thin film of molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium (TMCM&#8208;CdCl3), a large area of highly ordered periodic domain structures can be obtained. The density and width of these periodic domains can be adjusted by the magnitude of strain and the thickness of the film, respectively, and the piezoelectric response at the domain wall is enhanced.








Abstract
Achieving a periodic domain structure in ferroelectric materials to tailor the macroscopic properties or realize new functions has always been a hot topic. However, methods to construct periodic domain structures, such as epitaxial growth, direct writing by scanning tips, and the patterned electrode method, are difficult or inefficient to implement in emerging molecular ferroelectrics, which have the advantages of lightweight, flexibility, biocompatibility, etc. An efficient method for constructing and controlling periodic domain structures is urgently needed to facilitate the development of molecular ferroelectrics in nanoelectronic devices. In this work, it is demonstrated that large&#8208;area, periodic and controllable needle&#8208;like domain structures can be achieved in thin films of the molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium (TMCM&#8208;CdCl3) upon the application of tensile strain. The domain evolution under various tensile strains can be clearly observed, and such processes are accordingly identified. Furthermore, the domain wall exhibits a superior piezoelectric response, with up to fivefold enhancement compared to that of the pristine samples. Such large&#8208;area tunable periodic domain structure and abnormally strong piezoresponse are not only of great interests in fundamental studies, but also highly important in the future applications in functional molecular materials.

         <title>The Interaction of Amines with Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding the interactions between amines and the surface of gold nanoparticles is important because of their role in the stabilization of the nanosystems, in the formation of the protein corona and preparation of semisynthetic nanozymes. By using fluorescence spectroscopy, electrochemistry, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, and molecular simulation we obtained a detailed picture of these interactions. We show for the first time that amines interact with surface Au(0) atoms of the nanoparticles with their lone electron pair with a strength linearly correlating with their basicity corrected for steric hindrance. The kinetic of binding depends on the position of the gold atoms (flat surfaces or edges) while the mode of binding involves a single Au(0) with nitrogen sitting on top of it. We also found that the presence of a small fraction of surface Au(I) atoms, resulting from the non&#8208;complete reduction of gold salts when citrate is used as the reducing agent in the nanoparticle preparation, is reduced by the amines yielding a much stronger Au(0)&#8208;RN.+ (RN., after the loss of a proton) interaction. DFT calculations reveal that, in this case, the mode of binding involves two Au(0) atoms with a bridging nitrogen placed between them. The strength of the interaction of the amines with gold nanoparticles may be quite different depending on whether they have been used for the reduction of the gold salt or were introduced after the reduction had occurred. The implications for the passivation of the nanoparticles and their interaction with the amino groups of proteins are significant. Stable Au nanoparticles, as those required for robust semisynthetic nanozymes preparation, are better obtained when the protein is involved (at least in part) in the gold ions reduction.

         <title>Quantifiable Relationship Between Antibacterial Efficacy and Electro&#8211;Mechanical Intervention on Nanowire Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantifiable relationship between biophysical force and antibacterial efficiency is demonstrated. Electrical interactions not only supplement mechanical damage by accentuating the electrostatic attraction between the bacteria and implant surface, but also facilitate electron flow from the bacteria to the materials to boost production of intracellular reactive oxygen species. This principle aids the development of non&#8208;leaching antibacterial implant materials with clinical significance.








Abstract
Physical disruption is an important antibacterial means as it is lethal to bacteria without spurring antimicrobial resistance. However, it is very challenging to establish a quantifiable relationship between antibacterial efficacy and physical interactions such as mechanical and electrical forces. Herein, titanium nitride (TN) nanowires with adjustable orientations and capacitances are prepared to exert gradient electro&#8211;mechanical forces on bacteria. While vertical nanowires show the strongest mechanical force resulting in an antibacterial efficiency of 0.62 log reduction (vs 0.22 for tiled and 0.36 for inclined nanowires, respectively), the addition of electrical charges maximizes the electro&#8211;mechanical interactions and elevates the antibacterial efficacy to more than 3 log reduction. Biophysical and biochemical analyses indicate that electrostatic attraction by electrical charge narrows the interface. The electro&#8211;mechanical intervention more easily stiffens and rips the bacteria membrane, disturbing the electron balance and generating intracellular oxidative stress. The antibacterial ability is maintained in vivo and bacteria&#8208;challenged rats are protected from serious infection. The physical bacteria&#8208;killing process demonstrated here can be controlled by adjusting the electro&#8211;mechanical interactions. Overall, these results revealed important principles for rationally designing high&#8208;performance antibacterial interfaces for clinical applications.

         <title>A Concerted Redox&#8208; and Light&#8208;Activated Agent for Controlled Multimodal Therapy against Hypoxic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia represents a compelling tumor therapeutic target. The first metal&#8208;based multimodal theranostic agent (RuAzNM) for targeting hypoxia is reported. The&#160;activity of RuAzNM is caged by a conjugated azo group, and selectively unleashed in hypoxic cancer cells. This allows emission&#8208;directed multimodal therapy, elicits apoptosis, and suggests that RuAzNM can deliver&#160;an efficacious theranostic outcome for hypoxic cancer cells.








Abstract
Hypoxia represents a remarkably exploitable target for cancer therapy, is encountered only in solid human tumors, and is highly associated with cancer resistance and recurrence. Here, a hypoxia&#8208;activated mitochondria&#8208;accumulated Ru(II) polypyridyl prodrug functionalized with conjugated azo (Az) and nitrogen mustard (NM) functionalities, RuAzNM, is reported. This prodrug has multimodal theranostic properties toward hypoxic cancer cells. Reduction of the azo group in hypoxic cell microenvironments gives rise to the generation of two primary amine products, a free aniline mustard, and the polypyridyl RuNH2 complex. Thus, the aniline mustard triggers generation of&#160;reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mtDNA crosslinking. Meanwhile, the resultant biologically benign phosphorescent RuNH2 gives rise to a diagnostic signal and signals activation of the phototherapy. This multimodal therapeutic effect eventually elevates ROS levels, depletes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and induces mitochondrial membrane damage, mtDNA damage, and ultimately cell apoptosis. This unique strategy allows controlled multimodal theranostics to be realized in hypoxic cells and multicellular spheroids, making RuAzNM a highly selective and effective cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective theranostic agent (IC50&#160;= 2.3&#160;&#181;m for hypoxic HepG2 cancer cells vs 58.2&#160;&#181;m for normoxic THL&#8208;3 normal cells). This is the first report of a metal&#8208;based compound developed as a multimodal theranostic agent for hypoxia.

&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia represents a compelling tumor therapeutic target. The first metal-based multimodal theranostic agent (RuAzNM) for targeting hypoxia is reported. The&#160;activity of RuAzNM is caged by a conjugated azo group, and selectively unleashed in hypoxic cancer cells. This allows emission-directed multimodal therapy, elicits apoptosis, and suggests that RuAzNM can deliver&#160;an efficacious theranostic outcome for hypoxic cancer cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia represents a remarkably exploitable target for cancer therapy, is encountered only in solid human tumors, and is highly associated with cancer resistance and recurrence. Here, a hypoxia-activated mitochondria-accumulated Ru(II) polypyridyl prodrug functionalized with conjugated azo (Az) and nitrogen mustard (NM) functionalities, RuAzNM, is reported. This prodrug has multimodal theranostic properties toward hypoxic cancer cells. Reduction of the azo group in hypoxic cell microenvironments gives rise to the generation of two primary amine products, a free aniline mustard, and the polypyridyl RuNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; complex. Thus, the aniline mustard triggers generation of&#160;reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mtDNA crosslinking. Meanwhile, the resultant biologically benign phosphorescent RuNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives rise to a diagnostic signal and signals activation of the phototherapy. This multimodal therapeutic effect eventually elevates ROS levels, depletes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and induces mitochondrial membrane damage, mtDNA damage, and ultimately cell apoptosis. This unique strategy allows controlled multimodal theranostics to be realized in hypoxic cells and multicellular spheroids, making RuAzNM a highly selective and effective cancer-cell-selective theranostic agent (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;= 2.3&#160;&#181;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; for hypoxic HepG2 cancer cells vs 58.2&#160;&#181;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; for normoxic THL-3 normal cells). This is the first report of a metal-based compound developed as a multimodal theranostic agent for hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A unique class of materials&#8212;quantum composites based on polymers with fillers composed of a van der Waals material that reveals multiple charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave quantum condensate phases&#8212;is demonstrated. The composites display strong quantum phenomena even above room temperature. The dielectric constant experiences more than two&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement while the material remains electrically insulating, opening venues for applications in energy storage and electronics.








Abstract
A unique class of advanced materials&#8212;quantum composites based on polymers with fillers composed of a van der Waals quantum material that reveals multiple charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave quantum condensate phases&#8212;is demonstrated. Materials that exhibit quantum phenomena are typically crystalline, pure, and have few defects because disorder destroys the coherence of the electrons and phonons, leading to collapse of the quantum states. The macroscopic charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave phases of filler particles after multiple composite processing steps are successfully preserved in this work. The prepared composites display strong charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave phenomena even above room temperature. The dielectric constant experiences more than two orders of magnitude enhancement while the material maintains its electrically insulating properties, opening a venue for advanced applications in energy storage and electronics. The results present a conceptually different approach for engineering the properties of materials, extending the application domain for van der Waals materials.

         <title>Iridescence from Total Internal Reflection at 3D Microscale Interfaces: Mechanistic Insights and Spectral Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental investigation and the optical modeling of structural coloration produced from total internal reflection interference within 3D microstructures are described. Ray tracing coupled with spectral analysis techniques are used to examine the iridescence generated for a range of microgeometries, including hemicylinders and truncated hemispheres. Microstructure arrays with varying orientation and size create unique color&#8208;traveling optical effects with customizable iridescence.








Abstract
An experimental investigation and the optical modeling of the structural coloration produced from total internal reflection interference within 3D microstructures are described. Ray&#8208;tracing simulations coupled with color visualization and spectral analysis techniques are used to model, examine, and rationalize the iridescence generated for a range of microgeometries, including hemicylinders and truncated hemispheres, under varying illumination conditions. An approach to deconstruct the observed iridescence and complex far&#8208;field spectral features into its elementary components and systematically link them to ray trajectories that emanate from the illuminated microstructures is demonstrated. The results are compared with experiments, wherein microstructures are fabricated with methods such as chemical etching, multiphoton lithography, and grayscale lithography. Microstructure arrays patterned on surfaces with varying orientation and size lead to unique color&#8208;traveling optical effects and highlight opportunities for how total internal reflection interference can be used to create customizable reflective iridescence. The findings herein provide a robust conceptual framework for rationalizing this multibounce interference mechanism and establish approaches for characterizing and tailoring the optical and iridescent properties of microstructured surfaces.

         <title>Perovskite Grain&#8208;Boundary Manipulation Using Room&#8208;Temperature Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing &#8220;Ligaments&#8221; for Developing Highly Stable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.8% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain&#8208;boundary &#8220;ligaments&#8221; are developed to endow fragile perovskite grain boundaries with toughness, water resistance, and room temperature self&#8208;healing properties. Meanwhile, they can also passivate the defects and release the residual tensile strain in perovskite films. The resultant flexible perovskite solar cells achieve a record 23.84% power conversion efficiency and robust mechanical, operational, and ambient stabilities.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) are the best candidates to complement traditional silicon SCs in portable power applications. However, their mechanical, operational, and ambient stabilities are still unable to meet the practical demands because of the natural brittleness, residual tensile strain, and high defect density along the perovskite grain boundaries. To overcome these issues, a cross&#8208;linkable monomer TA&#8208;NI with dynamic covalent disulfide bonds, H&#8208;bonds, and ammonium is carefully developed. The cross&#8208;linking acts as &#8220;ligaments&#8221; attached on the perovskite grain boundaries. These &#8220;ligaments&#8221; consisting of elastomers and 1D perovskites can not only passivate the grain boundaries and enhance moisture resistance but also release the residual tensile strain and mechanical stress in 3D perovskite films. More importantly, the elastomer can repair bending&#8208;induced mechanical cracks in the perovskite film because of dynamic self&#8208;healing characteristics. The resultant flexible pero&#8208;SCs exhibit promising improvements in efficiency, and record values (23.84% and 21.66%) are obtained for 0.062&#160;and 1.004&#160;cm2&#160;devices; the flexible devices also show overall improved stabilities with T90&#160;&gt;20&#160;000&#160;bending cycles, operational stability with T90&#160;&gt;1248&#160;h, and ambient stability (relative humidity&#160;=&#160;30%) with T90&#160;&gt;3000&#160;h. This strategy paves a new way for the industrial&#8208;scale development of high&#8208;performance flexible pero&#8208;SCs.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances on lactate oxidase (LOx)&#8208;based biosensors are summarized, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)&#8208;based, oxygen (O2)2&#8208;based, pH&#8208;sensitive, and electrochemical, for cancer diagnosis, and various LOx&#8208;based cancer therapy strategies, including lactate&#8208;depletion&#8208;based metabolic cancer therapy/immunotherapy, hypoxia&#8208;activated chemotherapy, H2O2&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, and multimodal synergistic cancer therapy, are discussed.








Abstract
Lactate oxidase (LOx) has attracted extensive interest in cancer diagnosis and therapy in recent years owing to its specific catalysis on l&#8208;lactate; its catalytic process consumes oxygen (O2) and generates a large amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and pyruvate. Given high levels of lactate in tumor tissues and its tight correlation with tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence, LOx&#8208;based biosensors including H2O2&#8208;based, O2&#8208;based, pH&#8208;sensitive, and electrochemical have been designed for cancer diagnosis, and various LOx&#8208;based cancer therapy strategies including lactate&#8208;depletion&#8208;based metabolic cancer therapy/immunotherapy, hypoxia&#8208;activated chemotherapy, H2O2&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, and multimodal synergistic cancer therapy have also been developed. In this review, the lactate&#8208;specific catalytic properties of LOx are introduced, and the recent advances on LOx&#8208;instructed cancer diagnostic or therapeutic platforms and corresponding biological applications are summarized. Additionally, the challenges and potential of LOx&#8208;based nanomedicines are highlighted.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although research on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials has been booming for decades, more research is needed on how to utilize them to construct efficient information sensing, processing, and feedback devices. A review of recent representative studies on information sensing, processing, and feedback devices based on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials to provide a perspective on developing human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interaction technologies is presented.








Abstract
A wide variety of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials with excellent properties can meet almost all the requirements of functional materials for information sensing, processing, and feedback devices. Low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are becoming the star of hope on the road to pursuing human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interactions, benefiting from the breakthroughs in precise preparation, performance regulation, structural design, and device construction in recent years. This review summarizes several types of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials commonly used in human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interactions and outlines the differences in properties and application areas of different materials. According to the sequence of information flow in the human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing interaction process, the representative research progress of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials&#8208;based information sensing, processing, and feedback devices is reviewed and the key roles played by low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are discussed. Finally, the development trends and existing challenges of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials in the field of human&#8211;machine&#8211;thing natural interaction technology are discussed.

         <title>The Emerging Layered Hydroxide Plates with Record Thickness for Enhanced High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

With the NH4+ and F&#8722; synergy mechanism, the intrinsic growth limit of &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 is broken,&#160;realizing record&#8208;level thickness (over 700&#160;nm) for the tailored F&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 (Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH) superstructure. The ultrathick plate superstructure is found to have a versatile family, which can open a new era of novel energy&#8208;storage materials to meet various future demands.








Abstract
The past decade has witnessed the development of layered&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting electrodes, but the low active mass ratio impedes its all&#8208;around energy&#8208;storage applications. Herein, the intrinsic limit of layered hydroxides is broken by engineering F&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 (Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH) plates with a sub&#8208;micrometer thickness (over 700&#160;nm), producing a superhigh mass loading of 29.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 on the carbon substrate. Theoretical calculation and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH shares the &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2&#8208;like structure with slightly tuned lattice parameters. More interestingly, the synergy modulation of NH4+ and F&#8722; is found to serve as the key enabler to tailor these sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;thickness 2D plates thanks to the modification effects on the (001) plane surface energy and local OH&#8722; concentration. Guided by this mechanism, the superstructures of bimetallic hydroxides and their derivatives are further developed, revealing they are a versatile family with great promise. The tailored ultrathick phosphide superstructure achieves a superhigh specific capacity of 7144 mC cm&#8722;2 and a superior rate capability (79% at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). This work highlights a multiscale understanding of how exceptional structure modulation happens in low&#8208;dimensional layered materials. The as&#8208;built unique methodology and mechanisms will boost the development of advanced materials to better meet future energy demands.

         <title>Engineering and Development of a Tissue Model for the Evaluation of Microneedle Penetration Ability, Drug Diffusion, Photothermal Activity, and Ultrasound Imaging: A Promising Surrogate to Ex Vivo and In Vivo Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue models based on hydrogel/silicone are prepared for different applications in biomedical sectors. Such customized tissue surrogates can be employed as a platform to evaluate the ability of microneedle insertion, the diffusion of drugs, the activity of photothermal agents, as well as the performance of ultrasound bioimaging.








Abstract
Driven by regulatory authorities and the ever&#8208;growing demands from industry, various artificial tissue models have been developed. Nevertheless, there is no model to date that is capable of mimicking the biomechanical properties of the skin whilst exhibiting the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity properties of the skin layers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, tissue surrogates based on gel and silicone are fabricated for the evaluation of microneedle penetration, drug diffusion, photothermal activity, and ultrasound bioimaging. The silicone layer aims to imitate the stratum corneum while the gel layer aims to mimic the water&#8208;rich viable epidermis and dermis present in in vivo tissues. The diffusion of drugs across the tissue model is assessed, and the results reveal that the proposed tissue model shows similar behavior to a cancerous kidney. In place of typical in vitro aqueous solutions, this model can also be employed for evaluating the photoactivity of photothermal agents since the tissue model shows a similar heating profile to skin of mice when irradiated with near&#8208;infrared laser. In addition, the designed tissue model exhibits promising results for biomedical applications in optical coherence tomography and ultrasound imaging. Such a tissue model paves the way to reduce the use of animals testing in research whilst obviating ethical concerns.

         <title>Atom&#8208;Precise Heteroatom Core&#8208;Tailoring of Nanoclusters for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titania&#8208;supported atomically precise gold&#8208;silver core&#8211;shell nanoclusters, Au12Ag32/TiO2, are fabricated through strong cluster&#8211;support interactions. The controlled modulation of the electronic structure of the nanoclusters through the incorporation of the metallic gold core plays a critical role in the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge carriers, making Au12Ag32/TiO2 a &#8776;38&#8208;fold more efficient photocatalyst than TiO2 for hydrogen production (6.8 mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) from solar water splitting.








Abstract
While core&#8211;shell nanomaterials are highly desirable for realizing enhanced optical and catalytic properties, their synthesis with atomic&#8208;level control is challenging. Here, the synthesis and crystal structure of [Au12Ag32(SePh)30]4&#8722;, the first example of selenolated Au&#8211;Ag core&#8211;shell nanoclusters, comprising a gold icosahedron core trapped in a silver dodecahedron, which is protected by an Ag12(SePh)30 shell, is presented. The gold core strongly modifies the overall electronic structure and induces synergistic effects, resulting in high enhancements in the stability and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II photoluminescence. The Au12Ag32 and its homometal analog Ag44, show strong interactions with oxygen vacancies of TiO2, facilitating the interfacial charge transfer for photocatalysis. Indeed, the Au12Ag32/TiO2 exhibits remarkable solar H2 production (6810&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1), which is &#8776;6.2 and &#8776;37.8 times higher than that of Ag44/TiO2 and TiO2, respectively. Good stability and recyclability with minimal catalytic activity loss are additional features of Au12Ag32/TiO2. The experimental and computational results reveal that the Au12Ag32 acts as an efficient cocatalyst by possessing a favorable electronic structure that aligns well with the TiO2 bands for the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge carriers due to the relatively negatively charged Au12 core. These atomistic insights will motivate uncovering of the structure&#8211;catalytic activity relationships of other nanoclusters.

         <title>Electrostatic Epitaxy of Orientational Perovskites for Microlasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;free electrostatic epitaxy is achieved toward orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline microwire arrays and thin films. This is facilitated by a negatively charged surfactant layer at the air&#8211;liquid interface, where the strong and selective interaction between surfactant anion and perovskite facet induces preferential nucleation and orientational growth. The high&#8208;quality microwire permits a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of photonic lasing, waveguide coupling, and coherent&#8208;light propagation.








Abstract
Orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline structures is pivotal in the semiconductor industry, which is achievable by epitaxy for producing thin films, heterostructures, quantum wells, and superlattices. Beyond silicon and III&#8211;V semiconductors, solution&#8208;processible semiconductors, such as metal&#8208;halide perovskites, are emerging for scalable and cost&#8208;effective manufacture of optoelectronic devices, whereas the polycrystalline nature of fabricated structures restricts their application toward integrated devices. Here, electrostatic epitaxy, a process sustained by strong electrostatic interactions between self&#8208;assembled surfactants (octanoate anions) and Pb2+, is developed to realize orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline CsPbBr3 microwires. Strong electrostatic interactions localized at the air&#8211;liquid interface not only support preferential nucleation for single crystallinity, but also select the crystal facet with the highest Pb2+ areal density for pure crystallographic orientation. Due to the epitaxy at the air&#8211;liquid interface, direct growth of oriented single&#8208;crystalline microwires onto different substrates without the processes of lift&#8208;off and transfer is realized. Photonic lasing emission, waveguide coupling, and on&#8208;chip propagation of coherent light are demonstrated based on these single&#8208;crystalline microwires. These findings open an avenue for on&#8208;chip integration of single&#8208;crystalline materials.

         <title>Modular Design of a Polymer&#8208;Bilayer&#8208;Based Mechanically Compliant Worm&#8208;Like Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically compliant earthworm&#8208;like robot with a fully modular soft body that primarily consists of polymers is presented. The robot is based on electrothermally actuated polymer&#8208;bilayer&#8208;based segments and is capable of directional locomotion on various surfaces, turning on the spot, steering during forward movement, and, most strikingly, squeezing itself through constrictions that are smaller than its cross&#8208;section in the resting state.








Abstract
Soft earthworm&#8208;like robots that exhibit mechanical compliance can, in principle, navigate through uneven terrains and constricted spaces that are inaccessible to traditional legged and wheeled robots. However, unlike the biological originals that&#160;they mimic, most of the worm&#8208;like robots reported to date contain rigid components that limit their compliance, such as electromotors or pressure&#8208;driven actuation systems. Here, a mechanically compliant worm&#8208;like robot with a fully modular body that is based on soft polymers is reported. The robot is composed of strategically assembled, electrothermally activated polymer bilayer actuators, which are based on a semicrystalline polyurethane with an exceptionally large nonlinear thermal expansion coefficient. The segments are designed on the basis of a modified Timoshenko model, and finite element analysis simulation is used to describe their performance. Upon electrical activation of the segments with basic waveform patterns, the robot can move through repeatable peristaltic locomotion on exceptionally slippery or sticky surfaces and it can be oriented in any direction. The soft body enables the robot to wriggle through openings and tunnels that are much smaller than its cross&#8208;section.

         <title>Multiexciton Generation from a 2D Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite with Nearly 200% Quantum Yield of Red Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiexciton generation (MEG) is found in a 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite, phenylammonium cadmium chloride (PACC). The MEG effect induced by Mn2+ doping improves the red phosphorescent quantum yield of PACC from 6% to nearly 200%, thus resulting in a switching from blue to red afterglow.








Abstract
2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) show obvious advantages in the field of optoelectronics due to their high luminescent stability and good solution processability. However, the thermal quenching and self&#8208;absorption of excitons caused by the strong interaction between the inorganic metal ions lead to a low luminescence efficiency of 2D perovskites. Herein, a 2D Cd&#8208;based OIHP phenylammonium cadmium chloride&#160;(PACC) with a weak red phosphorescence (&#934;P&#160;&lt; 6%) at 620&#160;nm and a blue afterglow is reported. Interestingly, the Mn&#8208;doped PACC exhibits very strong red emission with nearly 200% quantum yield and 15&#160;ms lifetime, thus resulting in a red afterglow. The experimental data prove that the doping of Mn2+ not only induces the multiexciton generation (MEG) process of the perovskite, avoiding the energy loss of inorganic excitons, but also promotes the Dexter energy transfer from organic triplet excitons to inorganic excitons, thus realizing the superefficient red&#8208;light emission of Cd2+. This work suggests that guest metal ions can induce host metal ions to realize MEG in 2D bulk OIHPs, which provides a new idea for the development of optoelectronic materials and devices with ultrahigh energy utilization.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Resolved Imaging of Antiferromagnetic Order in Fe4Se5 Ultrathin Films on SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe4Se5 ultrathin films are experimentally demonstrated to host a pair&#8208;checkerboard antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state with in&#8208;plane magnetization, evident with magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent spin contrasts in real&#8208;space by spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. The AFM order is modulated by a spin&#8211;lattice coupling and exhibits three types of nanoscale AFM domains, which are subject to thermal fluctuations into short&#8208;ranged patches at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Unraveling the magnetic order in iron chalcogenides and pnictides at atomic scale is pivotal for understanding their unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism, but is experimentally challenging. Here, by utilizing spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, real&#8208;space spin contrasts are successfully resolved to exhibit atomically unidirectional stripes in Fe4Se5 ultrathin films, the plausible closely related compound of bulk FeSe with ordered Fe&#8208;vacancies, which are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. As is substantiated by the first&#8208;principles electronic structure calculations, the spin contrast originates from a pair&#8208;checkerboard antiferromagnetic ground state with in&#8208;plane magnetization, which is modulated by a spin&#8211;lattice coupling. These measurements further identify three types of nanoscale antiferromagnetic domains with distinguishable spin contrasts, which are subject to thermal fluctuations into short&#8208;ranged patches at elevated temperatures. This work provides promising opportunities in understanding the emergent magnetic order and the electronic phase diagram for FeSe&#8208;derived superconductors.

         <title>Functional Ultrathin Separators Proactively Stabilizing Zinc Anodes for Zinc&#8208;Based Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
23&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick functional ultrathin separators for zinc&#8208;based energy storage are reported. The separators are composed of a high&#8208;strength cellulose nanofiber substrate and a zincophilic sites&#8208;rich decoration layer, in which the former one presents uniform nanoporous structure, ion&#8208;sieving ability, and ultrathin thickness and the latter one possesses high specific surface area and abundant zincophilic sites, and thus can proactively stabilize zinc anodes.








Abstract
Ultrathin separators are indispensable to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but their easy failure caused by zinc dendrites poses a great challenge. Herein, 23&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick functional ultrathin separators (FUSs), realizing superb electrochemical stability of zinc anodes and outstanding long&#8208;term durability of ultrathin separators, are reported. In the FUSs, an ultrathin but mechanically strong nanoporous membrane substrate benefits fast and flux&#8208;homogenized Zn2+ transport, while a metal&#8211;organic&#160;framework&#160;(MOF)&#8208;derived C/Cu nanocomposite decoration layer provides rich low&#8208;barrier zinc nucleation sites, thereby synergistically stabilizing zinc anodes to inhibit zinc dendrites and dendrite&#8208;caused separator failure. Investigation of the zinc affinity of the MOF&#8208;derived C/Cu nanocomposites unravels the high zincophilicity of heteroatom&#8208;containing C/Cu interfaces. Zinc anodes coupled with the FUSs present superior electrochemical stability, whose operation lifetime exceeds 2000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 600&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 40&#8211;50 times longer than that of the zinc anodes using glass&#8208;fiber separators. The reliability of the FUSs in ZIBs and zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors is also validated. This work proposes a new strategy to stabilize zinc anodes and provides theoretical guidance in developing ultrathin separators for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;based energy storage.

The separators are composed of a high-strength cellulose nanofiber substrate and a zincophilic sites-rich decoration layer, in which the former one presents uniform nanoporous structure, ion-sieving ability, and ultrathin thickness and the latter one possesses high specific surface area and abundant zincophilic sites, and thus can proactively stabilize zinc anodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin separators are indispensable to high-energy-density zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs), but their easy failure caused by zinc dendrites poses a great challenge. Herein, 23&#160;&#181;m-thick functional ultrathin separators (FUSs), realizing superb electrochemical stability of zinc anodes and outstanding long-term durability of ultrathin separators, are reported. In the FUSs, an ultrathin but mechanically strong nanoporous membrane substrate benefits fast and flux-homogenized Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, while a metal&#8211;organic&#160;framework&#160;(MOF)-derived C/Cu nanocomposite decoration layer provides rich low-barrier zinc nucleation sites, thereby synergistically stabilizing zinc anodes to inhibit zinc dendrites and dendrite-caused separator failure. Investigation of the zinc affinity of the MOF-derived C/Cu nanocomposites unravels the high zincophilicity of heteroatom-containing C/Cu interfaces. Zinc anodes coupled with the FUSs present superior electrochemical stability, whose operation lifetime exceeds 2000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 600&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 40&#8211;50 times longer than that of the zinc anodes using glass-fiber separators. The reliability of the FUSs in ZIBs and zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors is also validated. This work proposes a new strategy to stabilize zinc anodes and provides theoretical guidance in developing ultrathin separators for high-energy-density zinc-based energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Controlled Helical Quantum Sieve Chiral Spectrometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;spin&#8208;sensitive&#8208;antenna (MSSA) that is capable of separation, recognition, and selective sensing to acheive spatiotemporal identification of chiral enantiomers is reported. By integrating the MSSA with a decision&#8208;making system based on neuromorphic artificial intelligence, rapid, transportable, and wearable spectrometry can be attained to distinguish and classify chiral molecules, such as butanol, limonene, and xylene isomers, with 95&#8211;98% accuracy.








Abstract
This article reports on a molecular&#8208;spin&#8208;sensitive&#8208;antenna (MSSA) that is based on stacked layers of organically functionalized graphene on a fibrous helical cellulose network for carrying out spatiotemporal identification of chiral enantiomers. The MSSA structures combine three complementary features: (i) chiral separation via a helical quantum sieve for chiral trapping, (ii) chiral recognition by a synthetically implanted spin&#8208;sensitive center in a graphitic lattice; and (iii) chiral selectivity by a chirality&#8208;induced&#8208;spin mechanism that polarizes the local electronic band&#8208;structure in graphene through chiral&#8208;activated Rashba spin&#8211;orbit interaction field. Combining the MSSA structures with decision&#8208;making principles based on neuromorphic artificial intelligence shows fast, portable, and wearable spectrometry for the detection and classification of pure and a mixture of chiral molecules, such as butanol (S and R), limonene (S and R), and xylene isomers, with 95&#8211;98% accuracy. These results can have a broad impact where the MSSA approach is central as a precautionary risk assessment against potential hazards impacting human health and the environment due to chiral molecules; furthermore, it acts as a dynamic monitoring tool of all parts of the chiral molecule life cycles.

         <title>A Liquid Triboelectric Series</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The triboelectric series is a generally accepted method for describing the triboelectric effect. It provides a way to control the double face of the ubiquitous triboelectric effect: causes of unpredictable accidents and the resultant surface charge as energy sources. However, previous studies have been biased in solids despite being observed in liquids (liquid&#8208;solid contact electrification). Therefore, a liquid triboelectric series is necessary to be established to manipulate the liquid triboelectric effect according to the appropriate goal. In this study, a liquid triboelectric series is first established to describe the triboelectric properties of each liquid when contact electrification occurs with a solid surface. The liquid triboelectric series covers electrolytes, organic solvents, oxidants, and higher and sugar alcohols. Common chemical groups can be derived from the liquid triboelectric series that hydroxyl groups enhance, and benzene groups suppress the liquid triboelectric effect. The results are demonstrated by the amplified efficiency of an energy harvester and particle contamination after surface washing. This study will play a pivotal role in understanding the liquid&#8208;solid contact electrification phenomenon and providing new perspectives on the applications of the liquid triboelectric effect.

         <title>Zinc Single&#8208;Atom Regulated Hard Carbons for High Rate and Low Temperature Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hard carbons (HCs) as one of the most commercializable anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), have to deal with the trade&#8208;off between the rate capability and specific capacity or initial columbic efficiency (ICE), and the fast performance decline at low temperature (LT) remains poorly understood. Here, we report a comprehensive regulation on the interfacial/bulk electrochemistry of hard carbons through atomic Zn doping, which demonstrates a record&#8208;high reversible capacity (546 mAh g&#8722;1), decent ICE (84%), remarkable rate capability (140 mAh g&#8722;1 @ 50 A g&#8722;1), and excellent low&#8208;temperature (LT) capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 @ &#8208;40&#176;C), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art literature. We unveil that the Zn doping can generally induce a local electric field to enable the fast bulk Na+ transportation, and meanwhile catalyze the decomposition of NaPF6 to form a robust inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), which elaborates the underlying origin of the boosted electrochemical performance. Importantly, distinguished from room temperature, the intrinsic Na+ migration/desolvation ability of the electrolyte is disclosed to be the crucial rate&#8208;determining factors for the SIB performance at LT. This work provides a fundamental understanding on the charge storage kinetics at varied temperatures.

         <title>Single quantum dot selection and tailor&#8208;made photonic device integration using nanoscale focus pinspot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Among the diverse platforms of quantum light sources, epitaxially grown semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are one of the most attractive workhorses for realizing quantum photonic technologies owing to their outstanding brightness and scalability. However, the spatial and spectral randomness of most QDs severely hinders the construction of large&#8208;scale photonic platforms. In this work, we present a methodology to deterministically integrate single QDs with tailor&#8208;made photonic structures. We apply a nondestructive luminescence picking method termed as nanoscale focus pinspot (NFP) using helium ion microscopy to reduce the luminous QD density while retaining the surrounding medium. We extract only a single QD emission out of the high&#8208;density ensemble QDs. Then the tailor&#8208;made photonic structure of a circular Bragg reflectors (CBR) are designed and deterministically integrated with the selected QD. Given that the microscopy can image with nanoscale resolution and apply NFP in situ, photonic devices can be deterministically fabricated on target QDs. The extraction efficiency of the NFP&#8208;selected QD emission is improved by 25 times after the CBR integration. Since the NFP method only controls the luminescence without destroying the medium, it is applicable to various photonic structures such as photonic waveguides or photonic crystal cavities regardless of materials.

         <title>Gradient Electrolyte Strategy Achieving Long&#8208;life Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are plagued by a short lifespan caused by localized dendrites. The high&#8208;concentration electrolytes are favorable for dense Zn deposition but have poor performance in batteries with glass fiber separators. In contrast, the low&#8208;concentration electrolytes can wet the separators well, ensuring the migration of zinc ions, but the dendrites grow rapidly. In this work, we propose an electrolyte gradient strategy that constructs a gradient of zinc ion concentration from anode to separator, ensuring that the separator keeps a good wettability in low&#8208;concentration areas and the zinc anode achieves dendrite&#8208;free in a high concentration areas. By using this strategy in the common zinc sulfate electrolyte, Zn||Zn symmetric cell achieved 14000 ultra&#8208;long cycles (exceed 8 months) at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2. When the current was further increased to 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the symmetric cell could still run exceed 10000 cycles. Assembled Zn||NVO full cells also demonstrate prominent performance. At a high current of 16&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the NVO cathode with high loading (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) still has a capacity of 58% after 1200 cycles. Overall, the gradient electrolyte strategy provides a promising approach for practical long&#8208;life Zn anodes with the advantages of simple operation and low cost.

         <title>Towards a Novel Energy Dissipation Metamaterial with Tensegrity Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The interest in novel energy dissipation devices that offer advanced functionalities for optimal performance in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art engineering applications is growing. In this regard, a highly tunable and innovative dissipator has been developed. This dissipator features movement amplification capabilities resulting from the radial replication of a unit&#8208;cell with tensegrity architecture. The kinematic response of the dissipator has been analyzed for several layouts, by varying the number of unit&#8208;cells within the device, their internal geometry, and identifying the corresponding locking configurations. A fully operational 3D printed prototype is presented, demonstrating its excellent performance in terms of damping capabilities and feasibility. The experimental results have been used to validate a numerical model of the flower unit. This model has demonstrated the importance of pre&#8208;strain on the overall stiffness and dissipative features of the proposed system. By utilizing these numerical models, it has been shown that the proposed device can be used as a building block for more complex assemblies such as periodic metamaterials with tensegrity&#160;architecture.

Abstract
Crystal&#8208;graph attention neural networks have emerged recently as remarkable tools for the prediction of thermodynamic stability. The efficacy of their learning capabilities and their reliability is however subject to the quantity and quality of the data they are fed. Previous networks exhibited strong biases due to the inhomogeneity of the training data. Here we&#160;engineer a high&#8208;quality dataset to provide a better balance across chemical and crystal&#8208;symmetry space. Crystal&#8208;graph neural networks trained with this dataset show unprecedented generalization accuracy. We&#160;applied such networks to perform machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted high&#8208;throughput searches of stable materials, spanning 1 billion candidates. In this way we&#160;increase the number of vertices of the global T = 0&#160;K phase diagram by 30% and find more than &#8764;150&#160;000 compounds with a distance to the convex hull of stability of less than 50&#160;meV/atom. We&#160;then assess the discovered materials for applications, identifying compounds with extreme values of a few properties, such as superconductivity, superhardness, and giant gap&#8208;deformation potentials.

         <title>Bifunctional ultrathin RhRu0.5 alloy nanowire electrocatalysts for hydrazine assisted water splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hydrazine assisted water electrolysis offers a feasible path for low&#8208;voltage green hydrogen production. Herein w e report the design and synthesis of ultrathin RhRu0.5 alloy wavy nanowires as bifunctional electrocatalysts for both anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). W e show that the RhRu0.5 alloy wavy nanowires can achieve total electrooxidation of hydrazine with lower overpotential and high mass activity as well as improved performance for HER, which together, leads to ultrahigh performance for hydrazine assisted water electrolysis, with ultralow cell voltage of 54&#160;mV at current density of 100&#160;mA/cm2 and ultrahigh current density of 853&#160;mA/cm2 at a cell voltage of 0.6&#160;V. The resulting electrocatalysts further demonstrate a stable operation at a high current density of 100&#160;mA/cm2 for 80 hours of testing period with little degradation. The overall performance not only far exceeds the performances of the previously reported hydrazine assisted water electrolyzers, but also equivalent to a high turnover frequency (TOF) value of 1618/h for catalytic hydrazine decomposition at room temperature, which outperforms many previously reported catalysts (TOF &lt; 500/h at room temperature).

         <title>Visualizing the atomic configuration of carbonate groups in a (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948; superconductor</title>

Abstract
Carbonates (CO32&#8722;) have always been known as impurities to degrade the superconductivity in cuprate high&#8208;Tc superconductors. Herein, the atomic arrangement of carbonates is directly visualized in (Cu,C)Ba2Ca3Cu4O11+&#948; via integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) combined with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art scanning transmission electron microscopy. The carbon atoms replace Cu atoms in the charge&#8208;reservoir layers, contributing to the formation of carbonates through strong orbital hybridization with the surrounding oxygen atoms. Using first&#8208;principles calculations, the spatial configuration of carbonate groups is confirmed and their influence on local crystal lattice and electronic states are further investigated. The carbonates not only accommodate the distortions by improving the flatness of outer CuO2 layers but also reduce the density of states at the Fermi level. These two factors play competitive roles to affect the superconductivity. Our study provides direct evidence of the presence of CO32&#8722; groups and gains an insight into the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in oxycarbonate superconductors.

         <title>Stacking Faults Inducing Oxygen Anion Activities in Li2MnO3</title>

Abstract
Controllable anionic redox for a transformational increase in the energy density is the pursuit of next generation Li&#8208;ion battery cathode materials. Its activation mechanism is coupled with the local coordination environment around O, which posts experimental challenges for control. Here w e show the tuning capability of anionic redox by varying O local environment via experimentally controlling the density of stacking faults in Li2MnO3, the parent compound of Li&#8208;rich oxides. By combining computational analysis and spectroscopic study, w e quantitatively reveal that more stacking faults can trigger smaller Li&#8208;O&#8208;Li bond angles and larger Li&#8208;O bond distance in local Li&#8208;rich environments and subsequently activate oxygen redox reactivity, which, in turn enhances the reactivity of Mn upon the following reduction process. This study highlights the critical role of local structure environment in tunning the anionic reactivity, which provides guidance in designing high&#8208;capacity layered cathodes by appropriately adjusting stacking faults.

         <title>Molecular Locking with All&#8208;Organic Surface Modifiers Enables Stable and Efficient Slot&#8208;Die Coated Methyl&#8208;Ammonium&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Modules</title>

Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art large area slot die&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is now over 19%, but issues with their stability persist owing to significant intrinsic point defects and a mass of surface imperfections introduced during fabrication process. We report the utilization of a hydrophobic all&#8208;organic salt to modify the top surface of large area slot&#8208;die coated methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free halide perovskite layers. Bearing two molecules, each of which is endowed with anchoring groups capable of exhibiting secondary interactions with the perovskite surfaces, the organic salt acts as a molecular lock by effectively binding to both anion and cation vacancies, substantially enhancing the materials&#8217; intrinsic stability against different stimuli. It not only reduces the ingression of external species such as oxygen and moisture, but also suppresses the egress of volatile organic components during the thermal stability testing. The treated PSCs demonstrate efficiency of 19.28% (active area of 58.5 cm2) and 17.62% (aperture area of 64 cm2) for the corresponding mini&#8208;module. More importantly, unencapsulated slot&#8208;die coated mini&#8208;modules incorporating the all&#8208;organic surface modifier show &#8764;80% efficiency retention after 7,500 hours (313 days) of storage under 30% relative humidity (RH). They also remarkably retain more than 90% of the initial efficiency for over 850 hours while being measured continuously.

         <title>Protophilic MOF Enables Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium Battery Stable Cycling in a High Water/Acid Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Trace protic impurities, such as water and hydrofluoric acid (HF), can severely degrade the stable and long cycling of lithium batteries. Therefore, the costly water removal process is inevitably needed throughout production of lithium batteries, leaving the paradox that energy&#8208;saving lithium battery technology consumes nonnegligible amounts of energy. Herein, we report a unique ionic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) enables highly destructive H2O/HF&#8208;tolerance lithium batteries. The isolated ionic fluorine sites in MOF exhibit unusual protophilicity and efficiently capture ppm&#8208;levels H2O/HF from the highly polar electrolyte solvents. The resulting MOF&#8208;based LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2&#9474;Li battery achieves over 300 cycles in the presence of 800&#160;ppm H2O or 1107&#160;ppm acidic impurity. This 10&#8208;fold longer battery lifespan relative to those for batteries with conventional standard separators demonstrates its excellent electrochemical cycling performance. Our results reveal that the rational use of unique nanoporous features of MOFs could provide new possibilities for long&#8208;standing challenges in the lithium battery industry.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Flux X&#8208;Ray Detection by Solution&#8208;Grown Perovskite CsPbBr3 Single Crystal Semiconductor Detector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed perovskites are promising for hard X&#8208;ray and gamma ray detection, but there has been limited reports on their performance under extremely intense X&#8208;rays. Here, we report a solution&#8208;grown all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 single crystal semiconductor detector capable of operating at ultra&#8208;high X&#8208;ray flux of 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2. High&#8208;quality solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 single crystals were fabricated into detectors with a Schottky diode structure of eutectic gallium indium/CsPbBr3/Au. A high reverse bias voltage of 1000&#160;V (435&#160;V mm&#8722;1) can be applied with a small and stable dark current of &#8764; 60 &#8211; 70 nA (&#8764; 9 &#8211; 10 nA mm&#8722;2), which enabled a high sensitivity larger than 10000 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a simultaneous low detection limit of 22 nGyair s&#8722;1. The CsPbBr3 semiconductor detector showed an excellent photocurrent linearity and reproducibility under 58.61&#160;keV synchrotron X&#8208;ray with flux from 106 to 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2. Defect characterization by thermally stimulated current spectroscopy showed a similar low defect density of a synchrotron X&#8208;ray and a lab X&#8208;ray irradiated device. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy suggests that the excellent performance of the solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 single crystal may be associated with its good short&#8208;range order, comparable to the spectrometer&#8208;grade melt&#8208;grown CsPbBr3.

         <title>A Novel Ultra&#8208;wideband Electromagnetic Wave&#8208;absorbing Metastructure Inspired by Bionic Gyroid Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Traditional honeycomb&#8208;like structural electromagnetic (EM) wave&#8208;absorbing materials have been widely used in various equipment as multifunctional materials. However, current EM wave&#8208;absorbing materials are limited by narrow absorption bandwidths and incident angles because of anisotropic structural morphology. The work presented here proposes a novel EM wave&#8208;absorbing metastructure with an isotropic morphology inspired by the gyroid microstructures seen in Parides sesostris butterfly wings. A matching redesign methodology between the material and subwavelength scale properties of the gyroid microstructure is proposed, inspired by the interaction mechanism between microstructure and material properties on the EM wave&#8208;absorption performance of the prepared metastructure. Bioinspired metastructure is fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM) and subsequent coating through dipping processes, filled with dielectric lossy materials. Based on simulations and experiments, the metastructure designed in this work exhibits an ultra&#8208;wide absorption bandwidth covering the frequency range of 2&#8211;40&#160;GHz with a fractional bandwidth of 180% at normal incidence. Moreover, the metastructure has a stable frequency response when the incident angle is 60&#176; under the transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarization. Finally, the synergistic mechanism between microstructure and material is elucidated, which provides a new paradigm for the design of novel ultra&#8208;broadband EM absorbing materials.

         <title>Short Peptide Nanofiber Biomaterials Ameliorate Local Hemostatic Capacity of Surgical Materials and Intraoperative Hemostatic Applications in Clinics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Short designer self&#8208;assembling peptide (dSAP) biomaterials are a new addition to hemostat group. It may provide diverse and robust toolboxes for surgeon to integrate wound microenvironment with much safer and stronger hemostatic capacity than conventional materials and hemostatic agents. Especially in noncompressible torso hemorrhage (NCTH), diffuse mucosal surface bleeding, and internal medical bleeding (IMB), et&#160;al., with respect to the optimal hemostatic formulation, dSAP biomaterials are the ingenious nanofiber alternatives to make bioactive neural scaffold, nasal packing, large mucosal surface coverage in gastrointestinal surgery (esophagus, gastric lesion, duodenum, and lower digestive tract), epicardiac cell delivery carrier, transparent matrix barrier, et&#160;al. Herein, in multiple surgical specialties, dSAP biomaterials&#8208;based nano hemostats achieve safe, effective and immediate hemostasis, facile wound healing, and potentially reduce the risks in delayed bleeding, rebleeding, postoperative bleeding or related complications. The biosafety in vivo, bleeding indications, tissue&#8208;sealing quality, surgical feasibility, and local usability are addressed comprehensively and sequentially and pursued to develop useful surgical techniques with better hemostatic performance. This article provides the state of art and all&#8208;round advancements of nano hemostatic approaches in surgery. Relevant critical insights will inspire exciting investigations on peptide nanotechnology, next&#8208;generation biomaterials, and better promising prospects in clinics.

         <title>Magnetic&#8211;Acoustic Sequentially Actuated CAR T Cell Microrobots for Precision Navigation and In Situ Antitumor Immunoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
M&#8208;CAR Ts are created by decorating CAR T cells with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation, and they are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and antitumor immune responses, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated CAR T. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Despite its clinical success, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T)&#8208;cell immunotherapy remains limited in solid tumors, owing to the harsh physical barriers and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here a CAR&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;based live microrobot (M&#8208;CAR T) is created by decorating CAR T with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation. M&#8208;CAR Ts are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and in situ activation of antitumor immune responses. Sequential actuation endows M&#8208;CAR Ts with magnetically actuated anti&#8208;flow and obstacle avoidance as well as tissue penetration driven by acoustic propulsion, enabling efficient migration and accumulation in artificial tumor models. In vivo, sequentially actuated M&#8208;CAR Ts achieves long&#8208;distance targeting and accumulate at the peritumoural area under programmable magnetic guidance, and subsequently acoustic tweezers actuate M&#8208;CAR Ts to migrate&#160;into deep tumor tissues, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated exogenous CD8+ CAR T cells compared with that without actuation. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy. Thus, this&#160;sequential&#8208;actuation&#8208;guided cell microrobot combines the merits of autonomous targeting and penetration of intelligent robots with in situ T&#8208;cell immunoactivation, and holds considerable promise for precision navigation and cancer immunotherapies.

Thus, this&#160;sequential-actuation-guided cell microrobot combines the merits of autonomous targeting and penetration of intelligent robots with in situ T-cell immunoactivation, and holds considerable promise for precision navigation and cancer immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Effects of Multiple Ion Reactions Based on a CoSe2/MXene Cathode in Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aluminum&#8208;ion cathode material based on an array&#160;of&#160;MXene lamellar CoSe2 nanoparticles is designed and synthesized. The lattice distortion brought by the AlCl4&#8722; ion embedding has a serious impact on the initial stability of the battery, and such distortion consumes extra energy, making it difficult for the Coulombic efficiency to reach close to 100%.








Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (RAIBs) have emerged as a promising battery storage technology owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, operational safety, and high energy density. However, their actual capacity is substantially lower than their true capacity and their cycling stability is poor. Therefore, understanding the energy&#8208;storage mechanism may contribute to the successful design of a stable electrode material, on which the performance can be optimized. The aim of this study is to investigate AlCl4&#8722; ions in transition metal cathode materials and mechanisms that enable for their high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage potential and low Coulombic efficiency. Results of theoretical analysis and experimental verification show that a multi&#8208;ion transport mechanism is responsible for the electrochemical behavior of the battery. The lattice distortion of CoSe2 caused by AlCl4&#8722; ion intercalation, has a considerable effect on the initial stability of the battery. MXene as a support material reduces the size of CoSe2 growing on its surface, effectively inhibiting the lattice distortion caused by the interaction with the aluminum&#8208;anion complex, thus addressing the issues of poor reversibility, cycle instability, and low Coulombic efficiency of the battery. Hence, understanding the impact of MXene on the battery may aid in further improving the design of electrode materials.

         <title>Mobile Trions in Electrically Tunable 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically controlled, bipolar tuning of the excitonic light emission is achieved in 2D perovskites via the field effect in a van der Waals heterostructure. The formation of trions with exceptionally high binding energies up to 46&#160;meV is demonstrated. Localized at liquid helium temperature, these charged excitons become mobile toward 50&#160;K with effective mobilities up to 200 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
2D hybrid perovskites are currently in the spotlight of material research for light&#8208;harvesting and &#8208;emitting applications. It remains extremely challenging, however, to externally control their optical response due to the difficulties of introducing electrical doping. Here, an approach of interfacing ultrathin sheets of perovskites with few&#8208;layer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride into gate&#8208;tunable, hybrid heterostructures, is demonstrated. It allows for bipolar, continuous tuning of light emission and absorption in 2D perovskites by electrically injecting carriers to densities as high as 1012&#160;cm&#8722;2. This reveals the emergence of both negatively and positively charged excitons, or trions, with binding energies up to 46&#160;meV, among the highest measured for 2D systems. Trions are shown to dominate light emission and propagate with mobilities reaching 200&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at elevated temperatures. The findings introduce the physics of interacting mixtures of optical and electrical excitations to the broad family of 2D inorganic&#8211;organic nanostructures. The presented strategy to electrically control the optical response of 2D perovskites highlights it as a promising material platform toward electrically modulated light&#8208;emitters, externally guided charged exciton currents, and exciton transistors based on layered, hybrid&#160;semiconductors.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast Piezocatalysts Enabled By Interfacial Interaction of Reduced Graphene Oxide/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rGO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure (GMH) shows a record&#8208;high piezo&#8208;catalytic degradation rate and can totally degrade the organic dyes within 50 s. The fundamental interfacial phenomena and the charge transfer in GMH are carefully examined by theoretical and experimental methods. It opens a new door for creation of new piezo&#8208;catalysts and toward a deeper understanding of the mechanism of piezo&#8208;catalysis.








Abstract
The catalytic activity has been investigated in 2D materials, and the unique structural and electronic properties contribute to their success in conventional heterogeneous catalysis. Heterojunction&#8208;based piezocatalysis has attracted increasing attention due to the band&#8208;structure engineering and the enhanced charge carrier separation by prominent piezoelectric effect. However, the piezocatalytic behavior of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is still unknown, and the finite active sites, catalyst poisoning, and poor conductivity are challenges for developing good piezocatalysts. Herein, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure is rationally designed to tackle these challenges. The heterostructure shows a record&#8208;high piezocatalytic degradation rate of 1.40 &#215; 102 L mol&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is 7.86 times higher than MoS2 nanosheets. Piezoresponse force microscope measurements and density functional theory calculation reveal that the coupling between semiconductive and piezoelectric properties in the vdW heterojunction is vital to break the metallic state screening effect at the MoS2 edge for keeping the piezoelectric potential. The dynamic charges generated by MoS2 and the fast charge transfer in rGO activate and maintain catalytically active sites for pollutant degradation with an ultra&#8208;fast rate and good stability. The working mechanism opens new avenues for developing efficient catalysts significant to wastewater treatments and other applications.

         <title>Tailoring Molecular&#8208;Scale Contact at Perovskite/Polymeric Hole Transporting Material Interface for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have delivered more than 25% of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and incorporating polymers as hole transporting layers (HTLs) can further enhance the stability of devices towards the goal of commercialization. Among various polymeric hole transporting materials, poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) is one of the promising HTL candidates with good stability; however, the hydrophobicity of PTAA causes problematic interfacial contact with perovskite, limiting the device performance. Using molecular side&#8208;chain engineering, we successfully constructed a uniform two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite interlayer with conjugated ligands, between three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites and PTAA. Further, employing conjugated ligands as cohesive elements, perovskite/PTAA interfacial adhesion was significantly improved. As a result, the thin and lateral extended 2D/3D heterostructure enabled the as&#8208;fabricated PTAA&#8208;based PSCs to achieve a PCE of 23.7%, improved from the 18% of reference devices. Owing to the increased ion migration energy barrier and conformal 2D coating, unencapsulated devices with the new ligands exhibited both superior thermal stability under 60&#176;C heating and moisture stability in ambient conditions.

         <title>RAINBOW Organic Solar Cells: Implementing Spectral Splitting in Lateral Multi&#8208;Junction Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While multi&#8208;junction geometries have the potential to boost the efficiency of organic solar cells, the experimental gains yet obtained are still very modest. This work proposes an alternative spectral splitting device concept in which various individual semiconducting junctions with cascading band gaps are laid side by side, thus the name RAINBOW. Each lateral sub&#8208;cell receives a fraction of the spectrum that closely matches the main absorption band of the given semiconductor. Here, simulations are used to identify the important material and device properties of each RAINBOW sub&#8208;cell. Using the resulting design rules, three systems are selected, namely PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;2F:IO&#8208;4Cl, PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;2F:Y6 and PTB7&#8208;Th:COTIC&#8208;4F, and their potential as sub&#8208;cells in this geometry is experimentally investigated. With the aid of a custom built setup that generates spectrally spread sunlight on demand, the simulations are experimentally validated, showing that this geometry can lead to a reduction in thermalization losses and an improvement in light harvesting, which results in a relative improvement in efficiency of 46.6% with respect to the best sub&#8208;cell. Finally, a working proof of concept monolithic device consisting of two sub&#8208;cells deposited from solution on the same substrate is fabricated, thus demonstrating the feasibility and the potential of the RAINBOW solar cell concept.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While multi-junction geometries have the potential to boost the efficiency of organic solar cells, the experimental gains yet obtained are still very modest. This work proposes an alternative spectral splitting device concept in which various individual semiconducting junctions with cascading band gaps are laid side by side, thus the name RAINBOW. Each lateral sub-cell receives a fraction of the spectrum that closely matches the main absorption band of the given semiconductor. Here, simulations are used to identify the important material and device properties of each RAINBOW sub-cell. Using the resulting design rules, three systems are selected, namely PBDB-T-2F:IO-4Cl, PBDB-T-2F:Y6 and PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F, and their potential as sub-cells in this geometry is experimentally investigated. With the aid of a custom built setup that generates spectrally spread sunlight on demand, the simulations are experimentally validated, showing that this geometry can lead to a reduction in thermalization losses and an improvement in light harvesting, which results in a relative improvement in efficiency of 46.6% with respect to the best sub-cell. Finally, a working proof of concept monolithic device consisting of two sub-cells deposited from solution on the same substrate is fabricated, thus demonstrating the feasibility and the potential of the RAINBOW solar cell concept.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bifunctional Gas Diffusion Electrode Enables In&#8208;situ Separation and Conversion of CO2 to Ethylene from Dilute Stream</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The requirement of concentrated CO2 feedstock significantly limits the economic feasibility of electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) as it often involves multiple intermediate processes, including CO2 capture, energy intensive regeneration, compression, and transportation steps. Herein, we report on a bifunctional gas diffusion electrode (BGDE) for separation and electrolysis of CO2 from a low concentration CO2 stream (&#8764;10 vol%). We demonstrate a BGDE for selective production of ethylene (C2H4) by combining high density polyethylene&#8208;derived porous carbon (HPC) as a physisorbent with polycrystalline copper as conversion catalyst. Our BGDE shows substantial tolerance to 10 vol% CO2 exhibiting a Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;45% towards C2H4 at a current density of 80&#160;mA/cm2 over 11&#160;hrs, outperforming previous reports that utilised such partial pressure (PCO2 = 0.1 atm and above) at ambient conditions and unaltered polycrystalline copper as catalyst. Molecular dynamics simulation and mixed gas permeability assessment reveal that such selective performance is ensured by high CO2 uptake of microporous HPC as well as continuous desorption owing to molecular diffusion and concentration gradient created by binary flow (CO2|N2) within sorbent boundary. We conclude based on detailed technoeconomic analysis that our in&#8208;situ process has the potential to be economically compelling by precluding the C2H4 production cost associated with the energy intensive intermediate steps of conventional decoupled process.

         <title>Ti3C2Tx MXene van der Waals gate contact for GaN high electron mobility transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gate controllability is a key factor that determines the performance of GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs). However, at traditional metal&#8208;GaN interface, direct chemical interaction between metal and GaN can result in fixed charges and traps, which can significantly deteriorate the gate controllability. In this study, Ti3C2Tx MXene films were integrated into GaN HEMTs as the gate contact, wherein van der Waals heterojunctions were formed between MXene films and GaN without direct chemical bonding. The GaN HEMTs with enhanced gate controllability exhibited an extremely low off&#8208;state current (IOFF) of 10&#8722;7&#160;mA/mm, a record high ION/IOFF current ratio of &#8764;1013 (which is six orders of magnitude higher than conventional Ni/Au contact), a high off&#8208;state drain breakdown voltage of 1085&#160;V, and a near&#8208;ideal subthreshold swing of 61&#160;mV/dec. This work shows the great potential of MXene films as gate electrodes in wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor devices.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated High&#8208;Entropy MXenes Nanotherapeutics: NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Enhanced Intrinsic Oxidase Mimic Activity to Combat Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infection</title>

Abstract
Bacterial infections, such as bacterial keratitis (BK) and subcutaneous abscess, pose significant challenges to global healthcare. Innovative and new antibacterial agents and antibacterial strategies are in demand to control infections in this era of high drug resistance. Nanotechnology gradually emerged as an economically feasible and effective anti&#8208;infection treatment. High&#8208;entropy MXenes (HE MXenes) are used to confer desirable properties with exposed active sites to high&#8208;entropy atomic layers, whose potential application in the field of biomedicine remains to be explored. Herein, we fabricate the monolayer HE MXenes by implementing transition metals with high entropy and low Gibbs free energy to fill the gap in the biocatalytic performance of non&#8208;high&#8208;entropy MXenes. HE MXenes are endowed with extremely strong oxidase mimic activity (Km = 0.227&#160;mM) and photothermal conversion efficiency (65.8%) in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) biowindow as entropy increases. Subsequently, HE MXenes realize NIR&#8208;II&#8208;enhanced intrinsic oxidase mimic activity for killing methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus and rapidly removing the biofilm. Furthermore, HE MXenes can effectively treat BK and subcutaneous abscess infection induced by MRSA as nanotherapeutic agents with minuscule side effects. Overall, monolayer HE MXenes demonstrate promising clinical application potential in the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections and promote the healing of infected tissues.

         <title>Reconfigurable Multilevel Optical PUF by Spatiotemporally Programmed Crystallization of Supersaturated Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Physical unclonable function (PUF) is emerging as an alternative to information security by providing an advanced level of cryptographic keys with non&#8208;replicable characteristics, yet the cryptographic keys of the conventional PUFs are not reconfigurable from the ones assigned at the manufacturing stage and the overall authentication process slows down as the number of entities in the dataset or the length of cryptographic key increases. Herein, we present a supersaturated solution&#8208;based PUF (S&#8208;PUF) that utilizes stochastic crystallization of a supersaturated sodium acetate solution to allow a time&#8208;efficient, hierarchical authentication process together with on&#8208;demand rewritability of cryptographic keys. By controlling the orientation and the average grain size of the sodium acetate crystals via a spatiotemporally programmed temperature profile, S&#8208;PUF now includes two global variables, i.e., angle of rotation and divergence of the diffracted beam, in addition to the speckle pattern to produce multilevel cryptographic keys, and these variables function as prefixes for the classification of each entity for a fast authentication process. At the same time, the reversible phase change of sodium acetate enables repeated reconfiguration of the cryptographic key, which is expected to offer new possibilities for a next&#8208;generation, recyclable anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform.

Abstract
Negative capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) have gathered enormous interest as a way to reduce subthreshold swing (SS) and overcome the issue of power dissipation in modern integrated circuits. For stable NC behavior at low operating voltages, the development of ultrathin ferroelectrics, which are compatible with the industrial process, is of great interest. Here, we develop a new scalable ultrathin ferroelectric polymer layer based on CCl3&#8208;terminated P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) to achieve the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of NC&#8208;FETs. The crystalline phase of 5&#8764;10&#160;nm ultrathin P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) is prepared on AlOX by a newly&#8208;developed brush method, which enables a ferroelectric (FE)/dielectric (DE) bilayer. FE/DE thickness ratios are then systematically tuned at ease to achieve ideal capacitance matching. NC&#8208;FETs with optimized FE/DE thickness at thickness limit demonstrate hysteresis&#8208;free operation with SS of 28&#160;mV/dec at &#8764;1.5&#160;V, which competes with the best reports. Our P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;brush layer can be broadly adapted to NC&#8208;FETs, opening an exciting avenue for low&#8208;power devices.

         <title>A Biocompatible Supercapacitor Diode with Enhanced Rectification Capability towards Ion/Electron Coupling Logic Operations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The main challenge faced by the forthcoming human&#8208;computer interaction is that biological system and electronic device adopt two different information carriers, i.e., ions and electrons, respectively. To bridge the gap between these two systems, developing ion/electron coupling devices for logic operation is a feasible and effective approach. Accordingly, we herein develop a supercapacitor&#8208;based ionic diode (CAPode) that takes electrochemically amorphized molybdenum oxide as the working electrode. Benefiting from its unique size and charge dual ion&#8208;sieving effects, the molybdenum oxide electrode exhibits a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of 136, which is over 10 times higher than those of reported systems. It also delivers an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 448 F g&#8722;1 and an excellent cycling stability of up to 20,000 cycles, greatly outperforming those of previous works. These excellent rectification capability and electrochemical performances allow the as&#8208;built CAPode to work well in AND and OR logic gates, validating great potential in ion/electron coupling logic operations. More attractively, the superior biocompatibilities of molybdenum oxide and relevant constituent materials enable the constructed CAPode to be applied as bioelectronics without regard to biosafety, paving a new way towards forthcoming human&#8208;computer interaction.

         <title>Toughening Double Network Hydrogels by Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hoffmeister effect of inorganic salts has been verified as a promising way to toughen hydrogels, however, the high concentration of inorganic salts may accompany by poor biocompatibility. In this work, for the first time, we find that polyelectrolytes can obviously elevate the mechanical performances of hydrogels through Hoffmeister effect. The introduction of anionic poly(sodium acrylate) (P(iAA)) into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel induces the aggregation and crystallization of PVA to boost the mechanical properties of the resulting double network hydrogel: elevation of 73, 64, 28, 135, and 19 times in the tensile strength, compressive strength, Young's modulus, toughness, and fracture energy compared with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), respectively. It is noteworthy that the mechanical performances of the hydrogels can be flexibly tuned by the variation of polyelectrolyte concentration, ionization degree, relative hydrophobicity of the ionic component and polyelectrolyte type in a wide range. This strategy is verified to work for other Hoffmeister effect&#8208;sensitive polymers and polyelectrolytes. Also, the introduction of urea bonds into polyelectrolytes can further improve the mechanical properties and anti&#8208;swelling capability of hydrogels. As a biomedical patch, the advanced hydrogel can efficiently inhibit hernia formation and promote the regeneration of soft tissues in abdominal wall defect model.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.

         <title>Unified Therapeutic&#8208;Prophylactic Tissue Engineering Scaffold Demonstrated to Prevent Tumor Recurrence and Overcoming Infection toward Bone Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Osteosarcoma occurs in children and adolescents frequently and leads to a high fatality rate. Although surgical resection is the most common methods in clinic, patients always suffer from tumor metastasis and recurrence and the large bone defects are difficulty for the patients to self&#8208;repair. Furthermore, the postoperative infection from bacteria triggers an inflammatory response and hinders the bone&#8208;repair process. This work demonstrates a gadolinium (Gd)&#8208;complex and molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) co&#8208;doped N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA)/gelatin methacrylate (Gel&#8208;MA) multifunctional hydrogel (GMNG). The combination between NAGA and Gel&#8208;MA endows the GMNG with attractive mechanical properties and controllable degradation ability. The MoS2 improve the hydrogel system with excellent photothermal ability to kill tumor cells and inhibit bacterial infection both in vitro and in vivo. Based on Gd&#8208;complex, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) effect can be used to monitor the position and degradation situation of the hydrogel. Notably, accompanied by the degradation of GMNG hydrogel, the gradual released Gd3+ from the hydrogel exhibits osteogenic property and could promote new bone formation efficiently in vivo. Therefore, our strategy supplies a method to prepare multifunctional bone defect repair materials and is expected to play a significant guidance and reference to the development of biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.
Osteosarcoma, a kind of malignant bone tumors, is considered to be an extremely challenging disease in clinic due to the high probability of recurrence and metastasis, leading to the 5&#8208;year overall survival rate of less than 20%.[1] Resection surgery is the traditional and most useful strategy to cure osteosarcoma, however, tumor recurrence and postoperative infection is one of the problems faced by patients after surgery. Although radiotherapy and chemotherapy have been used in clinic, systemic side effects are still inevitable.[2] Faced with such a situation, photothermal therapy (PTT), a non&#8208;invasive treatment, is of great interest to researchers and has been applied in wound healing,[3] cancer therapy,[4] metabolism adjustment,[5] and so on. Based on the reliable tissue penetration, high energy, and almost no thermal damage to the skin, 808&#160;nm near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light has been widely applied in the medical field as a trigger for the photothermal effect.[7] Meanwhile, a series of photothermal materials have been discovered, such as black phosphorus (BP),[7] MXene,[8] black titanium dioxide,[9] etc. Molybdenum sulfide (MoS2), a well&#8208;known 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) that is easily prepared by a hydrothermal method and has good photothermal conversion efficiency,[10] will be used in our system as the photothermal agent to prevent osteosarcoma recurrence and even bacterial infection after artificial material implantation. Compared with the mechanical exfoliation and chemical vapor deposition methods for the preparation of monolayer MoS2 nanosheets, solution&#8208;based methods show some advantages such as high yields and relatively mild reaction conditions. It can be subdivided into liquid phase exfoliation (top&#8208;down method) and wet chemical synthesis (bottom&#8208;up method). The liquid phase exfoliation method is limited by the addition of multiple chemicals such as reaction reagents, solvents or surfactants, and its yield and quality become difficulty to control. In contrast, the wet chemical method is a typical bottom&#8208;up process to prepare MoS2 nanosheets. This strategy has the following advantages: a) the precursors are inexpensive metal salts; b) the prepared MoS2 nanosheets are uniform in size and high in yield; c) they can be easily dispersed and separated; and d) the diverse chemical properties and solubility provide a rich platform for chemical functionalization in solution and hybridization with other materials.[11] Thus, MoS2 prepared by the wet chemical synthesis method show some prospects as photothermal materials. In addition, it has been confirmed that mild heat stimulation (40&#8208;45&#176;C) can promote cell viability, leading to a self&#8208;healing or regeneration of skin, blood vessels and bone; moderate heat stimulation (45&#8208;50&#176;C) can kill tumor and bacteria effectively by inducing the collapse of cytomembranes and inactivation of protein without influencing normal cells; while excessive thermal exposure (&gt;55&#176;C) would cause tissue burns and should be avoided.[12] Therefore, the influence of power density and photothermal agent concentration will also be discussed in our system.

         <title>Rapid and Direct Liquid&#8208;Phase Synthesis of Luminescent Metal Halide Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward strategy to rapidly and directly crystallize luminescent metal halide nanocrystals into close&#8208;packed face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) superlattices during the liquid&#8208;phase synthesis is demonstrated. The concomitant nanocrystal growth and superlattice formation process is governed by the interplay between the nanocrystal size and surface&#8208;coating ligand.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A straightforward strategy to rapidly and directly crystallize luminescent metal halide nanocrystals into close-packed face-centered-cubic (FCC) superlattices during the liquid-phase synthesis is demonstrated. The concomitant nanocrystal growth and superlattice formation process is governed by the interplay between the nanocrystal size and surface-coating ligand.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Preventing Vanishing Gradient Problem of Hardware Neuromorphic System by Implementing Imidazole&#8208;Based Memristive ReLU Activation Neuron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
With advances in artificial intelligent services, brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic systems with synaptic devices have recently attracted significant interest to circumvent the von Neumann bottleneck. However, the increasing trend of deep neural network parameters causes huge power consumption and large area overhead of a nonlinear neuron electronic circuit, and it incurs a vanishing gradient problem. Here, we present a memristor&#8208;based compact and energy&#8208;efficient neuron device to implement a rectifying linear unit (ReLU) activation function. To emulate the volatile and gradual switching of the ReLU function, we propose a copolymer memristor with a hybrid structure using a copolymer/inorganic bilayer. The functional copolymer film developed by introducing imidazole functional groups enables the formation of nanocluster&#8208;type pseudo&#8208;conductive filaments by boosting the nucleation of Cu nanoclusters, causing gradual switching. The ReLU neuron device is successfully demonstrated by integrating the memristor with an amorphous InGaZnO thin&#8208;film transistors, and achieves 0.5 pJ of energy consumption based on sub&#8208;10&#160;&#956;A operation current and high&#8208;speed switching of 650&#160;ns. Furthermore, device&#8208;to&#8208;system&#8208;level simulation using neuron devices on the MNIST dataset demonstrates that the vanishing gradient problem is effectively resolved by five&#8208;layer deep neural networks. The proposed neuron device will enable the implementation of high&#8208;density and energy&#8208;efficient hardware neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Light&#8208;driven Self&#8208;recruitment of Biomimetic Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Precise Tumor Vascular Disruption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tumor vascular disrupting therapy has offered promising opportunities to treat cancer in clinical practice, whereas the overall therapeutic efficacy is notably limited due to the off&#8208;target effects and repeated dose toxicity of vascular disrupting agents (VDAs). To tackle this problem, we herein report a VDA&#8208;free biomimetic semiconducting polymer nanoparticle (SPNP) for precise tumor vascular disruption through two&#8208;stage light manipulation. SPNP consists of a semiconducting polymer nanoparticle as the photothermal agent camouflaged with platelet membranes that specifically target disrupted vasculature. Upon the first photoirradiation, SPNP administered in vivo generates mild hyperthermia to trigger tumor vascular hemorrhage, which activates the coagulation cascade and recruits more SPNP to injured blood vessels. Such enhanced tumor vascular targeting of photothermal agents enables intense hyperthermia to destroy the tumor vasculature during the second photoirradiation, leading to complete tumor eradication and efficient metastasis inhibition. Intriguingly, the mechanism study revealed that this vascular disruption strategy alleviates splenomegaly and reverses the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by reducing myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells. Therefore, this study not only illustrates a light&#8208;driven self&#8208;recruitment strategy to enhance tumor vascular disruption via a single dose of biomimetic therapeutics but also deciphers the immunotherapeutic role of vascular disruption therapy that is conducive to clinical studies.

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Adsorption and Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Supramolecular polymers have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their perfect combination of supramolecular chemistry and traditional polymer chemistry. The design and synthesis of macrocycles have driven the rapid development of supramolecular chemistry and polymer science. Pillar[n]arenes, a new generation of macrocyclic compounds possessing unique pillar&#8208;shaped structures, nano&#8208;sized cavities, multi&#8208;functionalized groups, and excellent host&#8211;guest complexation abilities, are promising candidates to construct supramolecular polymer materials with enhanced properties and functionalities. This review summarizes recent progress in the design and synthesis of pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (PSPs) and illustrates their diverse applications as adsorption and separation materials. All performances are evaluated and analyzed in terms of efficiency, selectivity, and recyclability. Typically, PSPs can be categorized into three typical types according to their topologies, including linear, cross&#8208;linked, and hybrid structures. The advances made in the area of functional supramolecular polymeric adsorbents formed by novel pillararene derivatives are also described in detail. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives of PSPs for separation&#8208;based materials science are discussed. We&#160;envision that this review will inspire new researchers in different fields and stimulate creative designs of supramolecular polymeric materials based on pillararenes and other macrocycles for effective adsorption and separation of a variety of targets.

         <title>Unveiling strong ion&#8208;electron&#8208;lattice coupling and electronic antidoping in hydrogenated perovskite nickelate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Despite highly promising for applications in emergent electronic devices, decoding ion&#8208;electron&#8208;lattice coupling in correlated materials at atomic scale and electronic band structure remains a big challenge due to the strong and complex correlation among these degrees of freedom. Here, taking epitaxial thin film of perovskite nickelate NdNiO3 as a model system, hydrogen ion induced giant lattice distortion and enhanced NiO6 octahedra rotation were demonstrated, which leads to a new robust hydrogenated HNdNiO3 phase with lattice expansion larger than 10% on a series of substrates. Moreover, under the effect of ion&#8208;electron synergistic doping, it is found that the proposed electronic antidoping, i.e., the doped electrons mainly fill the ground&#8208;state oxygen 2p holes instead of changing Ni oxidation state from Ni3+ to Ni2+, dominates the metal&#8208;insulator transition. While the lattice modification with enhanced Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ni bond rotation mainly modifies the orbital density of states near the Fermi level. Lastly, by electric&#8208;field controlled hydrogen ion intercalation and its strong coupling to the lattice and electron charge, selective micrometer&#8208;scale patterns with distinct structural and electronic states were fabricated. The results provide direct evidences for a strong ion&#8208;electron&#8208;lattice coupling in correlated physics and exhibit its potential applications in designing novel materials and devices.

         <title>Oxidized Activated Charcoal Nanozymes: Synthesis, and Optimization for In Vitro and In Vivo Bioactivity for Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic nanozymes have recently been employed as promising antioxidant nanotherapeutics due to their distinct properties. The structural features responsible for the efficacy of these nanomaterials as antioxidants is, however, poorly understood. Here, we studied the process&#8208;structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance properties of coconut&#8208;derived oxidized activated charcoal (cOAC) nano&#8208;SOD mimetics by analyzing how modifications to the nanomaterial's synthesis impact the size, as well as the elemental and electrochemical properties of the particles. We then correlate these properties to the in vitro antioxidant bioactivity of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;functionalized cOACs (PEG&#8208;cOAC). Chemical oxidative treatment methods that afford smaller, more homogeneous cOAC nanoparticles with higher levels of quinone functionalization show enhanced protection against oxidative damage in bEnd.3 murine endothelioma cells. In an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and oxidative vascular injury, PEG&#8208;cOACs restored cerebral perfusion rapidly to the same extent as our former nanotube&#8208;derived PEG&#8208;hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG&#8208;HCCs) with a single intravenous injection. These findings provide fa deeper understanding for how carbon nanozyme syntheses can be tailored for improved antioxidant bioactivity, and set the stage for translation for medical applications.

         <title>Corrosion&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Healing Coatings</title>

Abstract
Organic coatings are one of the most popular and powerful strategies for protecting metals against corrosion. They can be applied to in different ways, such as by dipping, spraying, electrophoresis, casting, painting, or flow coating. They offer great flexibility of material designs and cost effectiveness. Moreover, since about 20 years self&#8208;healing has evolved as a new research topic for protective organic coatings. Responsive materials play a crucial role in this new research field. However, for a really targeted development of high performance self&#8208;healing coatings for corrosion protection, it is not sufficient just to focus on smart responsive materials and suitable active agents for self&#8208;healing. A better understanding of how coatings can react on different stimuli induced by corrosion, how these stimuli can spread in the coating and how the released agents can reach the corroding defect is also of high importance. Such knowledge would allow to design coatings which are optimised for specific applications. Herein, the requirements and possibilities from the corrosion and synthesis perspectives for designing materials for preparing self&#8208;healing coatings for corrosion protection are discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Biodegradable Green Electronic Materials and Sensor Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As environmental issues have become the dominant agenda worldwide, the necessity for more environmentally friendly electronics has recently emerged. Accordingly, biodegradable or nature&#8208;derived materials for green electronics have attracted increased interest. Initially, metal&#8208;green hybrid electronics were extensively studied. Although these materials are partially biodegradable, they have high utility owing to their metallic components. Subsequently, C&#8208;framed materials (such as graphite, cylindrical carbon nanomaterials, graphene, graphene oxide, laser&#8208;induced graphene) have been investigated. This has led to the adoption of various strategies for C&#8208;based materials, such as blending them with biodegradable materials. Moreover, various conductive polymers have been developed and researchers have studied their potential use in green electronics. Researchers have attempted to fabricate conductive polymer composites with high biodegradability by shortening the polymer chains. Furthermore, various physical, chemical, and biological sensors that are essential to modern society have been studied using biodegradable compounds. These recent advances in green electronics have paved the way toward their application in real life, providing a brighter future for society.

         <title>Manipulation of Heterogeneous Surface Electric Potential Promotes Osteogenesis by Strengthening RGD Peptide Binding and Cellular Mechanosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The heterogeneity of extracellular matrix (ECM) topology, stiffness and architecture is a key factor modulating cellular behavior and osteogenesis. However, the effects of heterogeneous ECM electric potential at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale on cellular behavior and osteogenesis remain to be elucidated. Here, the heterogeneous distributions of surface electrical potential is established by incorporating ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanofibers (BTNF) into poly(vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) matrix based on phase&#8208;field simulation and first&#8208;principles simulation. By optimizing the aspect ratios of BTNF fillers, the anisotropic distribution of surface potential on BTNF/P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) nanocomposite membranes can be achieved by strong spontaneous electric polarization of BTNF fillers. Our results indicate that heterogeneous surface potential distribution leads to a meshwork pattern of fibronectin (FN) aggregation, which increased FN&#8208;III7&#8208;10 (FN fragment) focal flexibility and anchor points as predicted by molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, integrin clustering, focal adhesion formation, cell spreading and adhesion were enhanced sequentially. Increased traction of actin fibers amplifies mechanotransduction by promoting nuclear translocation of YAP/Runx2, which enhances osteogenesis in vitro and bone regeneration in vivo. Our work thus provides fundamental insights into the biological effects of surface potential heterogeneity at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale on osteogenesis, and also develops a new strategy to optimize the performance of electroactive biomaterials for tissue regenerative therapies.

         <title>Attenuating Metabolic Competition of Tumor Cells for Favoring the Nutritional Demand of Immune Cells by a Branched Polymeric Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A branched polymeric drug delivery system can be used as a previously unknown metabolic modulator to improve the tumor immune microenvironment via interfering with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the tumor microenvironment, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells.








Abstract
Tumor cells are dominant in the nutritional competition in the tumor microenvironment, and their metabolic abnormalities often lead to microenvironmental acidosis and nutrient deprivation, thereby impairing the function of immune cells and diminishing the antitumor therapeutic effect. Herein, a branched polymeric conjugate and its efficacy in attenuating the metabolic competition of tumor cells are reported. Compared with the control nanoparticles prepared from its linear counterpart, the branched&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based nanoparticles can more efficiently accumulate in the tumor tissue and interfere with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the TME, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells. Its combined treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) achieves an enhanced antitumor effect. The work presents a promising approach for targeting metabolic competition in the TME to enhance the chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effect against cancers.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Enhanced Microwave Attenuation in Titanate Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create the high&#8208;entropy&#8208;stabilized (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2La0.2Pb0.2)TiO3&#160;perovskite that exhibits an enhanced effective microwave absorption band (90% absorption) is designed and developed. The favorable microstructural features, including abundant grain boundaries, oxygen defects, and strong shear strain caused by ultradense distorted lattices, can be achieved by regulating the entropy configuration.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), which incorporate multiple&#8208;principal cations into single&#8208;phase crystals and interact with diverse metal ions, extend the border for available compositions and unprecedented properties. Herein, a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;stabilized (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2La0.2Pb0.2)TiO3&#160;perovskite is reported, and the effective absorption bandwidth (90% absorption) improves almost two times than that of BaTiO3. The results demonstrate that the regulation of entropy configuration can yield significant grain boundaries, oxygen defects, and an ultradense distorted lattice. These characteristics give rise to strong interfacial and defect&#8208;induced polarizations, thus synergistically contributing to the dielectric attenuation performance. Moreover, the large strains derived from the strong lattice distortions in the high&#8208;entropy perovskite offer varied transport for electron carriers. The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;enhanced positive/negative charges accumulation around grain boundaries and strain&#8208;concentrated location, quantitatively validated by electron holography, results in unusual dielectric polarization loss. This study opens up an effective avenue for designing strong microwave absorption materials to satisfy the increasingly demanding requirements of advanced and integrated electronics. This work also offers a paradigm for improving other interesting properties for HEOs through entropy engineering.

Combination therapy with oHSV&#160;+&#160;MPNPs boosts the effects of immune checkpoint therapy by inducing gasdermin&#8208;E&#8208;based tumor pyroptosis, reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and inducing effective immune memory, thus potentiating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 effects against local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis and consequently elongating the survival period. The nanoprodrugs&#160;+&#160;oncolytic viruses strategy represents a promising way to overcome immune checkpoint blockade resistance.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy shows excellent efficacy against malignancies; however, insufficient tumor immunogenicity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) are considered as the two major stumbling blocks to a broad ICB response. Here, a combinational therapeutic strategy is reported, wherein TME&#8208;reactive oxygen species/pH dual&#8208;responsive signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 inhibitor nanoprodrugs MPNPs are combined with oncolytic herpes simplex virus 1 virotherapy to synergistically ignite pyroptosis for enhancing immunotherapy. MPNPs exhibit a certain level of tumor accumulation, reduce tumor cell stemness, and enhance antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, the simultaneous application of oncolytic viruses (OVs) confers MPNPs with higher tumor penetration capacity and remarkable gasdermin&#8208;E&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, thereby reshaping the TME and transforming &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones. This &#8220;fire of immunity&#8221; strategy successfully activates robust T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor responses, potentiating ICB effects against local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis in preclinical &#8220;cold&#8221; murine triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and syngeneic oral cancer models. Collectively, this work may pave a new way and offer an unprecedented opportunity for the combination of OVs with nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Triplet Fusion Upconversion for Photocuring 3D&#8208;Printed Particle&#8208;Reinforced Composite Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct&#8208;ink&#8208;write printing and photocuring of opaque hydrogel composites are enabled by multiexciton triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion. Low energy red light is used for better penetration into opaque hydrogels and the upconverted blue light induces the free radical photopolymerization process. This method allows conventional photoinitiation systems to modify objects that block high energy photons.








Abstract
High energy photons (&#955;&#160;&lt;&#160;400&#160;nm) are frequently used to initiate free radical polymerizations to form polymer networks, but are only effective for transparent objects. This phenomenon poses a major challenge to additive manufacturing of particle&#8208;reinforced composite networks since deep light penetration of short&#8208;wavelength photons limits the homogeneous modification of physicochemical and mechanical properties. Herein, the unconventional, yet versatile, multiexciton process of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) is employed for curing opaque hydrogel composites created by direct&#8208;ink&#8208;write (DIW) 3D printing. TTA&#8208;UC converts low energy red light (&#955;max&#160;=&#160;660&#160;nm) for deep penetration into higher&#8208;energy blue light to initiate free radical polymerizations within opaque objects. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, hydrogels containing up to 15&#160;wt.% TiO2 filler particles and doped with TTA&#8208;UC chromophores are readily cured with red light, while composites without the chromophores and TiO2 loadings as little as 1&#8211;2&#160;wt.% remain uncured. Importantly, this method has wide potential to modify the chemical and mechanical properties of complex DIW 3D&#8208;printed composite polymer networks.

         <title>Radiative Recombination Processes in Halide Perovskites Observed by Light Emission Voltage Modulated Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology to analyze the kinetics that determine the light emission in voltage&#8208;driven devices is presented. It consists of combining the voltage&#8208;modulated light emission with impedance spectroscopy, whose spectra are interpreted according to the described equivalent circuit. This method, which is unprecedently applied to perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with high radiative efficiency, reveals electronic steps that delay the radiative event.








Abstract
The kinetics of light emission in halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and solar cells is composed of a radiative recombination of voltage&#8208;injected carriers mediated by additional steps such as carrier trapping, redistribution of injected carriers, and photon recycling that affect the observed luminescence decays. These processes are investigated in high&#8208;performance halide perovskite LEDs, with external quantum efficiency (EQE) and luminance values higher than 20% and 80&#160;000 Cd m&#8722;2, by measuring the frequency&#8208;resolved emitted light with respect to modulated voltage through a new methodology termed light emission voltage modulated spectroscopy (LEVS). The spectra are shown to provide detailed information on at least three different characteristic times. Essentially, new information is obtained with respect to the electrical method of impedance spectroscopy (IS), and overall, LEVS shows promise to capture internal kinetics that are difficult to be discerned by other techniques.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Hole Coherence and Spatial Self&#8208;Phase Modulation in the Anisotropic 3D Weyl Semimetal TaAs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatial self&#8208;phase modulation (SSPM), a third&#8208;order nonlinear optical response is observed in a Weyl semimetal TaAs. This extends previous SSPM discoveries in 0D, 1D, and 2D materials into 3D materials. Also amazing is that it reveals the long&#8208;sought laser&#8208;induced hole coherence. Furthermore, SSPM in a topological semimetal is reported.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced electron coherence is a fascinating topic in manipulating quantum materials. Recently, it has been shown that laser&#8208;induced electron coherence in 2D materials can produce a third&#8208;order nonlinear optical response spatial self&#8208;phase modulation (SSPM), which has been used to develop a novel all&#8208;optical switching scheme. However, such investigations have mainly focused on electron coherence, whereas laser&#8208;induced hole coherence is rarely explored. Here, the observation of the optical Kerr effect in 3D Weyl semimetal TaAs flakes is reported. The nonlinear susceptibility (&#967;(3)) is obtained, which exhibits a surprisingly high value (with &#967;one&#8722;layer(3)\[{\bm{\chi }}_{{\bf one}{\bm{ - }}{\bf layer}}^{{\bf (3)}}\] = 9.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;9 e.s.u. or 1.4&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;16&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2 at 532&#160;nm). This cannot be explained by the conventional electron mobility, but can be well understood by the unique high anisotropic hole mobility of TaAs. The wind&#8208;chime model and &#967;(3) carrier mobility correlation adequately explain the results, suggesting the crucial role of laser&#8208;induced nonlocal ac hole coherence. These observations extend the understanding of SSPM from 2D to 3D quantum materials with anisotropic carrier mobility and from electron coherence to hole coherence.

         <title>Efficient, Color&#8208;Stable, and Long&#8208;Lived White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Utilizing Phosphorescent Molecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Development of single&#8208;stack hybrid white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (WOLEDs) uses amber&#8208;colored aggregate emission and blue fluorescence emission to achieve high efficiencies, long operational lifetimes, and excellent color stabilities under various driving conditions. As far as it is known, this is the most stable single&#8208;stack white OLED device among all reported white OLEDs on the public domain.








Abstract
Highly efficient and stable single&#8208;stack hybrid white organic light&#8208;emitting diode (WOLED) devices are developed using two emissive layers: one with amber&#8208;colored phosphorescent molecular&#8208;aggregate emission from the Pd(II) complex, Pd(II) 7&#8208;(3&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;N)phenoxy&#8208;&#954;C)(benzo&#8208;&#954;C)([c]benzo[4,5]imidazo&#8208;&#954;N)[1,2&#8208;a][1,5]naphthyridine, Pd3O8&#8208;Py5, and the other with blue fluorescence emission. An optimized device structure achieves high color stability under various current densities, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5%, a power efficiency of 97.4 Lm W&#8722;1, and an estimated LT95 (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of 50 744 h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

     alt="Efficient, Color-Stable, and Long-Lived White Organic Light-Emitting Diodes Utilizing Phosphorescent Molecular Aggregates"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of single-stack hybrid white organic light-emitting diodes (WOLEDs) uses amber-colored aggregate emission and blue fluorescence emission to achieve high efficiencies, long operational lifetimes, and excellent color stabilities under various driving conditions. As far as it is known, this is the most stable single-stack white OLED device among all reported white OLEDs on the public domain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly efficient and stable single-stack hybrid white organic light-emitting diode (WOLED) devices are developed using two emissive layers: one with amber-colored phosphorescent molecular-aggregate emission from the Pd(II) complex, Pd(II) 7-(3-(pyridine-2-yl-&#954;N)phenoxy-&#954;C)(benzo-&#954;C)([&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;]benzo[4,5]imidazo-&#954;N)[1,2-&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;][1,5]naphthyridine, Pd3O8-Py5, and the other with blue fluorescence emission. An optimized device structure achieves high color stability under various current densities, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5%, a power efficiency of 97.4 Lm W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an estimated LT&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt; (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of 50 744 h at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oral Delivery of siRNA Using Fluorinated, Small&#8208;Sized Nanocapsules toward Anti&#8208;Inflammation Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;sized, reversibly cross&#8208;linked, fluorinated nanocapsules are developed to mediate efficient intestinal absorption of siRNA and systemic tumor necrosis factor &#945; gene silencing via oral administration. They feature high oral bioavailability of 20.4%, and demonstrate potent anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy against both acute and chronic inflammation. This study provides a transformative platform for oral siRNA delivery.








Abstract
Oral delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) provides a promising paradigm for treating diseases that require regular injections. However, the multiple gastrointestinal (GI) and systemic barriers often lead to inefficient oral absorption and low bioavailability of siRNA. Technologies that can overcome these barriers are still lacking, which hinders the clinical potential of orally delivered siRNA. Herein, small&#8208;sized, fluorinated nanocapsules (F&#8208;NCs) are developed to mediate efficient oral delivery of tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;) siRNA for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment. The NCs possess a disulfide&#8208;cross&#8208;linked shell structure, thus featuring robust stability in the GI tract. Because of their small size (&#8776;30&#160;nm) and fluorocarbon&#8208;assisted repelling of mucin adsorption, the best&#8208;performing F3&#8208;NCs show excellent mucus penetration and intestinal transport capabilities without impairing the intestinal tight junction, conferring the oral bioavailability of 20.4% in relative to intravenous injection. The disulfide cross&#8208;linker can be cleaved inside target cells, causing NCs dissociation and siRNA release to potentiate the TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing efficiency. In murine models of acute and chronic inflammation, orally delivered F3&#8208;NCs provoke efficient TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing and pronounced anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacies. This study therefore provides a transformative strategy for oral siRNA delivery, and will render promising utilities for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment.

         <title>Hybridization Engineering of Oxyfluoride Aluminosilicate Glass for Construction of Dual&#8208;Phase Optical Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild strategy for constructing dual&#8208;phase optical ceramics and ceramics with fiber geometry by stepped dual&#8208;phase crystallization of hybridized glass is proposed. The strategy has excellent generality, and candidates with various chemical compositions, phase combinations, and morphologies are produced. They have practical applications in lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging. These findings expand the scope of optical ceramics.








Abstract
The construction of transparent ceramics under mild conditionsand standard atmospheric pressure has great scientific and technological potential; however, it remains difficult to achieve when conventional ceramic sintering techniques are used. Herein, a mild strategy for constructing dual&#8208;phase optical ceramics with high crystallinity (&gt;90%) based on the stepped dual&#8208;phase crystallization of hybridized aluminosilicate glass is presented. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the hybridization of the glass system enables a new balance between the glass&#8208;forming ability and crystallization and can overcome the uncontrolled devitrification phenomenon during the dense crystallization of glass. Transparent hybridized oxide&#8208;fluoride ceramics with fiber geometry and dual&#8208;phase microstructures are also successfully fabricated. The generality of the strategy is confirmed, and transparent ceramics with various chemical compositions and phase combinations are prepared. Additionally, the cross&#8208;section of the ceramic fibers can be easily tuned into a circle, square, trapezoid, or even a triangle. Furthermore, the practical applications of optical ceramics for lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging are demonstrated. The findings described here suggest a major step toward expanding the scope of optical ceramics.

         <title>3D Printing of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanofibrous Multidomain Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidomain peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides, are used to 3D print complex, 3D structures. Multiple MDPs are demonstrated as printable, and oppositely charged MDPs are printed together into layered, porous constructs. MDPs are found to support high cell viability regardless of charge, while charge is shown to influence cellular behavior and morphology.








Abstract
3D printing has become one of the primary fabrication strategies used in biomedical research. Recent efforts have focused on the 3D printing of hydrogels to create structures that better replicate the mechanical properties of biological tissues. These pose a unique challenge, as soft materials are difficult to pattern in three dimensions with high fidelity. Currently, a small number of biologically derived polymers that form hydrogels are frequently reused for 3D printing applications. Thus, there exists a need for novel hydrogels with desirable biological properties that can be used as 3D printable inks. In this work, the printability of multidomain peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides that form a nanofibrous hydrogel at low concentrations, is established. MDPs with different charge functionalities are optimized as distinct inks and are used to create complex 3D structures, including multi&#8208;MDP prints. Additionally, printed MDP constructs are used to demonstrate charge&#8208;dependent differences in cellular behavior in vitro. This work presents the first time that self&#8208;assembling peptides have been used to print layered structures with overhangs and internal porosity. Overall, MDPs are a promising new class of 3D printable inks that are uniquely peptide&#8208;based and rely solely on supramolecular mechanisms for assembly.

         <title>Mitochondrial&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Antioxidases Complexes against Pyroptosis and Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyphenols such as tannic acid (TA) are able to mediate the targeting of polyphenol/antioxidases complexes to mitochondria, stemming from the strong binding of TA to mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and TA are assembled into complexes for efficiently scavenging excess mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and reversing mitochondrial depolarization, thereby inhibiting inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis and alleviate pyroptosis&#8208;related hepatitis.








Abstract
Excess accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) is a key target for inhibiting pyroptosis&#8208;induced inflammation and tissue damage. However, targeted delivery of drugs to mitochondria and efficient clearance of mtROS remain challenging. In current study, it is discovered that polyphenols such as tannic acid (TA) can mediate the targeting of polyphenol/antioxidases complexes to mitochondria. This affinity does not depend on mitochondrial membrane potential but stems from the strong binding of TA to mitochondrial outer membrane proteins. Taking advantage of the feasibility of self&#8208;assembly between TA and proteins, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and TA are assembled into complexes (referred to as TSC) for efficient enzymatic activity maintenance. In vitro fluorescence confocal imaging shows that TSC not only promoted the uptake of biological enzymes in hepatocytes but also highly overlapped with mitochondria after lysosomal escape. The results from an in vitro model of hepatocyte oxidative stress demonstrate that TSC efficiently scavenges excess mtROS and reverses mitochondrial depolarization, thereby inhibiting inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. More interestingly, TSC maintain superior efficacy compared with the clinical gold standard drug N&#8208;acetylcysteine in both acetaminophen&#8208; and D&#8208;galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide&#8208;induced pyroptosis&#8208;related hepatitis mouse models. In conclusion, this study opens a new paradigm for targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress to inhibit pyroptosis and treat inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Metal Interaction with a Threshold Effect in NiCu Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigating the inter&#8208;metal site distance effect of dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) can not only promote the full potential of DACs, but also guide the design of advanced atomically&#160;dispersed catalysts. In this work a peripherally distributed NiCu DAC is employed as a case study to investigate the distance (d)&#8208;dependent inter&#8208;metal interaction, and a newly&#160;proposed macro&#8208;descriptor is provided as the guidance for future designing DACs.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have become an emerging platform to provide more flexible active sites for electrocatalytic reactions with multi&#8208;electron/proton transfer, such as the CO2&#160;reduction reaction (CRR). However, the introduction of asymmetric dual&#8208;atom sites causes complexity in structure, leaving an incomprehensive understanding of the inter&#8208;metal interaction and catalytic mechanism. Taking NiCu DACs as an example, herein, a more rational structural model is proposed, and the distance&#8208;dependent inter&#8208;metal interaction is investigated by combining theoretical simulations and experiments, including density functional theory computation, aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy, synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, and Monte Carlo experiments. A distance threshold around 5.3&#160;&#197; between adjacent Ni&#63743;N4&#160;and Cu&#63743;N4&#160;moieties is revealed to trigger effective electronic regulation and boost CRR performance on both selectivity and activity. A universal macro&#8208;descriptor rigorously correlating the inter&#8208;metal distance and intrinsic material features (e.g., metal loading and thickness) is established to guide the rational design and synthesis of advanced DACs. This study highlights the significance of identifying the inter&#8208;metal interaction in DACs, and helps bridge the gap between theoretical study and experimental synthesis of atomically dispersed catalysts with highly correlated active sites.

         <title>Reviving Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis of Bulk La&#8211;Ni Intermetallics via Gaseous Hydrogen Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen processing strategy is utilized to optimize the microstructure of bulk LaNi5 to activate its alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER)&#160;performance. Furthermore, the phase evolution, as well as the role of La during the OER process, is unequivocally decoupled. Hydrogen storage, hydrogen production, and hydrogen application are integrated toward the development of the hydrogen economy.








Abstract
A hydrogen processing strategy is developed to enable bulk LaNi5 to attain high activity and long&#8208;term stability toward the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By a combination of in situ Raman and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) spectra, secondary&#8208;electron&#8208;excited scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) patterns as well as the Rietveld method and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is discovered that hydrogen&#8208;induced lattice distortion, grain refinement, and particle cracks dictate the effective reconstruction of the LaNi5 surface into a porous hetero&#8208;nanoarchitecture composed of uniformly confined active &#947;&#8208;NiOOH nanocrystals by La(OH)3 layer in the alkaline OER process. This significantly optimizes the charge transfer, structural integrity, active&#8208;site exposure, and adsorption energy toward the reaction intermediates. Benefiting from these merits, the overpotential (322&#160;mV) at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the hydrogen&#8208;processed OER catalyst deposited on nickel foam is reduced by 104&#160;mV as compared to the original phase. Notably, it exhibits remarkable stability for 10 days at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of more than 560&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media.

         <title>Correlated Rattling of Sodium&#8208;Chains Suppressing Thermal Conduction in Thermoelectric Stannides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks encapsulating zigzag Na&#8208;chains show lower thermal conductivity with decreasing inter&#8208;Na distances. Na atoms behave as Einstein&#8208;like oscillators along the tunnel, while significant interactions exist both between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and the framework. The large anisotropic oscillations, the correlation of Na atoms in the tunnels, and their interaction with frameworks&#160;lead to low thermal conductivity.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks containing zigzag Na chains that excite correlated rattling impinging on the framework phonons are attractive as thermoelectric materials owing to their low lattice thermal conductivity. The correlated rattling of Na atoms in the zigzag chains and the origin of the low thermal conductivity is uncovered via experimental and computational analyses. The Na atoms behave as oscillators along the tunnel, resulting in substantial interactions between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and framework. In these intermetallic compounds, a shorter inter&#8208;rattler distance results in lower thermal conductivity, suggesting that phonon scattering by the correlated rattling Na&#8208;chains is enhanced. These results provide new insights into the behavior of thermoelectric materials with low thermal conductivity and suggest strategies for the development of such materials that utilize the correlated rattling.

         <title>Trojan Horse Nanocapsule Enabled In Situ Modulation of the Phenotypic Conversion of Th17 Cells to Treg Cells for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocapsule (nC)&#8208;coupled Th17 cells transmigrates across the blood&#8211;brain barrier and homes to the inflamed MS niche in a &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221;&#8208;like manner. Upon ROS stimulation, (Aminooxy)&#8208;acetic acid is released from the nC, and subsequently enables in situ transformation of Th17 into Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion leads to a domino&#8208;like immune response that is conducive to MS therapy.








Abstract
Th17/Treg imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of multiple sclerosis (MS), and the transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into Treg cells may contribute to the resolution of inflammation, presenting a therapeutic strategy for MS. To modulate this phenotypic shift in situ, a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221;&#8208;like hybrid system, nanocapsule&#8208;coupled Th17 cells, is reported for MS treatment. Following intravenous injection into MS mice, the hybrid system efficiently transmigrates across the blood&#8211;brain barrier and homes to the inflamed MS niche. (Aminooxy)&#8208;acetic acid, a transdifferentiation inducer, is locally released upon the production of ROS and in turn taken up by Th17 cells. It is demonstrated that the Trojan horse hybrid system enables in situ phenotypic transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into anti&#8208;inflammatory Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion leads to a domino&#8208;like immune response that is conducive to MS therapy. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway for accurate modulation of the phenotypes of adoptively transferred cells in situ, from proinflammatory to anti&#8208;inflammatory for MS therapy, and may be broadly applicable for patients suffering from other autoimmune diseases.

         <title>A Multifunctional Interphase Layer Enabling Superior Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries under Ambient Temperature and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interphase consisting of disodium selenide and metal vanadium is developed for the Na anode via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. It possesses high sodiophilicity, strong mechanical strength, excellent ionic conductivity, and fast desolvation of solvated Na+, which can boost Na&#8208;ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites under ambient temperature and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The sodium (Na)&#8208;metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low cost is promising for construction of&#160;high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and the liquid electrolyte induces tardy ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultralow temperature (&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na2Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na2Se/V) via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction.

&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional interphase consisting of disodium selenide and metal vanadium is developed for the Na anode via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. It possesses high sodiophilicity, strong mechanical strength, excellent ionic conductivity, and fast desolvation of solvated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which can boost Na-ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites under ambient temperature and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sodium (Na)-metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low cost is promising for construction of&#160;high-energy-density metal batteries. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and the liquid electrolyte induces tardy ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultralow temperature (&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/V) via an in situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity, and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na-ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling life span of over 1790&#160;h (0.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in carbonate-based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the artificial Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate the desolvation of solvated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/V electrode thus exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/0.5 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This work provides an avenue to design artificial heterogeneous interphase layers for superior high-energy-density metal batteries at ambient and ultralow temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Lifetime of Over One Month in Disordered Organic Solid&#8208;State Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultralong charge&#8208;carrier lifetime of more than one month in a disordered film of an organic semiconductor stored at room temperature is demonstrated. The charge carriers stored in the film are stabilized by spontaneous orientation polarization. It is also revealed that the charge carriers retain spatial information due to their slow diffusion in the plane of the organic layer.








Abstract
Understanding intrinsic carrier lifetime in disordered organic solid&#8208;state semiconductors is essential for improving device performance in not only molecule&#8208;based optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells (OSC) but also photocatalysts used for producing solar fuel cells. Carriers in disordered films are generally thought to have short lifetimes on a scale ranging from nanoseconds to milliseconds. These short carrier lifetimes cause loss of charges in OSCs and low quantum yields in photocatalysts and impede the future application of organic semiconductors to, for example, charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based memory devices. This study reports an ultralong intrinsic carrier lifetime of more than one month in a disordered film of an organic semiconductor stored at room temperature without external power. This extraordinary lifetime, which is several orders of magnitude longer than that generally believed possible in conventional organic semiconductors, arises from carrier stabilization by spontaneous orientation polarization, excited spin&#8208;triplet recycling, and blocking of recombination processes in disordered films.

         <title>Microenvironmentally Responsive Chemotherapeutic Prodrugs and CHEK2 Inhibitors Self&#8208;Assembled Micelles: Protecting Fertility and Enhancing Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A co&#8208;delivery micelle (BML@PMP) that consists of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) is developed for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. The BML@PMP micelles enhance the antitumor effect by delivering a high dose of paclitaxel to the tumor and inhibiting DNA damage repair, and prevent fertility damage by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway in the ovary.








Abstract
Chemotherapy is a widely used and effective adjuvant treatment for cancer, and it has unavoidable damage to female fertility, with statistics showing 38% of women who have received chemotherapy are infertile. How to reduce fertility toxicity while enhancing the oncologic chemotherapy is a clinical challenge. Herein, co&#8208;delivery micelles (BML@PMP) are developed, which are composed of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. BML@PMP achieves fertility protection through three actions: (1) Due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, BML@PMP is more enriched in the tumor, while very little in the ovary (about 1/10th of the tumor). (2) Glutathione (GSH) triggers the release of PTX, and with low levels of GSH in the ovary, the amount of PTX released in the ovary is correspondingly reduced. (3) BML277 inhibits oocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway. Because of the different downstream targets of CHEK2 in tumor cells and oocytes, BML277 also enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy by reducing DNA damage repair which is activated through the CHEK2 pathway. This bidirectional effect of CHEK2 inhibitor&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery system represents a promising strategy for improving oncology treatment indices and preventing chemotherapy&#8208;associated fertility damage.

         <title>Unlocking the Full Potential of Electron&#8208;Acceptor Molecules for Efficient and Stable Hole Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and stable hole injection into organic semiconductors is realized by controlling the charged states of acceptor molecules. The high electron affinity of a neutral acceptor molecule enables direct hole injection even into materials used for a blue&#8208;emitting layer, and highly efficient, pure&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with an extraordinarily low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.67&#160;V are realized.








Abstract
Understanding the hole&#8208;injection mechanism and improving the hole&#8208;injection property are of pivotal importance in the future development of organic optoelectronic devices. Electron&#8208;acceptor molecules with high electron affinity (EA) are widely used in electronic applications, such as hole injection and p&#8208;doping. Although p&#8208;doping has generally been studied in terms of matching the ionization energy (IE) of organic semiconductors with the EA of acceptor molecules, little is known about the effect of the EA of acceptor molecules on the hole&#8208;injection property. In this work, the hole&#8208;injection mechanism in devices is completely clarified, and a strategy to optimize the hole&#8208;injection property of the acceptor molecule is developed. Efficient and stable hole injection is found to be possible even into materials with IEs as high as 5.8 eV by controlling the charged state of an acceptor molecule with an EA of about 5.0&#160;eV. This excellent hole&#8208;injection property enables direct hole injection into an emitting layer, realizing a pure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode with an extraordinarily low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.67&#160;V, a power efficiency of 29&#160;lm W&#8722;1, an external quantum efficiency of 28% and a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage y coordinate of less than 0.10.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Nanoflakes&#8208;Enabled All&#8208;Optical Nonlinear Activation Function for On&#8208;Chip Photonic Deep Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nanoflake 2D material MXene is designed for a neural network nonlinear broadband activator on a chip and realized using waveguide spectroscopy. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure of the proposed MXene&#8208;based activator configurations via tuning the wavelength of operation.








Abstract
2D metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) are promising material platforms for on&#8208;chip neural networks owing to their nonlinear saturable absorption effect. The localized surface plasmon resonances in metallic MXene nanoflakes may play an important role in enhancing the electromagnetic absorption; however, their contribution is not determined due to the lack of a precise understanding of its localized surface plasmon behavior. Here, a saturable absorber made of MXene thin film and a silicon waveguide with MXene flakes overlayer are developed to perform neuromorphic tasks. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure of the proposed MXene&#8208;based activator configurations via tuning the wavelength of operation. The capability and feasibility of the obtained results of machine&#8208;learning applications are confirmed via handwritten digit classification task, with near 99% accuracy. These findings can guide the design of advanced ultrathin saturable absorption materials on a chip for a broad range of applications.

These findings can guide the design of advanced ultrathin saturable absorption materials on a chip for a broad range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biohybrid 3D Printing of a Tissue&#8208;Sensor Platform for Wireless, Real&#8208;Time, and Continuous Monitoring of Drug&#8208;Induced Cardiotoxicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biohybrid 3D printing method is introduced for the fabrication of tissue&#8208;sensor platforms. The integration of electronics with living cardiac tissues enables continuous monitoring of their contractile force and, ultimately, the drug&#8208;induced cardiotoxicity effects on cardiac tissues. It is expected that this method&#160;has the potential to become the next&#8208;generation technology in the field of tissue engineering for drug development.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;induced cardiotoxicity is regarded as a major hurdle in the early stages of drug development. Although there are various methods for preclinical cardiotoxicity tests, they cannot completely predict the cardiotoxic potential of a compound due to the lack of physiological relevance. Recently, 3D engineered heart tissue (EHT) has been used to investigate cardiac muscle functions as well as pharmacological effects by exhibiting physiological auxotonic contractions. However, there is still no adequate platform for continuous monitoring to test acute and chronic pharmacological effects in vitro. Here, a biohybrid 3D printing method for fabricating a tissue&#8208;sensor platform, composed of a bipillar&#8208;grafted strain gauge sensor and EHT, is first introduced. Two pillars are three&#8208;dimensionally printed as grafts onto a strain gauge&#8208;embedded substrate to promote the EHT contractility and guide the self&#8208;assembly of the EHTs along with the strain gauge. In addition, the integration of a wireless multi&#8208;channel electronic system allows for continuous monitoring of the EHT contractile force by the tissue&#8208;sensor platform and, ultimately, for the observation of the acute and chronic drug effects of cardiotoxicants. In summary, biohybrid 3D printing technology is expected to be a potential fabrication method to provide a next&#8208;generation tissue&#8208;sensor platform for an effective drug development process.

         <title>Toward the Speed Limit of Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The operation speeds of elemental Sb devices are explored by both&#160;theoretical calculations and experiments. It is directly demonstrated that the fastest speed of elemental Sb is &#8776;242&#160;ps, which is also the fastest operation speed as found among known phase&#8208;change memory.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change memory (PCM) is one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation data&#8208;storage technology, the programming speed of which has enhanced within a timescale from milliseconds to sub&#8208;nanosecond (&#8776;500 ps) through decades of effort. As the potential applications of PCM strongly depend on the switching speed, namely, the time required for the recrystallization of amorphous chalcogenide media, the finding of the ultimate crystallization speed is of great importance both theoretically and practically. In&#160;this&#160;work, through systematic analysis of discovered phase&#8208;change materials and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, elemental Sb&#8208;based PCM is predicted to have a superfast crystallization speed. Indeed, such cells experimentally present extremely fast crystallization speeds within 360&#160;ps. Remarkably, the recrystallization process is further sped up as the device shrinks, and a record&#8208;fast crystallization speed of only 242&#160;ps is achieved in 60&#160;nm&#8208;size devices. These findings open opportunities for dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM)&#8208;like and even cache&#8208;like PCM using appropriate storage materials.

         <title>An Integrated Solar Panel with a Triboelectric Nanogenerator Array for Synergistic Harvesting of Raindrop&#160;and Solar Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A constructed integrated generator with a raindrop triboelectric nanogenerator (R&#8208;TENG) array and a solar panel can realize all&#8208;weather, complementary energy harvesting of raindrop and solar energy, and sustainable energy supply for the widely distributed sensors, which can promote the self&#8208;powered wireless environmental monitoring and the development of remote meteorological monitoring or smart farming, etc.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is regarded as an effective strategy for harvesting energy from raindrops, and is a complementary solution with solar cells to achieve all&#8208;weather energy harvesting and sustainable energy supply. However, due to the irregularity of natural rainfalls in the volume, frequency, density, and location, designing high&#8208;efficiency raindrop TENG (R&#8208;TENG) arrays faces great challenges. In this work, a highly transparent, large&#8208;area, and high&#8208;efficiency R&#8208;TENG array with rational material choice, electrode structure, and array distribution is developed for efficiently harvesting irregular raindrop energy. The problem of electrical signal cancellation among adjacent raindrops can be fully avoided, as viewed from the high&#8208;resolution space&#8211;time analyses of high&#8208;speed camera and electrical signal characteristics. With the rationally designed electrode instead of multiple complex electrodes, all charges can be exported by the R&#8208;TENG array in a simulated irregular raindrop scenario. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the R&#8208;TENG possesses higher average power density (40.80&#160;mW m&#8722;2) than that of the solar cell (37.03&#160;mW m&#8722;2) in rainy condition. Additionally, a self&#8208;powered wireless light&#8208;intensity&#8208;monitoring system is demonstrated for real&#8208;time and all&#8208;day weather monitoring. This work provides useful guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TENG arrays integrated with solar panels for harvesting irregular raindrop energy and solar energy.

         <title>Reprocessable and Chemically Recyclable Hard Vitrimers Based on Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Epoxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;crystalline epoxy vitrimers (LCEVs) are synthesized using imine and ester moieties as dynamic covalent bonds. The cured products are reprocessed by imine metathesis and transesterification. Moreover, the imine group is chemically decomposed and resin recycling is achieved via recombination. Repeated reprocessing and recycling are realized, and the products exhibit excellent thermal and mechanical properties owing to their LC nature.








Abstract
The rapid increase in demand for recyclable and reusable thermosets has necessitated the development of materials with chemical structures that exhibit these features. Thus, functional mesogenic epoxide monomers bearing both ester and imine groups that can be vitrimerized and recycled are reported herein. The compounds show mesophase characteristics at 100&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C and can be converted into hard epoxides by a common curing reaction. The obtained hard epoxides have high isotropic thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.64 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), which is derived from their highly ordered microstructures. The cured products can be easily reprocessed through imine metathesis and transesterification, and decomposed products can be obtained through imine hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions and subsequently be re&#8208;cured. Surprisingly, recycled materials can be repeatedly reprocessed or chemically decomposed. The reprocessed materials retain the properties of their pristine counterparts, and the recycled products preserve the advantages of the hard thermosets without alteration to any of their unique properties. A dehydration reaction occurs between the residual hydroxyl groups during the re&#8208;hardening, which dramatically increases the glass transition temperature by &#8776;60&#160;&#176;C. These reprocessable and recyclable vitrimers demonstrate the effectiveness and environmental friendliness of the molecular design strategy reported herein.

         <title>Pyridinic Nitrogen Sites Dominated Coordinative Engineering of Subnanometric Pd Clusters for Efficient Alkynes&#8217; Semihydrogenation</title>

Pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;site&#8208;dominated coordinative engineering of subnanometric Pd clusters is proposed for efficient alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. The obtained catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits excellent catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene semihydrogenation due to the abundant pyridinic nitrogen sites and interesting electron effects.








Abstract
Supported metal catalysts have played an important role in optimizing selective semihydrogenation of alkynes for fine chemicals. There into, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, as a type of promising support materials, have attracted extensive attentions. However, due to the general phenomenon of random doping for nitrogen species in the support, it is still atremendous challenge to finely identify which nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic property of alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. Herein, it is reported that uniform mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon spheres derived from mesoporous polypyrrole spheres are used as supports to immobilized subnanometric Pd clusters, which provide a particular platform to research the influence of nitrogen configurations on the alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. Comprehensive experimental results and density functional theory calculation indicate that pyridinic nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic behavior of Pd clusters. The high contents of pyridinic nitrogen sites offer abundant coordination sites, which greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining reaction step and makes Pd clusters own high catalytic activity. The electron effect between pyridinic nitrogen sites and Pd clusters makes the reaction highly selective. Additionally, the good mesostructures also promote the fast transport of substrate. Based on the above, catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits high catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene (C8H6) semihydrogenation.

         <title>Humidity&#8208;Insensitive, Large&#8208;Area&#8208;Applicable, Hot&#8208;Air&#8208;Assisted Ambient Fabrication of 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A hot&#8208;air&#8208;assisted ambient fabrication technique is introduced to prepare 2D layered perovskite films for efficient and stable solar cells. This method is material&#8208;saving, humidity&#8208;insensitive, large&#8208;area&#8208;applicable, and adaptable for different 2D perovskites. High&#8208;quality 2D perovskite films are obtained with good crystallinity, preferable orientation, and desirable morphology.








Abstract
2D layered perovskites (LPs) have shown great potential to deliver high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices with long&#8208;term stability. Despite many signs of progress being made in film quality and device performance, LP films are mainly processed in strict conditions and through non&#8208;scalable techniques. Here, the hot&#8208;air&#8208;assisted ambient fabrication technique is introduced to prepare LP films for efficient and stable solar cells. The high&#8208;quality LP films with good crystallinity, preferable orientation and desirable morphology are obtained by balancing the crystal nucleation and growth processes. Employing the synchrotron&#8208;based in situ grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction technique, hot air induces the solidification of solutes and forms an intermediate at the air&#8211;liquid interface, which transforms into 3D&#8208;like perovskite, followed by the growth of the 2D species toward the substrate. The optimal LP film delivers a device power conversion efficiency of 16.36%, the best value for the LP&#8208;based solar cells prepared by the non&#8208;spin&#8208;coating techniques. The solar cell performance is insensitive to the film processing humidity and the device size is upscalable, which promises real&#8208;world deployment of LP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Toward Plasmonic Neural Probes: SERS Detection of Neurotransmitters through Gold&#8208;Nanoislands&#8208;Decorated Tapered Optical Fibers with Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm Gaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy based neural probe that can detect neurotransmitters down to the micromolar range is presented. Striving for the development of minimally invasive neuroplasmonic probes providing highly sensitive biomolecular detection in the deep brain regions, a nonplanar repeated dewetting technique to fabricate gold nanoislands with sub&#8208;10 nm gaps around the entire tapered optical fiber surface is introduced.








Abstract
Integration of plasmonic nanostructures with fiber&#8208;optics&#8208;based neural probes enables label&#8208;free detection of molecular fingerprints via surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and it represents a fascinating technological horizon to investigate brain function. However, developing neuroplasmonic probes that can interface with deep brain regions with minimal invasiveness while providing the sensitivity to detect biomolecular signatures in a physiological environment is challenging, in particular because the same waveguide must be employed for both delivering excitation light and collecting the resulting scattered photons. Here, a SERS&#8208;active neural probe based on a tapered optical fiber (TF) decorated with gold nanoislands (NIs) that can detect neurotransmitters down to the micromolar range is presented. To do this, a novel, nonplanar repeated dewetting technique to fabricate gold NIs with sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gaps, uniformly distributed on the wide (square millimeter scale in surface area), highly curved surface of TF is developed. It is experimentally and numerically shown&#160;that the amplified broadband near&#8208;field enhancement of the high&#8208;density NIs layer allows for achieving a limit of detection in aqueous solution of 10&#8722;7&#160;m for rhodamine 6G and 10&#8722;5&#160;m for serotonin and dopamine through SERS at near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. The NIs&#8208;TF technology is envisioned as a first step toward the unexplored frontier of in vivo label&#8208;free plasmonic neural interfaces.

         <title>Tunable Photochromism of Spirooxazine in the Solid State: A New Design Strategy Based on the Hypochromic Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy based on the hypochromic effect is proposed to develop photochromic spirooxazine in the solid state, and tunable solid photochromism for spirooxazine is realized under mild conditions.








Abstract
As an important organic photofunctional material, spirooxazine (SO) usually does not exhibit photochromism in the solid state since the intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking impedes photoisomerization. Developing photochromic SO in the solid state is crucial for practical applications but is still full of challenges. Here, a series of spirooxazine derivatives (SO1&#8211;SO4) with bulky aromatic substituents at the 4&#8208; and 7&#8208;positions of the skeleton, which provide them with a large volume with which to undergo solid&#8208;state photochromism under mild conditions, is designed and synthesized. All the compounds SO1&#8211;SO4 exhibit tunable solid photochromism without ground colors, excellent fatigue resistance, and high thermal stability. Notably, it takes only 15&#160;s for SO4 to reach the saturation of absorption intensity, thought to represent the fastest solid&#8208;state photoresponse of spirooxazines. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the intermediate compound SO0 and the products SO1&#8211;SO2 as well as computational studies suggest that the bulky aromatic groups can lead to a hypochromic effect, allowing for the photochromism of SO in the solid state. The ideal photochromic properties of these spirooxazines open a new avenue for their applications in UV printing, quick response code, and related fields.

         <title>Stretchable Electrodes Based on Over&#8208;Layered Liquid Metal Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of thin films with liquid metal is proposed using thermal evaporation. The oxide film on the liquid metal surface forms a unique structure as indium/oxide/gallium (InOG). The oxide film helps form conductivity and exhibits negative piezoresistivity by rupturing. InOG electrode exhibits controllable electrical properties and mechanical stability. InOG overcomes the limitations of conventional applications through unique properties.








Abstract
Liquid metals are attractive materials for stretchable electronics owing to their high electrical conductivity and near&#8208;zero Young's modulus. However, the high surface tension of liquid metals makes it difficult to form films. A novel stretchable film is proposed based on an over&#8208;layered liquid&#8208;metal network. An intentionally oxidized interfacial layer helps to construct uninterrupted indium and gallium nanoclusters and produces additional electrical pathways between the two metal networks under mechanical deformation. The films exhibit gigantic negative piezoresistivity (G&#8208;NPR), which decreased the resistance up to 85% during the first 50% stretching. This G&#8208;NPR property is due to the rupture of the metal oxides, which allows the formation of liquid eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn) and the connection of the over&#8208;layered networks to build new electrical paths.

&lt;p&gt;The fabrication of thin films with liquid metal is proposed using thermal evaporation. The oxide film on the liquid metal surface forms a unique structure as indium/oxide/gallium (InOG). The oxide film helps form conductivity and exhibits negative piezoresistivity by rupturing. InOG electrode exhibits controllable electrical properties and mechanical stability. InOG overcomes the limitations of conventional applications through unique properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid metals are attractive materials for stretchable electronics owing to their high electrical conductivity and near-zero Young's modulus. However, the high surface tension of liquid metals makes it difficult to form films. A novel stretchable film is proposed based on an over-layered liquid-metal network. An intentionally oxidized interfacial layer helps to construct uninterrupted indium and gallium nanoclusters and produces additional electrical pathways between the two metal networks under mechanical deformation. The films exhibit gigantic negative piezoresistivity (G-NPR), which decreased the resistance up to 85% during the first 50% stretching. This G-NPR property is due to the rupture of the metal oxides, which allows the formation of liquid eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) and the connection of the over-layered networks to build new electrical paths. The electrodes exhibiting G-NPR are complementarily combined with conventional electrodes to amplify their performance or achieve some unique operations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Printing on Particles: Combining Two&#8208;Photon Nanolithography and Capillary Assembly to Fabricate Multimaterial Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of the capillary assembly of colloidal particles and two&#8208;photon polymerization nanoprinting allows the easy integration of multiple functional materials into complex 1D, 2D, and 3D&#8208;microstructures. This flexible method enables the fabrication of wide range of microscale devices, from thermoresponsive microactuators, to magnetically controlled &#8220;micromachines,&#8221; which can selectively capture and release particles in solution.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale has seen a recent upsurge to suit an increasing demand for more elaborate structures. However, the integration of multiple distinct materials at small scales remains challenging. To this end, capillarity&#8208;assisted particle assembly (CAPA) and two&#8208;photon polymerization direct laser writing (2PP&#8208;DLW) are combined to realize a new class of multimaterial microstructures. 2PP&#8208;DLW and CAPA both are used to fabricate 3D templates to guide the CAPA of soft&#8208; and hard colloids, and to link well&#8208;defined arrangements of functional microparticle arrays produced by CAPA, a process that is termed &#8220;printing on particles.&#8221; The printing process uses automated particle recognition algorithms to connect colloids into 1D, 2D, and 3D tailored structures, via rigid, soft, or responsive polymer links. Once printed and developed, the structures can be easily re&#8208;dispersed in water. Particle clusters and lattices of varying symmetry and composition are reported, together with thermoresponsive microactuators, and magnetically driven &#8220;micromachines&#8221;, which can efficiently move, capture, and release DNA&#8208;coated particles in solution. The flexibility of this method allows the combination of a wide range of functional materials into complex structures, which will boost the realization of new systems and devices for numerous fields, including microrobotics, micromanipulation, and metamaterials.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Stabilized AgSbTe2 with High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Type AgSbTe2 materials stabilized with S and Se co&#8208;doping are demonstrated to exhibit an outstanding thermoelectric (TE) figure of merit zTmax of 2.3 and a unicouple device reaching energy conversion efficiencies up to 12.3% at a temperature difference of 370 K. This exceptional performance arises from an enhanced carrier density resulting from a higher concentration of silver vacancies, a vastly improved Seebeck coefficient enabled by the flattening of the valence band maximum and the inhibited formation of n&#8208;type Ag2Te.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) generators enable the direct and reversible conversion between heat and electricity, providing applications in both refrigeration and power generation. In the last decade, several TE materials with relatively high figures of merit (zT) have been reported in the low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature regimes. However, there is an urgent demand for high&#8208;performance TE materials working in the mid&#8208;temperature range (400&#8211;700 K). Herein, p&#8208;type AgSbTe2 materials stabilized with S and Se co&#8208;doping are demonstrated to exhibit an outstanding maximum figure of merit (zTmax) of 2.3 at 673 K and an average figure of merit (zTave) of 1.59 over the wide temperature range of 300&#8211;673 K. This exceptional performance arises from an enhanced carrier density resulting from a higher concentration of silver vacancies, a vastly improved Seebeck coefficient enabled by the flattening of the valence band maximum&#160;and the inhibited formation of n&#8208;type Ag2Te, and ahighly improved stability beyond 673 K. The optimized material is used to fabricate a single&#8208;leg device with efficiencies up to 13.3% and a unicouple TE device reaching energy conversion efficiencies up to 12.3% at a temperature difference of 370 K. These results highlight an effective strategy to engineer high&#8208;performance TE material in the mid&#8208;temperature range.

         <title>Regulating Surface Oxygen Activity by Perovskite&#8208;Coating&#8208;Stabilized Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly active anionic redox in the ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathode is directly regulated by leveraging the stable oxygen vacancies/interstitials in a lithium and oxygen dual&#8208;ion conductor perovskite coating layer, which facilitates surface lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity at the same time. This work provides an effective strategy for capacity versus stability juggling of the high&#8208;energy cathodes.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxides are proposed as promising cathodes to fulfill the range demand of electric vehicles; yet, they are still haunted by compromised cyclability and thermal robustness. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art surface coating has been applied to solve the instability via blocking the physical contact between the electrolyte and the highly active Ni4+ ions on the cathode surface, but it falls short in handling the chemo&#8211;physical mobility of the oxidized lattice oxygen ions in the cathode. Herein, a direct regulation strategy is proposed to accommodate the highly active anionic redox within the solid phase. By leveraging the stable oxygen vacancies/interstitials in a lithium and oxygen dual&#8208;ion conductor (layered perovskite La4NiLiO8) coating layer, the reactivity of the surface lattice oxygen ion is dramatically restrained. As a result, the oxygen release from the lattice is suppressed, as well as the undesired irreversible phase transition and intergranular mechanical cracking. Meanwhile, the introduced dual&#8208;ion conductor can also facilitate lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity on the particle surface. This work demonstrates that accommodating the anionic redox chemistry by dual&#8208;ion conductors is an effective strategy for capacity versus stability juggling of the high&#8208;energy cathodes.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Trimetallic PtFeCo Nanosaws for Practical Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing highly efficient electrocatalysts with well&#8208;controlled nanostructure is significant for realizing the practical applications of fuel cells. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;a&#160;novel trimetallic platinum&#8211;iron&#8211;cobalt Pt3FeCo nanosaw with abundant defects and high&#8208;index edges&#160;is&#160;synthesized, reaching superior oxygen reduction reaction kinetics and fuel cell performances than commercial Pt/C. This work offers great inspiration for developing Pt&#8208;based multimetallic nanocatalysts in the future.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for fuel cell catalysis is the most critical and challenging step for the commercialization of fuel cell technology. Here 1D&#160;trimetallic platinum&#8211;iron&#8211;cobalt nanosaws (Pt3FeCo NSs) with low&#8208;coordination features are designed as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical fuel cell catalysis. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt3FeCo NSs (10.62&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 4.66 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 0.90&#160;V) is more than 25&#8208;folds higher than that of the commercial Pt/C, even after 30&#160;000 voltage cycles. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong inter&#8208;d&#8208;orbital electron transfer minimizes the ORR barrier with higher selectivity at robust valence states. The volcano correlation between the intrinsic structure featured with low&#8208;coordination Pt&#8208;sites and corresponding electronic activities is discovered, which guarantees high ORR activities. The Pt3FeCo NSs located in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) also achieve very high peak power density (1800.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and competitive specific/mass activities (1.79&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.79 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 0.90 ViR&#8208;free cell voltage) as well as a long&#8208;term lifetime in specific H2&#63743;O2 medium for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells, ranking top electrocatalysts reported to date for MEA. This work represents a class of multimetallic Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts for practical fuel cells and beyond.

Here 1D&#160;trimetallic platinum&#8211;iron&#8211;cobalt nanosaws (Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;FeCo NSs) with low-coordination features are designed as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical fuel cell catalysis. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;FeCo NSs (10.62&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 4.66 A mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt; at 0.90&#160;V) is more than 25-folds higher than that of the commercial Pt/C, even after 30&#160;000 voltage cycles. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the strong inter-d-orbital electron transfer minimizes the ORR barrier with higher selectivity at robust valence states. The volcano correlation between the intrinsic structure featured with low-coordination Pt-sites and corresponding electronic activities is discovered, which guarantees high ORR activities. The Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;FeCo NSs located in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) also achieve very high peak power density (1800.6&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and competitive specific/mass activities (1.79&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.79 A mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt; at 0.90 V&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;iR&lt;/i&gt;-free&lt;/sub&gt; cell voltage) as well as a long-term lifetime in specific H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; medium for proton-exchange-membrane fuel cells, ranking top electrocatalysts reported to date for MEA. This work represents a class of multimetallic Pt-based nanocatalysts for practical fuel cells and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dressing Bacteria With a Hybrid Immunoactive Nanosurface to Elicit Dual Anticancer and Antiviral Immunity</title>

Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and protecting susceptible patients from lethal infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but prove to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a combination of a checkpoint blocking antibody and a virus&#8208;specific antigen is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity.








Abstract
Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and protecting susceptible patients from lethal infections such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but prove to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity. A combination of a checkpoint blocking antibody and a virus&#8208;specific antigen is covalently conjugated to polydopamine nanoparticles, which can be anchored onto bacterial surface, by a one&#8208;step in situ polymerization of dopamine under a cell&#8208;friendly condition. By virtue of the ability to colonize and penetrate deep tumor tissue, dressed bacteria enable sustained release and expanded exposure of carried immunoactivators to stimulate immune cells. In addition to a carrier role, bacteria are able to further provoke innate immunity due to the native immunogenicity of the pathogen&#8208;associated molecular patterns. Immunization with dressed bacteria promotes the maturation, and activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells, which induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. As evidenced by efficient production of viral&#8208;antigen&#8208;specific immunoglobulin G antibody in serum and significantly suppressed tumor growth in different models, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface paves an avenue to prepare next&#8208;generation therapeutics for synergistic treatment and prevention.

         <title>Piezoelectric Actuation Mechanism Involving Extrinsic Nanodomain Dynamics in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric actuation mechanism in pseudocubic structures is clarified by the calculation of extrinsic/intrinsic contribution. Although only intrinsic contributes to the piezoelectricity, it does not match the piezoelectricity of BiFeO3&#8211;BaTiO3. It is clarified that extrinsic effect on nanodomain rearrangements is revealed in BiFeO3&#8211;BaTiO3. Extrinsic effect on nanodomain rearrangement is involved in the actuation mechanism of piezoelectricity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials play a key role in applications, while there are physically open questions. The physical origin of piezoelectricity is understood as the sum of contributions from intrinsic effects on lattice dynamics and those from extrinsic effects on ferroic&#8208;domain dynamics, but there is an incomplete understanding that all but intrinsic effects are classified as extrinsic effects. Therefore, the accurate classification of extrinsic effects is important for understanding&#160;the physical origin of piezoelectricity. In this work, high&#8208;energy synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray diffraction is utilized to measure the response of BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 piezoelectrics and the intrinsic/extrinsic contribution to electric fields. It is found from crystal structure and intrinsic/extrinsic contribution, using the analysis involving structure refinement with various structural model and micromechanics&#8208;based calculations, that Bi3+&#8208;ion disordering is important for realization of piezoelectricity and nanodomains. Here, an extrinsic effect on the rearrangement of nanodomains is suggested. The nanodomains, which are formed by the locally distorted structure around the A&#8208;site by Bi&#8208;ion disordering, can significantly deform the material in the BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 system, which contributes to the piezoelectric actuation mechanism apart from the extrinsic effect on ferroic&#8208;domain dynamics. Bi&#8208;ion disordering plays an important role in realizing piezoelectricity and nanodomains and can provide essential material design clues to develop next&#8208;generation Bi&#8208;based lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramics.

         <title>From Heterostructures to Solid&#8208;Solutions: Structural Tunability in Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degree of ion mixing in multicomponent perovskite crystals is a key factor for the stability and performance of optoelectronic devices but remains challenging to control. In this work, a new method, termed evaporation&#8211;crystallization polymer pen lithography, is used to synthesize and systematically study libraries of halide perovskite crystals (Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbX3, where X = halide anion) and reveals strategies for deliberately controlling ion segregation behavior in these materials.








Abstract
The stability, reliability, and performance of halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based devices depend upon the structure, composition, and particle size of the device&#8208;enabling materials. Indeed, the degree of ion mixing in multicomponent perovskite crystals, although challenging to control, is a key factor in determining properties. Herein, an emerging method termed evaporation&#8211;crystallization polymer pen lithography is used to synthesize and systematically study the degree of ionic mixing of Cs0.5FA0.5PbX3 (FA = formamidinium; X = halide anion, ABX3) crystals, as a function of size, temperature, and composition. These experiments have led to the discovery of a heterostructure morphology where the A&#8208;site cations, Cs and FA, are segregated into the core and edge layers, respectively. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the heterostructures form as a consequence of a combination of both differences in solubility of the two ions in solution and the enthalpic preference for Cs&#8211;FA ion segregation. This preference for segregation can be overcome to form a solid&#8208;solution by decreasing crystal size (&lt;60&#160;nm) or increasing temperature. Finally, these tools are utilized to identify and synthesize solid&#8208;solution nanocrystals of Cs0.5FA0.5Pb(Br/I)3 that significantly suppress photoinduced anion migration compared to their bulk counterparts, offering a route to deliberately designed photostable optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Electrical Manipulation of Topological Phases in a Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;gated Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 magnetic topological insulator devices are fabricated by combining molecular beam epitaxial growth and&#160;2D transfer methods. The large gate&#8208;tunability using mica as the gate dielectric leads to the observation of the reversible transition between two distinct topological phases, namely the quantum anomalous Hall and the anomalous Hall insulator, via electric field tuning.








Abstract
Quantum anomalous Hall phases arising from the inverted band topology in magnetically doped topological insulators have emerged as an important subject of research for quantization at zero magnetic fields. Though necessary for practical implementation, sophisticated electrical control of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)&#8208;grown quantum anomalous Hall matter have been stymied by growth and fabrication challenges. Here, a novel procedure is demonstrated, employing a combination of thin&#8208;film deposition and 2D&#160;material stacking techniques, to create dual&#8208;gated devices of the MBE&#8208;grown quantum anomalous Hall insulator, Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3. In these devices, orthogonal control over the field&#8208;induced charge density and the electric displacement field is demonstrated. A thorough examination of material responses to tuning along each control axis is presented, realizing magnetic property control along the former and a novel capability to manipulate the surface exchange gap along the latter. Through electrically addressing the exchange gap, the capabilities to either strengthen the quantum anomalous Hall state or suppress it entirely and drive a topological phase transition to a trivial state are demonstrated. The experimental result is explained using first principle theoretical calculations, and establishes a practical route for in situ control of quantum anomalous Hall states and topology.

The experimental result is explained using first principle theoretical calculations, and establishes a practical route for in situ control of quantum anomalous Hall states and topology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning of Polar Domain Boundaries in Nonpolar Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Domain boundaries with macroscopic polarity are discovered in a nonpolar PbZrO3&#8208;based single crystal. They can be preferentially created and erased by applying a small stress. The polarity can be enhanced or switched with a small electric field. Atomistic&#8208;structural analysis reveals that the polar domains boundaries are formed by a combination of &#8593;&#8593;&#8595;&#8208;like ferrielectric structures.








Abstract
Domain boundaries in ferroic materials are found to have various physical properties not observed in the surrounding domains. Such differences can be enhanced and bring promising functionalities when centrosymmetric nonpolar materials encounter polar domain boundaries. In this work, a tunable polar domain boundary is discovered in an antiferroelectric single crystal. Under a small stress or electric field, the density, volume, and polarity of the boundaries are successfully controlled.

         <title>Reshaping de Novo Protein Switches into Bioresponsive Materials for Biomarker, Toxin, and Viral Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining regenerated silk fibroin and de novo protein switches enables the design of a variety of sensing interfaces that have long shelf life and are highly sensitive and specific to numerous analytes such as pathogens, viruses, cancer markers, and toxins.








Abstract
De novo designed protein switches are powerful tools to specifically and sensitively detect diverse targets with simple chemiluminescent readouts. Finding an appropriate material host for de novo designed protein switches without altering their thermodynamics while preserving their intrinsic stability over time would enable the development of a variety of sensing formats to monitor exposure to pathogens, toxins, and for disease diagnosis. Here, a de novo protein&#8208;biopolymer hybrid that maintains the detection capabilities induced by the conformational change of the incorporated proteins&#160;in response to analytes of interest is generated in multiple, shelf&#8208;stable material formats without the need of refrigerated storage conditions. A set of functional demonstrator devices including personal protective equipment such as masks and laboratory gloves, free&#8208;standing films, air quality monitors, and wearable devices is presented to illustrate the versatility of the approach. Such formats are designed to be responsive to human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), anti&#8208;hepatitis B (HBV) antibodies, Botulinum neurotoxin B (BoNT/B), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). This combination of form and function offers wide opportunities for ubiquitous sensing in multiple environments by enabling a large class of bio&#8208;responsive interfaces of broad utility.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared Responsive J&#8208;Aggregates of Fused Quinoidal Tetracyanoindacenodithiophene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of J&#8208;aggregates based on quinoidal indacenodithiophenes are reported with an ultra&#8208;narrow bandwidth (full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum, FWHM&#160;=&#160;22&#160;nm) absoprtion peak located at 770&#160;nm. A combination of excited&#8208;state lifetime measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements are employed to probe their J&#8208;aggregate behavior. NIR phototransistors exhibit consistent photoresponse throughout the illumination intensity range at selective wavelength.








Abstract
Narrowband photoresponsive molecules are highly coveted in high&#8208;resolution imaging, sensing, and monochromatic photodetection, especially those extending into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral range. Here, a new class of J&#8208;aggregating materials based on quinoidal indacenodithiophenes (IDTs) that exhibit an ultra&#8208;narrowband (full width half maxima of 22&#160;nm) NIR absorption peak centered at 770&#160;nm is reported. The spectral width is readily tuned by the length of the solubilizing alkyl group, with longer chains resulting in significant spectral narrowing. The J&#8208;aggregate behavior is confirmed by a combination of excited state lifetime measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements. Their utility as electron&#8208;transporting materials is demonstrated in both transistor and phototransistor devices, with the latter demonstrating good response at NIR wavelengths (780&#160;nm) over a range of intensities.

         <title>Direct CO2 Capture by Alkali&#8208;Dissolved Cellulose and Sequestration in Building Materials and Artificial Reef Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media to lead mineralized cellulose materials at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio. Cellulose lean gels are converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites; meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration.








Abstract
Current carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies require high energy input and costly catalysts. Here, an effective pathway is offered that addresses climate action by atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Industrially relevant highly reactive alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media. The latter lead to mineralized cellulose materials (MCM) at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio, forming organic&#8208;inorganic viscous systems (viscosity from 102 to 107&#160;mPa&#160;s and storage modulus from 10 to 105&#160;Pa). CO2 absorption and conversion into calcium carbonate and associated minerals translate to maximum absorption of 6.5&#160;gCO2 gcellulose&#8722;1, tracking inversely with cellulose loading. Cellulose lean gels are easily converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites. Meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) suggests new CCU opportunities for building materials, as demonstrated in underwater deployment for coral reef ecosystem restoration.

         <title>Actively Triggerable Metals via Liquid Metal Embrittlement for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actively triggerable metals for biomedical applications combine the advantageous functional properties of metals with precise lifetime control. In this work, a biocompatible liquid metal is formulated into stimuli that can successfully trigger the on&#8208;demand and programmable breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically relevant environments. Additionally, three use cases for actively triggerable metals in biomedical devices are presented.








Abstract
Actively triggerable materials, which break down upon introduction of an exogenous stimulus, enable precise control over the lifetime of biomedical technologies, as well as adaptation to unforeseen circumstances, such as changes to an established treatment plan. Yet, most actively triggerable materials are low&#8208;strength polymers and hydrogels with limited long&#8208;term durability. By contrast, metals possess advantageous functional properties, including high mechanical strength and conductivity, that are desirable across several applications within biomedicine. To realize actively triggerable metals, a mechanism called liquid metal embrittlement is leveraged, in which certain liquid metals penetrate the grain boundaries of certain solid metals and cause them to dramatically weaken or disintegrate. In this work, it is demonstrated that eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), a biocompatible alloy of gallium, can be formulated to reproducibly trigger the breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically relevant environments. The breakdown behavior of aluminum after triggering can further be readily controlled by manipulating its grain structure. Finally, three possible use cases of biomedical devices constructed from actively triggerable metals are demonstrated.

Additionally, three use cases for actively triggerable metals in biomedical devices are presented.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actively triggerable materials, which break down upon introduction of an exogenous stimulus, enable precise control over the lifetime of biomedical technologies, as well as adaptation to unforeseen circumstances, such as changes to an established treatment plan. Yet, most actively triggerable materials are low-strength polymers and hydrogels with limited long-term durability. By contrast, metals possess advantageous functional properties, including high mechanical strength and conductivity, that are desirable across several applications within biomedicine. To realize actively triggerable metals, a mechanism called liquid metal embrittlement is leveraged, in which certain liquid metals penetrate the grain boundaries of certain solid metals and cause them to dramatically weaken or disintegrate. In this work, it is demonstrated that eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), a biocompatible alloy of gallium, can be formulated to reproducibly trigger the breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically relevant environments. The breakdown behavior of aluminum after triggering can further be readily controlled by manipulating its grain structure. Finally, three possible use cases of biomedical devices constructed from actively triggerable metals are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding Self&#8208;Assembly of Silica&#8208;Precipitating Peptides to Control Silica Particle Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic silaffin&#8208;based peptides give rise to different template structures depending on stereochemistry and connectivity of the central residue. NMR experiments help to decipher the peptidic template structures. The resulting structure&#8211;activity relationship provides a key to rationally control the assembly of such peptides and thereby the resulting silica material as the peptidic precursor structures determine the materials final architecture.








Abstract
The most advanced materials are those found in nature. These evolutionary optimized substances provide highest efficiencies, e.g., in harvesting solar energy or providing extreme stability, and are intrinsically biocompatible. However, the mimicry of biological materials is limited to a few successful applications since there is still a lack of the tools to recreate natural materials. Herein, such means are provided based on a peptide library derived from the silaffin protein R5 that enables rational biomimetic materials design. It is now evident that biomaterials do not form via mechanisms observed in vitro. Instead, the material's function and morphology are predetermined by precursors that self&#8208;assemble in solution, often from a combination of protein and salts. These assemblies act as templates for biomaterials. The RRIL peptides used here are a small part of the silica&#8208;precipitation machinery in diatoms. By connecting RRIL motifs via varying central bi&#8208; or trifunctional residues, a library of stereoisomers is generated, which allows characterization of different template structures in the presence of phosphate ions by combining residue&#8208;resolved real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Understanding these templates in atomistic detail, the morphology of silica particles is controlled via manipulation of the template precursors.

Given their low&#8208;temperature solution processability and mechanical flexibility, organic field&#8208;effect transistors are promising candidates for developing Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things technologies and realizing next&#8208;generation wearable applications. Here, the authors compare the performance of flexible transistors with the emerging vertical&#8208;transistor technology, outline the critical device fabrication and material&#8208;design strategies, and discuss their role and function in a wide range of flexible electronics applications.








Abstract
The development of flexible and conformable devices, whose performance can be maintained while being continuously deformed, provides a significant step toward the realization of next&#8208;generation wearable and e&#8208;textile applications. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are particularly interesting for flexible and lightweight products, because of their low&#8208;temperature solution processability, and the mechanical flexibility of organic materials that endows OFETs the natural compatibility with plastic and biodegradable substrates. Here, an in&#8208;depth review of two competing flexible OFET technologies, planar and vertical OFETs (POFETs and VOFETs, respectively) is provided. The electrical, mechanical, and physical properties of POFETs and VOFETs are critically discussed, with a focus on four pivotal applications (integrated logic circuits, light&#8208;emitting devices, memories, and sensors). It is pointed out that the flexible function of the relatively newer VOFET technology, along with its perspective on advancing the applicability of flexible POFETs, has not been reviewed so far, and the direct comparison regarding the performance of POFET&#8208; and VOFET&#8208;based flexible applications is most likely absent. With discussions spanning printed and wearable electronics, materials science, biotechnology, and environmental monitoring, this contribution is a clear stimulus to researchers working in these fields to engage toward the plentiful possibilities that POFETs and VOFETs offer to flexible electronics.

         <title>Recent Research Progress of Organic Small&#8208;Molecule Semiconductors with High Electron Mobilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 11, March 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the structural modification strategies of organic small&#8208;molecule semiconductors with high electron mobilities, a promising candidate for the construction of next&#8208;generation complementary organic logic&#8208;digital circuits, to achieve chemical stability and high electron transport properties. In addition, the applications of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials based on high mobility in organic electronic devices, such as organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, organic photodetectors, and gas sensors, are introduced.








Abstract
Organic electronics has made great progress in the past decades, which is inseparable from the innovative development of organic electronic devices and the diversity of organic semiconductor materials. It is worth mentioning that both of these great advances are inextricably linked to the development of organic high&#8208;performance semiconductor materials, especially the representative n&#8208;type organic small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high electron mobilities. The n&#8208;type organic small molecules have the advantages of simple synthesis process, strong intermolecular stacking, tunable molecular structure, and easy to functionalize structures. Furthermore, the n&#8208;type semiconductor is a remarkable and important component for constructing complementary logic circuits and p&#8208;n heterojunction structures. Therefore, n&#8208;type organic semiconductors play an extremely important role in the field of organic electronic materials and are the basis for the industrialization of organic electronic functional devices. This review focuses on the modification strategies of organic small molecules with high electron mobility at molecular level, and discusses in detail the applications of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high mobility in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, organic photodetectors, and gas sensors.

         <title>A Novel &#8220;Inside&#8208;Out&#8221; Intraocular Nanomedicine Delivery Mode for Nanomaterials&#8217; Biological Effect Enhanced Choroidal Neovascularization Occlusion and Microenvironment Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pt and Au nanoparticle decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise choroidal neovascularization occlusion and microenvironment regulation. A novel &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; intraocular nanomedicine delivery mode is exploited to penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis. The mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF reduce by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively, compared to verteporfin treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treatment due to the superior light transmittance of the eye. However, PDT often leads to surrounding tissue damage and further microenvironmental deterioration, including exacerbated hypoxia, inflammation, and secondary neovascularization. In this work, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Au NPs decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise PDT and microenvironment amelioration, which can penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis and target to CNV by surface&#8208;grafted cyclo(Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp&#8211;d&#8208;Phe&#8211;Lys) after intravitreal injection. The excessive H2O2 in the CNV microenvironment is catalyzed by catalase&#8208;like Pt NPs for hypoxia relief and enhanced PDT occlusion of neovascular. Meanwhile, Au NPs show significant anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;angiogenesis properties in regulating macrophages and blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Compared with verteporfin treatment, the mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF in the nanoplatform group are downregulated by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively. Therefore, the nanoplatform realizes a comprehensive CNV treatment effect based on the high drug loading capacity and biosafety. The CNV treatment mode developed in this work provides a valuable reference for treating other diseases with similar physiological barriers that limit drug delivery and similar microenvironment.

In this work, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Au NPs decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise PDT and microenvironment amelioration, which can penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis and target to CNV by surface-grafted cyclo(Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp&#8211;d-Phe&#8211;Lys) after intravitreal injection. The excessive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the CNV microenvironment is catalyzed by catalase-like Pt NPs for hypoxia relief and enhanced PDT occlusion of neovascular. Meanwhile, Au NPs show significant anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenesis properties in regulating macrophages and blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Compared with verteporfin treatment, the mRNA expressions of hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945; and VEGF in the nanoplatform group are downregulated by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively. Therefore, the nanoplatform realizes a comprehensive CNV treatment effect based on the high drug loading capacity and biosafety. The CNV treatment mode developed in this work provides a valuable reference for treating other diseases with similar physiological barriers that limit drug delivery and similar microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Y&#8208;Type Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors with Outer Branched Side Chains and Inner Cyclohexane Side Chains for 19.36% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains are designed for polymer solar cells with the power conversion efficiencies of 18.52% and 19.36% achieved in the binary and ternary blend devices, respectively, which are among the highest values for single&#8208;junction solar cells at present.








Abstract
Raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can increase the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and thus the photovoltaic performance of the current top performing polymer solar cells (PSCs). One of the viable routes is demonstrated by the successful Y6 derivative of L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains at the outer side. This will introduce steric hindrance and reduce intermolecular aggregation, thus open up the bandgap and raise the LUMO energy level. To take further advantages of the steric hindrance influence on optoelectronic properties of Y6 derivatives, two Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors of BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F and BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4Cl are designed and synthesized by adopting outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains. An outstanding Voc of 0.937&#160;V is achieved in the D18:BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F binary blend devices along with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.52%. With the addition of BTP&#8208;eC9 to extend the absorption spectral coverage, a remarkable PCE of 19.36% is realized finally in the related ternary blend devices, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;junction PSCs at present. The results illustrate the great potential of cyclohexane side chains in constructing high&#8208;performance non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and their PSCs.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Transparent, Chiral Organic Photodiodes with Incident Direction&#8208;Dependent Selectivity for Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;transparent organic photodiodes containing chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor and achiral polymer donor respond differently to left and right circularly polarized light. The preference switches when changing the direction of the incoming light. Circular selective absorption in combination with selective collection of carriers from a narrow space charge region can account for the change in polarization.








Abstract
Detection of the circular polarization of light is possible using chiral semiconductors, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Semi&#8208;transparent chiral photodiodes allow for a simple experiment to investigate the basis of their selectivity: changing the side from which the diode is illuminated. A reversal of circular selectivity is observed in photocurrent generation when changing the direction of illumination on organic, bulk&#8208;heterojunction cells. The change in selectivity can be explained by a space&#8208;charge limitation on the collection of photocarriers in combination with preferential absorption of one of the circular polarizations of near&#8208;infrared light by the chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor. The space&#8208;charge limitation is supported by detailed measurements of frequency and intensity dependence of dc and ac photocurrents.

         <title>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Mediated Drug Delivery for First Aid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system is developed for targeted drug delivery (uFAST), which enables autonomous administration of emergency therapeutics via UAVs to achieve timely first aid. The implementability and safety of the uFAST with a dual&#8208;mode glucagon microneedle patch in emergency care is well demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig disease model.








Abstract
Timely administration of key medications toward patients with sudden diseases is critical to saving lives. However, slow transport of first&#8208;aid therapeutics and the potential absence of trained people for drug usage can&#160;lead&#160;to severe injuries or even death. Herein, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system for targeted delivery (uFAST) is developed. It allows unattended administration of emergency therapeutics&#8208;loaded transdermal microneedle (MN) patches toward patients to relieve symptoms by a contact&#8208;triggered microneedle applicator (CTMA). The implementability and safety of the uFAST for first aid is demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig model by automatically delivering a glucagon patch with immediate and bioresponsive dual release modes. This platform technique may facilitate the development of UAV&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid treatments for other sudden diseases.

         <title>Dislocated Bilayer MOF Enables High&#8208;Selectivity Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D monolayer and 2D bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by a simple solvothermal method. The bilayer MOF is a novel dislocation 2D porphyrin&#8208;based MOF material that exhibits good structural stability as well as ultra&#8208;high CO selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (100% selectivity). This work offers a new strategy for the construction of bilayer MOFs and provides a new perspective for the customization of photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
The highly selective photoreduction of CO2 into valuable small&#8208;molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, it remains a challenge because the complex CO2 photoreduction process usually generates multiple possible products and requires a subsequent separation step. In this paper, 2D monolayer and bilayer porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are successfully constructed by adjusting the reaction temperature and solvent polarity with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin as the light&#8208;harvesting ligand. The bilayer MOF is a low&#8208;dimensional MOF with a special structure in which the upper and lower layers are arranged in dislocation and are bridged by halogen ions. This bilayer MOF exhibits 100% ultra&#8208;high selectivity for the reduction of CO2 to CO under simulated sunlight without any cocatalyst or photosensitizer and can be recycled at least three times. The intrinsic mechanism of this photocatalytic CO2 reduction process is explored through experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work shows that the rational design of the number of layers in 2D MOF structures can tune the stability of these structures and opens a new avenue for the design of highly selective MOF photocatalysts.

         <title>Multifunctional 3D&#8208;Printed Pollen Grain&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Microrobots for On&#8208;Demand Anchoring and Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional hydrogel microrobot is created by different stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with pollen grain&#8208;inspired microstructures. The robot is capable of conducting temperature&#8208;responsive on&#8208;demand surface attachment, magnetic locomotion, and pH&#8208;responsive cargo delivery toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
While a majority of wireless microrobots have shown multi&#8208;responsiveness to implement complex biomedical functions, their functional executions are strongly dependent on the range of stimulus inputs, which curtails their functional diversity. Furthermore, their responsive functions are coupled to each other, which results in the overlap of the task operations. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed multifunctional microrobot inspired by pollen grains with three hydrogel components is demonstrated: iron platinum (FePt) nanoparticle&#8208;embedded pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA), poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM), and poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide acrylic acid (pNIPAM&#8208;AAc) structures. Each of these structures exhibits their respective targeted functions: responding to magnetic fields for torque&#8208;driven surface rolling and steering, exhibiting temperature responsiveness for on&#8208;demand surface attachment (anchoring), and pH&#8208;responsive cargo release. The versatile multifunctional pollen grain&#8208;inspired robots conceptualized here pave the way for various future medical microrobots to improve their projected performance and functional diversity.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Polymer as a New Platform for Efficient and Selective Electroreduction of Nitrate into Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for simultaneous enhancement of activity and selectivity toward nitrate electroreduction into ammonia (NRA) is demonstrated by utilizing Ni&#8208;based conjugated coordination polymer catalysts for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. Coordination modulation can tailor their electrostatic attractions with the metal&#8208;hydrated cations that can regulate proton migration at the catalyst surface, promoting the NRA and inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).








Abstract
Electroreduction of nitrate into ammonia (NRA) provides a sustainable route to convert the widespread nitrate pollutants into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products under ambient conditions, which unfortunately suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Previous strategies of modifying the metal sites of catalysts often met a dilemma for simultaneously promoting activity and selectivity toward NRA. Here, a general strategy is reported to enable an efficient and selective NRA process through coordination modulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts to tailor the local proton concentration at the catalyst surface. By contrast, two analogous Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom enriched conjugated coordination polymers (NiO4&#8208;CCP and NiN4&#8208;CCP) with different coordination motifs are investigated for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. The NiO4&#8208;CCP catalyst exhibits an ammonia yield rate as high as 1.83&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 94.7% under a current density of 125&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming the NiN4&#8208;CCP catalyst. These experimental and theoretical studies both suggest that the strategy of coordination modulation can not only accelerate the NRA&#160;by adjusting the adsorption energies of NRA intermediates on the metal sites but also inhibit the HER through regulating the proton migration with contributions from the metal&#8208;hydrated cations adsorbed at the catalyst surface, thus achieving simultaneous enhancement of NRA selectivity and activity.

         <title>Unlocking High Capacity and Fast Na+ Diffusion of HxCrS2 by Proton&#8208;Exchange Pretreatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pretreatment of NaCrS2 to produce HxCrS2 results in a more robust and higher performing electrode by numerous measures. Proton exchange produces a heterostructure that permits fast diffusion while also seemingly unlocking reversible access to cationic redox, enabling high capacity. The unique biphasic structure of HxCrS2 may be generalizable to other materials, opening a new class of electrode materials.








Abstract
This study presents a new material, &#8220;HxCrS2&#8221; (denotes approximate composition) formed by proton&#8208;exchange of NaCrS2 which has a measured capacity of 728 mAh g&#8722;1 with significant improvements to capacity retention, sustaining over 700 mAh g&#8722;1 during cycling experiments. This is the highest reported capacity for a transition metal sulfide electrode and outperforms the most promising proposed sodium anodes to date. HxCrS2 exhibits a biphasic structure featuring alternating crystalline and amorphous lamella on the scale of a few nanometers. This unique structural motif enables reversible access to Cr redox in the material resulting in higher capacities than seen in the parent structure which features only S redox. Pretreatment by proton&#8208;exchange offers a route to materials such as HxCrS2 which provide fast diffusion and high capacities for sodium&#8208;ion&#160;batteries.

         <title>Ultrasensitive and Ultraprecise Pressure Sensors for Soft Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making flexible sensors more precise is the focus of this research. It is found that by making the pressure sensing layer using pure materials&#160;and separating it from the rest of the sensor structure, the errors caused by the sensor's deformation can be reduced when it is subjected to external forces. This leads to improved precision and flexibility in sensing.








Abstract
Highly sensitive soft pressure sensors have attracted tremendous attention in recent years due to their great promise in robotics, healthcare, smart wearables, etc. Although high sensitivities can be realized by existing sensing mechanisms, they usually cause large random errors owing to inhomogeneous sensing layers, thus considerably reducing the sensing precision for practical applications. Herein, a pure&#8208;polymer and field emission bilayer structure (PFEBS)&#8208;based transduction mechanism is presented to successfully design an ultrasensitive and ultraprecise soft pressure sensor for the first time. This unique structure enables numerous tunneling electrons generated by field emission to be transmitted through the homogeneous sensing layer, which undergoes uniform deformation under subtle pressures, simultaneously achieving a sensing precision with variation &lt;1.62% and a sensitivity of 372.2 kPa&#8722;1. This study offers a new design strategy to develop next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible pressure sensors for soft systems.

         <title>Highly Damping and Self&#8208;Healable Ionic Elastomer from Dynamic Phase Separation of Sticky Fluorinated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the heterogeneous structure of adipose tissue, the first example of damping self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer is reported, which features a dynamic phase&#8208;separated structure with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix. By virtue of phase separation and sticky liquid crystal assembly of fluorinated copolymers, this design reconciles elasticity and damping capacity, which are usually contradictive in previous ionic skins.








Abstract
Shock&#8208;induced low&#8208;frequency vibration damage is extremely harmful to bionic soft robots and machines that may incur the malfunction of fragile electronic elements. However, current skin&#8208;like self&#8208;healable ionic elastomers as the artificial sensing and protecting layer still lack the ability to dampen vibrations, due to their almost opposite design for molecular frictions to material's elasticity. Inspired by the two&#8208;phase structure of adipose tissue (the natural damping skin layer), here, a highly damping ionic elastomer with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix is introduced, which is formed by polymerization&#8208;induced dynamic phase separation of sticky fluorinated copolymers in the presence of lithium salts. Such a supramolecular design decouples the elastic and damping functions into two distinct phases, and thus reconciles a few intriguing properties including ionic conductivity, high stretchability, softness, strain&#8208;stiffening, elastic recovery, room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healability, recyclability, and most importantly, record&#8208;high damping capacity at the human motion frequency range (loss factor tan &#948;&#160;&gt;&#160;1 at 0.1&#8211;50&#160;Hz). This study opens the door for the artificial syntheses of high&#8208;performance damping ionic skins with robust sensing and protective applications in soft electronics and robotics.

This study opens the door for the artificial syntheses of high-performance damping ionic skins with robust sensing and protective applications in soft electronics and robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Picoperovskites: The Smallest Conceivable Isolated Halide Perovskite Structures Formed within Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 form &#8220;picoperovskites&#8221; in 1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm&#8208;diameter single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with cross&#8208;sectional unit&#8208;cell or sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell dimensions. The smallest of these are bilayer inorganic polymers retaining ABX3 stoichiometry while intermediate&#8208;scale Cs3PbBr3 preserves Pb2+ by forming ordered vacancies. The largest Cs4Sn4Ix form alternates Cs4 and Sn4Ix layers along the nanotube cavities.








Abstract
Halide perovskite structures are revolutionizing the design of optoelectronic materials, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and photovoltaics when formed at the quantum scale. Four isolated sub&#8208;nanometer, or picoscale, halide perovskite structures formed inside &#8776;1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by melt insertion from CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 are reported. Three directly relate to the ABX3 perovskite archetype while a fourth is a perovskite&#8208;like lamellar structure with alternating Cs4 and polyhedral Sn4Ix layers. In &#8776;1.4&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 forms Cs3PbIIBr5 nanowires, one ABX3 unit cell in cross section with the Pb2+ oxidation state maintained by ordered Cs+ vacancies. Within &#8776;1.2&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 and CsSnI3 form inorganic&#8208;polymer&#8208;like bilayer structures, one&#8208;fourth of an ABX3 unit cell in cross section with systematically reproduced ABX3 stoichiometry. Producing these smallest halide perovskite structures at their absolute synthetic cross&#8208;sectional limit enables quantum confinement effects with first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrating bandgap widening compared to corresponding bulk structural forms.

         <title>Rational Design of Platinum&#8211;Bismuth Sulfide Schottky Heterostructure for Sonocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is first proposed. The synthesized platinum&#8211;bismuth sulfide&#160;nanoparticles exhibit ultrasound&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen production, glutathione oxidation, relieve hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, and effectively kill cancer cells by inhibiting cancer cell energy metabolism, increasing intratumoral reactive oxygen species levels, and inducing DNA damage.








Abstract
Conventional sonodynamic therapy is unavoidably limited by the tumor microenvironment, although many sonosensitizers have been developed to improve them to a certain extent. Given this, a concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is proposed, which is defined as an oxygen&#8208;independent therapeutics. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, the narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) is selected as the sonocatalyst and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are grown in situ to optimize their catalytic performance. In this nanocatalytic system, the Pt nanoparticles help to capture sonoexcited electrons, whereas intratumoral overexpressed glutathione (GSH), as a natural hole sacrificial agent, can consume sonoexcited holes, which greatly improves the charge&#8208;separation efficiency and promotes controllable and sustainable H2&#160;generation. Even under hypoxic conditions, the Pt&#8208;Bi2S3&#160;nanoparticles can also produce sufficient H2&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2&#160;and intratumoral redox homeostasis destruction by GSH depletion synergistically damage DNA to induce tumor cells apoptosis. At the same time, the Pt nanoparticles and holes can also trigger the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into O2&#160;to relieve tumor hypoxia,&#160;thus&#160;being synergistic with GSH depletion to reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The proposed sonocatalysis&#8208;mediated therapy will provide a new direction to realize facile and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Dual/Triple Template&#8208;Induced Evolved Emulsion for Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Carbon Nanoparticles from Concave to Convex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual/triple template&#8208;induced evolved emulsion strategy is developed for the precise construction of anisotropic mesoporous carbon nanoparticles. It not only endows the concave structure with adjustable size and meso&#8208;structure but also realizes the innovative transformation from concave to convex in a one&#8208;pot method. Moreover, the well&#8208;designed basin&#8208;concave and mountain&#8208;convex nanoparticles manifest excellent performance for improving drug release rate and enzyme catalytic efficiency.








Abstract
Anisotropic mesoporous carbon (AMC) nanoparticles with asymmetric external morphologies, topological internal structure, and superior performance of carbon species are attracting great attention because of their seductive features differentiating them from symmetric nanoparticles. However, a bewildering challenge but crucial desire remains to endow them with flexibly tunable morphology and pore structure. Herein, a dual/triple&#8208;templating evolved emulsion strategy for tunable fabrication of AMC nanoparticles with distinctive defined structure by interface&#8208;energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is first reported based on a brand&#8208;new mechanism. It describes the possible formation process of the concave&#8208;cavity structure and allows for manipulation of the longitudinal and lateral sizes systematically by adjusting emulsion polarity and sodium oleate dosage, respectively. Interestingly, the internal pore structure can be rearranged into radial channels and the external morphology can realize structural transformation from concave to convex by innovatively introducing the third template n&#8208;hexanol, which is unprecedented at nanoscale. Remarkably, due to the excellent properties of carbon species and unique structural characteristics, AMC nanoparticles not only demonstrate good biocompatibility but also exhibit splendid performance in improving the dissolution and release rates of insoluble drug and enhancing the enzyme catalytic efficiency. Generally, this approach provides new inspiration and insights for expanding exquisite anisotropic nanomaterials for many potential applications.

         <title>A Breathable, Passive&#8208;Cooling, Non&#8208;Inflammatory, and Biodegradable Aerogel Electronic Skin for Wearable Physical&#8208;Electrophysiological&#8208;Chemical Analysis</title>

A breathable, passive&#8208;cooling, non&#8208;inflammatory, biodegradable, and flexible aerogel electronic skin is developed to monitor physical, electrophysiological, and metabolic biomarkers from the human body continuously and simultaneously.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of human health can be significantly improved by designing novel electronic skin (E&#8208;skin) platforms that mimic the characteristics and sensitivity of human skin. A high&#8208;quality E&#8208;skin platform that can simultaneously monitor multiple physiological and metabolic biomarkers without introducing skin discomfort or irritation is an unmet medical need. Conventional E&#8208;skins are either monofunctional or made from elastomeric films that do not include key synergistic features of natural skin, such as multi&#8208;sensing, breathability, and thermal management capabilities in a single patch. Herein, a biocompatible and biodegradable E&#8208;skin patch based on flexible gelatin methacryloyl aerogel (FGA) for non&#8208;invasive and continuous monitoring of multiple biomarkers of interest is engineered and demonstrated. Taking advantage of cryogenic temperature treatment and slow polymerization, FGA is fabricated with a highly interconnected porous structure that displays good flexibility, passive&#8208;cooling capabilities, and ultra&#8208;lightweight properties that make it comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It also provides numerous permeable capillary channels for thermal&#8208;moisture transfer, ensuring its excellent breathability. Therefore, the engineered FGA&#8208;based E&#8208;skin can simultaneously monitor body temperature, hydration, and biopotentials via electrophysiological sensors and detect glucose, lactate, and alcohol levels via electrochemical sensors. This work offers a previously unexplored materials strategy for next&#8208;generation E&#8208;skin platforms with superior practicality.

         <title>A Pseudocapacitor Diode Based on Ion&#8208;Selective Surface Redox Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudocapacitor diode is proposed for the first time, which is constructed by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox mechanism of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous electrolyte KOH, thus successfully integrating the function of blocking the unidirectional current response of a diode into an aqueous pseudocapacitor with fast ion conduction capability.








Abstract
Supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is a novel device that integrates ion diode functionality into a conventional electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor and is expected to have great applications in emerging fields such as signal propagation, microcircuit rectification, logic operations, and neuromorphology. Here, a brand new pseudocapacitor diode is reported that has both high charge storage (50.2&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) and high rectification (the rectification ratio of 0.79 at 200&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) properties, which is realized by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox reaction of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, an application of the integrated device is demonstrated in the logic gate of circuit system to realize the logic operations of &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;. This work not only expands the types of CAPodes, but also provides a train of thought for constructing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Locked Tandem Fluorescent Probe for Imaging of Pyroptosis in Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is presented for real&#8208;time near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. It provides a non&#8208;invasive tool to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis during cancer therapy and predict cancer therapeutic efficacy, hence capable of being applied to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of programmed cancer cell death (PCD) is imperative to monitor cancer therapeutic efficacy and tailor therapeutic regimens; however, specific in vivo detection of intratumoral pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, a dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is reported for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. The probe comprises a hemicyanine dye dual&#8208;locked with an enzyme&#8208;responsive moiety that can be tandemly cleaved by pyroptosis&#8208;related biomarker (Caspase&#8208;1) and cancer biomarker (GGT) to turn on its NIRF signal. As pyroptosis plays a vital role in triggering anti&#8208;tumor immune responses, the activated signal of DTAP correlates well with the population of tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and tumor growth inhibition, consequently permitting the prediction of cancer therapeutic efficacy. This study also provides a non&#8208;invasive technique to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis in cancer therapy and to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.

         <title>Graph Analysis with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristive Crossbar Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graph analysis based on the desired sneak current is performed using a self&#8208;rectifying memristor and a &#8220;metal cell at diagonalcrossbar array (mCBA)&#8221; structure. mCBA effectively extracts hidden information from complex networks without preprocessing and loss of information. Three graph algorithms (pathfinding, link prediction, community detection) and brain network&#8208;based attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder classification are performed effectively based on the mCBA.








Abstract
Many big data have interconnected and dynamic graph structures growing over time. Analyzing these graphical data requires the hidden relationship between the nodes in the graphs to be identified, which has conventionally been achieved by finding the effective similarity. However, graphs are generally non&#8208;Euclidean, which does not allow finding it. In this study, the non&#8208;Euclidean graphs are mapped to a specific crossbar array (CBA) composed of self&#8208;rectifying memristors and metal cells at the diagonal positions. The sneak current, an intrinsic physical property in the CBA, allows for the identification of the similarity function. The sneak&#8208;current&#8208;based similarity function indicates the distance between the nodes, which can be used to predict the probability that unconnected nodes will be connected in the future, connectivity between communities, and neural connections in a brain. When all bit lines of the CBA are connected to the ground, the sneak current is suppressed, and the CBA can be used to search for adjacent nodes. This work demonstrates the physical calculation methods applied to various graphical problems&#160;using the CBA composed of the self&#8208;rectifying memristor based on the HfO2 switching layer. Moreover, such applications suffer less from the memristors&#8217; inherent issues related to their stochastic nature.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Guaranteed High Carrier Mobility in Quasi&#8208;2D Thermoelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The horizontal mirror symmetry in BaAgSb vanishes the electron&#8211;phonon coupling mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors, which weakens the phonon&#8208;induced carrier scattering and triggers a record hole mobility among polycrystalline quasi&#8208;2D thermoelectrics. Such high mobility accompanied with intrinsically low thermal conductivity gives rise to excellent p&#8208;type thermoelectric performance in polycrystalline BaAgSb.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next&#8208;generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties. However, most quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors experimentally synthesized so far have relatively low carrier mobility, preventing the achievement of exceptional power output. To break through this obstacle, a route is proposed based on the crystal symmetry arguments to facilitate the charge transport of quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors, in which the horizontal mirror symmetry is found to vanish the electron&#8211;phonon coupling strength mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors. This is demonstrated in ZrBeSi&#8208;type quasi&#8208;2D systems, where the representative sample Ba1.01AgSb shows a high room&#8208;temperature hole mobility of 344 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1, a record value among quasi&#8208;2D polycrystalline thermoelectrics. Accompanied by intrinsically low thermal conductivity, an excellent p&#8208;type zT of &#8776;1.3 is reached at 1012 K, which is the highest value in ZrBeSi&#8208;type compounds. This work uncovers the relation between electron&#8211;phonon coupling and crystal symmetry in quasi&#8208;2D systems, which broadens the horizon to develop high mobility semiconductors for electronic and energy conversion applications.

The multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA), with terminal amino and carboxyl groups, passivates the surface defects and enhances the stability of the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite, therefore resulting in high sensitivity and highly stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors. In addition, the ATFBA&#8208;based photodetector has been integrated with a pulse oximetry visualization system, successfully yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate.








Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap tin (Sn)&#8208;lead (Pb) halide perovskites can achieve near&#8208;infrared response for photodetectors. However, the Sn&#8208;based devices suffer from notorious instability and high defect densities due to the oxidation propensity of Sn2+. Herein, a multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA) is presented, which can passivate surface defects and inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ through hydrogen bonds and chelation coordination from the terminal amino and carboxyl groups. The perfluorinated benzene ring structure of ATFBA affords the passivator assembled at the grain boundaries to enhance the water resistance. With the synergistical passivation of these functional groups, the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetector exhibits a remarkable responsivity of 0.52&#160;A&#160;W&#8208;1 and an excellent specific detectivity of 5.34&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at 850&#160;nm, along with remaining 97% of its initial responsivity over 450 days. Benefitting from high sensitivity, the photodetector is integrated into a pulse oximetry sensor visualization system, yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate with less than 2% error. This work paves the avenue toward constructing high&#8208;performance and stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors for practical applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Replication and Transfer for Low&#8208;Cost, Sub&#8208;100&#160;nm Patterning of Materials on Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new additive patterning technique, named electrochemical replication and transfer, is developed to pattern a wide variety of metals, semiconductors, and polymers with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters on flexible substrates at low cost and high throughput.








Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;resolution patterns on flexible substrates is an essential step in the development of flexible electronics. However, the patterning process on flexible substrates often requires expensive equipment and tedious lithographic processing. Here, a bottom&#8208;up patterning technique, termed electrochemical replication and transfer (ERT) is reported, which fabricates multiscale patterns of a wide variety of materials by selective electrodeposition of target materials on a predefined template, and subsequent transfer of the electrodeposited materials to a flexible substrate, while leaving the undamaged template for reuse for over 100 times. The additive and parallel patterning attribute of ERT allows the fabrication of multiscale patterns with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters simultaneously, which overcomes the trade&#8208;off between resolution and throughput of conventional patterning techniques. ERT is suitable for fabricating a wide variety of materials including metals, semiconductors, metal oxides, and polymers into arbitrary shapes on flexible substrates at a very low cost.

         <title>Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Microribbon Scaffolds Induce Regenerative Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses in a Critical&#8208;Size Cranial Bone Defect Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane coating represents a biomimetic strategy for modifying the surface of biomaterials. Coating macroporous microribbon scaffolds with mesenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM) enhances cranial bone healing via immunomodulation. Primed MSCM&#8208;coating contains ligands that promote M&#966; polarization toward M2, induce Treg differentiation and TCD8+ apoptosis, and enhance MSC osteogenesis. MSCM coating synergizes with BMP&#8208;2 to further accelerate bone regeneration while suppressing inflammation.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;derived cell membranes have shown great promise in functionalizing nanoparticles to enhance biointerfacing functions for drug delivery applications. However, its potential for functionalizing macroporous scaffolds to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo remains unexplored. Engineering scaffolds with immunomodulatory functions represents an exciting strategy for tissue regeneration but is largely limited to soft tissues. Critical&#8208;sized bone defects cannot heal on their own, and the role of adaptive immune cells in scaffold&#8208;mediated healing of cranial bone defects remains largely unknown. Here, mensenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM)&#8208;coated microribbon (&#181;RB) scaffolds for treating critical size cranial bone defects via targeting immunomodulation are reported. Confocal imaging and proteomic analyses are used to confirm successful coating and characterize the compositions of cell membrane coating. It is demonstrated that MSCM coating promotes macrophage (M&#966;) polarization toward regenerative phenotype, induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and enhances regulatory T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. When combined with a low dosage of BMP&#8208;2, MSCM coating further accelerates bone regeneration and suppresses inflammation. These results establish cell membrane&#8208;coated microribbon scaffolds as a promising strategy for treating critical size bone defects via immunomodulation. The platform may be broadly used with different cell membranes and scaffolds to enhance regeneration of multiple tissue types.

         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip operated by LED is developed to detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses simultaneously. The ultrafast target enrichment (&#8776;500&#215;) followed by autonomous elution and amplification via photothermal activation enables limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The sensitive detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings comparable to standard polymerase chain reaction allows timely management of various pandemic situations that may be faced shortly.








Abstract
Prompt on&#8208;site diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with other respiratory infections will have minimized the global impact of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic through rapid, effective management. However, no such multiplex point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) chip has satisfied a suitable sensitivity of gold&#8208;standard nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Here, a rapid multiplexed ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (MUSAL) chip operated by simple LED&#8208;driven photothermal amplification to detect six targets from single&#8208;swab sampling is presented. First, the MUSAL chip allows ultrafast on&#8208;chip sample preparation with &#8776;500&#8208;fold preconcentration at a rate of 1.2&#160;mL min&#8722;1. Second, the chip enables contamination&#8208;free amplification using autonomous target elution into on&#8208;chip reagents by photothermal activation. Finally, the chip accomplishes multiplexed on&#8208;chip diagnostics of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The rapid, ultrasensitive, cost&#8208;effective sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip with a multiplex capability will allow timely management of various pandemics situations that may be faced shortly.

         <title>A Super Tough, Rapidly Biodegradable, Ultrafast Hemostatic Bioglue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bioglue is composed of amidated&#8208;gelatin and Tetra&#8208;PEG&#8208;SS for rapid hemostasis in massive hemorrhage. The amino terminals in gelatin quickly react with active ester moieties in the PEG&#8208;SS, endowing the amino&#8208;gelatin&#8208;PEG glue firm and indiscriminate adhesion with various moist tissues (e.g., adhesively sealing cardiac hemorrhagic wounds). The bioglue provides a fascinating hemostatic approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.








Abstract
Death happening due to massive hemorrhage has been involved in military conflicts, traffic accidents, and surgical injuries of various human disasters. Achieving rapid and effective hemostasis to save lives is crucial in urgent massive bleeding situations. Herein, a covalent cross&#8208;linked AG&#8208;PEG glue based on extracellular matrix&#8208;like amino&#8208;gelatin (AG) and PEG derivatives is developed. The AG&#8208;PEG glue gelatinizes fast and exhibits firm and indiscriminate close adhesion with various moist tissues upon being dosed. The formed glue establishes an adhesive and robust barrier to seal the arterial, hepatic, and cardiac hemorrhagic wounds, enabling it to withstand up to 380&#160;mmHg blood pressure in comparison with normal systolic blood pressure of 60&#8211;180&#160;mmHg. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a pig cardiac penetrating hole with 6&#160;mm diameter is effectively stopped using the glue within 60&#160;s. Postoperative indexes of the treated pig gradually recover and the cardiac wounds regrow significantly at 14&#160;days. Possessing on&#8208;demand solubility, self&#8208;gelling, and rapid degradability, the AG&#8208;PEG glue may provide a fascinating stop&#8208;bleeding approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.

&lt;p&gt;A new bioglue is composed of amidated-gelatin and Tetra-PEG-SS for rapid hemostasis in massive hemorrhage. The amino terminals in gelatin quickly react with active ester moieties in the PEG-SS, endowing the amino-gelatin-PEG glue firm and indiscriminate adhesion with various moist tissues (e.g., adhesively sealing cardiac hemorrhagic wounds). The bioglue provides a fascinating hemostatic approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Death happening due to massive hemorrhage has been involved in military conflicts, traffic accidents, and surgical injuries of various human disasters. Achieving rapid and effective hemostasis to save lives is crucial in urgent massive bleeding situations. Herein, a covalent cross-linked AG-PEG glue based on extracellular matrix-like amino-gelatin (AG) and PEG derivatives is developed. The AG-PEG glue gelatinizes fast and exhibits firm and indiscriminate close adhesion with various moist tissues upon being dosed. The formed glue establishes an adhesive and robust barrier to seal the arterial, hepatic, and cardiac hemorrhagic wounds, enabling it to withstand up to 380&#160;mmHg blood pressure in comparison with normal systolic blood pressure of 60&#8211;180&#160;mmHg. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a pig cardiac penetrating hole with 6&#160;mm diameter is effectively stopped using the glue within 60&#160;s. Postoperative indexes of the treated pig gradually recover and the cardiac wounds regrow significantly at 14&#160;days. Possessing on-demand solubility, self-gelling, and rapid degradability, the AG-PEG glue may provide a fascinating stop-bleeding approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Terahertz Nonlinear Hall Rectifiers Based on Spin&#8208;Polarized Topological Electronic States in&#160;1T&#8208;CoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second&#8208;order nonlinear Hall effect response for high&#8208;efficiency terahertz rectification, is observed in the spin&#8208;polarized 1T&#8208;CoTe2, led by the zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#160;extrinsic contribution of topological electronic states. The Hall&#8208;rectifier, without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, shows up room&#8208;temperature responsivity of over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2, opening up device implementation based on quantum&#8208;wavefunction engineering.








Abstract
The zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) refers to the second&#8208;order transverse current induced by an applied alternating electric field; it indicates the topological properties of inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking crystals. Despite several studies on the NLHE induced by the Berry&#8208;curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals, the direct current conversion by rectification is limited to very low driving frequencies and cryogenic temperatures. The nonlinear photoresponse generated by the NLHE at room temperature can be useful for numerous applications in communication, sensing, and photodetection across a high bandwidth. In this study, observations of the second&#8208;order NLHE in type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal CoTe2 under time&#8208;reversal symmetry are reported. This is determined by the disorder&#8208;induced extrinsic contribution on the broken&#8208;inversion&#8208;symmetry surface and room&#8208;temperature terahertz rectification without the need for semiconductor junctions or bias voltage. It is shown that remarkable photoresponsivity over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, a response time of approximately 710&#160;ns, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 can be achieved at room temperature. The results open a new pathway for low&#8208;energy photon harvesting via nonlinear rectification induced by the NLHE in strongly spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled and inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking systems, promising a considerable impact in the field of infrared/terahertz photonics.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Ionizable Iron Nanoadjuvant Augments STING Activation for Personalized Vaccination Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) is developed to potentiate cancer vaccination immunotherapy. PEIM nanoadjuvant is coassembled from acid&#8208;ionizable&#160;copolymers with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist. PEIM nanoadjuvant effectively delivers tumor antigens to lymph nodes, amplifies STING activation and type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production, and ultimately&#160;elicits antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell response to inhibit tumor growth.








Abstract
The critical challenge for cancer vaccine&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell immunity is the sustained activation of antigen cross&#8208;presentation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, it is first discovered that the clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), markedly augment the type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production profile of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist MSA&#8208;2 and achieve a 16&#8208;fold dosage&#8208;sparing effect in the human STING haplotype. Acid&#8208;ionizable copolymers are coassembled with IONPs and MSA&#8208;2 into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen cross&#8208;presentation to elicit a 55&#8208;fold greater frequency of antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Monoliths of Steel with Self&#8208;Reinforcing Adaptive Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous steel structures combining ultralow weight and high mechanical efficiency are manufactured by printing, reducing, and sintering wet foams containing iron oxide precursor particles. By forming new load&#8208;bearing struts when compressed, the porous structures are able to reversibly stiffen in response to nonuniform stresses, a behavior that conceptually resembles the unique adaptive properties of human bone.








Abstract
Porous structures offer an attractive approach to reduce the amount of natural resources used while maintaining relatively high mechanical efficiency. However, for some applications the drop in mechanical properties resulting from the introduction of porosity is too high, which has limited the broader utilization of porous materials in industry. Here, it is shown that steel monoliths can be designed to display high mechanical efficiency and reversible self&#8208;reinforcing properties when made with porous architectures with up to three hierarchical levels. Ultralight steel structures that can float on water and autonomously adapt their stiffness are manufactured by the thermal reduction and sintering of 3D printed foam templates. Using distinct mechanical testing techniques, image analysis, and finite element simulations, the mechanisms leading to the high mechanical efficiency and self&#8208;stiffening ability of the hierarchical porous monoliths are studied. The design and fabrication of mechanically stable porous monoliths using iron as a widely available natural resource is expected to contribute to the future development of functional materials with a more sustainable footprint.

         <title>A Flexible, High&#8208;Voltage (&gt;100&#160;V) Generating Device Based on Zebra&#8208;Like Asymmetrical Photovoltaic Cascade</title>

         <dc:description>
Gold/aluminum micro&#8208;strips repeat along a specific direction and periodically form overlaps and gaps in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner like the patterns of a zebra. After compounding with semiconducting supramolecular nanowires, an output voltage of 140&#160;V can be achieved on a flexible substrate upon illumination.








Abstract
The mutual conversion between light and electricity lies at the heart of optoelectronic and photonic applications. Maximization of the photoelectric conversion is a long&#8208;term goal that can be pursued via the fabrication of devices with ad&#8208;hoc architectures. In this framework, it is of utter importance to harvest and transform light irradiation into high electric potential in&#160;specific area for driving functional dielectrics that respond to pure electric field. Here, a nano&#8208;fabrication technology has been devised featuring double self&#8208;alignment that is applied to construct zebra&#8208;like asymmetric heterojunction arrays. Such nanostructured composite, which covers a surface area of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;mm2 and contains 500 periodic repeating units, is capable of photo generating voltages as high as 140&#160;V on a flexible substrate. This approach represents a leap over the traditional functionalization process based on simply embedding materials into devices by demonstrating the disruptive potential of integrating oriented nanoscale device components into meta&#8208;material.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Promoted Co&#8208;Production of Dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2 over Defective Zn3In2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional and defective Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst is developed for the simultaneous efficient photocatalytic co&#8208;syntheses of dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2, which shows the highest rate for both reactions up to date.








Abstract
One of the most sustainable and promising approaches for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in a low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly way is photosynthesis, which, however, suffers from poor carrier utilization and low H2O2 productivity. The addition of proton donors such as isopropanol or ethanol can increase H2O2 production, which, unfortunately, will inevitably elevate the entire cost while wasting the oxidizing power of holes (h+). Herein, the tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) is employed as a distinctive proton donor for the thermodynamically feasible and selective semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction to highly valuable dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs), and meanwhile, to couple with and promote H2O2 generation in one photoredox reaction under the photocatalysis by dual&#8208;functional Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst. Surprisingly, the suitably defective Zn3In2S6 offers an excellent and near&#8208;stoichiometric co&#8208;production performance of H2O2 and DHIQs at unprecedentedly high rates of 66.4 and 62.1&#160;mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 under visible light (&#955;&#160;&#8805; 400&#160;nm), respectively, which outperforms all the previously available reports even though sacrificial agents&#160;were&#160;employed in those reports. Additionally, photocatalytic redox reaction mechanism demonstrates that H2O2 can be generated through multiple pathways, highlighting the synergistic effect among ROS (&#183;O2&#8208; and 1O2), h+ and proton donor, which has been ignored in previous studies.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Wavelength Light&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network&#8208;Based Microrobots for Reactive Species Scavenging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a hollow metal&#8211;phenolic network&#8208;based microrobot with spray&#8208;coated asymmetric capping is reported capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared irradiation and ultraviolet irradiation without fuel. With multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsiveness, tunable size of the particles, and great reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging capacity, the proposed microrobots can be ideal for future in vivo analytical sensing and medical treatment.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven microrobots with different propulsion mechanisms have attracted great attention in microrobot synthesis and applications. However, current systems rely heavily on precious metals, using a complex synthesis process and limited working wavelength. It is therefore of great interest to fabricate microrobots that can be driven by multi&#8208;wavelength irradiation and with simple components. Here, metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;based microrobots are synthesized using a sacrificial polystyrene bead template and an extra capping is added to regulate their symmetry. The hollow MPN microrobots with different layers of capping are capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, without fuel. The velocity of the microrobots under irradiation is altered by the thickness of the asymmetric capping and their motion could be manipulated remotely by switching the NIR or UV irradiation on and off. With light&#8208;driven mobility, the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) scavenging activity of the microrobots is significantly increased. Therefore, this proposed microrobot system provides a synthesis strategy to develop asymmetric light&#8208;navigated microrobots for future medical treatment with tunable structure, multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsive mobility, and great RONS scavenging capacity.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Electrocatalysts Enable Efficient CO&#8208;to&#8208;Acetate Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating a coordination polymer catalyst consisting of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50%, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Upgrading carbon dioxide/monoxide to multi&#8208;carbon C2+ products using renewable electricity offers one route to more sustainable fuel and chemical production. One of the most appealing products is acetate, the profitable electrosynthesis of which demands a catalyst with higher efficiency. Here, a coordination polymer (CP) catalyst is reported that consists of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds, which enables selective reduction of CO to acetate with a 61% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.59 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cells. The catalyst is integrated in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly that enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate (3.3 molar) from the cathodic liquid stream, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50% toward CO&#8208;to&#8208;acetate conversion, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at a current density of 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Intracellular Glucose&#8208;Depriving Polymer Micelles for Antiglycolytic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glucose&#8208;responsive polymer is designed, considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells. The polymer exhibits micellar&#8208;structure stability during blood circulation and accumulates in tumor tissues. Specific binding between the polymer and intracellular glucose induces glucose deprivation in tumor cells. Glucose metabolism is particularly inhibited; the lack of energy in tumor cells is intensified, leading to tumor suppression.








Abstract
A new anticancer strategy to exploit abnormal metabolism of cancer cells rather than to merely control the drug release or rearrange the tumor microenvironment is reported. An antiglycolytic amphiphilic polymer, designed considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells (Warburg effect) and aimed at the regulation of glucose metabolism, is synthesized through chemical conjugation between glycol chitosan (GC) and phenylboronic acid (PBA). GC&#8208;PBA derivatives form stable micellar structures under physiological conditions and respond to changes in glucose concentration. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor site, intracellular glucose capture occurs, and the resultant energy deprivation through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis remarkably suppresses tumor growth without significant side effects in vivo. This strategy highlights the need to develop safe and effective cancer treatment without the use of conventional anticancer drugs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanocrystalline Structures from Freestanding Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scientific exploration of nanomaterials has led to massive growth in understanding and applications of quantum materials at the nanoscale. A route for fabrication of nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality utilizing self&#8208;assembly of freestanding membranes transferred on appropriate substrates is presented. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry after self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
The exploration of crystalline nanostructures enhances the understanding of quantum phenomena occurring in spatially confined quantum matter and may lead to functional materials with unforeseen applications. A novel route to fabricating nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality is presented. This is achieved by utilizing a self&#8208;assembly process of ultrathin membranes composed of the desired oxide. The thermally induced self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystalline structures is driven by dewetting the oxide membranes once they are lifted off and transferred onto sapphire surfaces. In three successive steps, the process provides nanovoids, nanowires, and nanocrystals. Regardless of substrate orientation, the nanostructures are highly anisotropic in shape due to material retraction favoring low&#8208;index crystalline lattice directions of the membranes. The orientation of the nanostructures is provided precisely by the crystal lattice of the transferred membrane. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry, both maintained all the way down to the well&#8208;developed crystalline facets. The demonstrated self&#8208;assembly process holds the potential to improve the understanding of surface diffusion phenomena at the interface of materials, which is important for advancing epitaxial growth technology and paves the way to fabricating crystalline nanostructures by the transfer and self&#8208;assembly of membranes.

         <title>HACS: Helical Auxetic Yarn Capacitive Strain Sensors with Sensitivity Beyond the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capacitive strain sensors are theoretically limited in their sensitivity. In this work, stretchable and flexible strain sensors are fabricated using a helical auxetic yarn structure providing access to auxetic character in the fiber form. The helical auxetic capacitive sensors (HACS) are able to access sensitivity beyond the theoretical limit, determined to be because of an engulfment phenomenon that occurs as a result of the materials employed and the auxetic character.








Abstract
The development of flexible strain sensors over the past decade has focused on accessing high strain percentages and high sensitivity (i.e., gauge factors). Strain sensors that employ capacitance as the electrical signal to correlate to strain are typically restricted in sensitivity because of the Poisson effect. By employing auxetic structures, the limits of sensitivity for capacitive sensors have been exceeded, which has improved the competitiveness of this modality of sensing. In this work, the first employment of helical auxetic yarns as capacitive sensors is presented. It is found that the response of the helical auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (termed as HACS) is dependent on the two main fabrication variables&#8212;the ratio of diameters and the helical wrapping length. Depending on these variables, sensors that respond to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitance values can be obtained. A greater auxetic character results in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains&#8212;a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far is obtained. A mechanism of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally is proposed.

         <title>Fully Optical in Operando Investigation of Ambient Condition Electrical Switching in MoS2 Nanodevices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin MoS2 electrical switches are characterized for the first time in operando and in ambient conditions through a non&#8208;invasive spectroscopy&#8208;based method. The study sheds light on the &#8211; controversial and still debated &#8211; dynamics driving the switching mechanism. It reveals volatile metallic filaments percolating interatomic spacing in MoS2 and stresses the impact of transfer residues on the electrical performance of switches.








Abstract
MoS2 nanoswitches have shown superb ultralow switching energies without excessive leakage currents. However, the debate about the origin and volatility of electrical switching is unresolved due to the lack of adequate nanoimaging of devices in operando. Here, three optical techniques are combined to perform the first noninvasive in situ characterization of nanosized MoS2 devices. This study reveals volatile threshold resistive switching due to the intercalation of metallic atoms from electrodes directly between Mo and S atoms, without the assistance of sulfur vacancies. A &#8220;semi&#8208;memristive&#8221; effect driven by an organic adlayer adjacent to MoS2 is observed, which suggests that nonvolatility can be achieved by careful interface engineering. These findings provide a crucial understanding of nanoprocess in vertically biased MoS2 nanosheets, which opens new routes to conscious engineering and optimization of 2D electronics.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Reconstruction of Conductive Filaments in HfOx&#8208;Based Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive filaments (CFs) with different morphologies after forming, set, and reset operations are clearly revealed in HfOx&#8208;based memristors by the 3D reconstruction of c&#8208;AFM technique. Multiple conductive filaments are successfully observed in the devices with three different resistive states. The rupture location of CFs after reset is also observed clearly.








Abstract
HfOx&#8208;based memristor has been studied extensively as one of the most promising memories for the excellent nonvolatile data storage and computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory capabilities. However, the resistive switching mechanism, relying on the formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs) during device operations, is still under debate. In this work, the CFs with different morphologies after different operations&#8212;forming, set, and reset&#8212;are clearly revealed for the first time by 3D reconstruction of conductive atomic force microscopy (c&#8208;AFM) images. Intriguingly, multiple CFs are successfully observed in HfOx&#8208;based memristor devices with three different resistive states. CFs after forming, set, and reset exhibit the typical morphologies of hourglass, inverted&#8208;cone, and short&#8208;cone, respectively. The rupture location of CFs after the reset operation is also observed clearly. These findings reveal the microscopic behaviors underlying the resistive switching, which could pave the road to design and optimize oxide&#8208;based memristors for both memory and computing applications.

         <title>Dissolvable Self&#8208;Locking Microneedle Patches Integrated with Immunomodulators for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking dissolvable microneedle is presented as a mass&#8208;producible and cost&#8208;effective transdermal drug delivery platform for precise microdose delivery of drugs in a minimally invasive manner. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a novel combination immunotherapy approach proposed to improve melanoma treatment efficacy shows a significantly higher efficacy when delivered via self&#8208;locking microneedles than intratumoral injection.








Abstract
Advancements in micro&#8208;resolution 3D printers have significantly facilitated the development of highly complex mass&#8208;producible drug delivery platforms. Conventionally, due to the limitations of micro&#8208;milling machineries, dissolvable microneedles (MNs) are mainly fabricated in cone&#8208;shaped geometry with limited drug delivery accuracy. Herein, to overcome the limitations of conventional MNs, a novel projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking MN for precise skin insertion, adhesion, and transcutaneous microdose drug delivery is presented. The geometry of self&#8208;locking MN consists of a sharp skin&#8208;penetrating tip, a wide skin interlocking body, and a narrow base with mechanical supports fabricated over a flexible hydrocolloid patch to improve the accuracy of skin penetration into irregular surfaces. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is selected as the model for the investigation of self&#8208;locking MNs due to its irregular and uneven surface. In vivo immunotherapy efficacy is evaluated by integrating SD&#8208;208, a novel transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor that suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of tumors, and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor that induces T cell&#8208;mediated tumor cell death, into self&#8208;locking MNs and comparing them with intratumoral injection. Evaluation of (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab)/SD&#8208;208 delivery effectiveness in B16F10 melanoma&#8208;bearing mice model confirms significantly improved dose efficacy of self&#8208;locking MNs compared with intratumoral injection.

In vivo immunotherapy efficacy is evaluated by integrating SD-208, a novel transforming growth factor-&#946; (TGF-&#946;) inhibitor that suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of tumors, and anti-PD-L1 (&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;PD-L1 Ab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor that induces T cell-mediated tumor cell death, into self-locking MNs and comparing them with intratumoral injection. Evaluation of (&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;PD-L1 Ab)/SD-208 delivery effectiveness in B16F10 melanoma-bearing mice model confirms significantly improved dose efficacy of self-locking MNs compared with intratumoral injection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Holographically Activatable Nanoprobe via Glutathione/Albumin&#8208;Mediated Exponential Signal Amplification for High&#8208;Contrast Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is reported for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging, which is accomplished through both glutathione/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues.








Abstract
Glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable probes hold great promise for in vivo cancer imaging, but are restricted by their dependence on non&#8208;selective intracellular GSH enrichment and uncontrollable background noise. Here, a holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is shown for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through cooperative GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues. Once targeting tumors, the endocytosed nanoprobe effectively senses the lysosomal microenvironment to undergo instantaneous decomposition into Mn2+ with threshold GSH concentration of &#8776; 0.12&#160;mm for brightening MRI signals, thus achieving high contrast tumor imaging and flexible monitoring of GSH&#8208;relevant cisplatin resistance during chemotherapy. Upon efficient up&#8208;regulation of extracellular GSH in&#160;tumor via exogenous injection, the relaxivity&#8208;silent interstitial nanoprobe remarkably evolves into Mn2+ that are further captured/retained and re&#8208;activated into ultrahigh&#8208;relaxivity&#8208;capable complex by stromal albumin in the tumor, and simultaneously allows the renal clearance of off&#8208;targeted nanoprobe in the form of Mn2+ via lymphatic vessels for suppressing background noise to distinguish tiny liver metastasis. These findings demonstrate the concept of holographic tumor activation via both tumor GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification and simultaneous background suppression for precise tumor malignancy detection, surveillance, and surgical guidance.

         <title>Cooperative Electronic Structure Modulator of Fe Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for High Energy and Long Cycle Li&#8211;S Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of electron exchangeable binding sites comprising thiophene S and oxidized S, adjacent to Fe single atom electrocatalysts, improves Li2S redox kinetics by modulating d&#8208;orbital level of Fe single atom via electron exchange. These specially designed electrocatalysts enable realization of a 1 A h level Li&#8211;S pouch cell with high gravimetric energy density and long cycle stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy and long cycle lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) pouch cells are limited by the insufficient capacities and stabilities of their cathodes under practical electrolyte/sulfur (E/S), electrolyte/capacity (E/C), and negative/positive (N/P) ratios. Herein, an advanced cathode comprising highly active Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is reported to form 320.2&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 multistacked Li&#8211;S pouch cells with total capacity of &#8776;1 A h level, satisfying low E/S (3.0), E/C (2.8), and N/P (2.3) ratios and high sulfur loadings (8.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). The high&#8208;activity Fe SAC is designed by manipulating its local environments using electron&#8208;exchangeable binding (EEB) sites. Introducing EEB sites comprising two different types of S species, namely, thiophene&#8208;like&#8208;S (&#8211;S) and oxidized&#8208;S (&#8211;SO2), adjacent to Fe SACs promotes the kinetics of the Li2S redox reaction by providing additional binding sites and modulating the Fe d&#8208;orbital levels via electron exchange with Fe. The &#8211;S donates the electrons to the Fe SACs, whereas &#8211;SO2 withdraws electrons from the Fe SACs. Thus, the Fe d&#8208;orbital energy level can be modulated by the different &#8211;SO2/&#8211;S ratios of the EEB site, controlling the electron donating/withdrawing characteristics. This desirable electrocatalysis is maximized by the intimate contact of the Fe SACs with the S species, which are confined together in porous carbon.

         <title>Modular Approach to Creating Functionalized Surface Arrays of Molecular Qubits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to create 2D arrays of molecular spin qubits is reported. The quantum properties are retained and the quantum coherence times are improved compared to bulk conditions.








Abstract
The quest for developing quantum technologies is driven by the promise of exponentially faster computations, ultrahigh performance sensing, and achieving thorough understanding of many&#8208;particle quantum systems. Molecular spins are excellent qubit candidates because they feature long coherence times, are widely tunable through chemical synthesis, and can be interfaced with other quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits. A present challenge for molecular spin qubits is their integration in quantum devices, which requires arranging them in thin films or monolayers on surfaces. However, clear proof of the survival of quantum properties of molecular qubits on surfaces has not been reported so far. Furthermore, little is known about the change in spin dynamics of molecular qubits going from the bulk to monolayers. Here, a versatile bottom&#8208;up method is reported to arrange molecular qubits as functional groups of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on surfaces, combining molecular self&#8208;organization and click chemistry. Coherence times of up to 13 &#181;s demonstrate that qubit properties are maintained or even enhanced in the monolayer.

         <title>Solvation and Interfacial Engineering Enable &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C Operation of Graphite/NCM Batteries at Energy Density over 270 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic barriers related to Li+ transport at low temperatures is knocked down by formulating a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte containing Na+ as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, where a Li&#8208;Na hybrid SEI is identified to favor Li+ migration through the multiple LiF/NaF grain boundaries. As such, the electrolyte affords a 2 Ah, 270&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM523 pouch cell with discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) that can operate under low temperature (LT) conditions are essential for applications in orbital missions, subsea areas, and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, severe capacity loss is witnessed due to tremendous kinetic barriers that emerge at LT. Herein, to surmount such kinetic limitations, a low dielectric environment is tamed throughout the bulk electrolyte, which efficaciously brought the Li+ desolvation energy down to 30.76 kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. At the meantime, the adoption of sodium cations (Na+) is proposed as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, and a Li&#8208;Na hybrid and fluoride&#8208;rich interphase is further identified via preferential reduction of Na+&#8208;(solvent/anion) clusters, which is found to efficiently facilitate Li+ migration through the LiF/NaF grain boundaries. Based on a N/P ratio of 1.1, the graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) full cell (cathode loading of &#8776;18.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) delivers a capacity as high as 125.1 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C with prolonged cycling to 100 cycles. Finally, a 270&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM pouch cell is assembled, which affords a discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C during the initial cycles. With an eye to both fundamental and practical aspects, this work will propel additional advancements and allow LIBs to fill more roles under extreme operation temperatures than ever before.

Based on a N/P ratio of 1.1, the graphite/LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM) full cell (cathode loading of &#8776;18.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) delivers a capacity as high as 125.1 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C with prolonged cycling to 100 cycles. Finally, a 270&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; graphite/NCM pouch cell is assembled, which affords a discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C during the initial cycles. With an eye to both fundamental and practical aspects, this work will propel additional advancements and allow LIBs to fill more roles under extreme operation temperatures than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Reaction Heterogeneity During Calcination of Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature calcination used for Li&#8208;ion battery particle synthesis is chemically imaged. Various parallel and serial combinations of heterogeneous reactions, such as the thermal aerobic/anaerobic decomposition, Li2CO3 decomposition, Li2&#8208;O insertion/diffusion, and O2 insertion/diffusion, prevail during the calcination reaction. The anaerobic decomposition of the precursor core slows down Li2&#8208;O incorporation.








Abstract
During solid&#8208;state calcination, with increasing temperature, materials undergo complex phase transitions with heterogeneous solid&#8208;state reactions and mass transport. Precise control of the calcination chemistry is therefore crucial for synthesizing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides (LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2, NRNCM) as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Although the battery performance depends on the chemical heterogeneity during NRNCM calcination, it has not yet been elucidated. Herein, through synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray, mass spectrometry microscopy, and structural analyses, it is revealed that the temperature&#8208;dependent reaction kinetics, the diffusivity of solid&#8208;state lithium sources, and the ambient oxygen control the local chemical compositions of the reaction intermediates within a calcined particle. Additionally, it is found that the variations in the reducing power of the transition metals (i.e., Ni, Co, and Mn) determine the local structures at the nanoscale. The investigation of the reaction mechanism via imaging analysis provides valuable information for tuning the calcination chemistry and developing high&#8208;energy/power density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>In Situ Absorption Characterization Guided Slot&#8208;Die&#8208;Coated High&#8208;Performance Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ absorption measurement is used to investigate the aggregation behavior of acceptors during slot&#8208;die&#8208;coating. The 1 cm2 flexible device can reach a power conversion efficiency of 13.70%, with excellent shelf stability and upscaling ability. The connected modules (180 cm2) can effectively power a smartphone, showing great potential for future applications.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large&#8208;area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin&#8208;coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx&#8208;1 and Qx&#8208;2, show quite different film&#8208;formation kinetics in the slot&#8208;die coating process. In situ absorption spectroscopy indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx&#8208;2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx&#8208;1&#8208;based 1&#160;cm2 flexible device exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx&#8208;2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%. Moreover, the 30 cm2 modules based on PM6:Qx&#8208;1, containing six 5 cm2 sub&#8208;cells, exhibit a PCE of 12.20%. After being stored in a glove box for over 6000&#160;h, the PCE remains at 103% of its initial values, indicating excellent shelf stability. Therefore, these results show a promising future strategy for the upscaling fabrication of flexible large&#8208;area OSCs.

         <title>Over 19% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Regulating Multidimensional Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular interactions are ubiquitous and elusive in organic solar cells. Herein, the complicated relationship between multidimensional intermolecular interactions in active layers and photovoltaic performance is disclosed. The results show that complex interactions are critical to synergistically regulating comprehensive properties, including molecular assembly, stacking orientations, charge transport, and morphology management, which helps to achieve an efficiency over 19% in ternary devices.








Abstract
Research on organic solar cells (OSCs) has progressed through material innovation and device engineering. However, well&#8208;known and ubiquitous intermolecular interactions, and particularly their synergistic effects, have received little attention. Herein, the complicated relationship between photovoltaic conversion and multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the active layers is investigated. These interactions are dually regulated by side&#8208;chain isomerization and end&#8208;cap engineering of the acceptors. The phenylalkyl featured acceptors (LA&#8208;series) exhibit stronger crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on interactions relative to the alkylphenyl attached isomers (ITIC&#8208;series). In addition, the PM6&#160;and LA&#8208;series acceptors exhibit moderate donor/acceptor interactions compared to those of the strongly interacting PM6/ITIC&#8208;series pairs, which helps to enhance phase separation and charge transport. Consequently, the output efficiencies of all LA series acceptors are over 14%. Moreover, LA&#8208;series acceptors show appropriate compatibility, host/guest interactions, and crystallinity relationships with BTP&#8208;eC9, thereby leading to uniform and well&#8208;organized &#8220;alloy&#8208;like&#8221; mixed phases. In particular, the highly crystalline LA23&#160;further optimizes multiple interactions and ternary microstructures, which results in a high efficiency of 19.12%. Thus, these results highlight the importance of multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

Capacitive Strain Sensors
In article number 2209321, Tyler J. Cuthbert, Carlo Menon, and co&#8208;workers present a novel capacitive strain sensor that accesses sensitivity beyond the theoretical limit. The helical auxetic capacitive sensor (HACS) employs a two&#8208;component yarn structure allowing tuneable sensitivity and accessible strain ranges. The HACS sensitivity is found to be from an engulfment phenomenon, which is predicted with a geometric model and analyzed by X&#8208;ray &#956;CT scanning.

Nonlinear Hall Effect
As the heart and with the tremendous applications of terahertz technology, photodetectors suffer from considerable drawbacks imposed by weak optical absorption, and inefficient charge&#8208;separation mechanisms. In article number 2209557, Antonio Politano, Lin Wang, and co&#8208;workers report the nonlinear Hall effect operating at terahertz frequencies within strong spin&#8208;polarized topological states in CoTe2 without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, opening up fascinating route toward quantum wavefunction engineering.

Cathode Calcination
In article number 2207076, Sugeun Jo, Keeyoung Jung, Jongwoo Lim, and co&#8208;workers show how solid&#8208;state reaction heterogeneity affects the high&#8208;temperature calcination of Li&#8208;ion battery particles. Various parallel and serial combinations of the thermal (an)aerobic decomposition and Li2&#8211;O insertion/diffusion are chemically imaged during the calcination reaction. The cover image features the calcination intermediates that facilitate the surface Li2&#8211;O incorporation, which is impeded by the anaerobically decomposed phase in the particle core.

Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and fiber complement each other for making remarkble progress in smart flexible materials. This article provides a comprehensive and fundamental overview of the basic concepts, structure&#8208;function relationship, seminal and recent studies, and the potential directions for future developments regarding AIEgen&#8208;based fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have recently been developed at a tremendous pace in the area of organic luminescent materials by virtue of their superior properties. However, the practical applications of AIEgens still face the challenge of transforming AIEgens from molecules into materials. Till now, many AIEgens have been integrated into fiber, endowing the fiber with prominent fluorescence and/or photosensitizing capacities. AIEgens and fiber complement each other for making progress in flexible smart materials, in which the utilization of AIEgens creates new application possibilities for fiber, and the fiber provides an excellent carrier for AIEgens towards realizing the conversion from molecule to materials and an ideal platform to research the aggregate state of AIEgens in mesoscale and macroscale. This review begins with a brief summary of the recent advances related to some typical AIEgens with various functions and the technology for the fabrication of AIEgen&#8208;functionalized fiber. The most representative applications are then highlighted by focusing on energy conversion, personal protective equipment, biomedical, sensor, and fluorescence&#8208;related fields. Finally, the challenges, opportunities, and tendencies in future development are discussed in detail. This review hopes to inspire innovation in AIEgens and fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.

         <title>Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers: From Light&#8208;Controlled Small Molecules to Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over supramolecular interactions is an important part of the toolbox for developing functional materials. The design of supramolecular polymers with light&#8208;triggered molecules allows remote control of supramolecular polymers and materials with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, a perspective review of various approaches and major advances toward photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with controlled functions is presented.








Abstract
Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers are well&#8208;organized assemblies based on highly oriented and reversible noncovalent interactions containing photosensitive molecules as (co&#8208;)monomers. They have attracted increasing interest in smart materials and dynamic systems with precisely controllable functions, such as light&#8208;driven soft actuators, photoresponsive fluorescent anticounterfeiting and light&#8208;triggered electronic devices. The present review discusses light&#8208;activated molecules used in photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with their main photo&#8208;induced changes, e.g., geometry, dipole moment, and chirality. Based on these distinct changes, supramolecular polymers formed by light&#8208;activated molecules exhibit photoresponsive disassembly and reassembly. As a consequence, photo&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization, &#8220;depolymerization,&#8221; and regulation of the lengths and topologies are observed. Moreover, the light&#8208;controlled functions of supramolecular polymers, such as actuation, emission, and chirality transfer along length scales, are highlighted. Furthermore, a perspective on challenges and future opportunities is presented. Besides the challenge of moving from harmful UV light to visible/near IR light avoiding fatigue, and enabling biomedical applications, future opportunities include light&#8208;controlled supramolecular actuators with helical motion, light&#8208;modulated information transmission, optically recyclable materials, and multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular systems.

         <title>Unraveling the Plasma Protein Corona by Ultrasonic Cavitation Augments Active&#8208;Transporting of Liposome in Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transcytosis&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly and protein&#8208;corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size&#8208;transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.








Abstract
Ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis&#8208;targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer&#8208;targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient&#8208;derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis&#8208;targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Realizing Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Bactericidal Capability through the Phonon&#8211;Electron Coupling Effect Using Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalytic Planar Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D catalytic planar defects have been rationally designed and engineered for reversing the ultrasonic silence of Ti3C2, dramatically realizing the highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal therapy. It is unveiled that the electron's origin, electron transfer, and the visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by ultrasound are attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect.








Abstract
Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such 0D defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. Herein, 2D catalytic planar defects are designed within Ti3C2&#160;sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti3+ species (Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+)) can yield surface&#8208;bound O due to the effective activation of O2, thus resulting in a substantial amount of 1O2&#160;generation and the 99.72%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. It is discovered that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene in electron transfer through the phonon drag effect&#8212;a coupling effect between surface electrons and US&#8208;triggered phonons&#8212;that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O2&#160;activation energy from 1.65&#160;to 0.06&#160;eV. This design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D. Moreover, it is revealed that the electron origin, electron transfer, and visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by US can be attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect. After coating with neutrophil membrane (NM) proteins, the NM&#8208;Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+) sheets further demonstrate a 6&#8208;log10&#160;reduction in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus burden in the infected bony tissue.

After coating with neutrophil membrane (NM) proteins, the NM-Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-SD(Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) sheets further demonstrate a 6-log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;reduction in methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; burden in the infected bony tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Stretchable and Biocompatible Wrinkled Nanoclay&#8208;Composite Hydrogel With Enhanced Sensing Capability for Precise Detection of Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bioinspired nanoclay&#8208;composite wrinkled hydrogel sensor is developed with excellent mechanical and biocompatible properties and high and reliable sensing capacity due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the wrinkle micropattern and nanoclay&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating crosslinked network. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this hydrogel sensor can accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs, showing promise for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological heart tissue.








Abstract
It is challenging to balance high biocompability with good mechanical&#8211;electrical sensing performance, especially when triggering inflammatory stress response after in vivo implantation. Herein, a bioinspired wrinkle&#8208;reinforced adaptive nanoclay&#8208;interlocked soft strain&#8208;sensor based on a highly stretchable and elastic ionic&#8208;conductive hydrogel is reported. This novel nanoclay&#8208;composite hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile properties and high sensing capacity with steady and reliable sensing performance due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the nanoclay crosslinked and nano&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating network. The incorporation of amphiphilic ions provides the hydrogel with significant protein resistance, reducing its non&#8208;specific adsorption to proteins upon implantation, improving its biosafety as an implanted device, and maintaining the authenticity of the sensing results. Based on the revealed sensing enhanced mechanism based on hierarchical ordered structures as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, this hydrogel sensor is demonstrated to be able to&#160;accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs and may become a novel strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological changes in heart disease.

         <title>Synergistic Surface Modification of Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic surface modification of mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films by the combination of piperazine and C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid realizes narrow&#8208;bandgap solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 22.7% and substantially elongated stability.








Abstract
Interfaces in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics play a pivotal role in determining device efficiency and longevity. In this work, the top surface treatment of mixed tin&#8211;lead (&#8776;1.26&#160;eV) halide perovskite films for p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells is studied. Charge extraction is promoted by treating the perovskite surface with piperazine. This compound reacts with the organic cations at the perovskite surface, modifying the surface structure and tuning the interfacial energy level alignment. In addition, the combined treatment with C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid (CPTA) reduces hysteresis and leads to efficiencies up to 22.7%, with open&#8208;circuit voltage values reaching 0.90&#160;V, &#8776;92% of the radiative limit for the bandgap of this material. The modified cells also show superior stability, with unencapsulated cells retaining 96% of their initial efficiency after &gt;2000 h of storage in N2 and encapsulated cells retaining 90% efficiency after &gt;450 h of storage in air. Intriguingly, CPTA preferentially binds to Sn2+ sites at film surface over Pb2+ due to the energetically favored exposure of the former, according to first&#8208;principles calculations. This work provides new insights into the surface chemistry of perovskite films in terms of their structural, electronic, and defect characteristics and this knowledge is used to fabricate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmion Transistor Gated with Voltage&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor is presented using spatially uniform voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic anisotropy. A gate operation can control the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion. Utilizing the gate&#8208;controlled skyrmion motion technique, the authors expect various skyrmion logic devices to be demonstrated in the future.








Abstract
The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally, is introduced. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area can be maintained. The findings will open a new route toward the design and realization of skyrmion&#8208;based spintronic devices in the near future.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells Enabled by Optimized Fibril Network Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation morphology featuring more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance can be attained. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.2% (certified value of 17.7%) with excellent mechanical properties in all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells is demonstrated.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF with a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) is introduced to enable highly efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high&#8208;Mw PBDB&#8208;TF as a third component into the PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all&#8208;polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

A 2D dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface featured by switchable wettability is proposed to achieve the multi&#8208;path parallel directional transportation of both water droplets and subaqueous bubbles. This programmable, easy&#8208;fabricable, highly&#8208;efficient, and cost&#8208;effective fluidic system with strong robustness against structural defects is ready for versatile fluid transportation supporting both liquid&#8208; and gas&#8208;phase matters.








Abstract
Conventional engineered surfaces for fluid manipulation are hindered by the set wettability, and thus they can only achieve spontaneous transport of single&#8208;phase fluid, namely liquid or gas. Moreover, fluid transport systems that are robust to path defects have yet to be fully explored. Here, unprecedentedly, a universal wettability switching strategy is developed for achieving programmable directional transport of both droplets and subaqueous bubbles on a dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface (DPFS), featuring in strong robustness, high efficiency, and effective cost. By tuning the superwettability of DPFS through octadecyltrichlorosilane treatment and ultraviolet&#8208;C selective irradiation, the transport fluid can alternate between liquid and gas. The material's switchable superwettability regulates the fluid directed dynamics within the confined pattern, in which the sustaining fluid propelling relies on the surface energy difference between the starting and terminal sites. This enables the construction of multiple channels, which works synergistically with ultralow&#8208;volume&#8208;loss transport to impart the fluidic system with strong robustness against path defects. Underlying the completion of complex microfluidics tasks, spatially&#8208;selective cooling devices and subaqueous gas microreactors are successfully demonstrated. This energy&#8208;consumption&#8208;free fluid transport system opens a new avenue for on&#8208;chip programmable fluid manipulation, promoting innovative applications requiring rational control of two&#8208;phase fluid transport.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic antimony bromide hybrid containing semiconducting organic cation is developed for the first time, with which electrically driven red light emitting diodes (LEDs) are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2 cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) are routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide bandgap organic cations. Here, the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;), is reported. By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation is developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small clusters in the early growth steps of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors (denoted as preMOFs) with good processibility. Then, the removal of solvents and modulators will trigger the crosslinking of preMOFs and lead to the formation of continuous MOF films.








Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, it is difficult to grow most MOFs spontaneously or process them into films. Here, a convenient strategy is demonstrated for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

         <title>Microscale Combinatorial Libraries for the Discovery of High&#8208;Entropy Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale combinatorial libraries are introduced as a new method for exploration of polyelemental material systems. Composition gradients of quinary material systems are produced and characterized for crystal properties and electrocatalytic activity. The small dimensions of microscale combinatorial libraries enable efficient screening of thousands of compositions. Highly active electrocatalysts are identified in the systems Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt and Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt.








Abstract
Polyelemental material systems, specifically high&#8208;entropy alloys, promise unprecedented properties. Due to almost unlimited combinatorial possibilities, their exploration and exploitation is hard. This challenge is addressed by co&#8208;sputtering combined with shadow masking to produce a multitude of microscale combinatorial libraries in one deposition process. These thin&#8208;film composition spreads on the microscale cover unprecedented compositional ranges of high&#8208;entropy alloy systems and enable high&#8208;throughput characterization of thousands of compositions for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions using nanoscale scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. The exemplary exploration of the composition space of two high&#8208;entropy alloy systems provides electrocatalytic activity maps for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution as well as oxygen reduction reactions. Activity optima in the system Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt are identified, and active noble&#8208;metal lean compositions in the system Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt are discovered. This illustrates that the proposed microlibraries are a holistic discovery platform to master the multidimensionality challenge of polyelemental systems.

         <title>Unusual Spectrally Reproducible and High Q&#8208;Factor Random Lasing in Polycrystalline Tin Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly spectrally reproducible multimode random lasing is observed in thin polycrystalline films of tin iodide perovskite that cannot be explained by a strong mode localization. The observed spectral reproducibility can be due to the strong inhomogeneous broadening of photoluminescence spectra measured in tin&#8208;based perovskites on the basis of a comparison with an analogous Pb&#8208;based counterpart.








Abstract
An unusual spectrally reproducible near&#8208;IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q&#8208;factor as high as &#8776;104 with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn&#8208;based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.

&lt;p&gt;An unusual spectrally reproducible near-IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q-factor as high as &#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn-based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organohydrogel Artificial Muscle with Compartmentalized Anisotropic Actuation Under Microdomain Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organohydrogel actuator achieving the combination of high speed, high actuation strength, and large material size is proposed. The water is confined in hydrophobic microdomains in organohydrogel, thus realizing a compartmentalization actuation mode similar to muscle. This strategy can break through the limitations that originated from the traditional solvent diffusion actuation mechanism, inspiring gel actuator design.








Abstract
Current hydrogel actuators mostly suffer from weak actuation strength and low responsive speed owing to their solvent diffusion&#8208;induced volume change mechanism. Here a skeletal muscle&#8208;inspired organohydrogel actuator is reported in which solvents are confined in hydrophobic microdomains. Organohydrogel actuator is driven by compartmentalized directional network deformation instead of volume change, avoiding the limitations that originate from solvent diffusion. Organohydrogel actuator has an actuation frequency of 0.11&#160;Hz, 110 times that of traditional solvent diffusion&#8208;driven hydrogel actuators (&lt;10&#8722;3&#160;Hz), and can lift more than 85 times their own weight. This design achieves the combination of high responsive speed, high actuation strength, and large material size, proposing a strategy to fabricate hydrogel actuators comparable with skeletal muscle performance.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A goal in graphene synthesis is to establish routes for preparing graphene materials from liquids instead of conventional solid or gaseous sources. This work reports the production of graphene materials with tunable composition directly from liquid precursor. A fundamentally new graphene 3D&#8208;printing system is further developed for constructing 3D graphene materials with high structural integrity unachievable by traditional printing strategy.








Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation. The liquid precursor allows for easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantage of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene can be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8776;15 wt.%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes is demonstrated via a selective in situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the high structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects show an electrical conductivity of 4380 S&#160;m&#8722;1 and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components.

         <title>Bioengineering of High Cell Density Tissues with Hierarchical Vascular Networks for Ex Vivo Whole Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is shown to fabricate an in vitro model of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues. The supply of oxygen and nutrition is extremely significant for such tissues. Therefore, a hierarchical vascular network containing capillaries and an artificial channel for perfusion are formed.








Abstract
The development of tissue&#8208;like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and organoids has contributed to progress in regenerative medicine. Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top&#8208;down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

A simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine is developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology.

Abstract
Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA and high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, a simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (MCz&#8208;VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The resulting polymer CL&#8208;MCz offers high energy ordering and improved electrical conductivity, as well as appropriate energy&#8208;level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL&#8208;MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non&#8208;PTAA&#8208;based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibit competitive shelf&#8208;life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 h, reflecting high promises of CL&#8208;MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross&#8208;linking approach in preparing low&#8208;cost, stable, and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.

         <title>A New Class of Cluster&#8211;Matrix Nanocomposite Made of Fully Miscible Components</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prospect for creating highly metastable nanocomposite materials made from fully miscible alloy systems, like Ni&#8211;Cu, is opened. The cluster ion beam deposition technique allows stabilization of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters in a Cu&#8208;matrix with varying macroscopic concentration. Consequently, unique magnetic and magnetotransport properties are evident as a function of cluster concentration and enthalpy&#8208;driven cluster dissolution.








Abstract
Nanocomposite materials, consisting of two or more phases, at least one of which has a nanoscale dimension, play a distinctive role in materials science because of the multiple possibilities for tailoring their structural properties and, consequently, their functionalities. In addition to the challenges of controlling the size, size distribution, and volume fraction of nanometer phases, thermodynamic stability conditions limit the choice of constituent materials. This study goes beyond this limitation by showing the possibility of achieving nanocomposites from a bimetallic system, which exhibits complete miscibility under equilibrium conditions. A series of nanocomposite samples with different compositions are synthesized by the co&#8208;deposition of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters and a flux of Cu&#8208;atoms using a novel cluster ion beam deposition system. The retention of the metastable nanostructure is ascertained from atom probe tomography (APT), magnetometry, and magnetotransport studies. APT confirms the presence of nanoscale regions with &#8776;100 at% Ni. Magnetometry and magnetotransport studies reveal superparamagnetic behavior and magnetoresistance stemming from the single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic Ni&#8208;clusters embedded in the Cu&#8208;matrix. Essentially, the magnetic properties of the nanocomposites can be tailored by the precise control of the Ni concentration. The initial results offer a promising direction for future research on nanocomposites consisting of fully miscible elements.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Compatible Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is reported to modify the crystallization process of perovskite films on industrially feasible double&#8208;side textured silicon, which enables conformal deposition with improved film crystallinity and reduced trap density. This allows the fabrication of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with efficiencies of 28.9% (certified efficiency of 27.9%) and 25.1% for areas of 1 and 16&#160;cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells promise power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. The conformal deposition of perovskites on industrially feasible textured silicon solar cells allows for both lowered manufacturing costs and a higher matched photocurrent density, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandems using front&#8208;side flat or mildly textured silicon. However, the inferior crystal quality of perovskite films grown on fully&#8208;textured silicon compromises the photovoltaic performance. Here, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is developed to control the crystallization process of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films, which enables improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, and conformal deposition on industrially textured silicon. This strategy allows the fabrication of 28.6%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells (certified 27.9%, 1&#160;cm2). This approach is compatible with the scalable fabrication of tandems on industrially textured silicon, demonstrating an efficiency of 25.1% for an aperture area of 16&#160;cm2. The anion&#8208;engineered additive significantly improves the operating stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, and the encapsulated tandem solar cells retain over 80% of their initial performance following 2000&#160;h of operation under full 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Observation of Multi&#8208;Directional Energy Transfer in a Hybrid Plasmonic&#8211;Excitonic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast charge and energy exchange across the interface of a hybrid plasmonic heterostructure are explored with momentum resolved electron spectroscopy and diffraction. The results identify a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal, driven by a non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction. Non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy backflow.








Abstract
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light&#8211;matter interaction, and a non&#8208;plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application&#8208;relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal&#8208;to&#8208;substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on WSe2 with time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge&#8208;carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub&#8208;bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;modelling.

         <title>Multimorphic Materials: Spatially Tailoring Mechanical Properties via Selective Initiation of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two disparate polymer networks are created simultaneously using non&#8208;interacting chemical reactions and light as a stimulus. Upon turning the light on, the polymers want to phase&#8208;separate like oil and water, but the process is hindered as they interlock. Thus, the degree and location of phase separation, and in&#8208;turn mechanical properties, can be precisely controlled by the &#8220;flick of a switch&#8221;.








Abstract
Access to multimaterial polymers with spatially localized properties and robust interfaces is anticipated to enable new capabilities in soft robotics, such as smooth actuation for advanced medical and manufacturing technologies. Here, orthogonal initiation is used to create interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with spatial control over morphology and mechanical properties. Base catalyzes the formation of a stiff and strong polyurethane, while blue LEDs initiate the formation of a soft and elastic polyacrylate. IPN morphology is controlled by when the LED is turned &#8220;on&#8221;, with large phase separation occurring for short time delays (&#8776;1&#8211;2 min) and a mixed morphology for longer time delays (&gt;5&#160;min), which is supported by dynamic mechanical analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Through tailoring morphology, tensile moduli and fracture toughness can be tuned across &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a simple spring model is used to explain the observed mechanical behavior. Photopatterning produces &#8220;multimorphic&#8221; materials, where morphology is spatially localized with fine precision (&lt;100&#160;&#181;m), while maintaining a uniform chemical composition throughout to mitigate interfacial failure. As a final demonstration, the fabrication of hinges represents a possible use case for multimorphic materials in soft robotics.

         <title>Fast and Dynamic Mapping of the Protein Corona on Nanoparticle Surfaces by Photocatalytic Proximity Labeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed for in situ labeling of corona proteins. Nano&#8208;PPL exhibits a significantly improved temporal resolution (5 s duration) and reveals precise dynamics of protein coronas on anionic and cationic nanoparticles. This technology represents a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions.








Abstract
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano-PPL) is developed for in situ labeling of corona proteins. Nano-PPL exhibits a significantly improved temporal resolution (5 s duration) and reveals precise dynamics of protein coronas on anionic and cationic nanoparticles. This technology represents a significant methodological advance toward nano-protein interactions.

         <title>Imaging Guided Endogenic H2&#8208;Augmented Electrochemo&#8208;Sonodynamic Domino Co&#8208;therapy of Tumor in Vivo</title>

         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) is developed. The endogenic H2&#8208;triggered &#8220;domino effect&#8221; in tumor tissue is clearly revealed. The developed H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy guided by US imaging in vivo will open up a feasible new way for green, economic, and effective treatment of cancer in the future.








Abstract
Precise and on&#8208;demand release of sufficient hydrogen (H2) to tumor sites remains a key challenge for emerging H2&#8208;oncotherapy, and little is known about the physiological effects of &#8220;abundant&#8221; H2 on complex tumor microenvironments (TME). Here, a highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) with strong &#8220;domino effect&#8221; triggered by endogenous H2 generation at tumor sites is reported to speedily eliminate tumor tissue (&#8804;80&#160;mm3) within 1&#160;day. Adequate H2 is controllably generated in tumor sites through mild electrochemistry in vivo due to acidic TME by using clinical acupuncture Fe needles as electrodes. Besides starvation damage due to gas blockage/destruction of vessels, nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;bubbles of H2 formed in situ can elevate the tumor's internal temperature and burst vessels to further destroy the tumor&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Remarkably, vulnerable homeostasis of TME is disturbed as H2 also participates in the physiological activity of tumor cells, leading to tumor dysfunction. Last but not least, the body's inflammatory response to cancer is reduced after the treatment, which is beneficial for the body's immune system during post&#8208;treatment recovery. Based on all of these merits, the H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy provides a potentially safe and viable therapeutic strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Bandgap Reduction of GaN&#8211;ZnO Solid&#8208;Solution Thin Films Fabricated by Nanolamination of Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition is employed to fabricate (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x homogenous solid&#8208;solution films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 by varying the cycle ratios. The density functional theory calculations using a superlattice model are performed to evaluate and validate the reduction of bandgaps that results in enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to fabricate GaN&#8211;ZnO homogenous solid&#8208;solution thin films because it offers more precise control of the stoichiometry. By varying the ALD cycle ratios of GaN:ZnO from 5:10 to 10:5, the (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 are obtained. The formation of solid solution is explained based on the atomic stacking and preferred orientation of the layers of GaN and ZnO. However, the growth rates of GaN and ZnO during the lamination process are different from those of pure GaN and ZnO films. It is found that GaN grows faster on ZnO, whereas ZnO grows slower on GaN. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using a superlattice model for GaN and ZnO laminated layers fabricated by ALD to understand the difference of density of states (DOS) and evaluate the bandgaps for various atomic configurations in the solid&#8208;solution films. The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid&#8208;solution films.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Induced Micrometer&#8208;Scale Charge&#8208;Carrier Diffusion in Organic Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mobility fullerene liquid crystal is introduced into the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) to provide a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport, reduce energetic disorder and trap density via enhancing crystallization, and then realize micrometer&#8208;scale charge&#8208;carrier diffusion, leading to the impressive power conversion efficiencies of 15.23% for OSCs with the thickness approaching 500 nm.








Abstract
The short charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length (LD) (100&#8211;300&#160;nm) in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) impedes the further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially for thick&#8208;film (&gt;400&#160;nm) devices matching with industrial solution processing. Here a facile method is developed to efficiently increase LD and then improve PCEs of OSCs via introducing a fullerene liquid crystal, F1, into the active layer. F1 combines the inherent high electron mobility of fullerene and strong self&#8208;assembly capacity of liquid crystal, providing a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport&#160;and reducing energetic disorder and trap density in BHJ film via enhancing crystallization. Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility (&gt;10&#8722;2 cm&#8722;2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record LD of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuInxGa(1&#8722;x)Se2 (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer&#8208;scale LD, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.

         <title>Electron Conductive and Transparent Hydrogels for Recording Brain Neural Signals and Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to break the current bottleneck of implantable materials, which demonstrate a suit of desirable performances including matched modulus, good transparency, and high conductivity. The hydrogel electrode is successfully utilized for optogenetic neuromodulation and simultaneously recording the brain's neural signals, establishing the correlation between brain neural signals and corresponding limb behavior.








Abstract
Recording brain neural signals and optogenetic neuromodulations open&#160;frontiers in decoding brain neural information and neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Conventional implantable probes suffer from modulus mismatch with biological tissues and an irreconcilable tradeoff between transparency and electron conductivity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to address these tradeoffs, which generates conductive and transparent hydrogels with polypyrrole&#8208;decorated microgels as cross&#8208;linkers. The optical transparency of the electrodes can be attributed to the special structures that allow light waves to bypass the microgel particles and minimize their interaction. Demonstrated by probing the hippocampus of rat brains, the biomimetic electrode shows a prolonged capacity for simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and recording of brain neural signals. More importantly, an intriguing brain&#8211;machine interaction is realized, which involves signal input to the brain, brain neural signal generation, and controlling limb behaviors. This breakthrough work represents a significant scientific advancement toward decoding brain neural information and developing neurodegenerative disease therapies.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enables Exceptional Cyclability in Pouch&#8208;Type Full Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode, which consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with rich oxygen stable {001} planes. The resultant cathode effectively homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain and greatly inhibits the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen loss during de&#8208;/lilthiation, leading to superior electrochemical performances at various rates and operating temperatures.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in situ co&#8208;precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super&#8208;dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C with much better retention at 55 &#176;C and 5 C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. In a pouch&#8208;type full cell, it exhibits exceptionally long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1 C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5 C after 2000 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater to the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.

         <title>Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas&#8208;Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent gas diffusion electrodes are developed via the F&#8208;doped SnO2 coating of SiO2 fused fiber felts. These highly porous and conductive substrates are amenable to the disposition of various semiconductors and are employed herein to demonstrate photoelectrode membrane assemblies for solar&#8208;driven H2 production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance and thus limit the development of gas&#8208;phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein, the simple and scalable preparation of F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) coated SiO2 interconnected fiber felt substrates is reported. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the resulting substrates have porosity of 90%, roughness factor of 15.8, and Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100 nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gives sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and loss of incident light of 41% at illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating), and liquid&#8208;phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates is confirmed. Finally, gas phase H2 production is demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.

         <title>Dual Topology of Dirac Electron Transport and Photogalvanic Effect in Low&#8208;Dimensional Topological Insulator Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking layer number&#8208;dependent electron structure, quantum properties, and circularly (linearly) polarized photogalvanic effect are assessed in the low&#8208;dimensional dual topological superlattices (TSLs) (Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.








Abstract
Dual topological insulators, simultaneously protected by time&#8208;reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, open great opportunities to explore different symmetry&#8208;protected metallic surface states. However, the conventional dual topological states located on different facets hinder integration into planar opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic devices. Here, dual topological superlattices (TSLs) Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N with limited stacking layer number N are constructed. Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron emission spectra of the TSLs identify the coexistence and adjustment of dual topological surface states on Bi2Se3 facet. The existence and tunability of spin&#8208;polarized dual&#8208;topological bands with N on Bi2Se3 facet result in an unconventionally weak antilocalization effect (WAL) with variable WAL coefficient &#945; (maximum close to 3/2) from quantum transport experiments. Most importantly, it is identified that the spin&#8208;polarized surface electrons from dual topological bands exhibit circularly and linearly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE and LPGE). It is anticipated that the stacked dual&#8208;topology and stacking layer number controlled bands evolution provide a platform for realizing intrinsic CPGE and LPGE. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Control of Nonlinear Light Polarization in MoS2 via PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Thin Films and Free&#8208;Standing Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric domain patterning enabled approach is developed to achieve nanoscale reconfigurable modulation of the amplitude and polarization of SHG light in MoS2 interfaced with PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films and membranes. The light polarization exhibits threefold symmetry at polar domains and twofold symmetry at domain walls. This study opens up new opportunities for developing smart nano&#8208;photonics and optical computing systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinear optical responses, while nanoscale control of the amplitude, polar orientation, and phase of the nonlinear light in TMDCs remains challenging. In this work, by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films and free&#8208;standing PZT membranes, the amplitude and polarization of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal are modulated via ferroelectric domain patterning, which demonstrates that PZT membranes can lead to in&#8208;operando programming of nonlinear light polarization. The interfacial coupling of the MoS2 polar axis with either the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar domains of PZT or the in&#8208;plane polarization of domain walls tailors the SHG light polarization into different patterns with distinct symmetries, which are modeled via nonlinear electromagnetic theory. This study provides a new material platform that enables reconfigurable design of light polarization at the nanoscale, paving the path for developing novel optical information processing, smart light modulators, and integrated photonic circuits.

&lt;p&gt;A ferroelectric domain patterning enabled approach is developed to achieve nanoscale reconfigurable modulation of the amplitude and polarization of SHG light in MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interfaced with PbZr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thin films and membranes. The light polarization exhibits threefold symmetry at polar domains and twofold symmetry at domain walls. This study opens up new opportunities for developing smart nano-photonics and optical computing systems.

         <title>Fast and Durable Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at the Electron&#8208;Deficient Ruthenium&#8211;Ruthenium Oxide Interface</title>

         <dc:description>
A Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure is designed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively. The Ru domains are electron deficient and show substantially improved inoxidizability. The results highlight the significance of establishing robust and multifunctional heterointerfaces toward fast alkaline HOR and beyond.








Abstract
The slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics under alkaline conditions remain a critical challenge for the practical application of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are designed with abundant active Ru&#8211;RuO2 interface domains as efficient electrocatalysts for the HOR in alkaline media. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains at Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively, endowing the well&#8208;defined Ru(100)/RuO2(200) interface as the preferential region for fast alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. More importantly, the metallic Ru domains become electron deficient due to the strong interaction with RuO2 domains and show substantially improved inoxidizability, which is vital to maintain durable HOR electrocatalytic activity. The optimal Ru/RuO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits impressive alkaline HOR activity with an exchange current density of 8.86&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and decent durability. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure can be attributed to the robust and multifunctional Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces endowed by the unique metal&#8211;metal oxide domains.

         <title>Weakening Li+ De&#8208;solvation Barrier for Cryogenic Li&#8211;S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antecedent theoretical simulations decipher the correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ desolvation barrier in the electrolyte, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance kinetics of sulfur cathode effectively. This insight endows Li&#8211;S pouch cells with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0 &#176;C, demonstrating great&#160;potential for&#160;cryogenic&#160;Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;S batteries hold promise for pushing cell&#8208;level energy densities beyond 300&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 while operating at low temperatures (LTs, below 0&#160;&#176;C). However, the capacity release of existing Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs is still barely satisfactory, and there is almost no verification of the practicability of Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs in the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. Here, antecedent molecular dynamics (MDs) combined with density functional theory analysis are used to systematically investigate Li+ solvation structure in conventional Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs, which unprecedentedly reveals the positive correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ de&#8208;solvation barrier, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance the Li+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and thus improve the capacity performance of cryogenic Li&#8211;S batteries. These insights derived from theoretical simulations invested Li&#8211;S batteries with a 67.34% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared to their room temperature performance. In particular, an Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell using dilute electrolytes with a high sulfur loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte condition is fabricated, which delivers a discharge capacity of about 1000 mAh g&#8208;1 and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0&#160;&#176;C, offering a promising route toward a practical high&#8208;energy cryogenic Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>3D Cold&#8208;Trap Environment Printing for Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing technology (3DCEP) is proposed in this work to fabricate a MXene/Zn&#8208;P aerogel anode with highly aligned arrangement. Benefitting from unique high lattice matching and physical confinement effects inside the electrode, it can effectively inhibit the Zn dendrite growth and Zn&#8208;P corrosion in electrolytes. Finally, a 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full cell with long cyclic life can be realized.








Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are always regarded as ideal anode candidates for zinc ion batteries owing to their low cost and ease of processing. However, the intrinsic negative properties of Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes such as easy corrosion and uncontrolled dendrite growth have limited their further applications. Herein, a novel 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed to achieve the MXene and Zn&#8208;P (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P) anode with highly ordered arrangement. Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within the&#160;3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode during Zn plating&#8211;stripping. Consequently, the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;9.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3 DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF), the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1600 cycles. This study brings an inspired universal pathway to rapidly fabricate a reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in a cold environment for micro&#8208;zinc storage systems.

Many&#8208;body interactions in exciton complexes are crucial in many devices, for example, lasers, LEDs, and quantum light sources. Here, a combination of single quantum&#8208;dot photoluminescence spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures and configuration&#8208;interaction calculations reveals the size&#8208;dependent binding energies of trions (7&#8211;17&#160;meV) and biexcitons (15&#8211;30&#160;meV) in CsPbBr3&#160;quantum dots.

All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskite (LHP) (CsPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a competitive platform for classical light&#8208;emitting devices (in the weak light&#8211;matter interaction regime, e.g., LEDs and laser), as well as for devices exploiting strong light&#8211;matter interaction at room temperature. Many&#8208;body interactions and quantum correlations among photogenerated exciton complexes play an essential role, for example, by determining the laser threshold, the overall brightness of LEDs, and the single&#8208;photon purity in quantum light sources. Here, by combining cryogenic single&#8208;QD photoluminescence spectroscopy with configuration&#8208;interaction (CI) calculations, the size&#8208;dependent trion and biexciton binding energies are addressed. Trion binding energies increase from 7&#160;to 17&#160;meV for QD sizes decreasing from 30&#160;to 9&#160;nm, while the biexciton binding energies increase from 15&#160;to 30&#160;meV, respectively. CI calculations quantitatively corroborate the experimental results and suggest that the effective dielectric constant for biexcitons slightly deviates from the one of the single excitons, potentially as a result of coupling to the lattice in the multiexciton regime. The findings here provide a deep insight into the multiexciton properties in all&#8208;inorganic LHP QDs, essential for classical and quantum optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Engineering the Electronic Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Iron Sites with Boosted Oxygen Bifunctional Activity for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst on a mesoporous NC material by engineering the electronic structures of the metal sites is reported. This catalyst achieves remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction&#160;and oxygen evolution reaction, and demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the optimized electronic structure of Fe1N4O1 moieties contributes to excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries typically require efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts to support oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). However, sluggish kinetics and mass transportation challenges must be addressed if the performance of these catalysts is to be enhanced. Herein, a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprising atomically dispersed iron atoms supported on a mesoporous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Fe SAs/NC) with accessible metal sites and optimized electronic metal&#8211;support interactions is developed. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the engineered electronic structures of the metal active sites can regulate the charge distribution of Fe centers to optimize the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The Fe SAs/NC containing Fe1N4O1 sites achieves remarkable ORR activity over the entire pH range, with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.93, 0.83, and 0.75&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. In addition, it demonstrates a promising low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline conditions. The zinc&#8211;air battery assembled with Fe SAs/NC exhibits superior performance than that of Pt/C+RuO2 counterpart in terms of peak power density, specific capacity, and cycling stability. These findings demonstrate the importance of the electronic structure engineering of metal sites in directing catalytic activity.

         <title>Initiating Reversible Aqueous Copper&#8211;Tellurium Conversion Reaction with High Volumetric Capacity through Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8211;tellurium conversion reaction with high volumetric capacity of 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3 and long discharge plateau are investigated. The thermodynamic&#8211;kinetic asymmetries of the Cu&#8211;Te multiphase&#8208;conversion and oxidation&#8208;failure mechanisms are systematically revealed. The developed precise electrolyte engineering overcomes inherent oxidative distress and extends the cycling life of the battery by about three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Pursuing conversion&#8208;type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode due to its intrinsic attractive electronic conductivity and high theoretical volumetric capacity yet still to be explored. Herein, the kinetically/thermodynamically co&#8208;dominat copper&#8211;tellurium (Cu&#8211;Te) alloying phase&#8208;conversion process and corresponding oxidation failure mechanism of tellurium are investigated using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and comprehensive ex situ characterization techniques. By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive antioxidant addition) is implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu&#8211;Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8776;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 of which lifespan thousand&#8208;fold longer than Cu&#8211;Te conversion using CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte. This work paves a significant avenue for expanding high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type cathodes toward energetic aqueous multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

Dual&#8208;function colloidal quantum dot (QD) devices that operate as a high&#8208;current density light emitting diode and an optically excited laser are demonstrated. The device structure has been optimized to reduce optical losses and allow for efficient wave&#8208;guiding within the active QD layer. This demonstration represents an important milestone toward the practical implementation of a colloidal QD laser diode.








Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials can benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunications, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by rapid nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation at high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here&#160;we&#160;resolve some of these challenges and demonstrate optically excited lasing from fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

         <title>Macroscale Fabrication of Lightweight and Strong Porous Carbon Foams through Template&#8208;Coating Pair Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon materials on a macroscopic length scale has a significant impact on the construction, packaging, and transportation industries. Presented herein is a tunable platform for macroscale fabrication of lightweight and strong pyrolytic carbon foams through template&#8208;coating pair design.








Abstract
Manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams can benefit the construction, transportation, and packaging industries. One successful route to lightweight and mechanically strong carbon foams involves pyrolysis of polymeric architectures, which is inevitably accompanied by drastic volumetric shrinkage (usually &gt;98%). As such, a challenge of these materials lies in maintaining bulk dimensions of building struts that span orders of magnitude difference in length scale from centimeters to nanometers. This work demonstrates fabrication of macroscale low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams that feature exceptional dimensional stability through pyrolysis of robust template&#8208;coating pairs. The template serves as the architectural blueprint and contains strength&#8208;imparting properties (e.g., high node density and small strut dimensions); it is composed of a low char&#8208;yielding porous polystyrene backbone with a high carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The coating serves to imprint and transcribe the template architecture into pyrolytic carbon; it is composed of a high char&#8208;yielding conjugated polymer with a relatively low carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The designed carbonization mismatch enables structural inheritance, while the decomposition mismatch affords hollow struts, minimizing density.

&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing of low-density-high-strength carbon materials on a macroscopic length scale has a significant impact on the construction, packaging, and transportation industries. Presented herein is a tunable platform for macroscale fabrication of lightweight and strong pyrolytic carbon foams through template-coating pair design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing of low-density-high-strength carbon foams can benefit the construction, transportation, and packaging industries. One successful route to lightweight and mechanically strong carbon foams involves pyrolysis of polymeric architectures, which is inevitably accompanied by drastic volumetric shrinkage (usually &amp;gt;98%). As such, a challenge of these materials lies in maintaining bulk dimensions of building struts that span orders of magnitude difference in length scale from centimeters to nanometers. This work demonstrates fabrication of macroscale low-density-high-strength carbon foams that feature exceptional dimensional stability through pyrolysis of robust template-coating pairs. The template serves as the architectural blueprint and contains strength-imparting properties (e.g., high node density and small strut dimensions); it is composed of a low char-yielding porous polystyrene backbone with a high carbonization-onset temperature. The coating serves to imprint and transcribe the template architecture into pyrolytic carbon; it is composed of a high char-yielding conjugated polymer with a relatively low carbonization-onset temperature. The designed carbonization mismatch enables structural inheritance, while the decomposition mismatch affords hollow struts, minimizing density. The carbons synthesized through this new framework exhibit remarkable dimensional stability (&#8776;80% dimension retention; &#8776;50% volume retention) and some of the highest specific strengths (&#8776;0.13&#160;GPa g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) among reported carbon foams derived from porous polymer templates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Fullerene Bisadducts Enable High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four fullerene bisadduct regioisomers on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Benefiting from the favorable molecular packing, energy level alignment, and interfacial interaction, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based devices yield a champion efficiency of 14.58% with a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are attracting intense research interest due to their excellent optoelectric properties and eco&#8208;friendly features. To further improve the device performance, developing new fullerene derivatives as electron transporter layers (ETLs) is highly demanded. Four well&#8208;defined regioisomers (trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e) of diethylmalonate&#8208;C60 bisadduct (DCBA) are isolated and well characterized. The well&#8208;defined molecular structure enables us to investigate the real structure&#8208;dependent effects on photovoltaic performance. It is found that the chemical structures of the regioisomers not only affect their energy levels, but also lead to significant differences in their molecular packings and interfacial contacts. As a result, the devices with trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e as ETLs yield efficiencies of 11.69%, 14.58%, 12.59%, and 10.55%, respectively, which are higher than that of the as&#8208;prepared DCBA&#8208;based (10.28%) device. Notably, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing TPSCs.

         <title>Control of Molecular Orbital Ordering Using a van der Waals Monolayer Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling and tuning the orbital ordering in a single molecule using a monolayer ferroelectric substrate is realized. This is achieved by adsorbing transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc) molecules on a ferroelectric monolayer SnTe. The orbital order is probed using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, and it is demonstrated that it can be controllably changed by switching the polarization direction of the underlying ferroelectric monolayer.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials provide a promising platform for the electrical control of quantum states. In particular, due to their 2D nature, they are suitable for influencing the quantum states of deposited molecules via the proximity effect. Here, electrically controllable molecular states in phthalocyanine molecules adsorbed on monolayer ferroelectric material SnTe are reported. The strain and ferroelectric order in SnTe are found to create a transition between two distinct orbital orders in the adsorbed phthalocyanine molecules. By controlling the polarization of the ferroelectric domain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it is successfully demonstrated that orbital order can be manipulated electrically. The results show how ferroelastic coupling in 2D systems allows for control of molecular states, providing a starting point for ferroelectrically switchable molecular orbital ordering and ultimately, electrical control of molecular&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the drawbacks of current nanozyme catalytic therapy, a novel Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom/Cer nanoagent with asymmetric electron distribution is developed, which can improve the efficiency of multienzyme&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions through a substrate&#8208;recyclable manner, thereby disrupting the intracellular redox and energy metabolism homeostasis to achieve efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#63743;N5 SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single&#8208;atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#63743;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#63743;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can also generate O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&#63743;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Vertical Electrochemical Transistors for Printed Multi&#8208;Valued Logic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of high&#8208;speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical&#8208;tuning of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox&#8208;based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high&#8208;functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi&#8208;valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual&#8208;channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual&#8208;ion&#8208;penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very&#8208;high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V are demonstrated.

         <title>Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh Reversibility Enabled by the Closest Packing Crystallography for Sustainable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is reported to construct dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates, which epitaxially match the closest packed facets of metals. The closest packed facets of metal anodes aligned horizontally with substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability. Consequently, the metal anodes display high reversibility and outstanding performance.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing annual electricity generated from sustainable and intermittent energy such as wind and solar power requires cost effective and reliable electrochemical energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent metal anodes such as Zn, Al, and Fe, taking advantage of large&#8208;scale production and affordable cost, have emerged as promising candidates. However, the uncontrollable dendrite&#8208;like metal deposition on regular substrate caused by disordered metal crystallization usually leads to premature failure of batteries and even safety concerns when the dendrite bridges the electrodes. Here it is reported that a series of metal anodes (Zn, Co, Al, Ni, and Fe) with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) can achieve dendrite&#8208;free and epitaxial deposition on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates enabled by the closest packing crystallography. Moreover, the closest packed facets are aligned horizontally with the substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability even at an unprecedented current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full cells under a practical anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio of 2.3 show a cycling life span of over 800 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of &gt;&#160;99.9%. The universal approach of regulating metal electrodeposition in this work is expected to boost the development of emerging sustainable energy storage/conversion devices.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cation Composition Engineering of Hybrid Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Self&#8208;Healing Electronics Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthesis cesium/formamidinium (Cs/FA) mixed&#8208;cation perovskite nanocrystals possess high structural and optoelectronic properties for integration in self&#8208;healing polymer composites. Entropic&#8208;driven self&#8208;healing not only enhances white backlight display performance, but also sustains the working performance of a shattered&#8211;repaired glass substrate laser, thereby representing potentially major advances in optoelectronics and photonics applications.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskite nanocrystal (HPNC) with high crystallinity, color purity, and tunable optical bandgap offers a practical pathway toward next&#8208;generation&#160;displays. Herein, a two&#8208;step modified hot&#8208;injection combined with cation compositional engineering and surface treatment to synthesize high&#8208;purity cesium/formamidinium lead bromide HPNCs(Cs1&#8208;xFAxPbBr3) is presented. The optimized Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) exhibit uniform luminescence of 3500&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a prominent current efficiency of 21.5&#160;cd A&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP) integrated with white LED backlight and laser prototypes exhibited 4 h autonomous self&#8208;healing through the synergistic effect of weak reversible imine bonds and stronger H&#8208;bonds. First, the SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;initial and SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;cut possess high long&#8208;term stability and dramatically suppressed lead leakage as low as 0.6&#160;ppm along with a low leakage rate of 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 and 3.36 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 even over 6 months in water. Second, the Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 HPNCs and SHP&#8208;induced shattered&#8211;repaired perovskite glass substrate show the lowest lasing threshold values of 1.24 and 8.58 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides an integrative and in&#8208;depth approach to exploiting SHP with intrinsic and entropic self&#8208;healing capabilities combined with HPNCs to develop robust and reliable soft&#8208;electronic backlight and laser applications.

Organic Metal Halide Hybrids
Efficient electroluminescent devices can now be fabricated using solution&#8208;processed thin films based on 0D organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs). In article number 2209417, Biwu Ma and co&#8208;workers develop a highly luminescent 0D OMHH containing organic semiconducting cations, which successfully addresses the issues of low conductivity and poor energy alignment of existing 0D OMHHs for electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

         <title>Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive switching devices made of layered materials (LMs) have shown interesting performance. However, most studies employ fabrication methods and device structures that are not industry&#8208;relevant. In this review, the focus is on the status of crossbar arrays of LMs.








Abstract
Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&gt;108&#160;devices mm&#8722;2) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three&#8208;dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices compared to traditional phase&#8208;change materials and metal oxides is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here, the key figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit and procedures to implement LM&#8208;based RS devices are defined. LM&#8208;based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry are identified and discussed. The focus is on small devices (size&#160;&lt;&#160;9&#160;&#181;m2) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artifacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions. How to enhance device performance, so to accelerate the development of this technology, is also discussed.
