         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Dielectrophoretic Microparticle Manipulation Platform Based on a Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered DEP microparticle manipulation platform based on a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is proposed, which performs high&#8208;efficiency cell separation. This work provides an ideal scheme for improving the portability of microfluidic chips and is beneficial to the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.








Abstract
Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems aim to integrate laboratory operations on a miniaturized device with broad application prospects in the field of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing. However, bulky peripheral power resources, such as high&#8208;voltage supplies, function generators, and amplifiers, hamper the commercialization of the system. In this work, a portable, self&#8208;powered microparticle manipulation platform based on triboelectrically driven dielectrophoresis (DEP) is reported. A rotary freestanding triboelectric nanogenerator (RF&#8208;TENG) and rectifier/filter circuit supply a high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current signal to form a non&#8208;uniform electric field within the microchannel, realizing controllable actuation of the microparticles through DEP. The operating mechanism of this platform and the control performance of the moving particles are systematically studied and analyzed. Randomly distributed particles converge in a row after passing through the serpentine channel and various particles are separated owing to the different DEP forces. Ultimately, the high&#8208;efficiency separation of live and dead yeast cells is achieved using this platform. RF&#8208;TENG as the power source for lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip exhibits better safety and portability than traditional high&#8208;voltage power sources. This study presents a promising solution for the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip.

         <title>&#8220;Enzyme&#8208;Like&#8221; Spatially Fixed Polyhydroxyl Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Hydrochromic Molecular Switching for Naked Eye Detection of ppm Level Humidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy for ultralow humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) is proposed, which activates hydrochromic molecular switching by constructing a spatially&#8208;fixed polyhydroxyl microenvironment. As a result, recyclable naked eye recognition of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm humidity is achieved first. This UHSP provides a more economical, environmental friendly and convenient choice for ultralow humidity monitoring required by high&#8208;tech manufacturing such as chips, solar cells, etc.








Abstract
The detection and monitoring of ultralow humidity (&lt;100&#160;ppm) are critical in many important industries, such as high&#8208;tech manufacturing, scientific research, and aerospace. However, the development of ppm level humidity sensors with portability, low cost, and ease of regeneration remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy is proposed to address this problem by employing suitable molecular&#8208;level humidity&#8208;sensitive units and chemically constructing a multilevel spatial synergistic sensitization microenvironment around it. The as&#8208;prepared ultralow humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) achieved a naked eye recognition humidity of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm. UHSP not only is simple to prepare, handy and low&#8208;cost, but can also be simply and efficiently regenerated as well as recycled many times by skillfully utilizing the &#8220;unconventional sublimation&#8221; and &#8220;lime slaked&#8221; of calcium oxide. The molecular reaction mechanisms involved in the humidity response and regeneration of UHSP have been demonstrated in detail. UHSP can provide a promising new method for ultralow humidity detection in the form of portable kits or sirens. The demonstrated &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy can bring unlimited ideas and implications to the design and development of sensors with tunable response thresholds, particularly high sensitivity.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Change Perovskite Microlaser with Tunable Polarization Vortex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subwavelength&#8208;thin perovskite metasurface supporting multiple bound states in the continuum is used to realize a tunable polarization&#8208;vortex laser. The structural phase&#8208;change properties of the perovskite induce bistable dynamic switching of the topological charges as a function of temperature.








Abstract
Metasurfaces supporting optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) are emerging as simple and compact optical cavities to realize polarization&#8208;vortex lasers. The winding of the polarization around the singularity defines topological charges which are generally set by the cavity design and cannot be altered without changing geometrical parameters. Here, a subwavelength&#8208;thin phase&#8208;change halide perovskite BIC metasurface functioning as a tunable polarization vortex microlaser is demonstrated. Upon the perovskite structural phase transitions, both its refractive index and gain vary substantially, inducing reversible and bistable switching between distinct polarization vortexes underpinned by opposite topological charges. Dynamic tuning and switching of the resulting vector beams may find use in microscopy imaging, particle trapping and manipulation, and optical data storage.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Controllable Syntheses and Property Modulations from 2D Ferromagnetic Fe5Se8 to Metallic Fe3Se4 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the composition&#8208;controllable syntheses of 2D non&#8208;layered iron selenide nanosheets (25% Fe&#8208;intercalated triclinic Fe5Se8 and 50% Fe&#8208;intercalated monoclinic Fe3Se4), via a robust chemical vapor deposition strategy is presented. Intriguingly, it has been revealed that the 2D Fe5Se8 exhibits intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic property, and the ultrathin Fe3Se4 presents a novel metallic feature.








Abstract
Exploring new&#8208;type 2D magnetic materials with high magnetic transition temperature and robust air stability has attracted wide attention for developing innovative spintronic devices. Recently, intercalation of native metal atoms into the van der Waals gaps of 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been developed to form 2D non&#8208;layered magnetic TMDs, while only succeeded in limited systems (e.g., Cr2S3, Cr5Te8). Herein, composition&#8208;controllable syntheses of 2D non&#8208;layered iron selenide nanosheets (25% Fe&#8208;intercalated triclinic Fe5Se8 and 50% Fe&#8208;intercalated monoclinic Fe3Se4) are firstly reported, via a robust chemical vapor deposition strategy. Specifically, the 2D Fe5Se8 exhibits intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic property, which is explained by the change of electron spin states from layered 1T'&#8208;FeSe2 to non&#8208;layered Fe&#8208;intercalated Fe5Se8 based on density functional theory calculations. In contrast, the ultrathin Fe3Se4 presents novel metallic features comparable with that of metallic TMDs. This work hereby sheds light on the composition&#8208;controllable synthesis and fundamental property exploration of 2D self&#8208;intercalation induced novel TMDs compounds, by propelling their application explorations in nanoelectronics and spintronics&#8208;related fields.

         <title>An Effective Sneak&#8208;Path Solution Based on a Transient&#8208;Relaxation Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy in which&#160;the transient relaxation in a type of dynamic selector made from unipolar volatile memristors is harnessed to effectively address&#160;the sneak&#8208;path problem in memristor arrays is demonstrated.








Abstract
An efficient strategy for addressing individual devices is required to unveil the full potential of memristors for high&#8208;density memory and computing applications. Existing strategies using two&#8208;terminal selectors that are preferable for compact integration have trade&#8208;offs in reduced generality or functional window. A strategy that applies to broad memristors and maintains their full&#8208;range functional window is proposed. This strategy uses a type of unipolar switch featuring a transient relaxation or retention as the selector. The unidirectional current flow in the switch suppresses the sneak&#8208;path current, whereas the transient&#8208;relaxation window is exploited for bidirectional programming. A unipolar volatile memristor with ultralow switching voltage (e.g., &lt;100&#160;mV), constructed from a protein nanowire dielectric harvested from Geobacter sulfurreducens, is specifically employed as the example switch to highlight the advantages and scalability in the strategy for array integration.

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption via Charge Transfer at the Semiconductor&#8211;Metal Heterointerface&#160;for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RhP2/Rh heterointerface induces electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which effectively increases the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakens the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2. The interfacial electron transfer can activate the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2, effectively promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics.








Abstract
Designing and synthesizing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is important for realizing the hydrogen economy. Tuning the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts is essential to achieve optimal HER activity, and interfacial engineering is an effective strategy to induce electron transfer in a heterostructure interface to optimize HER kinetics. In this study, ultrafine RhP2/Rh nanoparticles are synthesized with a well&#8208;defined semiconductor&#8211;metal heterointerface embedded in N,P co&#8208;doped graphene (RhP2/Rh@NPG) via a one&#8208;step pyrolysis. RhP2/Rh@NPG exhibits outstanding HER performances under all pH conditions. Electrochemical characterization and first principles density functional theory calculations reveal that the RhP2/Rh heterointerface induces electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which increases the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakens the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2, thereby accelerating the HER kinetics. Moreover, the interfacial electron transfer activates the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2 in neutral and alkaline environments, thereby promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster HER kinetics.

         <title>Hybrid Block Copolymer/Perovskite Heterointerfaces for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid block copolymer/perovskite heterointerfaces strategy is developed for the first time by introducing a novel and functional block copolymer PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6, and consequently, such an architecture enhances light harvesting, promotes charge transfer and prevents moisture invasion, delivering a champion efficiency over 24% together with enhanced stability.








Abstract
Solution processable semiconductors like organics and emerging lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are ideal candidates for photovoltaics combining high performance and flexibility with reduced manufacturing cost. Moreover, the study of hybrid semiconductors would lead to advanced structures and deep understanding that will propel this field even further. Herein, a novel device architecture involving block copolymer/perovskite hybrid bulk heterointerfaces is investigated, such a modification could enhance light absorption, create an energy level cascade, and provides a thin hydrophobic layer, thus enabling enhanced carrier generation, promoting energy transfer and preventing moisture invasion, respectively. The resulting hybrid block copolymer/perovskite solar cell exhibits a champion efficiency of 24.07% for 0.0725&#160;cm2&#8208;sized devices and 21.44% for 1&#160;cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively, together with enhanced stability, which is among the highest reports of organic/perovskite hybrid devices. More importantly, this approach has been effectively extended to other LHPs with different chemical compositions like MAPbI3 and CsPbI3, which may shed light on the design of highly efficient block copolymer/perovskite hybrid materials and architectures that would overcome current limitations for realistic application exploration.

         <title>Engineering Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks for Solar Desalination with Directional Salt Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8722;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;engineered 3D evaporators are constructed by alternately arranging superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic sponges secured with hydrophilic threads. The MPN coatings endow the sponges with photothermal properties and selective wettability, enabling the efficient, long&#8208;term, and sustained desalination of high&#8208;salinity brine for both indoor and outdoor field operations.








Abstract
Solar desalination is one of the most promising strategies to address the global freshwater shortage crisis. However, the residual salt accumulated on the top surface of solar evaporators severely reduces light absorption and steam evaporation efficiency, thus impeding the further industrialization of this technology. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;engineered 3D evaporator composed of photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges and side&#8208;twining hydrophilic threads for efficient desalination with directional salt crystallization and zero liquid discharge is reported. The MPN coatings afford the engineering of alternating photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges with high heating efficiency and defined vapor escape channels, while the side&#8208;twining threads induce site&#8208;selective salt crystallization. The 3D evaporator exhibits a high and stable indoor desalination rate (&#8776;2.3&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) of concentrated seawater (20&#160;wt%) under simulated sun irradiation for over 21 days without the need for salt crystallization inhibitors. This direct desalination is also achieved in outdoor field operations with a production rate of clean water up to &#8776;1.82&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 from concentrated seawater (10&#160;wt%). Together with the high affinity and multiple functions of MPNs, this work is expected to facilitate the rational design of solar desalination devices and boost the research translation of MPN materials in broader applications.

         <title>Role of Bicontinuous Structure in Elastomeric Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;property&#8211;electrochemical performance relationship of the elastomeric electrolyte system is established to demonstrate the importance of balancing Li&#8208;ion transport and mechanical properties for achieving high energy Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are garnering attention as a next&#8208;generation battery technology that can surpass conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries in terms of energy density and operational safety under the condition that the issue of uncontrolled Li dendrite is resolved. In this study, various plastic crystal&#8208;embedded elastomer electrolytes (PCEEs) are investigated with different phase&#8208;separated structures, prepared by systematically adjusting the volume ratio of the phases, to elucidate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE in the LMBs.

&lt;p&gt;The structure&#8211;property&#8211;electrochemical performance relationship of the elastomeric electrolyte system is established to demonstrate the importance of balancing Li-ion transport and mechanical properties for achieving high energy Li metal batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state lithium (Li)-metal batteries (LMBs) are garnering attention as a next-generation battery technology that can surpass conventional Li-ion batteries in terms of energy density and operational safety under the condition that the issue of uncontrolled Li dendrite is resolved. In this study, various plastic crystal-embedded elastomer electrolytes (PCEEs) are investigated with different phase-separated structures, prepared by systematically adjusting the volume ratio of the phases, to elucidate the structure-property-electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE in the LMBs. At an optimal volume ratio of elastomer phase to plastic-crystal phase (i.e., 1:1), bicontinuous-structured PCEE, consisting of efficient ion-conducting, plastic-crystal pathways with long-range connectivity within a crosslinked elastomer matrix, exhibits exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 20 &#176;C and excellent mechanical resilience (elongation at break &#8776; 300%). A full cell featuring this optimized PCEE, a 35&#160;&#181;m thick Li anode, and a high loading LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.83&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.06&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NMC-83) cathode delivers a high energy density of 437&#160;Wh kg&lt;sub&gt;anode+cathode+electrolyte&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The established structure&#8211;property&#8211;electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE for solid-state LMBs is expected to inform the development of the elastomeric electrolytes for various electrochemical energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymer Coordinated Single Co Site Nanofibers for Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Cathodes in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A liquid processable COP&#8208;based material is directly used in fuel cell devices via a pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The nanofibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a hierarchical porous texture and the full dispersion of the atomic Co active sites. Resultingly, both the power density and durability are significantly improved compared with the traditional conventional spraying methods.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;cobalt&#8208;atom electrocatalysts, particularly ones derived from high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis of cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), have emerged as a new frontier in the design of oxygen reduction cathodes in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) due to their enhanced durability and smaller Fenton effects related to the degradation of membranes and ionomers compared with emphasized iron&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, pyrolysis techniques lead to obscure active&#8208;site configurations, undesirably defined porosity and morphology, and fewer exposed active sites. Herein, a highly stable cross&#8208;linked nanofiber electrode is directly prepared by electrospinning using a liquid processability cobalt&#8208;based covalent organic polymer (Co&#8208;COP) obtained via pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The resultant fibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a uniform hierarchical porous texture and a full dispersion of atomic Co active sites on the catalyst surface. Focused ion beam&#8208;field emission scanning electron microscopy and computational fluid dynamics experiments confirm that the relative diffusion coefficient is enhanced by 3.5 times, which can provide an efficient route both for reactants to enter the active sites, and drain away the produced water efficiently. Resultingly, the peak power density of the integrated Co&#8208;COP nanofiber electrode is remarkably enhanced by 1.72 times along with significantly higher durability compared with conventional spraying methods. Notably, this nanofabrication technique also maintains excellent scalability and uniformity.

         <title>Nanoscale TEM Imaging of Hydrogel Network Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct observation of the nanoscale polymer network of hydrogels is essential in understanding its properties. Herein, for the first time, a novel staining and structure fixation method is developed for transmission electron microscopy&#160;observation to visualize the hydrogel network architecture in its unperturbed conformation. The revealed molecular structures provide important insights for the friction, adhesion, and fracture of hydrogels.








Abstract
In this work, the authors succeed in direct visualization of the network structure of synthetic hydrogels with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by developing a novel staining and network fixation method. Such a direct visualization is not carried out because sample preparation and obtaining sufficient contrast are challenging for these soft materials. TEM images reveal robust heterogeneous network architectures at mesh size scale and defects at micro&#8208;scale. TEM images also reveal the presence of abundant dangling chains on the surface of the hydrogel network. The real space structural information provides a comprehensive perspective that links bulk properties with a nanoscale network structure, including fracture, adhesion, sliding friction, and lubrication. The presented method has the potential to advance the field.

         <title>Emergent, Non&#8208;Aging, Extendable, and Rechargeable Exchange Bias in 2D Fe3GeTe2 Homostructures Induced by Moderate Pressuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon moderate pressuring, Fe3GeTe2 as a prototypical layered magnet transits into a ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coexisting state, and the homostructure with an atomically smooth interface exhibits unprecedented exchange bias (ExB) without gradual aging before collapsing via avalanching. The very existence of the non&#8208;aging nature further allows achieving, striking and technologically significant extendability and rechargeability of the ExB.








Abstract
As a crucial concept in magnetism and spintronics, exchange bias (ExB) measures the asymmetry in the hysteresis loop of a pinned ferromagnet (FM)/antiferromagnet (AFM) interface. Previous studies are mainly focused on FM/AFM heterostructures composed of conventional bulk materials, whose complex interfaces prohibit precise control and full understanding of the phenomenon. Here, the enabling power of 2D magnets is exploited to demonstrate the emergence, non&#8208;aging, extendability, and rechargeability of ExB in van der Waals Fe3GeTe2 homostructures, upon moderate pressuring. The emergence of the ExB is attributed to a local stress&#8208;induced FM&#8208;to&#8208;AFM transition, as validated using first&#8208;principles calculations, and confirmed in magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect and second harmonic generation measurements. It is also observed that, negligible ExB aging before the training effect suddenly takes place through avalanching, pronounced delay of the avalanche via timed pressure repetition (extendability), ExB recovery in the post&#8208;training sample upon refreshed pressuring (rechargeability), and demonstrate its versatile tunability. These striking findings offer unprecedented insights into the underlying principles of ExB and its training, with immense technological applications in sight.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tunable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Metatransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. The &#8220;metatransistor&#8221; shows an 8&#8208;fold enhancement of the electroluminescence compared to the unpatterned device. The combination of pixelated metasurfaces in the active area and electrically switchable recombination zone enables dynamic tunability of the electroluminescence polarization.








Abstract
Emerging immersive visual communication technologies require light sources with complex functionality for dynamic control of polarization, directivity, wavefront, spectrum, and intensity of light. Currently, this is mostly achieved by free space bulk optic elements, limiting the adoption of these technologies. Flat optics based on artificially structured metasurfaces that operate at the sub&#8208;wavelength scale are a viable solution, however, their integration into electrically driven devices remains challenging. Here, a radically new approach to monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. It is shown that nanogratings directly structured on top of the transistor channel yield an 8&#8208;fold increase of electroluminescence intensity and dynamic tunability of polarization. This new light&#8208;emitting metatransistor device concept opens unlimited opportunities for light management strategies based on metasurface design and integration.

         <title>Merging the Interfaces of Different Shape&#8208;Shifting Polymers Using Hybrid Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid exchange reactions (among ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8211;ester, and oxime&#8211;ester linkages) enable stable seamless bonding of covalently cross&#8208;linked networks made by different chemistry, as well as to produce new materials by cross&#8208;fusion. Distinctive multimaterial 3D shape&#8208;shifting structures are demonstrated since this strategy facilitates flexible design in morphology and integration of diverse properties in a monolithic recyclable and potentially healable system.








Abstract
Sophisticated shape&#8208;shifting structures and integration of advanced functions often call for different&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based polymers (such as epoxy and polyurethane) in a unified system. However, permanent cross&#8208;links pose crucial obstacles to be seamless. Here, merging interfaces via hybrid exchange reactions among different dynamic covalent bonds (including ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8211;ester, and oxime&#8211;ester linkages) is proposed, breaking the long&#8208;lasting restriction that these widely used bonds only undergo self&#8208;exchange reactions. Model compound studies are conducted to verify that hybrid exchange reactions occur. As demonstrations, different liquid crystal elastomers are tenaciously joined into coherent assemblies, with the desired biomimetic structures (e.g., flying fish containing stiff and flexible parts) and rare deformation modes (e.g., flower blooming upon both heating and cooling). Besides connecting polymers, hybrid exchange reactions also facilitate the creation of new materials through cross&#8208;fusion of different polymers. In addition to the polymers used in this work, hybrid exchange reactions can be adapted to other polymers based on similar mechanisms and beyond. Besides shape&#8208;shifting&#8208;related areas (e.g., soft robots, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices), it may also foster innovation in other fields involving general polymers, as well as promote deeper understanding of dynamic covalent chemistry.

         <title>When Chirophotonic Film Meets Wrinkles: Viewing Angle Independent Corrugated Photonic Crystal Paper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D stripe and 2D wavy wrinkled photonic crystal paper are fabricated by shear coating on the wrinkled interpenetrating network rubber substrate to reflect the same color regardless of viewing angle. The wrinkled photonic crystal paper can be applied as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting film and wide&#8208;angle monochromatic light reflector.








Abstract
Light manipulation strategies of nature have fascinated humans for centuries. In particular, structural colors are of considerable interest due to their ability to control the interaction between light and matter. Here, wrinkled photonic crystal papers (PCPs) are fabricated to demonstrate the consistent reflection of colors regardless of viewing angles. The nanoscale molecular self&#8208;assembly of a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) with a microscale corrugated surface is combined. Fully polymerizable CLC paints are uniaxially coated onto a wrinkled interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) substrate. Photopolymerization of the helicoidal nanostructures results in a flexible and free&#8208;standing PCP. The facile method of fabricating the wrinkled PCPs provides a scalable route for the development of novel chirophotonic materials with precisely controlled helical pitch and curvature dimensions. The reflection notch position of the flat PCP shifts to a lower wavelength when the viewing angle increased, while the selective reflection wavelength of wrinkled PCP is remained consistent regardless of viewing angles. The optical reflection of the 1D stripe&#8208;wrinkled PCP is dependent on the wrinkle direction. PCPs with different corrugated directions can be patterned to reduce the angular&#8208;dependent optical reflection of wrinkles. Furthermore, 2D wavy&#8208;wrinkled PCP is successfully developed that exhibit directionally independent reflection of color.

         <title>Regulation of Polymer Configurations Enables Green Solvent&#8208;Processed Large&#8208;Area Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells With Breakthrough Performance and High Efficiency Stretchability Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulation of the configurations of the non&#8208;conjugated polymer acceptors enables green solvent&#8208;processed large&#8208;area binary all&#8208;polymer solar cells to achieve record efficiency and robustness. This study not only provides a series of reliable novel conductive materials with excellent performance for flexible wearable solar cells but also elucidates a concept to evaluate the comprehensive performance of organic solar cells.








Abstract
With the great potential of the all&#8208;polymer solar cells for large&#8208;area wearable devices, both large&#8208;area device efficiency and mechanical flexibility are very critical but attract limited attention. In this work, from the perspective of the polymer configurations, two types of terpolymer acceptors PYTX&#8208;A and PYTX&#8208;B (X&#160;= Cl or H) are developed. The configuration difference caused by the replacement of non&#8208;conjugated units results in distinct photovoltaic performance and mechanical flexibility. Benefiting from a good match between the intrinsically slow film&#8208;forming of the active materials and the technically slow film&#8208;forming of the blade&#8208;coating process, the toluene&#8208;processed large&#8208;area (1.21 cm2) binary device achieves a record efficiency of 14.70%. More importantly, a new parameter of efficiency stretchability factor (ESF) is proposed for the first time to comprehensively evaluate the overall device performance. PM6:PYTCl&#8208;A and PM6:PYTCl&#8208;B yield significantly higher ESF than PM6:PY&#8208;IT. Further blending with non&#8208;conjugated polymer donor PM6&#8208;A, the best ESF of 3.12% is achieved for PM6&#8208;A:PYTCl&#8208;A, which is among the highest comprehensive performances.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Infrared Lasers Featuring Sub&#8208;Single&#8208;Exciton Threshold and Very High Gain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavily doped PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed&#8208;shell colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) lead to short&#8208;wave infrared lasers with sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton pump threshold. These CQDs exhibit strong suppression of Auger recombination thanks to their compositional grading at the core/shell interface. Besides, they offer record high modal gain coefficient as well as long optical gain lifetime.








Abstract
The use of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) as a gain medium in infrared laser devices has been underpinned by the need for high pumping intensities, very short gain lifetimes, and low gain coefficients. Here, PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed&#8208;shell CQDs are employed as an infrared gain medium that results in highly suppressed Auger recombination with a lifetime of 485&#160;ps, lowering the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold down to 300&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2, and showing a record high net modal gain coefficient of 2180&#160;cm&#8722;1. By doping these engineered core/shell CQDs up to nearly filling the first excited state, a significant reduction of optical gain threshold is demonstrated, measured by transient absorption, to an average&#8208;exciton population&#8208;per&#8208;dot &#12296;Nth&#12297;g of 0.45&#160;due to bleaching of the ground state absorption. This in turn have led to a fivefold reduction in ASE threshold at &#12296;Nth&#12297;ASE&#160;=&#160;0.70&#160;excitons&#8208;per&#8208;dot, associated with a gain lifetime of 280&#160;ps. Finally, these heterostructured QDs are used to achieve near&#8208;infrared lasing at 1670&#160;nm at a pump fluences corresponding to sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton&#8208;per&#8208;dot threshold (&#12296;Nth&#12297;Las&#160;=&#160;0.87). This work brings infrared CQD lasing thresholds on par to their visible counterparts, and paves the way toward solution&#8208;processed infrared laser diodes.

         <title>Tissue&#8208;Mimetic Supramolecular Polymer Networks for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integration of non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;links and conducting polymers enables access to an electrically conductive supramolecular polymer network (E&#8208;SPN) exhibiting tissue&#8208;mimetic softness and stretchablity. The resultant material allows for fabrication of intrinsically&#8208;stretchable, stand&#8208;alone bioelectrodes, capable of comfortably and accurately measuring electromyography signals in real time. This research will offer a step toward the design and construction of next&#8208;generation, skin&#8208;like bioelectronics.








Abstract
Addressing the mechanical mismatch between biological tissue and traditional electronic materials remains a major challenge in bioelectronics. While rigidity of such materials limits biocompatibility, supramolecular polymer networks can harmoniously interface with biological tissues as they are soft, wet, and stretchable. Here, an electrically conductive supramolecular polymer network that simultaneously exhibits both electronic and ionic conductivity while maintaining tissue&#8208;mimetic mechanical properties, providing an ideal electronic interface with the human body, is introduced. Rational design of an ultrahigh affinity host&#8211;guest ternary complex led to binding affinities (&gt;1013&#160;M&#8208;2) of over an order of magnitude greater than previous reports. Embedding these complexes as dynamic cross&#8208;links, coupled with in situ synthesis of a conducting polymer, resulted in electrically conductive supramolecular polymer networks with tissue&#8208;mimetic Young's moduli (&lt;5&#160;kPa), high stretchability (&gt;500%), rapid self&#8208;recovery and high water content (&gt;84%). Achieving such properties enabled fabrication of intrinsically&#8208;stretchable stand&#8208;alone bioelectrodes, capable of accurately monitoring electromyography signals, free from any rigid&#160;materials.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Site Cathode with a Record High Sulfur Mass Loading for High&#8208;Performance Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site cathode is developed by wreathing monolayered MoS2 and Mo1 on sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The constructed atomic level MoS2&#8208;Mo1 with delocalized electron effects facilitates substantial charge transfer and a completely reversible reaction between S and Na, thus alleviating the shuttle effect.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries possess high potential for grid&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the issues arising from the low S mass loading and poor cycling stability caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfides seriously limit their operating capacity and cycling capability. Herein, sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks supporting atomically dispersed 2H&#8208;MoS2 and Mo1 (S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF) with a record high sulfur mass loading of 80.9&#160;wt.% are synthesized as an integrated dual active sites cathode for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. Impressively, the as&#8208;prepared S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF display unprecedented cyclic stability with a high initial capacity of 1017&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and a low&#8208;capacity fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 1000&#160;cycles. Experimental and computational results including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that atomic&#8208;level Mo in this integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site forms a delocalized electron system, which could improve the reactivity of sulfur and reaction reversibility of S and Na, greatly alleviating the shuttle effect. The findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;site cathodes, but also deepen the understanding of their enhancement mechanisms at an atomic level.

         <title>Decoupled Solar Energy Storage and Dark Photocatalysis in a 3D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material is showcased that combines light harvesting, photoinduced free&#8208;electron generation, and long&#8208;lived electron storage over several weeks. This phenomenon arises from the geometry&#8208;constraining confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8211;organic framework. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for dark photocatalysis and light&#8208;driven multicycle recharging is demonstrated, highlighting a candidate material toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.








Abstract
Materials enabling solar energy conversion and long&#8208;term storage for readily available electrical and chemical energy are key for off&#8208;grid energy distribution. Herein, the specific confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) unlocks a unique electron accumulating property under visible&#8208;light irradiation. About 15&#160;C gMOF&#8722;1 of electric charges can be concentrated and stored for over four weeks without loss. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for electrochemical reactions and H2 evolution catalysis is shown and light&#8208;driven recharging can be conducted for &gt;10 cycles with &#8776;90% of the initial charging capacity retained. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations link electron trapping to MOF&#8208;induced geometry constraints as well as the coordination environment of the Re&#8208;center, highlighting the key role of MOF confinement on molecular guests. This study serves as the seminal report on 3D porous colloids achieving photoaccumulation of long&#8208;lived electrons, unlocking dark photocatalysis, and a path toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.

         <title>Ultrathin Hydrogel Films toward Breathable Skin&#8208;Integrated Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin hydrogel films are fabricated by a facile cold&#8208;lamination method and demonstrated as the skin&#8211;electronics interface. The hydrogels comply with glyphic lines and subtle minutiae on the skin surface, allowing unimpeded transepidermal water loss and breathing of the skin underneath. Multitype organic thin&#8208;film (opto)electronics can attach to the skin interfaced with the ultrathin hydrogel, realizing seamless integration and long&#8208;term applications.








Abstract
On&#8208;skin electronics that offer revolutionary capabilities in personalized diagnosis, therapeutics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces require seamless integration between the skin and electronics. A common question remains whether an ideal interface can be introduced to directly bridge thin&#8208;film electronics with the soft skin, allowing the skin to breathe freely and the skin&#8208;integrated electronics to function stably. Here, an ever&#8208;thinnest hydrogel is reported that is compliant to the glyphic lines and subtle minutiae on the skin without forming air gaps, produced by a facile cold&#8208;lamination method. The hydrogels exhibit high water&#8208;vapor permeability, allowing nearly unimpeded transepidermal water loss and free breathing of the skin underneath. Hydrogel&#8208;interfaced flexible (opto)electronics without causing skin irritation or accelerated device performance deterioration are demonstrated. The long&#8208;term applicability is recorded for over one week. With combined features of extreme mechanical compliance, high permeability, and biocompatibility, the ultrathin hydrogel interface promotes the general applicability of skin&#8208;integrated electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Microdomain Interlocking Polymer Electrolytes for Advanced All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Battery Chemistries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational concept of high&#8208;entropy microdomain interlocking all&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is designed by introducing newly polymerized multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide. The tailor&#8208;made electrolyte shows advanced mechanical, electrochemical, and thermodynamic performances, stably enabling all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal symmetrical cell cycles over 4000&#160;h.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (ASPEs) with excellent processivity are considered one of the most forward&#8208;looking materials for large&#8208;scale industrialization. However, the contradiction between improving the mechanical strength and accelerating the ionic migration of ASPEs has always been difficult to reconcile.

&lt;p&gt;A rational concept of high-entropy microdomain interlocking all-solid-state polymer electrolytes is designed by introducing newly polymerized multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide. The tailor-made electrolyte shows advanced mechanical, electrochemical, and thermodynamic performances, stably enabling all-solid-state Li metal symmetrical cell cycles over 4000&#160;h.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state polymer electrolytes (ASPEs) with excellent processivity are considered one of the most forward-looking materials for large-scale industrialization. However, the contradiction between improving the mechanical strength and accelerating the ionic migration of ASPEs has always been difficult to reconcile. Herein, a rational concept is raised of high-entropy microdomain interlocking ASPEs (HEMI-ASPEs), inspired by entropic elasticity well-known in polymer and biochemical sciences, by introducing newly designed multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide for the first time. The tailor-made HEMI-ASPEs possess multifunctional polymer chains, which induce themselves to assemble into micro- and nanoscale dynamic interlocking networks with high topological structure entropy. HEMI-ASPEs achieve excellent toughness, considerable ionic conductivity, an appreciable lithium transference number (0.63), and desirable thermal stability (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&amp;gt; 400&#160;&#176;C) for all-solid-state lithium metal batteries. The Li|HEMI-ASPE-Li|Li symmetrical cell shows a stable Li plating/stripping performance over 4000&#160;h, and a LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|HEMI-ASPE-Li|Li full cell exhibits a high capacity retention (&#8776;96%) after 300 cycles.

         <title>Extremely Suppressed Energetic Disorder in a Chemically Doped Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is discovered that the energetic disorder inevitably arising in chemically doped conjugated polymers (CPs) can be suppressed close to the theoretical limit. Even after the incorporation of significant amount of dopant, the distribution of states for intramolecular sites is maintained as narrow because of the high planarity of the CP backbone chains, resulting in excellent charge&#8208;transport properties.








Abstract
Chemical doping can be used to tune the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers (CPs), extending their applications as conducting materials. Unfortunately, chemically doped CP films containing excess dopants exhibit an increase in energetic disorder upon structural alteration, and Coulomb interactions between charge carriers and dopants also affect such disorder. The increase in energetic disorder leads to a broadening of the density of states, which consequently impedes efficient charge transport in chemically doped CPs. However, the molecular origins that are inherently resistant to such incidental increase of energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs have not been sufficiently explored. Here, it is discovered that energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs can be suppressed to a level close to the theoretical limit. Indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDTBT) doped with triethyloxonium hexachloroantimonate (OA) exhibits disorder&#8208;free charge&#8208;transport characteristics and band&#8208;like transport behavior with astonishing carrier mobility as a result of reinforced 1D intramolecular transport. Molecular structure of IDTBT provides a capability to lower the energetic disorder that generally arises from the inclusion of heterogeneous dopants. The results suggest the possibilities of implementing disorder&#8208;free CPs that exhibit excellent charge transport characteristics in the chemically doped state and satisfy a prerequisite for their availability in the industry.

         <title>Chiral Seeded Growth of Gold Nanorods Into Fourfold Twisted Nanoparticles with Plasmonic Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fourfold twisted Au nanorods can be prepared via chiral seeded growth, using cysteine as a chiral inducer. A high dissymmetry factor is obtained and electromagnetic simulations show chiral plasmon modes with largely asymmetric near&#8208;field enhancement. The mechanism involved in chiral growth is related with cysteine&#8208;induced enantioselective development of chiral facets.








Abstract
A robust and reproducible methodology to prepare stable inorganic nanoparticles with chiral morphology may hold the key to the practical utilization of these materials. An optimized chiral growth method to prepare fourfold twisted gold nanorods is described herein, where the amino acid cysteine is used as a dissymmetry inducer. Four tilted ridges are found to develop on the surface of single&#8208;crystal nanorods upon repeated reduction of HAuCl4, in the presence of cysteine as the chiral inducer and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. From detailed electron microscopy analysis of the crystallographic structures, it is proposed that the dissymmetry results from the development of chiral facets in the form of protrusions (tilted ridges) on the initial nanorods, eventually leading to a twisted shape. The role of cysteine is attributed to assisting enantioselective facet evolution, which is supported by density functional theory simulations of the surface energies, modified upon adsorption of the chiral molecule. The development of R&#8208;type and S&#8208;type chiral structures (small facets, terraces, or kinks) would thus be non&#8208;equal, removing the mirror symmetry of the Au NR and in turn resulting in a markedly chiral morphology with high plasmonic optical activity.

         <title>Impact&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels by Harnessing 2D Hierarchical Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired hydrogels with lobster&#8208;underbelly&#8208;like properties are reported. By engineering the hierarchical structures, synthetic hydrogel materials can be enabled with the lobster&#8208;underbelly&#8208;like combinational properties, including high ballistic resistance, toughness, strength, water content, and superior softness.








Abstract
With the strengthening capacity through harnessing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale structural hierarchy, synthetic hydrogels hold tremendous promise as a low&#8208;cost and abundant material for applications demanding unprecedented mechanical robustness. However, integrating high impact resistance and high water content, yet superior softness, in a single hydrogel material still remains a grand challenge. Here, a simple, yet effective, strategy involving bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting and compression&#8208;annealing is reported, leading to a hierarchically structured hydrogel material. Rational engineering of the distinct 2D&#160;lamellar structures, well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline domains and robust interfacial interaction among the lamellae, synergistically contributes to a record&#8208;high ballistic energy absorption capability (i.e., 2.1 kJ m&#8722;1), without sacrificing their high water content (i.e., 85 wt%) and superior softness. Together with its low&#8208;cost and extraordinary energy dissipation capacity, the hydrogel materials present a durable alternative to conventional hydrogel materials for armor&#8208;like protection&#160;circumstances.

         <title>Ultrastrong, Thermally Stable, and Food&#8208;Safe&#160;Seaweed&#8208;Based Structural Material for Tableware</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A food&#8208;safe sargassum cellulose nanofiber (SCNF) is extracted through an efficient and low energy consuming way. Then, by assembling the SCNF into a dense bulk material, a strong structural material can be prepared. It possesses good machinability, which can be processed into tableware with better overall performance than that of commercial tableware, showing great application potential in the tableware field.








Abstract
Widely used disposable plastic tableware is usually buried or directly discharged into the natural environment after using, which poses potential threats to the natural environment and human health. To solve this problem, nondegradable plastic tableware needs to be replaced by tableware composed of biodegradable structural materials with both food safety and the excellent mechanical and thermal properties. Here, a food&#8208;safe sargassum cellulose nanofiber (SCNF) is extracted from common seaweed in an efficient and low energy consuming way under mild reaction conditions. Then, by assembling the SCNF into a dense bulk material, a strong sargassum cellulose nanofiber structural material (SCNSM) with high strength (283&#160;MPa) and high thermal stability (&gt;160&#160;&#176;C) can be prepared. The SCNSM also possesses good machinability, which can be processed into tableware with different shapes, e.g., knives and forks. The overall performance of the SCNSM&#8208;based tableware is better than commercial plastic, wood&#8208;based, and poly(lactic acid) tableware, which shows great application potential in the tableware field.

         <title>Tolerogenic Nanovaccine for Prevention and Treatment of Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tolerogenic nanovaccine is constructed to deliver a self&#8208;antigen and dexamethasone on an abatacept&#8208;modified polydopamine nanoparticle. In experimental&#8208;autoimmune encephalomyelitis model mice, preimmunization of the nanovaccine completely blocks the development of clinical symptoms. Immunization after the self&#8208;antigen injection ameliorates the symptoms of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The concept of tolerogenic nanovaccine can be applied to other autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Herein, a tolerogenic nanovaccine is developed and tested on an animal model of multiple sclerosis. The nanovaccine is constructed to deliver the self&#8208;antigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide, and dexamethasone on an abatacept&#8208;modified polydopamine core nanoparticle (AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG). AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG can target dendritic cells and undergo endocytosis followed by trafficking to lysosomes. AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG blocks the interaction between CD80/CD86 and CD28 in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and T cells, leading to decreased interferon gamma secretion. The subcutaneous administration of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG to mice yields significant biodistribution to lymph nodes and, in experimental&#8208;autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model mice, increases the integrity of the myelin basic sheath and minimizes the infiltration of immune cells. EAE mice are treated with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before or after injection of the autoantigen, MOG. Preimmunization of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before the injection of MOG completely blocks the development of clinical symptoms. Early treatment with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG at three days after injection of MOG also completely blocks the development of symptoms. Notably, treatment of EAE symptom&#8208;developed mice with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG significantly alleviates the symptoms, indicating that the nanovaccine has therapeutic effects. Although AbaLDPN is used for MOG peptide delivery in the EAE model, the concept of AbaLDPN can be widely applied for the prevention and alleviation of other autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Tailoring Poly(Styrene&#8208;co&#8208;maleic anhydride) Networks for All&#8208;Polymer Dielectrics Exhibiting Ultrahigh Energy Density and Charge&#8211;Discharge Efficiency at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh discharged energy densities at elevated temperatures are achieved in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymer dielectrics by tailoring polymer networks at the molecular level. This work provides new insights into the polymer structures that control electrical conduction at high&#8208;temperatures and high&#8208;fields, which will propel the development of scalable capacitive dielectrics for harsh&#8208;environment applications.








Abstract
Polymer film capacitors have been widely used in electronics and electrical power systems due to their advantages of high power densities, fast charge&#8211;discharge speed, and great stability. However, the exponential increase of electrical conduction with temperature and applied electric field substantially degrades the capacitive performance of dielectric polymers at elevated temperatures. Here, the first example of controlling the energy level of charge traps in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymers by tailoring molecular structures that significantly inhibit high&#8208;field high&#8208;temperature conduction loss, which largely differs from current approaches based on the introduction of inorganic fillers, is reported. The polymer network with optimized crosslinking structures exhibits an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 7.02&#8201;J&#8201;cm&#8722;3 with charge/discharge efficiencies of &gt;90% at 150&#160;&#176;C, far outperforming current dielectric polymers and composites. The charge&#8208;trapping effects in different crosslinked structures, as the origins of the marked improvements in the high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, are comprehensively investigated experimentally and confirmed computationally. Moreover, excellent cyclability and self&#8208;healing features are demonstrated in the polymer film capacitors. This work offers a promising pathway of molecular structure design to scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer dielectrics capable of operating under harsh environments.

         <title>Ultrathin Cellulose Nanofiber Assisted Ambient&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Dried, Ultralight, Mechanically Robust, Multifunctional MXene Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the renewable, ultrathin, large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cellulose nanofiber (CNF) as a cross&#8208;linker, the large&#8208;area, ultralight yet robust MXene&#8208;based aerogels with multifunctionality are prepared through the simple, energy&#8208;efficient, and scalable ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;dried approach. The synergies of the MXene, CNF, and abundant pores efficiently improve the EMI shielding performance, dye adsorption, photothermal conversion, and absorption of viscous crude oil.








Abstract
Ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;dried (APD) preparation of transition metal carbide/nitrides (MXene) aerogels is highly desirable yet remains highly challenging. Here, ultrathin, high&#8208;strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight&#8208;ratio, renewable cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are efficiently utilized to assist in the APD preparation of ultralight yet robust, highly conductive, large&#8208;area MXene&#8208;based aerogels via a facile, energy&#8208;efficient, eco&#8208;friendly, and scalable freezing&#8208;exchanging&#8208;drying approach. The strong interactions of large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CNF and MXene as well as the biomimetic nacre&#8208;like microstructure induce high mechanical strength and stability to avoid the structure collapse of aerogels in the APD process. Abundant functional groups of CNFs facilitate the chemical crosslinking of MXene&#8208;based aerogels, significantly improving the hydrophobicity, water resistance, and even oxidation stability. The ultrathin, 1D nature of the CNF renders the minimal MXenes&#8217; interlayered gaps and numerous heterogeneous interfaces, yielding the excellent conductivity and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance of aerogels. The synergies of the MXene, CNF, and abundant pores efficiently improve the EMI shielding performance, photothermal conversion, and absorption of viscous crude oil. This work shows great promises of the APD, multifunctional MXene&#8208;based aerogels in electromagnetic protection or compatibility, thermal therapy, and oil&#8208;water separation applications.

         <title>A Hemispherical Image Sensor Array Fabricated with Organic Photomemory Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors develop a photolithographic process to prepare a hemispherical image sensor array using one organic thin film photomemory transistor per pixel. Their organic thin&#8208;film photomemory transistors can achieve linear photoresponse, along with the best responsivity for similar dark currents among all the reported hemispherical image sensor arrays to date.








Abstract
Hemispherical image sensors simplify lens designs, reduce optical aberrations, and improve image resolution for compact wide&#8208;field&#8208;of&#8208;view cameras. To achieve hemispherical image sensors, organic materials are promising candidates due to the following advantages: tunability of optoelectronic/spectral response and low&#8208;temperature low&#8208;cost processes. Here, a photolithographic process is developed to prepare a hemispherical image sensor array using organic thin film photomemory transistors with a density of 308 pixels per square centimeter. This design includes only one photomemory transistor as a single active pixel, in contrast to the conventional pixel architecture, consisting of select/readout/reset transistors and a photodiode. The organic photomemory transistor, comprising light&#8208;sensitive organic semiconductor and charge&#8208;trapping dielectric, is able to achieve a linear photoresponse (light intensity range, from 1 to 50&#160;W m&#8722;2), along with a responsivity as high as 1.6 A W&#8722;1 (wavelength = 465&#160;nm) for a dark current of 0.24 A m&#8722;2 (drain voltage =&#160;&#8722;1.5&#160;V). These observed values represent the best responsivity for similar dark currents among all the reported hemispherical image sensor arrays to date. A transfer method was&#160;further developed that does not damage organic materials for hemispherical organic photomemory transistor arrays. These developed techniques are scalable and are amenable for other high&#8208;resolution 3D organic semiconductor devices.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Skyrmions and Large Topological Hall Effect in Chromium Telluride Engineered by Self&#8208;Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic skyrmions and large topological Hall effect are demonstrated in chromium telluride. The Curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy in Cr1+xTe2 can be controlled by the self&#8208;intercalate concentration x. In Cr1.53Te2, which has a Curie temperature of 295&#160;K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8776;106&#160;n&#937;&#160;cm are observed.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature magnetic skyrmion materials exhibiting robust topological Hall effect (THE) are crucial for novel nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, such skyrmion&#8208;hosting materials are rare in nature. In this study, a self&#8208;intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Cr1+xTe2 with a layered crystal structure that hosts room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and exhibits large THE is reported. By tuning the self&#8208;intercalate concentration, a monotonic control of Curie temperature from 169 to 333&#160;K and a magnetic anisotropy transition from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane to the in&#8208;plane configuration are achieved. Based on the intercalation engineering, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions are successfully created in Cr1.53Te2 with a Curie temperature of 295&#160;K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Remarkably, a skyrmion&#8208;induced topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8776;106&#160;n&#937; cm is observed at 290&#160;K. Moreover, a sign reversal of THE is also found at low temperatures, which can be ascribed to other topological spin textures having an opposite topological charge to that of the skyrmions. Therefore, chromium telluride can be a new paradigm of the skyrmion material family with promising prospects for future device applications.

         <title>Pt Single Atoms on CrN Nanoparticles Deliver Outstanding Activity and CO Tolerance in the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with novel and small&#8208;sized CrN nanoparticles as potential support is successfully prepared by atomic layer deposition method and exhibit superior activity and CO&#8208;tolerance toward hydrogen oxidation reaction, which is of great significance for the full utilization of low&#8208;cost H2 with impurity CO in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane fuel cells is currently hampered by high cost of commercial Pt catalysts and their susceptibility to poisoning by CO impurities in H2 feed. In this context, the development of CO&#8208;tolerant electrocatalysts with high Pt atom utilization efficiency for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is of critical importance. Herein, Pt single atoms are successfully immobilized on chromium nitride nanoparticles by atomic layer deposition method, denoted as Pt SACs/CrN. Electrochemical tests establish Pt SACs/CrN to be a very efficient HOR catalyst, with a mass activity that is 5.7 times higher than commercial PtRu/C. Strikingly, the excellent performance of Pt SACs/CrN is maintained after introducing 1000&#160;ppm of CO in H2 feed. The excellent CO&#8208;tolerance of Pt SACs/CrN is related to weaker CO adsorption on Pt single atoms. This work provides guidelines for the design and construction of active and CO&#8208;tolerant catalysts for HOR.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Crowding Effect Mimicking Cold&#8208;Resistant Plants to Stabilize the Zinc Anode with Wider Service Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular crowding electrolyte is developed for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Betaine in the electrolyte can regulate the solvation sheath of Zn2+ and adsorb on the Zn anode to guide the dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Zn2+. A high concentration of betaine breaks the H&#8208;bond between H2O, which keeps the Zn anode stable in a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 to 60 &#176;C.








Abstract
Growth of dendrites, the low plating/stripping efficiency of Zn anodes, and the high freezing point of aqueous electrolytes hinder the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a zwitterionic osmolyte&#8208;based molecular crowding electrolyte is presented, by adding betaine (Bet, a by&#8208;product from beet plant) to the aqueous electrolyte, to solve the abovementioned problems. Substantive verification tests, density functional theory calculations, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations consistently reveal that side reactions and growth of Zn dendrites are restrained because Bet can break Zn2+ solvation and regulate oriented 2D Zn2+ deposition. The Bet/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables superior reversibility in a Zn&#8211;Cu half&#8208;cell to achieve a high Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.9% for 900 cycles (&#8776;1800 h), and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping in Zn&#8211;Zn cells for 4235 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a high concentration of Bet lowers the freezing point of the electrolyte to &#8722;92 &#176;C via the molecular&#8208;crowding effect, which ensures the stable operation of the aqueous batteries at &#8722;30 &#176;C. This innovative concept of such a molecular crowding electrolyte will inject new vitality into the development of multifunctional aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>Mesoporous PdN Alloy Nanocubes for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous PdN alloy nanocubes are reported as the highly active and selective electrocatalyst for electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to recyclable ammonia (NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3). The remarkable performance results from combined synergies of mesoporous structure and PdN alloy, which facilitate the adsorption and reactivity of NO3&#8722; and enhance the retention time of electrocatalyzing NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 through an eight&#8208;electron transfer pathway.








Abstract
Developing highly active and selective electrocatalysts for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) is very important for synthesizing recyclable ammonia (NH3) in an economic and environmentally friendly manner. Despite some encouraging progress, their activity and selectivity have been remarkably slower than expected. In this manuscript, mesoporous palladium&#8208;nonmetal (meso&#8208;PdX) nanocubes (NCs) are reported as a new series of highly efficient electrocatalysts for selective nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) electrocatalysis to NH3. The samples feature uniformly alloyed compositions and highly penetrated mesopores with abundant highly active sites and optimized electronic structures. The best meso&#8208;PdN NCs hold an outstanding NITRR activity and selectivity with a remarkable NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.1% and a yield rate of 3760&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1, suppressing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, meso&#8208;PdN NCs are electrocatalytically stable, retaining well the activity and selectivity of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis for more than 20 cycles. Detailed mechanism studies ascribe the superior performance to combined compositional and structural synergies of meso&#8208;PdN NCs that not only promote the adsorption (reactivity) of NO3&#8722; and the desorption of NH3 but also increase the retention time of key intermediates for the deeper NITRR electrocatalysis to NH3 through an eight&#8208;electron pathway.

         <title>Bifacial Dye Membranes: Ultrathin and Free&#8208;Standing although not Being Covalently Bound</title>

The use of template layers for extension of Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett and related techniques to utilize water&#8208;soluble dyes for the synthesis of quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional molecular layers at the water&#8208;air interface is . Bilayers and intercalated layers stable enough to span 25 &#181;m &#215; 25 &#181;m meshes, although not covalently bonded, are demonstrated. Scalable fabrication of these broadly absorbing pi&#8208;conjugated films is realized via a modified roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process.








Abstract
Layers of aligned dyes are key to photo&#8208;driven charge separation in dye sensitized solar cells, but cannot be exploited as rectifying membranes in photocatalysis to separate half&#8208;cells because they are not sufficiently stable. While impressive work on the fabrication of stable noncovalent membranes has been recently demonstrated, these membranes are inherently suffering from non&#8208;uniform orientation of the constituting dyes. To stabilize layers made from uniformly assembled and aligned dyes, they can be covalently cross&#8208;linked via functional groups or via chromophores at the expense of their optical properties. Here stable membranes from established dyes are reported that do not need to be elaborately functionalized nor do their chromophores need to be destroyed. These membranes are free&#8208;standing, although being only non&#8208;covalently linked. To enable uniform dye&#8208;alignment, Langmuir layers made from linear, water&#8208;insoluble dyes are used. That water&#8208;soluble charge transfer dyes adsorb onto and intercalate into the Langmuir layer from the aqueous subphase, thus yielding free&#8208;standing, molecularly thin membranes are demonstrated. The developed bifacial layers consist almost entirely of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units and thus can conduct charges and can be further engineered for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Chiral Seeded Growth of Gold Nanorods Into Fourfold Twisted Nanoparticles with Plasmonic Optical Activity (Adv. Mater. 1/2023)</title>

Chiral Nanoparticles
In article number 2208299, Bing Ni, Sara Bals, Luis M. Liz&#8208;Marz&#225;n, and co&#8208;workers show how plasmonic optical activity in chiral nanoparticles can be tuned and optimized through the chiral morphological details. Twisted gold nanorods evolve through removal of mirror symmetry during dissymmetric seeded growth. Both experimental and theoretical analysis indicates that the underlying mechanism relates to cysteine&#8208;induced enantioselective development of chiral facets. The resulting 4&#8208;fold twisted structure leads to high dissymmetry factors.

Light&#8208;Emitting Metatransistors
A radically new light&#8208;emitting device concept, the perovskite light&#8208;emitting metatransistor, which enables active tunability of electroluminescence intensity, polarization, and spectrum, is demonstrated in article number 2207317 by Cesare Soci and co&#8208;workers. Monolithic integration of dielectric perovskite metasurfaces in the active region of electrically driven devices offers new routes for light control.

Photonic Crystal Papers
In article number 2206764, Dae&#8208;Yoon Kim, Kwang&#8208;Un Jeong, and  co&#8208;workers develop 1D stripe and 2D wavy wrinkled photonic crystal papers to demonstrate consistent reflection of colors regardless of viewing angle. The nanoscale molecular self&#8208;assembly of cholesteric liquid crystal is combined with a microscale corrugated surface.

Charge Storage
Long live the electron! Solar&#8208;energy conversion and long&#8208;term storage for on&#8208;demand electrical and chemical energy are crucial toward decentralized energy distribution. In article number 2207280, Julien Warnan and co&#8208;workers show how a hybrid material from a metal&#8211;organic framework and molecular rhenium complex enables light&#8208;driven accumulation of long&#8208;lived electrons. Full charge storage over several weeks is achieved as well as on&#8208;demand &#8220;dark photocatalysis&#8221; for decoupled hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Smart Eutectic Gallium&#8211;Indium: From Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article gives a comprehensive overview of the unique properties and wide applications of liquid metal eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn). The working principles for the EGaIn&#8208;based devices are illustrated and the developments of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are summarized. The main challenges for the development of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are analyzed and the potential applications of EGaIn in the new fields are prospected.








Abstract
Eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn), a liquid metal with a melting point close to or below room temperature, has attracted extensive attention in recent years due to its excellent properties such as fluidity, high conductivity, thermal conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healing capability, biocompatibility, and recyclability. These features of EGaIn can be adjusted by changing the experimental condition, and various composite materials with extended properties can be further obtained by mixing EGaIn with other materials. In this review, not only the are unique properties of EGaIn introduced, but also the working principles for the EGaIn&#8208;based devices are illustrated and the developments of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are summarized. The applications of EGaIn in various fields, such as flexible electronics (sensors, antennas, electronic circuits), molecular electronics (molecular memory, opto&#8208;electronic switches, or reconfigurable junctions), energy catalysis (heat management, motors, generators, batteries), biomedical science (drug delivery, tumor therapy, bioimaging and neural interfaces) are reviewed. Finally, a critical discussion of the main challenges for the development of EGaIn&#8208;based techniques are discussed, and the potential applications in new fields are prospected.

         <title>Recent Progress in Developing a LiOH&#8208;Based Reversible Nonaqueous Lithium&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous lithium&#8211;air batteries is reviewed, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions during cell operation. Many fundamental questions remain unanswered on the identities of the reaction intermediates, locations of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, and the effect of CO2&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, which all warrant further investigation.








Abstract
The realization of practical nonaqueous lithium&#8211;air batteries (LABs) calls for novel strategies to address their numerous theoretical and technical challenges. LiOH formation/decomposition has recently been proposed as a promising alternative route to cycling LABs via Li2O2. Herein, the progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous LABs is reviewed. Various catalytic systems, either soluble or solid&#8208;state, that can activate a LiOH&#8208;based electrochemistry are compared in detail, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in nonaqueous media.&#160;We&#160;identify the key factors that can switch the cell chemistry between Li2O2&#160;and LiOH and highlight the debate around these routes, as well as rationalize potential causes for these opposing opinions. The identities of the reaction intermediates, activity of redox mediators and additives, location of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, as well as the effect of CO2&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, all play a critical role in altering the relative rates of a series of interconnected reactions and all warrant further investigation.

         <title>Tungsten&#8208;based Nanomaterials in the Biomedical Field: A Bibliometric Analysis of Research Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research progress and prospects of tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials in biomedical field are analyzed by bibliometrics. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year/country/institute/referenced source/research hotspots are recognized. Next, to provide a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in biomedical fields (including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation). Finally, prospects and challenges are discussed.








Abstract
Tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials (TNMs) with diverse nanostructures and unique physicochemical properties have been widely applied in the biomedical field. Although various reviews have described the application of TNMs in specific biomedical fields, there are still no comprehensive studies that summarize and analyze research trends of the field as a whole. To identify and further promote the development of biomedical TNMs, a bibliometric analysis method is used to analyze all relevant literature on this topic. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year, country, institute, referenced source, and research hotspots are recognized. Next, a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in various biomedical fields, including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation, is provided. Finally, the prospects and challenges of TNMs are discussed to provide a new perspective for further promoting their development in biomedical research.

Abstract
Thermoelectric technology provides a promising solution to sustainable energy utilization and scalable power supply. Recently, Ag2Q&#8208;based (Q&#160;=&#160;S, Se, Te) silver chalcogenides have come forth as potential thermoelectric materials that are endowed with complex crystal structures, high carrier mobility coupled with low lattice thermal conductivity, and even exceptional plasticity. This review presents the latest advances in this material family, from binary compounds to ternary and quaternary alloys, covering the understanding of multi&#8208;scale structures and peculiar properties, the optimization of thermoelectric performance, and the rational design of new materials. The &#8220;composition&#8208;phase structure&#8208;thermoelectric/mechanical properties&#8221; correlation is emphasized. Flexible and hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric prototypes based on Ag2Q materials are also demonstrated. Several key problems and challenges are put forward concerning further understanding and optimization of Ag2Q&#8208;based thermoelectric chalcogenides.

         <title>Heterogeneous Structure Omnidirectional Strain Sensor Arrays with Cognitively&#8208;Learned Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mechanically stretchable strain sensors have gained tremendous attentions in bio&#8208;inspired skin sensation systems and artificially intelligent tactile sensors. However, high&#8208;accuracy detection of both strain intensity and direction with simple device/array structures is still insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose an omnidirectional strain perception platform utilizing a stretchable strain sensor array with triangular&#8208;sensor&#8208;assembly (three sensors tilted by 45 &#176;) coupled with machine learning&#8208;based neural network classification algorithm. The strain sensor, which is constructed with strain&#8208;insensitive electrode regions and strain&#8208;sensitive channel region, can minimize the undesirable electrical intrusion from the electrodes by strain, leading to a heterogeneous surface structure for more reliable strain sensing characteristics. The strain sensor exhibited decent sensitivity with gauge factor of &#8764;8, a moderate sensing range (0 &#8764; 35%), and relatively good reliability (3,000 stretching cycles). More importantly, by employing a multiclass&#8208;multioutput behavior&#8208;learned cognition algorithm, the stretchable sensor array with triangular&#8208;sensor&#8208;assembly exhibited highly accurate recognition of both direction and intensity of an arbitrary strain by interpretating the correlated signals from the three&#8208;unit sensors. The omnidirectional strain perception platform with neural network algorithm exhibited overall strain intensity and direction accuracy around 98&#177;2% over a strain range of 0 &#8764; 30% in various surface stimuli environments.

         <title>Printing on Particles: Combining Two&#8208;Photon Nanolithography and Capillary Assembly to Fabricate Multi&#8208;Material Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Additive manufacturing at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale has seen a recent upsurge to suit an increasing demand for more elaborate structures. However, the integration and precise placement of multiple distinct materials at small scales remain a challenge. To this end, we&#160;combine here capillarity&#8208;assisted particle assembly (CAPA) and two&#8208;photon polymerization direct laser writing (2PP&#8208;DLW) to realize a new class of multi&#8208;material microstructures. We&#160;use 2PP&#8208;DLW both to fabricate 3D templates to guide the CAPA of soft&#8208; and hard colloids, and to link well&#8208;defined arrangements of functional micro&#8208;particle arrays produced by CAPA, a process we&#160;term &#8220;printing on particles&#8221;. The printing process is based on automated particle recognition algorithms and enables the user to connect colloids into one&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;dimensional tailored structures, via rigid, soft or responsive polymer links. Once printed and developed, the structures can be easily harvested and re&#8208;dispersed in water. We&#160;report particle clusters and lattices of varying symmetry and composition, and fabricate thermo&#8208;responsive micro&#8208;actuators and magnetically&#8208;driven &#8220;micro&#8208;machines&#8221;, which can efficiently move, capture and release DNA&#8208;coated particles in solution. The flexibility of our&#160;method allows the combination of a wide range of functional materials into complex structures, which we&#160;envisage will boost the realization of new systems and devices for a broad range of fields, including microrobotics, micromanipulation and metamaterials.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;promoted co&#8208;production of dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2 over defective Zn3In2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
One of the most sustainable and promising approaches for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in a low&#8208;cost and environment friendly way is photosynthesis, which, however, suffers from poor carrier utilization and low H2O2 productivity. The addition of proton donors such as isopropanol or ethanol can increase H2O2 production, which, unfortunately, will inevitably elevates the entire cost while wastes the oxidizing power of holes (h+). Herein, the tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) is employed as a distinctive proton donor for the thermodynamically feasible and selective semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction to highly valuable dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs), and meanwhile, to couple with and promote H2O2 generation in one photoredox reaction under the photocatalysis by dual&#8208;functional Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst. To our surprise, the suitably defective Zn3In2S6 offers an excellent and near&#8208;stoichiometric co&#8208;production performance of H2O2 and DHIQs at unprecedentedly high rates of 66.4 and 62.1&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under visible light (&#955; &#8805; 400&#160;nm), respectively, which outperforms all the previous reports as far as we can find even though sacrificial agents were employed in those reports. Additionally, photocatalytic redox reaction mechanism demonstrate that H2O2 can be generated through multiple pathways, highlighting the synergistic effect among ROS (&#183;O2&#8722; and 1O2), h+ and proton donor, which has been ignored in previous studies.

         <title>Nanocomposite Engineering of a High&#8208;capacity Partially Ordered Cathode for Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Understanding the local cation order in the crystal structure and its correlation with electrochemical performances has advanced the development of high&#8208;energy Mn&#8208;rich cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries, notably Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered cathodes (LMR, e.g., Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2) that are considered as nanocomposite layered materials with C2/m Li2MnO3&#8208;type medium&#8208;range order (MRO). Moreover, the Li&#8208;transport rate in high&#8208;capacity Mn&#8208;based disordered rock&#8208;salt (DRX) cathodes (e.g., Li1.2Mn0.4Ti0.4O2) was found to be influenced by the short&#8208;range order (SRO) of cations, underlining the importance of engineering the local cation order in designing high&#8208;energy materials. Herein, we reveal the nanocomposite, heterogeneous nature (like MRO found in LMR) of ultrahigh&#8208;capacity partially ordered cathodes (e.g., Li1.68Mn1.6O3.7F0.3) made of distinct domains of spinel&#8208;, DRX&#8208; and layered&#8208;like phases, contrary to conventional single&#8208;phase DRX cathodes. This multi&#8208;scale understanding of ordering informs engineering the nanocomposite material via Ti doping, altering the intra&#8208;particle characteristics to increase the content of the rock&#8208;salt phase and heterogeneity within a particle. This strategy markedly improves the reversibility of both Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;redox processes to enhance the cycling stability of the partially ordered DRX cathodes (nearly &#8764;30% improvement of capacity retention). Our work sheds light on the importance of nanocomposite engineering to develop ultrahigh&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost Li&#8208;ion cathode materials.

Herein, we reveal the nanocomposite, heterogeneous nature (like MRO found in LMR) of ultrahigh-capacity partially ordered cathodes (e.g., Li&lt;sub&gt;1.68&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3.7&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;) made of distinct domains of spinel-, DRX- and layered-like phases, contrary to conventional single-phase DRX cathodes. This multi-scale understanding of ordering informs engineering the nanocomposite material via Ti doping, altering the intra-particle characteristics to increase the content of the rock-salt phase and heterogeneity within a particle. This strategy markedly improves the reversibility of both Mn- and O-redox processes to enhance the cycling stability of the partially ordered DRX cathodes (nearly &#8764;30% improvement of capacity retention). Our work sheds light on the importance of nanocomposite engineering to develop ultrahigh-performance, low-cost Li-ion cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Y&#8208;type Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptors with Outer Branched Side Chains and Inner Cyclohexane Side Chains for 19.36% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can increase the open circuit voltage (Voc) and thus the photovoltaic performance of the current top performing polymer solar cells (PSCs). One of the viable routes is demonstrated by the successful Y6 derivative of L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains at the outer side. This will introduce steric hindrance and reduce intermolecular aggregation, thus open up the bandgap and rise the LUMO energy level. To take further advantages of the steric hindrance influence on optoelectronic properties of Y6 derivatives, two Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors of BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F and BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4Cl were designed and synthesized by adopting outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains. An outstanding Voc of 0.937&#160;V was achieved in the D18:BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F binary blend devices along with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.52%. With the addition of BTP&#8208;eC9 to extend the absorption spectral coverage, a remarkable PCE of 19.36% was realized finally in the related ternary blend devices, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;junction PSCs at present. Our results illustrated the great potential of cyclohexane side chains in constructing high performance non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and their PSCs.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Fullerene Bisadducts Enable High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four fullerene bisadduct regioisomers on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Benefiting from the favorable molecular packing, energy level alignment, and interfacial interaction, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based devices yield a champion efficiency of 14.58% with a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are attracting intense research interest due to their excellent optoelectric properties and eco&#8208;friendly features. To further improve the device performance, developing new fullerene derivatives as electron transporter layers (ETLs) is highly demanded. Four well&#8208;defined regioisomers (trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e) of diethylmalonate&#8208;C60 bisadduct (DCBA) are isolated and well characterized. The well&#8208;defined molecular structure enables us to investigate the real structure&#8208;dependent effects on photovoltaic performance. It is found that the chemical structures of the regioisomers not only affect their energy levels, but also lead to significant differences in their molecular packings and interfacial contacts. As a result, the devices with trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e as ETLs yield efficiencies of 11.69%, 14.58%, 12.59%, and 10.55%, respectively, which are higher than that of the as&#8208;prepared DCBA&#8208;based (10.28%) device. Notably, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing TPSCs.

         <title>Highly Stretchable and Biocompatible Wrinkled Nanoclay&#8208;Composite Hydrogel With Enhanced Sensing Capability for Precise Detection of Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bioinspired nanoclay&#8208;composite wrinkled hydrogel sensor is developed with excellent mechanical and biocompatible properties and high and reliable sensing capacity due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the wrinkle micropattern and nanoclay&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating crosslinked network. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this hydrogel sensor can accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs, showing promise for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological heart tissue.








Abstract
It is challenging to balance high biocompability with good mechanical&#8211;electrical sensing performance, especially when triggering inflammatory stress response after in vivo implantation. Herein, a bioinspired wrinkle&#8208;reinforced adaptive nanoclay&#8208;interlocked soft strain&#8208;sensor based on a highly stretchable and elastic ionic&#8208;conductive hydrogel is reported. This novel nanoclay&#8208;composite hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile properties and high sensing capacity with steady and reliable sensing performance due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the nanoclay crosslinked and nano&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating network. The incorporation of amphiphilic ions provides the hydrogel with significant protein resistance, reducing its non&#8208;specific adsorption to proteins upon implantation, improving its biosafety as an implanted device, and maintaining the authenticity of the sensing results. Based on the revealed sensing enhanced mechanism based on hierarchical ordered structures as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, this hydrogel sensor is demonstrated to be able to&#160;accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs and may become a novel strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological changes in heart disease.

A simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine is developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV.








Abstract
Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA and high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, a simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (MCz&#8208;VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The resulting polymer CL&#8208;MCz offers high energy ordering and improved electrical conductivity, as well as appropriate energy&#8208;level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL&#8208;MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non&#8208;PTAA&#8208;based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibit competitive shelf&#8208;life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 h, reflecting high promises of CL&#8208;MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross&#8208;linking approach in preparing low&#8208;cost, stable, and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.

Abstract
Highly efficient and stable single&#8208;stack hybrid white organic light&#8208;emitting diode (WOLED) devices are developed using two emissive layers, one with amber colored phosphorescent molecular aggregate emission from the Pd (II) complex, Pd(II) 7&#8208;(3&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;N)phenoxy&#8208;&#954;C)(benzo&#8208;&#954;C)([c]benzo[4,5]imidazo&#8208;&#954;N)[1,2&#8208;a][1,5]naphthyridine, Pd3O8&#8208;Py5, and the other with blue fluorescence emission. An optimized device structure achieved high color stability under various current densities, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5%, a power efficiency of 97.4 Lm W&#8722;1, and an estimated LT95 (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of 50,744 hours at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Compatible Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells promise power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. The conformal deposition of perovskites on industrially feasible textured silicon solar cells allows for both lowered manufacturing costs and a higher matched photocurrent density, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandems using front&#8208;side flat or mildly textured silicon. However, the inferior crystal quality of perovskite films grown on fully&#8208;textured silicon compromises the photovoltaic performance. Here, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is developed to control the crystallization process of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films, which enables improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, and conformal deposition on industrially textured silicon. This strategy allows the fabrication of 28.6%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells (certified 27.9%, 1 cm2). This approach is compatible with the scalable fabrication of tandems on industrially textured silicon, demonstrating an efficiency of 25.1% for an aperture area of 16 cm2. The anion&#8208;engineered additive significantly improves the operating stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, and the encapsulated tandem solar cells retain over 80% of their initial performance following 2,000 hours of operation under full 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Pd&#8208;PdO Nanodomains on Amorphous Ru Metallene Oxide for High&#8208;Performance Multifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing highly efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial for pursuing sustainable energy future but remains a great challenge. Herein, a facile synthetic strategy is used to confine atomically thin Pd&#8208;PdO nanodomains to amorphous Ru metallene oxide (RuO2). The as&#8208;synthesized electrocatalyst (Pd2RuOx&#8208;0.5h) exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward the pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (&#951;10 = 14 mV in 1 m KOH, &#951;10 = 12 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4 and &#951;10 = 22 mV in 1 m PBS), alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (&#951;10 = 225 mV) and overall water splitting (E10 = 1.49 V) with high mass activity and operational stability. Further reduction endows the material (Pd2RuOx&#8208;2h) with a promising alkaline oxygen reduction activity, evidenced by high halfway potential, four&#8208;electron selectivity, and excellent poison tolerance. The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the rational integration of favorable nanostructures, including (1) the atomically thin nanosheet morphology, (2) the coexisting amorphous and defective crystalline phases, and (3) the multi&#8208;component heterostructural features. These structural factors effectively regulate the material's electronic configuration and the adsorption of intermediates at the active sites for favorable reaction energetics.

         <title>Pyridinic Nitrogen Sites Dominated Coordinative Engineering of Subnanometric Pd Clusters for Efficient Alkynes Semi&#8208;hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Supported metal catalysts have played an important role in optimizing selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes for fine chemicals. Thereinto, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, as a type of promising support materials, have attracted extensive attentions. However, due to the general phenomenon of random doping for nitrogen species in the support, it is still a tremendous challenge to finely identify which nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic property of alkynes semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Herein, we report that uniform mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon spheres derived from mesoporous polypyrrole spheres are used as supports to immobilized subnanometric Pd clusters, which provides a particular platform to research the influence of nitrogen configurations on the alkynes semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Comprehensive experimental results and DFT calculation indicate that pyridinic nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic behavior of Pd clusters. The high contents of pyridinic nitrogen sites offer abundant coordination sites to them, which greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining reaction step and makes Pd clusters own high catalytic activity. The electronic effect between pyridinic nitrogen sites and Pd clusters enables Pd to possess a high catalytic selectivity. Additionally, the good mesostructures also promote the fast transport of substrate. Based on the above, catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits high catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation.

         <title>Electron Conductive and Transparent Hydrogels for Recording Brain Neural Signals and Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to break the current bottleneck of implantable materials, which demonstrate a suit of desirable performances including matched modulus, good transparency, and high conductivity. The hydrogel electrode is successfully utilized for optogenetic neuromodulation and simultaneously recording the brain's neural signals, establishing the correlation between brain neural signals and corresponding limb behavior.








Abstract
Recording brain neural signals and optogenetic neuromodulations open&#160;frontiers in decoding brain neural information and neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Conventional implantable probes suffer from modulus mismatch with biological tissues and an irreconcilable tradeoff between transparency and electron conductivity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to address these tradeoffs, which generates conductive and transparent hydrogels with polypyrrole&#8208;decorated microgels as cross&#8208;linkers. The optical transparency of the electrodes can be attributed to the special structures that allow light waves to bypass the microgel particles and minimize their interaction. Demonstrated by probing the hippocampus of rat brains, the biomimetic electrode shows a prolonged capacity for simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and recording of brain neural signals. More importantly, an intriguing brain&#8211;machine interaction is realized, which involves signal input to the brain, brain neural signal generation, and controlling limb behaviors. This breakthrough work represents a significant scientific advancement toward decoding brain neural information and developing neurodegenerative disease therapies.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled Nonreciprocal Self&#8208;Oscillators for Fluidic Transportation and Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;sustained motions are widely reported in stimuli&#8208;responsive material systems. Here, a cilia&#8208;like&#160;soft actuator that can perform self&#8208;sustained oscillation under water, with programmable nonreciprocal strokes, is demonstrated. The self&#8208;oscillators can realize microfluidic pumping, translocation of a micro&#8208;object, and coupling between two non&#8208;equilibrium material pieces through fluidic interaction in an autonomous manner.

Light&#8208;fueled self&#8208;oscillators based on soft actuating materials have triggered novel designs for small&#8208;scale robotic constructs that self&#8208;sustain their motion at non&#8208;equilibrium states and possess bioinspired autonomy and adaptive functions. However, the motions of most self&#8208;oscillators are reciprocal, which hinders their use in sophisticated biomimetic functions such as fluidic transportation. Here, an optically powered soft material strip that can perform nonreciprocal, cilia&#8208;like,&#160;self&#8208;sustained oscillation under water is reported. The actuator is made of planar&#8208;aligned liquid crystal elastomer responding to visible light. Two laser beams from orthogonal directions allow for piecewise control over the strip deformation, enabling two self&#8208;shadowing effects coupled in one single material to yield nonreciprocal strokes. The nonreciprocity, stroke pattern and handedness are connected to the fluidic pumping efficiency, which can be controlled by the excitation conditions. Autonomous microfluidic pumping in clockwise and anticlockwise directions, translocation of a micro&#8208;object by liquid propulsion, and coupling between two oscillating strips through liquid medium interaction are demonstrated. The results offer new concepts for non&#8208;equilibrium soft actuators that can perform bio&#8208;like functions under water.

&lt;p&gt;Non-equilibrium self-sustained motions are widely reported in stimuli-responsive material systems. Here, a cilia-like&#160;soft actuator that can perform self-sustained oscillation under water, with programmable nonreciprocal strokes, is demonstrated. The self-oscillators can realize microfluidic pumping, translocation of a micro-object, and coupling between two non-equilibrium material pieces through fluidic interaction in an autonomous manner.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic antimony bromide hybrid containing semiconducting organic cation is developed for the first time, with which electrically driven red light emitting diodes (LEDs) are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2 cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) are routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide bandgap organic cations. Here, the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;), is reported. By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation is developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Unusual Spectrally Reproducible and High Q&#8208;Factor Random Lasing in Polycrystalline Tin Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly spectrally reproducible multimode random lasing is observed in thin polycrystalline films of tin iodide perovskite that cannot be explained by a strong mode localization. The observed spectral reproducibility can be due to the strong inhomogeneous broadening of photoluminescence spectra measured in tin&#8208;based perovskites on the basis of a comparison with an analogous Pb&#8208;based counterpart.








Abstract
An unusual spectrally reproducible near&#8208;IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q&#8208;factor as high as &#8776;104 with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn&#8208;based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.

         <title>Triplet Fusion Upconversion for Photocuring 3D Printed Particle&#8208;Reinforced Composite Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High energy photons (&#955;&lt;400&#160;nm) are frequently used to initiate free radical polymerizations to form polymer networks, but are only effective for transparent objects. This phenomenon poses a major challenge to additive manufacturing of particle&#8208;reinforced composite networks since deep light penetration of short&#8208;wavelength photons limits the homogeneous modification of physicochemical and mechanical properties. Herein, we employ the unconventional, yet versatile multiexciton process of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) for curing opaque hydrogel composites created by direct&#8208;ink&#8208;write (DIW) 3D printing. TTA&#8208;UC converts low&#8208;energy red light (&#955;max = 660&#160;nm) for deep penetration into higher&#8208;energy blue light to initiate free radical polymerizations within opaque objects. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, hydrogels containing up to 15 wt% TiO2 filler particles and doped with TTA&#8208;UC chromophores were readily cured with red light, while composites without the chromophores and TiO2 loadings as little as 1&#8211;2 wt% remained uncured. Importantly, this method has wide potential to modify the chemical and mechanical properties of complex DIW 3D printed composite polymer networks.

         <title>Unlocking High Capacity and Fast Na+ Diffusion of HxCrS2 by Proton&#8208;Exchange Pretreatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This study presents a new material, &#8220;HxCrS2&#8221; (denotes approximate composition) formed by proton&#8208;exchange of NaCrS2 which has a measured capacity of 728 mAh/g with significant improvements to capacity retention, sustaining over 700 mAh/g during cycling experiments. This is the highest reported capacity for a transition metal sulfide electrode and outperforms the most promising proposed sodium anodes to date. HxCrS2 exhibits a biphasic structure featuring alternating crystalline and amorphous lamella on the scale of a few nanometers. This unique structural motif enables reversible access to Cr redox in the material resulting in higher capacities than seen in the parent structure which features only S redox. Pretreatment by proton&#8208;exchange offers a route to materials such as HxCrS2 which provide fast diffusion and high capacities for sodium&#8208;ion&#160;batteries.

         <title>Observation of Multi&#8208;Directional Energy Transfer in a Hybrid Plasmonic&#8211;Excitonic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast charge and energy exchange across the interface of a hybrid plasmonic heterostructure are explored with momentum resolved electron spectroscopy and diffraction. The results identify a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal, driven by a non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction. Non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy backflow.








Abstract
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light&#8211;matter interaction, and a non&#8208;plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application&#8208;relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal&#8208;to&#8208;substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on WSe2 with time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge&#8208;carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub&#8208;bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;modelling.

         <title>Initiating Reversible Aqueous Copper&#8211;Tellurium Conversion Reaction with High Volumetric Capacity through Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8211;tellurium conversion reaction with high volumetric capacity of 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3 and long discharge plateau are investigated. The thermodynamic&#8211;kinetic asymmetries of the Cu&#8211;Te multiphase&#8208;conversion and oxidation&#8208;failure mechanisms are systematically revealed. The developed precise electrolyte engineering overcomes inherent oxidative distress and extends the cycling life of the battery by about three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Pursuing conversion&#8208;type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode due to its intrinsic attractive electronic conductivity and high theoretical volumetric capacity yet still to be explored. Herein, the kinetically/thermodynamically co&#8208;dominat copper&#8211;tellurium (Cu&#8211;Te) alloying phase&#8208;conversion process and corresponding oxidation failure mechanism of tellurium are investigated using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and comprehensive ex situ characterization techniques. By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive antioxidant addition) is implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu&#8211;Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8776;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 of which lifespan thousand&#8208;fold longer than Cu&#8211;Te conversion using CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte. This work paves a significant avenue for expanding high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type cathodes toward energetic aqueous multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Plant Derived Vesicle&#8208;Like Nanoparticles as Promising Biotherapeutic Tools: Present and Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous, phospholipid bilayer&#8208;enclosed biological particles that regulate cell communication by molecular cargo delivery and surface signaling. EVs are secreted by almost all living cells, including plant cells. Plant&#8208;derived vesicle&#8208;like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) are a generic term referring to vesicle&#8208;like nanostructure particles isolated from plants. Their low immunogenicity and wide availability make PDVLNs safer and more economical to be developed as therapeutic agents and drug carriers. Accumulating evidence indicates the key roles of PDVLNs in regulating interkingdom crosstalk between humans and plants. PDVLNs are capable of entering human body systems and delivering effector molecules to cells that modulate cell signaling pathways. PDVLNs released by or obtained from plants thus have great influences on human health and diseases. In this review, we introduce the biogenesis, detailed preparation methods, various physical and biochemical characteristics, biosafety, and preservation of PDVLNs, and how these characteristics pertain to their biosafety and preservability. We then systematically discuss the potential applications of PDVLNs on different plant and mammalian diseases and PDVLN research standardization.

         <title>Dual/Triple Template&#8208;Induced Evolved Emulsion for Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Carbon Nanoparticles from Concave to Convex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anisotropic mesoporous carbon (AMC) nanoparticles with asymmetric external morphologies, topological internal structure, and superior performance of carbon species are attracting great attention because of owning seductive features differentiating from symmetric nanoparticles. However, a bewildering challenge but crucial desire remains endowing them with flexibly tunable morphology and pore structure. Herein, a dual/triple&#8208;templating evolved emulsion strategy for tunable fabrication of AMC nanoparticles with distinctive defined structure by interface&#8208;energy induced self&#8208;assembly is first reported based on a brand&#8208;new mechanism. It describes the possible formation process of the concave&#8208;cavity structure and allows to manipulate the longitudinal and lateral sizes systematically by adjusting emulsion polarity and sodium oleate (SO) dosage, respectively. Interestingly, the internal pore structure could be rearranged into radial channels and the external morphology could realize structural transformation from concave to convex by innovatively introducing the third template n&#8208;hexanol (HA), which was unprecedented at nanoscale. Remarkably, due to the excellent properties of carbon species and unique structural characteristics, AMC nanoparticles not only demonstrated good biocompatibility, but also exhibited splendid performance in improving the dissolution and release rates of insoluble drug and enhancing the enzyme catalytic efficiency. Generally, this approach provides new inspiration and insights for expanding exquisite anisotropic nanomaterials for many potential applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;wavelength Light&#8208;responsive Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network&#8208;based Microrobots for Reactive Species Scavenging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Light&#8208;driven microrobots with different propulsion mechanisms have attracted great attention in microrobot synthesis and applications. However, current systems rely heavily on precious metals, using a complex synthesis process and limited working wavelength. It is therefore of great interest to fabricate microrobots that can be driven by multi&#8208;wavelength irradiation and with simple components. Here, Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network (MPN)&#8208;based microrobots are synthesized using a sacrificial polystyrene bead template and an extra capping is added to regulate their symmetry. The hollow MPN microrobots with different layers of capping are capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and ultra&#8208;violet (UV) irradiation, without fuel. The velocity of the microrobots under irradiation is altered by the thickness of the asymmetric capping and their motion could be manipulated remotely by switching the NIR or UV irradiation on and off. With light&#8208;driven mobility, the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) scavenging activity of the microrobots is significantly increased. Therefore, this proposed microrobot system provides a synthesis strategy to develop asymmetric light&#8208;navigated microrobots for future medical treatment with tunable structure, multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsive mobility, and great RONS scavenging capacity.

         <title>Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas&#8208;Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent gas diffusion electrodes are developed via the F&#8208;doped SnO2 coating of SiO2 fused fiber felts. These highly porous and conductive substrates are amenable to the disposition of various semiconductors and are employed herein to demonstrate photoelectrode membrane assemblies for solar&#8208;driven H2 production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance and thus limit the development of gas&#8208;phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein, the simple and scalable preparation of F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) coated SiO2 interconnected fiber felt substrates is reported. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the resulting substrates have porosity of 90%, roughness factor of 15.8, and Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100 nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gives sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and loss of incident light of 41% at illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating), and liquid&#8208;phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates is confirmed. Finally, gas phase H2 production is demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.

&lt;p&gt;Transparent gas diffusion electrodes are developed via the F-doped SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coating of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fused fiber felts. These highly porous and conductive substrates are amenable to the disposition of various semiconductors and are employed herein to demonstrate photoelectrode membrane assemblies for solar-driven H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production in a gas-phase flow cell.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance and thus limit the development of gas-phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein, the simple and scalable preparation of F-doped SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (FTO) coated SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interconnected fiber felt substrates is reported. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the resulting substrates have porosity of 90%, roughness factor of 15.8, and Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100 nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gives sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and loss of incident light of 41% at illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating), and liquid-phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates is confirmed. Finally, gas phase H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production is demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1-Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>4D Printed Soft and Stretchable Self&#8208;folding Cuff Electrodes for Small&#8208;nerve Interfacing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Peripheral nerve interfacing (PNI) has a high clinical potential for treating various diseases, like obesity or diabetes. However, currently existing electrodes present challenges to the interfacing procedure, which limits their clinical application, in particular, when targeting small peripheral nerves (&lt; 200&#160;&#956;m). To improve the electrode handling and implantation, we fabricate a nerve interface that can fold itself to a cuff around a small nerve, triggered by the body moisture during insertion. We achieve this folding by printing a bilayer of a flexible polyurethane printing resin and a highly swelling sodium acrylate hydrogel using photopolymerization. When immersed in an aqueous liquid, the hydrogel swells and folds the electrode softly around the nerve. Furthermore, the electrodes are robust, can be stretched (&gt; 20%), and bend to facilitate the implantation due to the use of soft and stretchable printing resins as substrates and a microcracked gold film as conductive layer. We demonstrate the straightforward implantation and extraction of the electrode as well as stimulation and recording capabilities on a small peripheral nerve in vivo. We believe that such simple and robust to use self&#8208;folding electrodes will pave the way for bringing PNI to a broader clinical application.

         <title>Dislocated Bilayer MOF Enables High&#8208;selectivity Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The highly selective photoreduction of CO2 into valuable small&#8208;molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, it remains a challenge because the complex CO2 photoreduction process usually generates multiple possible products and requires a subsequent separation step. In this paper, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer and bilayer porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs are successfully constructed by adjusting the reaction temperature and solvent polarity with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin as the light&#8208;harvesting ligand. The bilayer MOF is a low&#8208;dimensional MOF with a special structure in which the upper and lower layers are arranged in dislocation and are bridged by halogen ions. This bilayer MOF exhibits 100% ultra&#8208;high selectivity for the reduction of CO2 to CO under simulated sunlight without any cocatalyst or photosensitizer and can be recycled at least 3 times. The intrinsic mechanism of this photocatalytic CO2 reduction process is explored through experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work shows that the rational design of the number of layers in 2D MOF structures can tune the stability of these structures and opens a new avenue for the design of highly selective MOF photocatalysts.

         <title>Bioengineering of High Cell Density Tissues with Hierarchical Vascular Networks for Ex Vivo Whole Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is shown to fabricate an in vitro model of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues. The supply of oxygen and nutrition is extremely significant for such tissues. Therefore, a hierarchical vascular network containing capillaries and an artificial channel for perfusion are formed.








Abstract
The development of tissue&#8208;like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and organoids has contributed to progress in regenerative medicine. Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top&#8208;down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

         <title>Optically Excited Lasing in a Cavity&#8208;Based, High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Quantum Dot Electroluminescent Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;function colloidal quantum dot (QD) devices that operate as a high&#8208;current density light emitting diode and an optically excited laser are demonstrated. The device structure has been optimized to reduce optical losses and allow for efficient wave&#8208;guiding within the active QD layer. This demonstration represents an important milestone toward the practical implementation of a colloidal QD laser diode.








Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials can benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunications, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by rapid nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation at high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here&#160;we&#160;resolve some of these challenges and demonstrate optically excited lasing from fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Vertical Electrochemical Transistors for Printed Multi&#8208;Valued Logic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of high&#8208;speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical&#8208;tuning of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox&#8208;based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high&#8208;functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi&#8208;valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual&#8208;channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual&#8208;ion&#8208;penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very&#8208;high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V are demonstrated.

The dual-ion-penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very-high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fast and Durable Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at the Electron&#8208;Deficient Ruthenium&#8211;Ruthenium Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure is designed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively. The Ru domains are electron deficient and show substantially improved inoxidizability. The results highlight the significance of establishing robust and multifunctional heterointerfaces toward fast alkaline HOR and beyond.








Abstract
The slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics under alkaline conditions remain a critical challenge for the practical application of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are designed with abundant active Ru&#8211;RuO2 interface domains as efficient electrocatalysts for the HOR in alkaline media. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains at Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively, endowing the well&#8208;defined Ru(100)/RuO2(200) interface as the preferential region for fast alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. More importantly, the metallic Ru domains become electron deficient due to the strong interaction with RuO2 domains and show substantially improved inoxidizability, which is vital to maintain durable HOR electrocatalytic activity. The optimal Ru/RuO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits impressive alkaline HOR activity with an exchange current density of 8.86&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and decent durability. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure can be attributed to the robust and multifunctional Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces endowed by the unique metal&#8211;metal oxide domains.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the drawbacks of current nanozyme catalytic therapy, a novel Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom/Cer nanoagent with asymmetric electron distribution is developed, which can improve the efficiency of multienzyme&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions through a substrate&#8208;recyclable manner, thereby disrupting the intracellular redox and energy metabolism homeostasis to achieve efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#63743;N5 SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single&#8208;atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#63743;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#63743;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can also generate O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&#63743;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

         <title>Unraveling the Plasma Protein Corona by Ultrasonic Cavitation Augments Active&#8208;Transporting of Liposome in Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transcytosis&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly and protein&#8208;corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size&#8208;transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.








Abstract
Ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis&#8208;targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer&#8208;targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient&#8208;derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis&#8208;targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Portable Nanowire Array Gas Sensor for Dynamic NO2 Monitoring at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative self&#8208;powered room&#8208;temperature nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensor based on an indium phosphide homojunction nanowire array is presented. The proof&#8208;to&#8208;concept sensor structure, with high sensitivity, stability, and selectivity, is demonstrated. It is integrated to&#160;a USB interface for on&#8208;field vehicle&#8208;exhaust measurement. This work promises a new family of self&#8208;powered sensors made of III&#8211;V compound semiconductor nanostructures, for future mega&#8208;scale Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things systems.








Abstract
The fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven an increasing consumer demand for self&#8208;powered gas sensors for real&#8208;time data collection and autonomous responses in industries such as environmental monitoring, workplace safety, smart cities, and personal healthcare. Despite intensive research and rapid progress in the field, most reported self&#8208;powered devices, specifically NO2 sensors for air pollution monitoring, have limited sensitivity, selectivity, and scalability. Here, a novel photovoltaic self&#8208;powered NO2 sensor is demonstrated based on axial p&#8211;i&#8211;n homojunction InP nanowire (NW) arrays, that overcome these limitations. The optimized innovative InP NW array device is designed by numerical simulation for insights into sensing mechanisms and performance enhancement. Without a power source, this InP NW sensor achieves an 84% sensing response to 1&#160;ppm NO2 and records a limit of detection down to the sub&#8208;ppb level, with little dependence on the incident light intensity, even under &lt;5% of 1 sun illumination. Based on this great environmental fidelity, the sensor is integrated into a commercial microchip interface to evaluate its performance in the context of dynamic environmental monitoring of motor vehicle exhaust. The results show that compound semiconductor nanowires can form promising self&#8208;powered sensing platforms suitable for future mega&#8208;scale IoT systems.

         <title>Tuning the Color of Photonic Glass Pigments by Thermal Annealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal annealing of porous bottlebrush block copolymer microparticles enables their coloration to be tuned from blue through to red, without significant loss of structural fidelity. This process is driven by both a temperature&#8208;induced softening of the polymer matrix and the absence of microphase separation. Applying thermal annealing as a post&#8208;process enables the production of thermochromic patterned hydrogels.








Abstract
Thermal or solvent annealing is commonly employed to enhance phase separation and remove defects in block copolymer (BCP) films, leading to well&#8208;resolved nanostructures. Annealing is of particular importance for photonic BCP materials, where large, well&#8208;ordered lamellar domains are required to generate strong reflections at visible wavelengths. However, such strategies have not been considered for porous BCP systems, such as inverse photonic glasses, where the structure (and thus the optical response) is no longer defined solely by the chemical compatibility of the blocks, but by the size and arrangement of voids within the BCP matrix. In this study, a demonstration of how the concept of &#8220;thermal annealing&#8221; can be applied to bottlebrush block copolymer (BBCP) microparticles with a photonic glass architecture is presented, enabling their coloration to be tuned from blue to red. By comparing biocompatible BBCPs with similar composition, but different thermal behavior, it is shown that this process is driven by both a temperature&#8208;induced softening of the BBCP matrix (i.e., polymer mobility) and the absence of microphase separation (enabling diffusion&#8208;induced swelling of the pores). Last, this concept is applied toward the production of a thermochromic patterned hydrogel, exemplifying the potential of such responsive biocompatible photonic&#8208;glass pigments toward smart labeling or anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small clusters in the early growth steps of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors (denoted as preMOFs) with good processibility. Then, the removal of solvents and modulators will trigger the crosslinking of preMOFs and lead to the formation of continuous MOF films.








Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, it is difficult to grow most MOFs spontaneously or process them into films. Here, a convenient strategy is demonstrated for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells Enabled by Optimized Fibril Network Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation morphology featuring more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance can be attained. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.2% (certified value of 17.7%) with excellent mechanical properties in all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells is demonstrated.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF with a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) is introduced to enable highly efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high&#8208;Mw PBDB&#8208;TF as a third component into the PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all&#8208;polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Induced Micrometer&#8208;Scale Charge&#8208;Carrier Diffusion in Organic Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mobility fullerene liquid crystal is introduced into the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) to provide a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport, reduce energetic disorder and trap density via enhancing crystallization, and then realize micrometer&#8208;scale charge&#8208;carrier diffusion, leading to the impressive power conversion efficiencies of 15.23% for OSCs with the thickness approaching 500 nm.








Abstract
The short charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length (LD) (100&#8211;300&#160;nm) in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) impedes the further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially for thick&#8208;film (&gt;400&#160;nm) devices matching with industrial solution processing. Here a facile method is developed to efficiently increase LD and then improve PCEs of OSCs via introducing a fullerene liquid crystal, F1, into the active layer. F1 combines the inherent high electron mobility of fullerene and strong self&#8208;assembly capacity of liquid crystal, providing a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport&#160;and reducing energetic disorder and trap density in BHJ film via enhancing crystallization. Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility (&gt;10&#8722;2 cm&#8722;2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record LD of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuInxGa(1&#8722;x)Se2 (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer&#8208;scale LD, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.

         <title>Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh Reversibility Enabled by the Closest Packing Crystallography for Sustainable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is reported to construct dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates, which epitaxially match the closest packed facets of metals. The closest packed facets of metal anodes aligned horizontally with substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability. Consequently, the metal anodes display high reversibility and outstanding performance.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing annual electricity generated from sustainable and intermittent energy such as wind and solar power requires cost effective and reliable electrochemical energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent metal anodes such as Zn, Al, and Fe, taking advantage of large&#8208;scale production and affordable cost, have emerged as promising candidates. However, the uncontrollable dendrite&#8208;like metal deposition on regular substrate caused by disordered metal crystallization usually leads to premature failure of batteries and even safety concerns when the dendrite bridges the electrodes. Here it is reported that a series of metal anodes (Zn, Co, Al, Ni, and Fe) with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) can achieve dendrite&#8208;free and epitaxial deposition on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates enabled by the closest packing crystallography. Moreover, the closest packed facets are aligned horizontally with the substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability even at an unprecedented current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full cells under a practical anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio of 2.3 show a cycling life span of over 800 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of &gt;&#160;99.9%. The universal approach of regulating metal electrodeposition in this work is expected to boost the development of emerging sustainable energy storage/conversion devices.

&lt;p&gt;The ever-growing annual electricity generated from sustainable and intermittent energy such as wind and solar power requires cost effective and reliable electrochemical energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent metal anodes such as Zn, Al, and Fe, taking advantage of large-scale production and affordable cost, have emerged as promising candidates. However, the uncontrollable dendrite-like metal deposition on regular substrate caused by disordered metal crystallization usually leads to premature failure of batteries and even safety concerns when the dendrite bridges the electrodes. Here it is reported that a series of metal anodes (Zn, Co, Al, Ni, and Fe) with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close-packed, face-centered cubic, and body-centered cubic) can achieve dendrite-free and epitaxial deposition on single-crystal Cu(111) substrates enabled by the closest packing crystallography. Moreover, the closest packed facets are aligned horizontally with the substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability even at an unprecedented current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The full cells under a practical anode-to-cathode capacity ratio of 2.3 show a cycling life span of over 800 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of &amp;gt;&#160;99.9%. The universal approach of regulating metal electrodeposition in this work is expected to boost the development of emerging sustainable energy storage/conversion devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Bandgap Reduction of GaN&#8211;ZnO Solid&#8208;Solution Thin Films Fabricated by Nanolamination of Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition is employed to fabricate (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x homogenous solid&#8208;solution films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 by varying the cycle ratios. The density functional theory calculations using a superlattice model are performed to evaluate and validate the reduction of bandgaps that results in enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to fabricate GaN&#8211;ZnO homogenous solid&#8208;solution thin films because it offers more precise control of the stoichiometry. By varying the ALD cycle ratios of GaN:ZnO from 5:10 to 10:5, the (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 are obtained. The formation of solid solution is explained based on the atomic stacking and preferred orientation of the layers of GaN and ZnO. However, the growth rates of GaN and ZnO during the lamination process are different from those of pure GaN and ZnO films. It is found that GaN grows faster on ZnO, whereas ZnO grows slower on GaN. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using a superlattice model for GaN and ZnO laminated layers fabricated by ALD to understand the difference of density of states (DOS) and evaluate the bandgaps for various atomic configurations in the solid&#8208;solution films. The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid&#8208;solution films.

         <title>Highly Active, Long&#8208;lived Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst Derived from Open&#8208;framework Iridates</title>

Abstract
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction underpins several important electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversions, and this energy&#8208;intensive process relies industrially on iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here we present phase&#8208;selective synthesis of metastable strontium iridates with open&#8208;framework structure and their unexpected transformation into a highly active, ultrastable oxygen evolution nano&#8208;electrocatalyst. This transformation involves two major steps: Sr2+/H+ ion exchange in acid and in situ structural rearrangement under electrocatalysis conditions. Unlike its dense perovskite&#8208;structured polymorphs, the open&#8208;framework iridates have the ability to undergo rapid proton exchange in acid without framework amorphization. And the resulting protonated iridates further reconstruct into ultrasmall, surface&#8208;hydroxylated, (200) crystal plane&#8208;oriented rutile nanocatalyst, instead of common amorphous IrOxHy phase, during acidic oxygen evolution. Such microstructural characteristics are found to benefit both the oxidation of hydroxyls and the formation of O&#8208;O bonds in electrocatalytic cycle. As a result, the open&#8208;framework iridate&#8208;derived nanocatalyst gives a comparable catalytic activity to the most active iridium&#8208;based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts in acid, and retains its catalytic activity for more than 1,000 hours.

         <title>Backbone Engineering Enables Highly Efficient Polymer Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The interface and crystallinity of perovskite films play a decisive role in determining the device performance, which is significantly influenced by the bottom hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, this work reports a simple design strategy of polymer HTMs, which can modulate the wettability and promote the anchoring by introducing pyridine units into the polyarylamine backbone, so as to realize efficient and stable inverted PVSCs. The HTM properties can be effectively modified by varying the linkage sites of pyridine units, and 3,5&#8208;linked PTAA&#8208;P1 particularly demonstrates a more regulated molecular configuration for interacting with perovskites, leading to highly crystalline perovskite films with uniform back contact and reduced defect density. Dopant&#8208;free PTAA&#8208;P1&#8208;based inverted PVSCs have realized remarkable efficiencies of 24.89% (certified value: 24.50%) for small&#8208;area (0.08 cm2) as well as 23.12% for large&#8208;area (1 cm2) devices. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintained over 93% of its initial efficiency after 800 hours of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM 1.5G illumination.

         <title>Bioinspired Self&#8208;Growing Hydrogels by Harnessing the Interfacial Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The production of natural materials is achieved through a bottom&#8208;up approach, in which materials spontaneously grow and adapt to the external environment. Synthetic materials are specifically designed and fabricated as engineered materials; however, they are far away from these natural self&#8208;growing attributes. Thus, design and fabrication of synthetic material systems to replicate the self&#8208;growing characteristics of those natural prototypes (i.e., hairs and nails) remains challenging. Inspired by the self&#8208;growing behaviors of keratin proteins, here we report the fabrication of synthetic hydrogels (i.e., polyacrylamide, PAAm) from the free radical polymerization at the interface between AAm precursor solution and liquid metals (i.e., eutectic gallium&#8208;indium, EGaIn). The newly&#8208;formed hydrogel materials at the EGaIn/AAm precursor interface gradually push the whole hydrogel upwards, enabling the self&#8208;growing of these synthetic hydrogel materials. This work not only endows the fabrication of synthetic materials with unprecedented self&#8208;growing characters, but also broadens the potential applications of self&#8208;growing materials in actuation and soft robotics.

         <title>High&#8208;Q Nanophotonics Over the Full Visible Spectrum Enabled by Hexagonal Boron Nitride Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
All&#8208;dielectric optical metasurfaces with high quality (Q) factors have so far been hampered by the lack of simultaneously lossless and high refractive index (RI) materials over the full visible spectrum. To achieve broad spectral coverage, the use of low&#8208;index materials is, in fact, unavoidable due to the inverse correlation between the band&#8208;gap energy (and therefore the optical losses) and the RI. However, for Mie resonant photonics, smaller RIs are associated with reduced Q factors and mode volume confinement. In this work, we leverage symmetry&#8208;broken quasi bound states in the continuum (qBICs) to efficiently suppress radiation losses from the low&#8208;index (n&#8764;2) van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), realizing metasurfaces with high&#8208;Q resonances over the complete visible spectrum. In particular, we analyze the rational use of low and high RI materials as resonator components and harness our insights to experimentally demonstrate sharp qBIC resonances with Q factors above 300, spanning wavelengths between 400&#160;nm and 1000&#160;nm from a single hBN flake. Moreover, we utilize the enhanced electric near&#8208;fields to demonstrate second harmonic generation (SHG) with enhancement factors above 102. Our results provide a theoretical and experimental framework for the implementation of low RI materials as photonic media for metaoptics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanocrystalline Structures from Freestanding Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The exploration of crystalline nanostructures enhances our understanding of quantum phenomena occurring in spatially confined quantum matter and may lead to functional materials with unforeseen applications. We present a novel route to fabricating nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality. We achieve this by utilizing a self&#8208;assembly process of ultrathin membranes composed of the desired oxide. The thermally induced self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystalline structures is driven by dewetting the oxide membranes once they are lifted off and transferred onto sapphire surfaces. In three successive steps, the process provides nanovoids, nanowires and nanocrystals. Regardless of substrate orientation, the nanostructures are highly anisotropic in shape due to material retraction favouring low&#8208;index crystalline lattice directions of the membranes. The orientation of the nanostructures is provided precisely by the crystal lattice of the transferred membrane. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry, both maintained all the way down to the well&#8208;developed crystalline facets. The demonstrated self&#8208;assembly process holds the potential to improve our understanding of surface diffusion phenomena at the interface of materials, which is important for advancing epitaxial growth technology and paves the way to fabricating crystalline nanostructures by the transfer and self&#8208;assembly of membranes.

         <title>Multifunctional 3D&#8208;Printed Pollen Grain&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Microrobots for On&#8208;Demand Anchoring and Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While a majority of wireless microrobots has shown multi&#8208;responsiveness to implement complex biomedical functions, their functional executions are strongly dependent on the range of stimulus inputs, which curtails their functional diversity. Furthermore, their responsive functions are coupled to each other, which results in the overlap of the task operations. Here, we demonstrate a 3D&#8208;printed multifunctional microrobot inspired by pollen grains with three hydrogel components: FePt nanoparticle&#8208;embedded PETA, pNIPAM, and pNIPAM&#8208;AAc structures. Each of these structures exhibits their respective targeted functions: responding to magnetic fields for torque&#8208;driven surface rolling and steering, exhibiting temperature responsiveness for on&#8208;demand surface attachment (anchoring), and pH&#8208;responsive cargo release. The versatile multifunctional pollen grain&#8208;inspired robots conceptualized here pave the way for various future medical microrobots to improve their projected performance and functional diversity.

         <title>3D Cold&#8208;Trap Environment Printing for Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing technology (3DCEP) is proposed in this work to fabricate a MXene/Zn&#8208;P aerogel anode with highly aligned arrangement. Benefitting from unique high lattice matching and physical confinement effects inside the electrode, it can effectively inhibit the Zn dendrite growth and Zn&#8208;P corrosion in electrolytes. Finally, a 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full cell with long cyclic life can be realized.








Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are always regarded as ideal anode candidates for zinc ion batteries owing to their low cost and ease of processing. However, the intrinsic negative properties of Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes such as easy corrosion and uncontrolled dendrite growth have limited their further applications. Herein, a novel 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed to achieve the MXene and Zn&#8208;P (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P) anode with highly ordered arrangement. Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within the&#160;3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode during Zn plating&#8211;stripping. Consequently, the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;9.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3 DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF), the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1600 cycles. This study brings an inspired universal pathway to rapidly fabricate a reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in a cold environment for micro&#8208;zinc storage systems.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A goal in graphene synthesis is to establish routes for preparing graphene materials from liquids instead of conventional solid or gaseous sources. This work reports the production of graphene materials with tunable composition directly from liquid precursor. A fundamentally new graphene 3D&#8208;printing system is further developed for constructing 3D graphene materials with high structural integrity unachievable by traditional printing strategy.








Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation. The liquid precursor allows for easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantage of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene can be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8776;15 wt.%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes is demonstrated via a selective in situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the high structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects show an electrical conductivity of 4380 S&#160;m&#8722;1 and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components.

         <title>Collective Behaviors of Active Matter Learning from Natural Taxes Across Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological and synthetic agents perform collective taxes based on the local taxis between neighbors and global taxis toward various stimuli. Microorganisms and microrobots perform collective taxes in forms of one&#8208;way transformation, reversible generation, high&#8208;order system, and hierarchical system. Synthetic or biohybrid collectives conduct on&#8208;demand functionalities in environmental and biomedical engineering toward clinical trials owing to the efficiency, robustness, and adaptivity.








Abstract
Taxis orientation is common in microorganisms, and it provides feasible strategies to operate active colloids as small&#8208;scale robots. Collective taxes involve numerous units that collectively perform taxis motion, whereby the collective cooperation between individuals enables the group to perform efficiently, adaptively, and robustly. Hence, analyzing and designing collectives is crucial for developing and advancing microswarm toward practical or clinical applications. In this review, natural taxis behaviors are categorized and synthetic microrobotic collectives are discussed as bio&#8208;inspired realizations, aiming at closing the gap between taxis strategies of living creatures and those of functional active microswarms. As collective behaviors emerge within a group, the global taxis to external stimuli guides the group to conduct overall tasks, whereas the local taxis between individuals induces synchronization and global patterns. By encoding the local orientations and programming the global stimuli, various paradigms can be introduced for coordinating and controlling such collective microrobots, from the viewpoints of fundamental science and practical applications. Therefore, by discussing the key points and difficulties associated with collective taxes of different paradigms, this review potentially offers insights into mimicking natural collective behaviors and constructing intelligent microrobotic systems for on&#8208;demand control and preassigned&#160;tasks.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Control of Nonlinear Light Polarization in MoS2 via PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Thin Films and Free&#8208;Standing Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric domain patterning enabled approach is developed to achieve nanoscale reconfigurable modulation of the amplitude and polarization of SHG light in MoS2 interfaced with PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films and membranes. The light polarization exhibits threefold symmetry at polar domains and twofold symmetry at domain walls. This study opens up new opportunities for developing smart nano&#8208;photonics and optical computing systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinear optical responses, while nanoscale control of the amplitude, polar orientation, and phase of the nonlinear light in TMDCs remains challenging. In this work, by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films and free&#8208;standing PZT membranes, the amplitude and polarization of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal are modulated via ferroelectric domain patterning, which demonstrates that PZT membranes can lead to in&#8208;operando programming of nonlinear light polarization. The interfacial coupling of the MoS2 polar axis with either the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar domains of PZT or the in&#8208;plane polarization of domain walls tailors the SHG light polarization into different patterns with distinct symmetries, which are modeled via nonlinear electromagnetic theory. This study provides a new material platform that enables reconfigurable design of light polarization at the nanoscale, paving the path for developing novel optical information processing, smart light modulators, and integrated photonic circuits.

         <title>Multimorphic Materials: Spatially Tailoring Mechanical Properties via Selective Initiation of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two disparate polymer networks are created simultaneously using non&#8208;interacting chemical reactions and light as a stimulus. Upon turning the light on, the polymers want to phase&#8208;separate like oil and water, but the process is hindered as they interlock. Thus, the degree and location of phase separation, and in&#8208;turn mechanical properties, can be precisely controlled by the &#8220;flick of a switch&#8221;.








Abstract
Access to multimaterial polymers with spatially localized properties and robust interfaces is anticipated to enable new capabilities in soft robotics, such as smooth actuation for advanced medical and manufacturing technologies. Here, orthogonal initiation is used to create interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with spatial control over morphology and mechanical properties. Base catalyzes the formation of a stiff and strong polyurethane, while blue LEDs initiate the formation of a soft and elastic polyacrylate. IPN morphology is controlled by when the LED is turned &#8220;on&#8221;, with large phase separation occurring for short time delays (&#8776;1&#8211;2 min) and a mixed morphology for longer time delays (&gt;5&#160;min), which is supported by dynamic mechanical analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Through tailoring morphology, tensile moduli and fracture toughness can be tuned across &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a simple spring model is used to explain the observed mechanical behavior. Photopatterning produces &#8220;multimorphic&#8221; materials, where morphology is spatially localized with fine precision (&lt;100&#160;&#181;m), while maintaining a uniform chemical composition throughout to mitigate interfacial failure. As a final demonstration, the fabrication of hinges represents a possible use case for multimorphic materials in soft robotics.

         <title>Physical Origin of Negative Differential Resistance in V3O5 and Its Application as a Solid&#8208;State Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique properties of V3O5 and its application as a functional oxide layer in volatile memristive switching devices are reported, with a particular focus on the devlopment of oxide&#8208;based relaxation oscillators as artificial neurons in hardware&#8208;based neural networks. 








Abstract
Oxides that exhibit an insulator&#8211;metal transition can be used to fabricate energy&#8208;efficient relaxation oscillators for use in hardware&#8208;based neural networks but there are very few oxides with transition temperatures above room temperature. Here the structural, electrical, and thermal properties of V3O5 thin films and their application as the functional oxide in metal/oxide/metal relaxation oscillators are reported. The V3O5 devices show electroforming&#8208;free volatile threshold switching and negative differential resistance (NDR) with stable (&lt;3% variation) cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle operation. The physical mechanisms underpinning these characteristics are investigated using a combination of electrical measurements, in situ thermal imaging, and device modeling. This shows that conduction is confined to a narrow filamentary path due to self&#8208;confinement of the current distribution and that the NDR response is initiated at temperatures well below the insulator&#8211;metal transition temperature where it is dominated by the temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity of the insulating phase. Finally, the dynamics of individual and coupled V3O5&#8208;based relaxation oscillators is reported, showing that capacitively coupled devices exhibit rich non&#8208;linear dynamics, including frequency and phase synchronization. These results establish V3O5 as a new functional material for volatile threshold switching and advance the development of robust solid&#8208;state neurons for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Electrocatalysts Enable Efficient CO&#8208;to&#8208;acetate Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Upgrading carbon dioxide/monoxide to multi&#8208;carbon C2+ products using renewable electricity offers one route to more sustainable fuel and chemical production. One of the most appealing products is acetate, the profitable electrosynthesis of which demands catalyst with higher efficiency. Here, we report a coordination polymer (CP) catalyst &#8211; consisting of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds, which enables selective reduction of CO to acetate with a 61% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.59 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cells. We integrated the catalyst in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly and found that this enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190 hours, whilst achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate (3.3 molar) from the cathodic liquid stream, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50 percent toward CO&#8208;to&#8208;acetate conversion, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15 percent at a current density of 250&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Enhanced Moisture Stability of Lithium Rich Anti&#8208;perovskites for Sustainable All Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lithium rich anti&#8208;perovskites (LiRAPs) solid electrolytes have attracted extensive interests due to their advantages of structural tunability, mechanical flexibility and low cost. However, LiRAPs are instinctively hygroscopic and suffer from decomposition in air, which not only diversifies their electrochemical performances in present reports, but also hinders their application in all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, we systematically investigated the origin of the hygroscopicity and also the effect of the hygroscopicity on the electrochemical performances of Li3&#8208;x(OHx)Cl. Li3&#8208;x(OHx)Cl is demonstrated to be unstable in air and prone to decompose into LiOH and LiCl. Nevertheless, with fluorine doping on chlorine sites, the hygroscopicity of LiRAPs was suppressed by weakening the intermolecular hydrogen bond between LiRAPs and H2O, forming a moisture&#8208;resistive Li3&#8208;x(OHx)Cl0.9F0.1. Taking advantage of its low melting point (274 &#176;C), two prototypes of ASSLBs were assembled in the ambient air by means of co&#8208;coating sintering and melt&#8208;infiltration. With LiRAPs as the solder, low&#8208;temperature sintering of the ASSLBs with low interfacial resistance was demonstrated as feasible. The understanding on the hygroscopic behavior of LiRAPs and the integration of the moisture&#8208;resistive LiRAPs with ASSLBs provide an effective way towards the fabrication of the ASSLBs.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Reaction Heterogeneity During Calcination of Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
During solid&#8208;state calcination, with increasing temperature, materials undergo complex phase transitions with heterogeneous solid&#8208;state reactions and mass transport. Precise control of the calcination chemistry is therefore crucial for synthesizing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides (LiNi1&#8722;x&#8722;yCoxMnyO2, NRNCM) as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Although the battery performance depends on the chemical heterogeneity during NRNCM calcination, it has not yet been elucidated. Herein, through synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray, mass spectrometry microscopy, and structural analyses, we reveal that the temperature&#8208;dependent reaction kinetics, the diffusivity of solid&#8208;state lithium sources, and the ambient oxygen control the local chemical compositions of the reaction intermediates within a calcined particle. Additionally, we found that the variations in the reducing power of the transition metals (i.e., Ni, Co, and Mn) determine the local structures at the nanoscale. The investigation of the reaction mechanism via imaging analysis provides valuable information for tuning the calcination chemistry and developing high&#8208;energy/power density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Weakening Li+ De&#8208;solvation Barrier for Cryogenic Li&#8211;S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Li&#8208;S batteries hold promise for pushing cell&#8208;level energy densities beyond 300&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 while operating at low temperatures (LTs, below 0 &#176;C). However, the capacity release of existing Li&#8208;S batteries at LTs is still barely satisfactory. And there is almost no verification of the practicability of Li&#8208;S batteries at LTs in the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. Here, the antecedent molecular dynamics (MDs) combined with density functional theory (DFT) analysis systematically investigated Li+ solvation structure in conventional Li&#8208;S batteries at LTs, which unprecedentedly revealed the positive correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ de&#8208;solvation barrier, indicating that dilute electrolytes can enhance the Li+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and thus improve the capacity performance of cryogenic Li&#8208;S batteries. These insights derived from theoretical simulations invested Li&#8211;S batteries with a 67.34% capacity retention at &#8722;40 &#176;C compared to their room temperature performance. In particular, an Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell using dilute electrolytes with a high sulfur loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8211;2) and lean electrolyte condition (E/S = 4&#160;mL g&#8211;1) was fabricated, which delivered a discharge capacity of about 1000 mAh g&#8211;1 and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 at 0 &#176;C, offering a promising route toward practical high&#8208;energy cryogenic Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Next&#8208;Generation Photonics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has attracted great interest motivated by fascinating properties in the fields of quantum optics, electronics, and optoelectronics. The most recent discoveries of structural, optical, and electrical properties of h&#8208;BN and advancements in emerging photonic and electronic applications are reviewed.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), an insulating 2D layered material, has recently attracted tremendous interest motivated by the extraordinary properties it shows across the fields of optoelectronics, quantum optics, and electronics, being exotic material platforms for various applications. At an early stage of h&#8208;BN research, it is&#160;explored as an ideal substrate and insulating layers for other 2D materials due to its atomically flat surface that is free of dangling bonds and charged impurities, and its high thermal conductivity. Recent discoveries of structural and optical properties of h&#8208;BN have expanded potential applications into emerging electronics and photonics fields. h&#8208;BN shows a very efficient deep&#8208;ultraviolet band&#8208;edge emission despite its indirect&#8208;bandgap nature, as well as stable room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;photon emission over a wide wavelength range, showing a great potential for next&#8208;generation photonics. In addition, h&#8208;BN is extensively being adopted as active media for low&#8208;energy electronics, including nonvolatile resistive switching memory, radio&#8208;frequency devices, and low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant materials for next&#8208;generation electronics.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Thermomechanically Reprogrammable Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magneto&#8208;thermomechanical tool is constructed and demonstrated, which enables a single material system to transform with untethered, reversible, low&#8208;powered reprogrammable deformations, and shape locking via the application of magneto&#8208;thermomechanically triggered prestress on a shape&#8208;memory polymer and structural instability with asymmetric magnetic torque.








Abstract
Future active metamaterials for reconfigurable structural applications require fast, untethered, reversible, and reprogrammable (multimodal) transformability with shape locking. Magnetic control has a superior advantage for fast and remotely controlled deployment; however, a significant drawback is needed to maintain the magnetic force to hold the transformation, limiting its use in structural applications. The shape&#8208;locking property of shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) can resolve this issue. However, the intrinsic irreversibility of SMPs may limit their reconfigurability as active metamaterials. Moreover, to date, reprogrammable methods have required high power with laser and arc welding proving to be energy&#8208;inefficient control methods. In this work, a magneto&#8208;thermomechanical tool is constructed and demonstrated, which enables a single material system to transform with untethered, reversible, low&#8208;powered reprogrammable deformations, and shape locking via the application of magneto&#8208;thermomechanically triggered prestress on the SMP and structural instability with asymmetric magnetic torque. The mutual assistance of two physics concepts&#8212;magnetic control combined with the thermomechanical behavior of SMPs&#160;is demonstrated, without requiring new materials synthesis and high&#8208;power energy for reprogramming. This approach can open a new path of active metamaterials, flexible yet stiff soft robots, multimodal morphing structures, and mechanical computing devices where it can be designed in reversible and reprogrammable ways.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Submillimeter Non&#8208;layered WO2 Nanoplates via a WSe2&#8208;Assisted Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional metal oxides (2DMOs) have stimulated tremendous attention due to their distinct electronic structures and abundant surface chemistry. However, it remains a standing challenge for the synthesis of 2DMOs because of their intrinsic 3D lattice structure and ultrahigh synthesis temperature. Here, a reliable WSe2&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy to grow high&#8208;quality and non&#8208;layered WO2 nanoplates with tunable thickness and lateral dimension is reported. Optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies demonstrate that WO2 nanoplates exhibit a well&#8208;faceted rhombic geometry with a lateral dimension up to the submillimeter level (&#8764;135&#160;&#956;m), which is the largest size of 2D metal oxide single crystals obtained by CVD to date. Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies reveal that the nanoplates are high&#8208;quality single crystals with a monoclinic WO2 crystal structure. Electrical measurements show the nanoplates exhibit metallic behavior with strong anisotropic resistance, outstanding conductivity of 1.1&#215;106 S m&#8722;1, and breakdown current density of 7.1 &#215; 107 A cm&#8722;2. More interestingly, low&#8208;temperature magnetotransport studies demonstrate that the nanoplates show the quantum&#8208;interference&#8208;induced weak localization effect. The developed WSe2&#8208;assisted strategy for the growth of WO2 nanoplates could enrich the library of 2D metal oxide materials and provide a material platform for other property explorations based on 2D WO2.

         <title>Computational Biomaterials: Computational Simulations for Biomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically introduces the achievements on computational biomaterials in biomedical applications, summarizes the computational simulation in revealing internal physicochemical mechanism behind the biomaterial, and offers an outlook on the computatinal biomaterials in nanoenabled amalgamation of chemistry, material science, biology, computational and medicine based on the reports of computational biomaterials&#8208;involved disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapies and other biomimetic biomaterials.








Abstract
With the flourishing development of material simulation methods (quantum chemistry methods, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, phase field, etc.), extensive adoption of computing technologies (high&#8208;throughput, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.), and the invention of high&#8208;performance computing equipment, computational simulation tools have sparked the fundamental mechanism&#8208;level explorations to predict the diverse physicochemical properties and biological effects of biomaterials and investigate their enormous application potential for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Herein, the term &#8220;computational biomaterials&#8221; is proposed and the computational methods currently used to explore the inherent properties of biomaterials, such as optical, magnetic, electronic, and acoustic properties, and the elucidation of corresponding biological behaviors/effects in the biomedical field are summarized/discussed. The theoretical calculation of the physiochemical properties/biological performance of biomaterials applied in disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapeutics, and specific paradigms such as biomimetic biomaterials is discussed. Additionally, the biosafety evaluation applications of theoretical simulations of biomaterials are presented. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of such computational simulations for biomaterials development are clarified. It is anticipated that these simulations would offer various methodologies for facilitating the development and future clinical translations/utilization of versatile biomaterials.

         <title>Engineering the Electronic Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Iron Sites with Boosted Oxygen Bifunctional Activity for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst on a mesoporous NC material by engineering the electronic structures of the metal sites is reported. This catalyst achieves remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction&#160;and oxygen evolution reaction, and demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the optimized electronic structure of Fe1N4O1 moieties contributes to excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries typically require efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts to support oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). However, sluggish kinetics and mass transportation challenges must be addressed if the performance of these catalysts is to be enhanced. Herein, a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprising atomically dispersed iron atoms supported on a mesoporous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Fe SAs/NC) with accessible metal sites and optimized electronic metal&#8211;support interactions is developed. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the engineered electronic structures of the metal active sites can regulate the charge distribution of Fe centers to optimize the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The Fe SAs/NC containing Fe1N4O1 sites achieves remarkable ORR activity over the entire pH range, with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.93, 0.83, and 0.75&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. In addition, it demonstrates a promising low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline conditions. The zinc&#8211;air battery assembled with Fe SAs/NC exhibits superior performance than that of Pt/C+RuO2 counterpart in terms of peak power density, specific capacity, and cycling stability. These findings demonstrate the importance of the electronic structure engineering of metal sites in directing catalytic activity.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enables Exceptional Cyclability in Pouch&#8208;Type Full Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode, which consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with rich oxygen stable {001} planes. The resultant cathode effectively homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain and greatly inhibits the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen loss during de&#8208;/lilthiation, leading to superior electrochemical performances at various rates and operating temperatures.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in situ co&#8208;precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super&#8208;dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C with much better retention at 55 &#176;C and 5 C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. In a pouch&#8208;type full cell, it exhibits exceptionally long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1 C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5 C after 2000 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater to the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.

         <title>Approaching Bulk Mobility in PbSe Colloidal Quantum Dots 3D Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dot superlattices hold promise to combine tunable optical properties with electrical transport comparable to bulk semiconductors. In this work, it is demonstrated that the self&#8208;assembly of highly ordered 3D superlattices made from PbSe colloidal quantum dots achieves record electron mobilities up to 278 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, the highest for these systems and for any self&#8208;assembled solid of quantum&#8208;confined objects.








Abstract
3D superlattices made of colloidal quantum dots are a promising candidate for the next generation of optoelectronic devices as they are expected to exhibit a unique combination of tunable optical properties and coherent electrical transport through minibands. While most of the previous work was&#160;performed on 2D arrays, the control over the formation of these systems is lacking, where limited long&#8208;range order and energetical disorder have so far hindered the potential of these metamaterials, giving rise to disappointing transport properties. Here, it is reported that nanoscale&#8208;level controlled ordering of colloidal quantum dots in 3D and over large areas allows the achievement of outstanding transport properties. The measured electron mobilities are the highest ever reported for a self&#8208;assembled solid of fully quantum&#8208;confined objects. This ultimately demonstrates that optoelectronic metamaterials with highly tunable optical properties (in this case in the short&#8208;wavelength infrared spectral range) and charge mobilities approaching that of bulk semiconductor can be obtained. This finding paves the way toward a new generation of optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Vanadium Catalyst Boosting Reaction Kinetics of Polysulfides in Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;life room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are realized by the development of a single atom vanadium anchored on 3D nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix (3D&#8208;PNCV) as an ideal host in RT Na&#8211;S chemistry. Such host possesses the advantages of the abundant micro/mesoporous, highly reactive V single atom, which can restrain the polysulfides dissolution and in time catalyze the conversion of polysulfide into solid discharged products.








Abstract
The practical application of the room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries is hindered by the insulated sulfur, the severe shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides, and insufficient polysulfide conversion. Herein, on the basis of first principles calculations, single&#8208;atom vanadium anchored on a 3D&#160;nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix (denoted as 3D&#8208;PNCV) is designed and fabricated to enhance sulfur reactivity, and adsorption and catalytic conversion performance of sodium polysulfide. The 3D&#8208;PNCV host with abundant and active V sites, hierarchical porous structure, high electrical conductivity, and strong chemical adsorption/conversion ability of V&#8211;N bonding can immobilize the polysulfides and promote reversibly catalytic conversion of polysulfides toward Na2S. Therefore, as&#8208;fabricated RT Na&#8211;S batteries can achieve a high reversible capacity (445&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 over 800 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and excellent rate capability (224&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1). The electrocatalysis mechanism of sodium polysulfides is further experimentally and theoretically revealed, which provides a new strategy to develop the highly stable RT Na&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The practical application of the room-temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries is hindered by the insulated sulfur, the severe shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides, and insufficient polysulfide conversion. Herein, on the basis of first principles calculations, single-atom vanadium anchored on a 3D&#160;nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix (denoted as 3D-PNCV) is designed and fabricated to enhance sulfur reactivity, and adsorption and catalytic conversion performance of sodium polysulfide. The 3D-PNCV host with abundant and active V sites, hierarchical porous structure, high electrical conductivity, and strong chemical adsorption/conversion ability of V&#8211;N bonding can immobilize the polysulfides and promote reversibly catalytic conversion of polysulfides toward Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. Therefore, as-fabricated RT Na&#8211;S batteries can achieve a high reversible capacity (445&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; over 800 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and excellent rate capability (224&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The electrocatalysis mechanism of sodium polysulfides is further experimentally and theoretically revealed, which provides a new strategy to develop the highly stable RT Na&#8211;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmion Transistor Gated with Voltage&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor is presented using spatially uniform voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic anisotropy. A gate operation can control the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion. Utilizing the gate&#8208;controlled skyrmion motion technique, the authors expect various skyrmion logic devices to be demonstrated in the future.








Abstract
The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally, is introduced. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area can be maintained. The findings will open a new route toward the design and realization of skyrmion&#8208;based spintronic devices in the near future.

         <title>Integrated Solar Panel with Triboelectric Nanogenerator Array for Synergistic Harvesting of Raindrop and Solar Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is regarded as an effective strategy for raindrop energy harvesting, and is a complementary solution with solar cells to achieve all&#8208;weather energy harvesting and sustainable energy supply. However, due to the irregularity of natural rainfalls in the volume, frequency, density, and location, etc., designing high&#8208;efficiency raindrop TENG (R&#8208;TENG) arrays faces great challenges. Here, a highly transparent, large&#8208;area and high&#8208;efficiency R&#8208;TENG array with rational material choice, electrode structure, and array distribution is developed for efficiently harvesting irregular raindrop energy. The problem of electrical signal cancellation among adjacent raindrops can be fully avoided, as viewed from the high&#8208;resolution space&#8208;time analyses of high&#8208;speed camera and electrical signal characteristic. With the rationally&#8208;designed electrode instead of multiple complex electrodes, all charges can be exported by the R&#8208;TENG array in a simulated irregular raindrop scenario. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the R&#8208;TENG possesses higher average power density (40.80&#160;mW m&#8722;2) than that of solar cell (37.03&#160;mW m&#8722;2) in raining condition. Additionally, a self&#8208;powered wireless light intensity monitoring system has been demonstrated for real&#8208;time and all&#8208;day weather monitoring. This work provides useful guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TENG array integrated with solar panel for harvesting irregular raindrop energy and solar energy.

         <title>Scaled&#8208;up Synthesis of Freestanding Molybdenum Disulfide Membranes for Nanopore Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, owing to their extremely low thickness, are ideal materials for nanopores with optimal detection sensitivity and resolution. Among 2D materials, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has gained significant traction as a more suitable nanopore material compared to graphene, which is much more hydrophobic. However, performing experiments using 2D nanopores remains challenging due to the lack of scalable fabrication methods of high&#8208;quality freestanding membranes. Here we report a site&#8208;directed, scaled&#8208;up synthesis of MoS2 freestanding membranes on predrilled nanoapertures on 4&#8208;inch wafer substrates with 75% yields. A unique chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method that introduces sulfur and molybdenum dioxide vapors across both sides of the sub&#8208;100&#160;nm nanoapertures results in the exclusive formation of freestanding membranes that seal the apertures. Nucleation and growth near the nanoaperture edges is followed by nanoaperture decoration with MoS2 which proceeds until a critical flake radius of curvature is achieved, after which fully spanning freestanding membranes form. Intentionally blocking flow of reagents through the apertures inhibits MoS2 nucleation around the nanoapertures, thereby promoting the formation of large&#8208;crystal monolayer MoS2 membranes. The in situ grown membranes along with facile membrane wetting and nanopore formation using dielectric breakdown enabled the recording of dsDNA translocation events at 1&#160;MHz bandwidth, unprecedented for 2D nanopores. The methods presented here are important steps towards the development of many applications requiring single&#8208;layer membranes built at&#8208;scale in high&#8208;throughput 2D nanofluidics and nanopores studies.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered perovskites (LPs) have shown great potential to deliver high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices with long&#8208;term stability. Despite many progresses have been made in film quality and device performance, the LP films are mainly processed in strict conditions and through non&#8208;scalable techniques. Here we introduce the hot&#8208;air&#8208;assisted ambient fabrication technique to prepare LP films for efficient and stable solar cells. The high&#8208;quality LP films with good crystallinity, preferable orientation and desirable morphology are obtained by balancing the crystal nucleation and growth processes. Employing the synchrotron&#8208;based in situ grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction technique, we find hot air induces the solidification of solutes and forms an intermediate at the air&#8208;liquid interface, which transforms into the 3D&#8208;like perovskite, followed by the growth of 2D species towards the substrate. The optimal LP film delivers a device power conversion efficiency of 16.36%, the best value for the LP&#8208;based solar cells prepared by the non&#8208;spin&#8208;coating techniques. The solar cell performance is insensitive to the film processing humidity and the device size is up&#8208;scalable, which promises the real&#8208;world deployment of the LP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Regulating Surface Oxygen Activity by Perovskite Coating Stabilized Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxides have been proposed as promising cathodes to fulfill the range demand of electric vehicles, yet they are still haunted by compromised cyclability and thermal robustness. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art surficial coating is designed to solve the instability via blocking the physical contact between the electrolyte and the highly active Ni4+ ions on the cathode surface, but it falls short in handling the chemo&#8208;physical mobility of the oxidized lattice oxygen ions in the cathode. Herein, a direct regulation strategy is proposed to accommodate the highly active anionic redox within the solid phase. By leveraging the stable oxygen vacancies/interstitials in a lithium and oxygen dual&#8208;ion conductor (layered perovskite La4NiLiO8) coating layer, the reactivity of the surficial lattice oxygen ion is dramatically restrained. As a result, the oxygen release from the lattice is suppressed, as well as the undesired irreversible phase transition and intergranular mechanical cracking. Meanwhile, the introduced dual&#8208;ion conductor can also facilitate lithium ions diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity on the particle surface. This work demonstrates that accommodating the anionic redox chemistry by dual ion conductors is an effective strategy for capacity versus stability juggling of the high&#8208;energy cathodes.

Abstract
Death happening in massive hemorrhage has been involved in military conflicts, traffic accidents, and surgical injuries of various human disasters. Achieving rapid and effective hemostasis to save lives is crucial in urgent massive bleeding situations. Herein, we develop a covalent crosslinked AG&#8208;PEG glue based on extracellular matrix&#8208;like amino&#8208;gelatin (AG) and PEG derivatives. The AG&#8208;PEG glue gelatinizes fast and exhibits firm and indiscriminate close adhesion with various moist tissues upon being dosed. The formed glue establishes an adhesive and robust barrier to seal the arterial, hepatic and cardiac hemorrhagic wounds, enabling it to withstand up to 380&#160;mmHg blood pressure in comparison with normal systolic blood pressure of 60&#8211;180&#160;mmHg. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a pig cardiac penetrating hole with 6&#160;mm diameter is effectively stopped using the glue within 60 seconds. Postoperative indexes of the treated pig gradually recover and the cardiac wounds regrow significantly at 14 days. Possessing on&#8208;demand solubility, self&#8208;gelling and rapid degradability, the AG&#8208;PEG glue may provide a fascinating stop bleeding approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.

         <title>Tunable Photochromism of Spirooxazine in the Solid State: A New Design Strategy Based on the Hypochromic Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As an important organic photo&#8208;functional material, spirooxazine usually does not exhibit photochromism in the solid state since the intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking impedes photoisomerization. Developing photochromic spirooxazine in the solid state is crucial for practical applications but is still full of challenges. Here, we design and synthesize a series of spirooxazine derivatives (SO1&#8208;SO4) with bulky aromatic substituents at the 4&#8208; and 7&#8208;positions of the skeleton, providing a large volume for them to undergo solid&#8208;state photochromism under mild conditions. All compounds SO1&#8208;SO4 exhibit tunable solid photochromism without ground colors, excellent fatigue resistance, and high thermal stability. Notably, it takes only 15 s for SO4 to reach the saturation of absorption intensity, representing the fastest solid&#8208;state photoresponse of spirooxazines to the best of our knowledge. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the intermediate compound SO0 and the products SO1&#8208;SO2 as well as the computational studies suggest that the bulky aromatic groups can lead to a hypochromic effect, allowing for the photochromism of SO in the solid state. The ideal photochromic properties of these spirooxazines open a new avenue for their applications in UV printing, Quick Response (QR) code, and related fields.

         <title>Compute in&#8208;Memory with Non&#8208;Volatile Elements for Neural Networks: A Review from a Co&#8208;Design Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep learning has become ubiquitous, touching daily lives across the globe. Today, traditional computer architectures are stressed to their limits in efficiently executing the growing complexity of data and models. Compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM) can potentially play an important role in developing efficient hardware solutions that reduce data movement from compute&#8208;unit to memory, known as the von Neumann bottleneck. At its heart is a cross&#8208;bar architecture with nodal non&#8208;volatile&#8208;memory elements that performs an analog multiply&#8208;and&#8208;accumulate operation, enabling the matrix&#8208;vector&#8208;multiplications repeatedly used in all neural network workloads. The memory materials can significantly influence final system&#8208;level characteristics and chip performance, including speed, power, and classification accuracy. With an over&#8208;arching co&#8208;design viewpoint, this review assesses the use of cross&#8208;bar based CIM for neural networks, connecting the material properties and the associated design constraints and demands to application, architecture and performance. We consider both digital and analog memory, assess the status for both training and inference, and provide metrics for the collective set of properties existing and new non&#8208;volatile memory materials will need to demonstrate for a successful CIM technology.

         <title>Laser&#8208;induced Hole Coherence and Spatial Self&#8208;phase Modulation in the Anisotropic 3D Weyl Semimetal TaAs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced electron coherence is a fascinating topic in manipulating quantum materials. Recently, it has been shown that laser&#8208;induced electron coherence in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials can produce a third&#8208;order nonlinear optical response spatial self&#8208;phase modulation (SSPM), which has been used to develop a novel all&#8208;optical switching scheme. However, such investigations have mainly focused on electron coherence, whereas laser&#8208;induced hole coherence is rarely explored. Here, we report on the observation of the optical Kerr effect in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Weyl semimetal TaAs flakes. The nonlinear susceptibility (&#967;(3)) is obtained, which exhibits a surprisingly high value (with &#967;one&#8722;layer(3)$\chi _{{\bf{one}} - {\bf{layer}}}^{( 3 )}$ = 9.9&#215;10&#8722;9 e.s.u. or 1.4&#215;10&#8722;16 m2/V2 at 532&#160;nm). This could not be explained by the conventional electron mobility, but could be well understood by the unique high anisotropic hole mobility of TaAs. The Wind Chime Model and &#967;(3)&#8208;carrier mobility correlation adequately explain the results, suggesting the crucial role of laser&#8208;induced non&#8208;local ac hole coherence. Our observations extend the understanding of SSPM from 2D to 3D quantum materials with anisotropic carrier mobility, and from electron coherence to hole coherence.

         <title>A Continuous Gradient Colloidal Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled extraction emulsion process (CrEEP) allows the synthesis of monodisperse latex particles with a continuous size gradient. Subsequent self&#8208;assembly into a photonic glass results in a thin film with a continuous photonic gradient and structural colors ranging over the full visible spectrum. This concept is shown to improve the broadband reflectance of such a mesostructure compared to a non&#8208;gradient&#160;mixture.








Abstract
Colloidal crystals and glasses manipulate light propagation depending on their chemical composition, particle morphology, and mesoscopic structure. This light&#8211;matter interaction has been intensely investigated, but a knowledge gap remains for mesostructures comprising a continuous property gradient of the constituting particles. Here, a general synthetic approach to bottom&#8208;up fabrication of continuous size gradient colloidal ensembles is introduced. First, the technique synthesizes a dispersion with a specifically designed gradual particle size distribution. Second, self&#8208;assembly of this dispersion yields a photonic colloidal glass with a continuous size gradient from top to bottom. Local and bulk characterization methods are used to highlight the significant potential of this mesostructure, resulting in vivid structural colors along, and in superior light scattering across the gradient. The process describes a general pathway to mesoscopic gradients. It can expectedly be transferred to a variety of other particle&#8208;based systems where continuous gradients will provide novel physical insights and&#160;functionalities.

         <title>2D Functionalized Germananes: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis and functionalization of 2D germananes (hydrogen atom and covalent group(s) termination) via topotactical deintercalation offer customizable properties or new functionalities. The fundamentals from synthesis and exfoliation to properties; for optoelectronics, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors, and biomedical applications are reviewed. The review presents the recent progress and challenges, and provides insight for future exploration of these materials.








Abstract
In the realm of 2D layered materials, the monoelemental group 14 Xene, germanene, as the germanium analog of graphene, has emerged as the next prospective candidate. Preceded by silicon, germanium is widely used in the semiconductor industry; thus, germanene is deemed compatible with existing semiconductor technologies. Germanene consists of mixed sp2&#8211;sp3&#8208;hybridized networks in a buckled hexagonal honeycomb structure. Chemical exfoliation of Zintl phases, such as CaGe2, specifically the topotactical deintercalation in acidic media, removes the alkaline earth metal ions Ca2+, giving rise to layered germanane (germanene with the Ge centers covalently saturated with terminal hydrogen atoms). Diverse variants of functionalized germananes (with covalent group(s) termination) can be obtained by varying the topotactical deintercalation precursors, elevating the game with limitless functionalization possibilities for customizable properties or new functionalities. The preparation of Zintl phases to the details of functionalized and modified germananes and their properties, and the additional exfoliation step to achieve mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer germananes, are comprehensively covered. The progress and challenges of 2D functionalized germananes in optoelectronics, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors, and biomedical areas are reviewed. This review provides insight into designing and exploring this class of atomically thin semiconductors in realizing future nanoarchitectonics.

     alt="2D Functionalized Germananes: Synthesis and Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical synthesis and functionalization of 2D germananes (hydrogen atom and covalent group(s) termination) via topotactical deintercalation offer customizable properties or new functionalities. The fundamentals from synthesis and exfoliation to properties; for optoelectronics, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors, and biomedical applications are reviewed. The review presents the recent progress and challenges, and provides insight for future exploration of these materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of 2D layered materials, the monoelemental group 14 Xene, germanene, as the germanium analog of graphene, has emerged as the next prospective candidate. Preceded by silicon, germanium is widely used in the semiconductor industry; thus, germanene is deemed compatible with existing semiconductor technologies. Germanene consists of mixed sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized networks in a buckled hexagonal honeycomb structure. Chemical exfoliation of Zintl phases, such as CaGe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, specifically the topotactical deintercalation in acidic media, removes the alkaline earth metal ions Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, giving rise to layered germanane (germanene with the Ge centers covalently saturated with terminal hydrogen atoms). Diverse variants of functionalized germananes (with covalent group(s) termination) can be obtained by varying the topotactical deintercalation precursors, elevating the game with limitless functionalization possibilities for customizable properties or new functionalities. The preparation of Zintl phases to the details of functionalized and modified germananes and their properties, and the additional exfoliation step to achieve mono- or few-layer germananes, are comprehensively covered. The progress and challenges of 2D functionalized germananes in optoelectronics, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors, and biomedical areas are reviewed. This review provides insight into designing and exploring this class of atomically thin semiconductors in realizing future nanoarchitectonics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photomagnetically Powered Spiky Nanomachines with Thermal Control of Viscosity for Enhanced Cancer Mechanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;pronged driving strategy of nanomachines by simultaneously enhancing magnetic forces and reducing viscous forces is proposed here. The photomagnetically powered nanomachines with spiky surface exhibit a thermally dependent viscosity tunability and coupling&#8208;enhanced magnetic perception, which facilitate mechanical motion in lysosomes for enhanced cancer mechanotherapy. This work shines a light on designing intelligent nanomachine&#8208;based mechanotherapy for clinical translation.








Abstract
Nanomachines with active propulsion have emerged as an intelligent platform for targeted cancer therapy. Achieving an efficient locomotion performance using an external energy conversion is a key requirement in the design of nanomachines. In this study, inspired by diverse spiky structures in nature, a photomagnetically powered nanomachine (PMN) with a spiky surface and thermally dependent viscosity tunability is proposed to facilitate mechanical motion in lysosomes for cancer mechanotherapy. The hybrid nanomachine is integrated with magnetic nanoparticles as the core and covered with gold nanotips. Physical simulations and experimental results prove that the spiky structure endows nanomachines with an obvious photomagnetic coupling effect in the NIR&#8208;II region through the alignment and orienting movement of plasmons on the gold tips. Using a coupling&#8208;enhanced magnetic field, PMNs are efficiently assembled into chain&#8208;like structures to further elevate energy conversion efficiency. Notably, PMNs with the thermal control of viscosity are efficiently propelled under simultaneously applied dual external energy sources in cell lysosomes. Enhanced mechanical destruction of cancer cells via PMNs is confirmed both in vitro and in vivo under photomagnetic treatment. This study provides a new direction for designing integrated nanomachines with active adaptability to physiological environments for cancer treatment.

         <title>Unconventional Spin State Driven Spontaneous Magnetization in a Praseodymium Iron Antimonide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel rare&#8208;earth transition metal antimonide Pr3Fe3Sb7 shows spontaneous magnetization when cooled without external magnetic field, indicating a symmetry breaking without a compensating domain structure. Below 40&#160;K, the Fe and Pr magnetic moments order antiparallel to each other, which gives rise to a magnetization antiparallel to the external field. The spin structure is studied by magnetic measurements, spectroscopy, and diffraction.








Abstract
Consolidating a microscopic understanding of magnetic properties is crucial for a rational design of magnetic materials with tailored characteristics. The interplay of 3d and 4f magnetism in rare&#8208;earth transition metal antimonides is an ideal platform to search for such complex behavior. Here the synthesis, crystal growth, structure, and complex magnetic properties are reported of the new compound Pr3Fe3Sb7 as studied by magnetization and electrical transport measurements in static and pulsed magnetic fields up to 56&#160;T, powder neutron diffraction, and M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy. On cooling without external magnetic field, Pr3Fe3Sb7 shows spontaneous magnetization, indicating a symmetry breaking without a compensating domain structure. The Fe substructure exhibits noncollinear ferromagnetic order below the Curie temperature TC&#160;&#8776;&#160;380 K. Two spin orientations exist, which approximately align along the Fe&#8211;Fe bond directions, one parallel to the ab plane and a second one with the moments canting away from the c axis. The Pr substructure orders below 40&#160;K, leading to a spin&#8208;reorientation transition (SRT) of the iron substructure. In low fields, the Fe and Pr magnetic moments order antiparallel to each other, which gives rise to a magnetization antiparallel to the external field. At 1.4&#160;K, the magnetization approaches saturation above 40&#160;T. The compound exhibits metallic resistivity along the c axis, with a small anomaly at the SRT.

Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of human health can be significantly improved by designing novel electronic skin (E&#8208;skin) platforms that mimic the characteristics and sensitivity of human skin. A high&#8208;quality E&#8208;skin platform that can simultaneously monitor multiple physiological and metabolic biomarkers without introducing skin irritation is an unmet medical need. Conventional E&#8208;skins are either monofunctional or made from elastomeric films that do not include key synergistic features of natural skin, such as multi&#8208;sensing, breathability, and thermal management capabilities in a single patch. Herein, we engineered and demonstrated a biocompatible and biodegradable E&#8208;skin patch based on flexible gelatin methacryloyl aerogel (FGA) for non&#8208;invasive and continuous monitoring of multiple biomarkers of interest. Taking advantage of cryogenic temperature treatment and slow polymerization, we fabricated FGA with a highly interconnected porous structure that displays good flexibility, passive&#8208;cooling capabilities, and ultra&#8208;lightweight properties that make it comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It also provides numerous permeable capillary channels for thermal&#8208;moisture transfer, ensuring its excellent breathability. Therefore, the engineered FGA&#8208;based E&#8208;skin can simultaneously monitor body temperature, hydration, and biopotentials via electrophysiological sensors and detect glucose, lactate, and alcohol levels via electrochemical sensors. This work offers a previously unexplored materials strategy for next&#8208;generation E&#8208;skin platforms with superior practicality.

         <title>Hybridization Engineering of Oxyfluoride Aluminosilicate Glass for Construction of Dual&#8208;Phase Optical Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The construction of transparent ceramics under mild conditions under 1000&#176;C and standard atmospheric pressure has great scientific and technological potential; however, it remains difficult to achieve when conventional ceramic sintering techniques are used. Herein, we present a mild strategy for constructing dual&#8208;phase optical ceramics with high crystallinity (&gt;90%) based on the stepped dual&#8208;phase crystallization of hybridized aluminosilicate glass. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the hybridization of the glass system enables a new balance between the glass&#8208;forming ability and crystallization and can overcome the uncontrolled devitrification phenomenon during the dense crystallization of glass. Transparent hybridized oxide&#8208;fluoride ceramics with fiber geometry and dual&#8208;phase microstructures are also successfully fabricated. The generality of the strategy is confirmed, and transparent ceramics with various chemical compositions and phase combinations are prepared. Additionally, the cross section of the ceramic fibers can be easily tuned into a circle, square, trapezoid, and even a triangle. Furthermore, the practical applications of the optical ceramics for lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging are demonstrated. The findings described here suggest a major step toward expanding the scope of optical ceramics.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Ionizable Iron Nanoadjuvant Augments STING Activation for Personalized Vaccination Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The critical challenge for cancer vaccine&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell immunity is the sustained activation of antigen cross&#8208;presentation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, we first discover that the clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), markedly augment the type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production profile of the STING agonist MSA&#8208;2, and achieve a 16&#8208;fold dosage&#8208;sparing effect in the human STING haplotype. We next co&#8208;assembled acid&#8208;ionizable copolymers with IONPs and MSA&#8208;2 into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen cross&#8208;presentation to elicit a 55&#8208;fold greater frequency of antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The critical challenge for cancer vaccine-induced T-cell immunity is the sustained activation of antigen cross-presentation in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, we first discover that the clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), markedly augment the type-I interferon (IFN-I) production profile of the STING agonist MSA-2, and achieve a 16-fold dosage-sparing effect in the human STING haplotype. We next co-assembled acid-ionizable copolymers with IONPs and MSA-2 into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen cross-presentation to elicit a 55-fold greater frequency of antigen-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16-OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid-ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross-presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multifunctional Interphase Layer Enabling Superior Sodium Metal Battery under Ambient Temperature and &#8208;40 &#176;C</title>

Abstract
Sodium (Na) metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low&#8208;cost is promising to construct high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal battery. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and liquid electrolyte induces tardily ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultra&#8208;low temperature (&#8208;40 &#176;C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na2Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na2Se/V) via an in&#8208;situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na2Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling lifespan of over 1790&#160;h (0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2) in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the artificial Na2Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate the desolvation of solvated Na+ at &#8208;40 &#176;C. The Na@Na2Se/V electrode thus exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at &#8208;40 &#176;C. This work provides an avenue to design artificial heterogeneous interphase layer for superior high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries at ambient and ultra&#8208;low temperatures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium (Na) metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low-cost is promising to construct high-energy-density metal battery. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and liquid electrolyte induces tardily ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultra-low temperature (-40 &#176;C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/V) via an in-situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling lifespan of over 1790&#160;h (0.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in carbonate-based electrolyte.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;hybridized Hydroxides for Energy Conversion and Storage: Interface Chemistry and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As novel and promising materials, carbon&#8208;hybridized hydroxides (CHHs) have been intensively investigated for uses in the energy conversion/storage fields. Nevertheless, the intrinsic structure&#8208;activity relationships between carbon and hydroxides within CHHs are still blurry, which hinders the fine modulation of CHHs in terms of practical applications to some degree. This review aims to figure out the intrinsic role of carbon materials in CHHs with a focus on the interface chemistry and the engineering strategy in&#8208;between two components. The fundamental effects of the carbon materials in enhancing the charge/mass transfer kinetics are firstly analyzed, particularly the extra electron pathways for fast charge transfer and the anchoring sites for boosting the mass transfer. Subsequently, the surface&#8208;guided/confined effects of carbon materials in CHHs to modify the morphology and tailor the hydroxides, and functional heterojunction for regulating the inner electronic structure are decoupled simultaneously. The fabrication methods to efficiently construct a stable yet robust solid&#8208;solid heterointerface are summarized, including oxygen functional groups engrafting, topological defective&#8208;sites construction, and heteroatom incorporation to activate the inert carbon surface. The smart CHHs in some typical energy applications are demonstrated. Additionally, the methodologies that can reveal the hybridization electron configuration between two components are summed up. At last, the perspective and challenges faced by the CHHs for energy&#8208;related applications are outlined and discussed.

         <title>Semi&#8208;transparent, Chiral Organic Photodiodes with Incident Direction&#8208;dependent Selectivity for Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Detection of the circular polarization of light is possible using chiral semiconductors, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Semitransparent chiral photodiodes allow for a simple experiment to investigate the basis of their selectivity: changing the side from which the diode is illuminated. We observe a reversal of circular selectivity in photocurrent generation when changing the direction of illumination on organic, bulk&#8208;heterojunction cells. The change in selectivity can be explained by a space charge limitation on the collection of photocarriers in combination with preferential absorption of one of the circular polarizations of near&#8208;infrared light by the chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor. The space charge limitation is supported by detailed measurements of frequency and intensity dependence of dc and ac photocurrents.

         <title>Trojan Horse Nanocapsule Enabled in Situ Modulation of the Phenotypic Conversion of Th17 Cells to Treg Cells for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Th17/Treg imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of multiple sclerosis (MS), and the transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into Treg cells may contribute to the resolution of inflammation, presenting a therapeutic strategy for MS. To modulate this phenotypic shift in situ, we report a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221;&#8208;like hybrid system, nanocapsule&#8208;coupled Th17 cells, for MS treatment. Following intravenous injection into MS mice, the hybrid system efficiently transmigrated across the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and homed to the inflamed MS niche. Aminooxy&#8208;acetic acid (AOA), a transdifferentiation inducer, was locally released upon the production of ROS and in turn taken up by Th17 cells. We demonstrated that the Trojan horse hybrid system enabled in situ phenotypic transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into anti&#8208;inflammatory Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion led to a domino&#8208;like immune response that was conducive to MS therapy. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway for accurate modulation of the phenotypes of adoptively transferred cells in situ, from proinflammatory to anti&#8208;inflammatory for MS therapy, and may be broadly applicable for patients suffering from other autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained Snapping Drives Autonomous Dancing and Motion in Free&#8208;Standing Wavy Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving self&#8208;sustained snapping and motion remains challenging in autonomous systems. Harnessing wavy ribbon rings for realizing self&#8208;sustained snapping in liquid&#8208;crystal elastomer rings under constant temperature and light are reported. It drives continuous flipping for either periodic self&#8208;dancing in place in symmetric rings or self&#8208;crawling in asymmetric rings on the ground and underwater, as well as self&#8208;escaping from confined spaces.








Abstract
Harnessing snapping, an instability phenomenon observed in nature (e.g., Venus flytraps), for autonomy has attracted growing interest in autonomous soft robots. However, achieving self&#8208;sustained snapping and snapping&#8208;driven autonomous motions in soft robots remains largely unexplored. Here, harnessing bistable, ribbon ring&#8208;like structures for realizing self&#8208;sustained snapping in a library of soft liquid&#8208;crystal elastomer wavy rings under constant thermal and photothermal actuation are reported. The self&#8208;sustained snapping induces continuous ring flipping that drives autonomous dancing or crawling motions on the ground and underwater. The 3D, free&#8208;standing wavy rings employ either a highly symmetric or symmetry&#8208;broken twisted shape with tunable geometric asymmetries. It is found that the former favors periodic self&#8208;dancing motion in place due to isotropic friction, while the latter shows a directional crawling motion along the predefined axis of symmetry during fabrication due to asymmetric friction. It shows that the crawling speed can be tuned by the geometric asymmetries with a peak speed achieved at the highest geometric asymmetry. Lastly, it is shown that the autonomous crawling ring can also adapt its body shape to pass through a confined space that is over 30% narrower than its body size.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Design of the Metal&#8211;Organic Framework DUT&#8208;8(M)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillared layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be tuned along a time axis by adjusting the ratio of nickel and cobalt in the paddle wheel node. Advanced in&#160;situ methodologies reveal switching rates ranging from 1 to 200 s. Individual crystal observations in a microfluidic device reveal prolonged induction time in particular for highly cobalt substituted frameworks.








Abstract
Switchable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) change their structure in time and selectively open their pores adsorbing guest molecules, leading to highly selective separation, pressure amplification, sensing, and actuation applications. The 3D engineering of MOFs has reached a high level of maturity, but spatiotemporal evolution opens a new perspective toward engineering materials in the 4th dimension (time) by t&#8208;axis design, in essence exploiting the deliberate tuning of activation barriers. This work demonstrates the first example in which an explicit temporal engineering of a switchable MOF (DUT&#8208;8, [M1M2(2,6&#8208;ndc)2dabco]n, 2,6&#8208;ndc = 2,6&#8208;naphthalene dicarboxylate, dabco = 1,4diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, M1&#160;= Ni, M2&#160;= Co) is presented. The temporal response is deliberately tuned by variations in cobalt content. A spectrum of advanced analytical methods is presented for analyzing the switching kinetics stimulated by vapor adsorption using in&#160;situ time&#8208;resolved techniques ranging from ensemble adsorption and advanced synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments to individual crystal analysis. A novel analysis technique based on microscopic observation of individual crystals in a microfluidic channel reveals the lowest limit for adsorption switching reported so far. Differences in the spatiotemporal response of crystal ensembles originate from an induction time that varies statistically and widens characteristically with increasing cobalt content reflecting increasing activation barriers.

         <title>Surface Hydrophobization Provides Hygroscopic Supramolecular Plastics Based on Polysaccharides with Damage&#8208;Specific Healability and Room&#8208;Temperature Recyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel surface hydrophobization strategy is offered to achieve damage&#8208;specific healing for hygroscopic supramolecular plastic films. The surface alkylation protects the intact surface of the films from water&#8208;induced plasticization, which eliminates random self&#8208;adhesion. Thus, self&#8208;adhesion exclusively occurs at the damage sites, where fresh surfaces with ionic groups and hydroxyl groups expose, leading to damage&#8208;specific healing.








Abstract
Supramolecular materials with room&#8208;temperature healability and recyclability are highly desired because they can extend materials lifetimes and reduce resources consumption. Most approaches toward healing and recycling rely on the dynamically reversible supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen, ionic and coordinate bonds, which are hygroscopic and vulnerable to water. The general water&#8208;induced plasticization facilitates the healing and reprocessing process but cause a troubling problem of random self&#8208;adhesion. To address this issue, here it is reported that by modifying the hygroscopic surfaces with hydrophobic alkyl chains of dodecyltrimethoxysilane (DTMS), supramolecular plastic films based on commercial raw materials of sodium alginate (SA) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) display extraordinary damage&#8208;specific healability. Owing to the hydrophobic surfaces, random self&#8208;adhesion is eliminated even under humid environment. When damage occurs, the fresh surfaces with ionic groups and hydroxyl groups expose exclusively at the damaged site. Thus, damage&#8208;specific healing can be readily facilitated by water&#8208;induced plasticization. Moreover, the films display excellent room&#8208;temperature recyclability. After multiple times of reprocessing and re&#8208;modifying with DTMS, the rejuvenated films exhibit fatigueless mechanical properties. It is anticipated that this approach to damage&#8208;specific healing and room&#8208;temperature recycling based on surface hydrophobization can be applied to design various of supramolecular plastic polysaccharides materials for building sustainable societies.

         <title>Stabilization and Performance Enhancement Strategies for Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into the recently emerged stability and activity enhancement strategies, widely applicable to the design and development of high&#8208;performance halide perovskite photocatalysts for H2 evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and organic synthesis reactions, is provided.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;powered photocatalytic fuel production and chemical synthesis are widely recognized as viable technological solutions for a sustainable energy future. However, the requirement of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts is a major bottleneck. Halide perovskites, a category of diversified semiconductor materials with suitable energy&#8208;band&#8208;enabled high&#8208;light&#8208;utilization efficiencies, exceptionally long charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;diffusion&#8208;length&#8208;facilitated charge transport, and readily tailorable compositional, structural, and morphological properties, have emerged as a new class of photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, and various organic synthesis reactions. Despite the noticeable progress, the development of high&#8208;performance halide perovskite photocatalysts (HPPs) is still hindered by several key challenges: the strong ionic nature and high hydrolysis tendency induce instability and an unsatisfactory activity due to the need for a coactive component to realize redox processes. Herein, the recently developed advanced strategies to enhance the stability and photocatalytic activity of HPPs are comprehensively reviewed. The widely applicable stability enhancement strategies are first articulated, and the activity improvement strategies for fuel production and chemical synthesis are then explored. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives associated with the application of HPPs in efficient production of fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals are presented, indicating the irreplaceable role of the HPPs in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>Rationally Reconstructed Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Robust Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful fabrication of robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst, through reconstruction of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) framework structure from MOF&#8208;74&#8208;Fe type to MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH type by means of an in situ coordination transformation of the active sites, is reported. The resulting eg&#8211;t2g crystal&#8208;field splitting of the Fe&#8208;3d orbitals in the MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH is so small as to guarantee the efficient OER with lowered overpotential at the rate&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
Reconstructing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOFs) toward a designed framework structure provides breakthrough opportunities to achieve unprecedented oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic performance, but has rarely, if ever, been proposed and investigated yet. Here, the first successful fabrication of a robust OER electrocatalyst by precision reconstruction of an MOF structure is reported, viz., from MOF&#8208;74&#8208;Fe to MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH with different coordination environments at the active sites. Due to the radically reduced eg&#8211;t2g crystal&#8208;field splitting in Fe&#8208;3d and the much suppressed electron&#8208;hopping barriers through the synergistic effects of the O species the efficient OER of in MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH is guaranteed. Benefiting from this desired electronic structure, the designed MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH catalyst exhibits high intrinsic OER activity, including a low overpotential of 215 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, low Tafel slope of 45.4 mV dec&#8722;1 and high turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.44 s&#8722;1 at 300 mV overpotential, over 80 times that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst (0.0177 s&#8722;1).Consistent with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the real&#8208;time kinetic simulation reveals that the conversion from O* to OOH* is the rate&#8208;determining step on the active sites of MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH.

         <title>Thermally Driven Point Defect Transformation in Antimony Selenosulfide Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energetic ions in the hydrothermal deposition lead to deep&#8208;level defects with high formation energy, while post&#8208;annealing with prolonged time enables defect transformation from high to low formation energy. A general principle regarding kinetically and thermodynamically controlled defect formation is uncovered and a guidance for materials synthesis is provided.








Abstract
Thermal treatment of inorganic thin films is a general and necessary step to facilitate crystallization and, in particular, to regulate the formation of point defects. Understanding the dependence of the defect formation mechanism on the annealing process is a critical challenge in terms of designing material synthesis approaches for obtaining desired optoelectronic properties. Herein, a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of defects in emerging Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell films is presented. A top&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar&#8208;cell film is adopted in this study to consolidate this investigation. This study reveals that, under hydrothermal conditions, the as&#8208;deposited Sb2(S,Se)3 film generates defects with a high formation energy, demonstrating kinetically favorable defect formation characteristics. Annealing at elevated temperatures leads to a two&#8208;step defect transformation process: 1) formation of sulfur and selenium vacancy defects, followed by 2) migration of antimony ions to fill the vacancy defects. This process finally results in the generation of cation&#8211;anion antisite defects, which exhibit low formation energy, suggesting a thermodynamically favorable defect formation feature. This study establishes a new strategy for the fundamental investigation of the evolution of deep&#8208;level defects in metal chalcogenide films and provides guidance for designing material synthesis strategies in terms of defect control.

     alt="Thermally Driven Point Defect Transformation in Antimony Selenosulfide Photovoltaic Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energetic ions in the hydrothermal deposition lead to deep-level defects with high formation energy, while post-annealing with prolonged time enables defect transformation from high to low formation energy. A general principle regarding kinetically and thermodynamically controlled defect formation is uncovered and a guidance for materials synthesis is provided.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermal treatment of inorganic thin films is a general and necessary step to facilitate crystallization and, in particular, to regulate the formation of point defects. Understanding the dependence of the defect formation mechanism on the annealing process is a critical challenge in terms of designing material synthesis approaches for obtaining desired optoelectronic properties. Herein, a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of defects in emerging Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar cell films is presented. A top-efficiency Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; solar-cell film is adopted in this study to consolidate this investigation. This study reveals that, under hydrothermal conditions, the as-deposited Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film generates defects with a high formation energy, demonstrating kinetically favorable defect formation characteristics. Annealing at elevated temperatures leads to a two-step defect transformation process: 1) formation of sulfur and selenium vacancy defects, followed by 2) migration of antimony ions to fill the vacancy defects. This process finally results in the generation of cation&#8211;anion antisite defects, which exhibit low formation energy, suggesting a thermodynamically favorable defect formation feature. This study establishes a new strategy for the fundamental investigation of the evolution of deep-level defects in metal chalcogenide films and provides guidance for designing material synthesis strategies in terms of defect control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Molecularly Tailored Photosensitizer with an Efficiency of 13.2% for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) is demonstrated as an efficient &#960;&#8208;linker for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells. Endowed with the hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination, yielding a record power conversion efficiency of 13.2% and an outstanding stability under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h.








Abstract
Photosensitizers yielding superior photocurrents are crucial for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Herein, two molecularly tailored organic sensitizers are presented, coded ZS4 and ZS5, through judiciously employing dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8243;,3&#8243;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) as the &#960;&#8208;linker and hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) or naphthalene&#8208;fused&#8208;quinoxaline (NFQ) as the auxiliary electron&#8208;accepting unit, respectively. Endowed with the HPQ acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination as compared to ZS5. As a result, ZS4&#8208;based DSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% under standard AM1.5G sunlight, with a high short&#8208;circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05&#160;V and a fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. Remarkably, DSCs sensitized with ZS4 exhibit an outstanding stability, retaining 95% of their initial PCE under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h. It is believed that&#160;this is a new record efficiency reported so far for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based DSCs using a single sensitizer. The work highlights the importance of developing molecularly tailored photosensitizers for highly efficient DSCs with copper electrolyte.

         <title>Multicolor and 3D Holography Generated by Inverse&#8208;Designed Single&#8208;Cell Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metasurface&#8208;generated holography has emerged as a promising route for fully reproducing vivid scenes by manipulating the optical properties of light using ultra&#8208;compact devices. However, achieving multiple holographic images using a single metasurface is still difficult due to the capacity limit of a single meta&#8208;atom. In this work, we&#160;present an inverse design method based on gradient&#8208;descent optimization to encode multiple pieces of holographic information into a single metasurface. The proposed method allows the inverse design of single&#8208;cell metasurfaces without the need for complex meta&#8208;atom design strategies, facilitating high&#8208;throughput fabrication using broadband low&#8208;loss materials. By exploiting the proposed design method, both multiplane RGB color and 3D holograms are designed and experimentally demonstrated. We&#160;achieve multiplane RGB color holograms with nine distinct holograms, demonstrating the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art data capacity of a phase&#8208;only metasurface. We&#160;also present the first experimental demonstration of metasurface&#8208;generated 3D holograms with completely independent and distinct images in each plane. The current research findings provide a viable route for practical metasurface&#8208;generated holography by demonstrating the high&#8208;density holography produced by a single metasurface. It is expected to ultimately lead to optical storage, display, and full&#8208;color imaging&#160;applications.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Trimetallic PtFeCo Nanosaws for Practical Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for fuel cell catalysis is one of the most critical and challenging steps for the commercialization of fuel cell technology. Here one&#8208;dimensional trimetallic platinum&#8208;iron&#8208;cobalt nanosaws (Pt3FeCo NSs) with low&#8208;coordination features were designed as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical fuel cell catalysis. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt3FeCo NSs (10.62&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 4.66 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 0.90&#160;V) is more than 25 folds higher than that of the commercial Pt/C, even after 30000 voltage cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the strong inter&#8208;d&#8208;orbital electron transfer minimizes the ORR barrier with even higher selectivity at robust valence states. The volcano correlation between the intrinsic structure featured with low&#8208;coordination Pt&#8208;sites and corresponding electronic activities is discovered, which guarantees high ORR activities. The Pt3FeCo NSs located in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) also achieve very high peak power density (1800.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and competitive specific/mass activities (1.79&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.79 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 0.90 ViR&#8208;free cell voltage) as well as a long&#8208;term lifetime in specific H2&#8208;O2 medium for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), ranking top electrocatalysts reported to date for MEA. This work represents a class of multimetallic Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts for practical fuel cells and beyond.

         <title>Oral Delivery of siRNA Using Fluorinated, Small&#8208;Sized Nanocapsules Toward Anti&#8208;Inflammation Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Oral delivery of siRNA provides a promising paradigm for treating diseases that require regular injections. However, the multiple gastrointestinal and systemic barriers often lead to inefficient oral absorption and low bioavailability of siRNA. Technologies that can overcome these barriers are still lacking, which hurdles the clinical potential of orally delivered siRNA. Herein, small&#8208;sized, fluorinated nanocapsules (F&#8208;NCs) were developed to mediate efficient oral delivery of TNF&#8208;&#945; siRNA for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment. The NCs possessed a disulfide&#8208;cross&#8208;linked shell structure, thus featuring robust stability in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of their small size (&#8764;30 nm) and fluorocarbon&#8208;assisted repelling of mucin adsorption, the best&#8208;performing F3&#8208;NCs showed excellent mucus penetration and intestinal transport capabilities without impairing the intestinal tight junction, conferring the oral bioavailability of 20.4% in relative to i.v. injection. The disulfide cross&#8208;linker could be cleaved inside target cells, causing NCs dissociation and siRNA release to potentiate the TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing efficiency. In murine models of acute and chronic inflammation, orally delivered F3&#8208;NCs provoked efficient TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing and pronounced anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacies. This study therefore provides a transformative strategy for oral siRNA delivery, and would render promising utilities for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment.

         <title>Reconfigurable Electrical Networks within A Conductive Hydrogel Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Soft materials that exhibit the compliance, programmability, and reconfigurability could have transformative impact as electronic skin for applications in wearable electronics/soft robotics. There has been significant progress in soft conductive materials; however, achieving electrically&#8208;controlled and reversible changes in conductivity and circuit connectivity remains challenging. To overcome this limitation, we present soft material architecture with reconfigurable conductive networks of silver flakes embedded within a hydrogel matrix. The conductive networks can be reversibly created/disconnected through various stimuli, including current, humidity, or temperature. Such stimuli affect electrical connectivity of the hydrogel by controlling its water content, which can be modulated by evaporation under ambient conditions (passive dehydration), evaporation through electrical Joule heating (active dehydration), or absorption of additional water (rehydration). Through passive dehydration, the volume fraction of conductive fillers increases as water evaporates, enhancing electrical conductivity. Applying electrical power across the composite accelerates water evaporation and forms conductive pathways faster with greater connectivity than composites subjected to passive dehydration. Alternatively, the percolating networks of silver flakes can be disrupted when the hydrogel absorbs water. The resulting change in electrical conductivity is reversible and repeatable, endowing the composite with on&#8208;demand reconfigurable conductivity. To highlight this material's unique properties, we show that conductive traces can be reconfigured after severe damage and revert to lower conductivity after rehydration. Additionally, we demonstrate a quadruped robot that can respond to stimuli by changing direction following exposure to excess water, thereby achieving reprogrammable locomotion behaviors.

         <title>Chemical Tuning Meets 2D Molecular Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical tuning including lithiation control and solvent coordination can significantly modify magnetic interaction in molecule&#8208;based magnets for high&#8208;temperature magnetic order and large coercivity. Through those technical routes and processing, 2D molecule&#8208;based magnets with an applicable magnetic performance of ferrites are demonstrated. The considerable energy product evidences its worth for obtaining practical molecule&#8208;based magnets.








Abstract
2D magnets provoke a surge of interest in large anisotropy in reduced dimensions and are promising for next&#8208;generation information technology where dynamic magnetic tuning is essential. Until recently, the crucial metal&#8208;organic magnet Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF with considerable high coercivity and high&#8208;temperature magnetic order opens up a new platform to control magnetism in metal&#8208;organic materials at room temperature. Here, an in&#8211;situ chemical tuning route is reported to realize the controllable transformation of low&#8208;temperature magnetic order into room&#8208;temperature hard magnetism in Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF. The chemical tuning via electrochemical lithiation and solvation/desolvation exhibits continuously variable magnetic features from cryogenic magnetism to the room&#8208;temperature optimum performance of coercivity (Hc) of 8500&#160;Oe and energy product of 0.6 MGOe. Such chemically flexible tunability of room&#8208;temperature magnetism is ascribed to the different degrees of lithiation and solvation that modify the stoichiometry and Cr&#8208;pyrazine coordination framework. Furthermore, the additively manufactured hybrid magnets show air stability and electromagnetic induction, providing potential applications. The findings here suggest chemical tuning as a universal approach to control the anisotropy and magnetism of 2D hybrid magnets at room temperature, promising for data storage, magnetic refrigeration, and spintronics.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Nano&#8208;Optogenetic Activation of Cancer Immunotherapy via Engineered Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is designed to specifically release encoded flagellin B (flaB) in response to near&#8208;infrared light for tumor&#8208;specific nano&#8208;optogenetic cancer immunotherapy. Upon 808&#160;nm irradiation, flaB activates the immune response via binding to Toll&#8208;like receptor 5 in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to induce significant tumor regression in different tumor models.








Abstract
Certain anaerobic microbes with the capability to colonize the tumor microenvironment tend to express the heterologous gene in a sustainable manner, which will inevitably compromise the therapeutic efficacy and induce off&#8208;tumor toxicity in vivo. To improve the therapeutic precision and controllability of bacteria&#8208;based therapeutics, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), engineered to sense blue light and release the encoded flagellin B (flaB), is conjugated with lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) nano&#8208;optogenetic cancer immunotherapy. Upon 808&#160;nm photoirradiation, UCNPs emit at the blue region to photoactivate the EcN for secretion of flaB, which subsequently binds to Toll&#8208;like receptor 5 expressed on the membrane of macrophages for activating immune response via MyD88&#8208;dependent signal pathway. Such synergism leads to significant tumor regression in different tumor models and metastatic tumors with negligible side effects. These studies based on the NIR nano&#8208;optogenetic platform highlight the rational of leveraging the optogenetic tools combined with natural propensity of certain bacteria for cancer immunotherapy.

A series of lanthanide(III)&#8208;Cu4I4 heterometallic organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs)&#8208;based X&#8208;ray scintillators is developed by rationally assembling X&#8208;ray absorption centers ([Cu4I4] clusters) and luminescent chromophores (Ln(III) ions) in a specific manner. High&#8208;efficient excitation energy transfer from the cluster&#8208;based antenna to the Ln(III) ions enables Ln&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs and their flexible film with excellent scintillation performance and high spatial resolution of 12.6&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Scintillator&#8208;based X&#8208;ray imaging has attracted great attention from industrial quality inspection and security to medical diagnostics. Herein, a series of lanthanide(III)&#8208;Cu4I4 heterometallic organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs)&#8208;based X&#8208;ray scintillators are developed by rationally assembling X&#8208;ray absorption centers ([Cu4I4] clusters) and luminescent chromophores (Ln(III) ions) in a specific manner. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, the heavy inorganic units ([Cu4I4] clusters) absorb the X&#8208;ray energy to populate triplet excitons via halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (XLCT) combined with the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT) state (defined as the X/MLCT state), and then the 3X/MLCT excited state sensitizes Tb3+ for intense X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence via excitation energy transfer. The obtained Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOF scintillators exhibit high resistance to humidity and radiation, excellent linear response to X&#8208;ray dose rate, and high X&#8208;ray relative light yield of 29 379&#160;&#177;&#160;3000 photons MeV&#8722;1. The relative light yield of Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs is &#8776;3 times higher than that of the control Tb(III) complex. X&#8208;ray imaging tests show that the Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs&#8208;based flexible scintillator film exhibits a high spatial resolution of 12.6&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1. These findings not only provide a promising design strategy to develop lanthanide&#8208;MOF&#8208;based scintillators with excellent scintillation performance, but also exhibit high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging for biological specimens and electronic chips.

         <title>Dilute Alloying to Implant Activation Centers in Nitride Electrocatalysts for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dilute alloying implants &#8220;activating&#8221; centers in nitride alloy electrocatalysts to boost lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Dilute Co dopants activate the surrounding N and Ti atoms to construct multiatom active domains for efficient bidirectional catalysis of S redox reactions. The corresponding dilute nitride alloy improves the reaction kinetics and electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Dilute alloying is an effective strategy to tune properties of solid catalysts but is rarely leveraged in complex reactions beyond small molecule conversion. In this work, dilute dopants are demonstrated to serve as activating centers to construct multiatom catalytic domains in metal nitride electrocatalysts for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, of which the sulfur cathode suffers from sluggish and complex conversion reactions. With titanium nitride (TiN) as a model system, the dilute cobalt alloying is shown to greatly improve the reaction kinetics while inducing negligible catalyst reconstruction. Compared to the pristine TiN, the dilute nitride alloy catalyst enables onefold increase in the high rate (2.0 C) capacities of Li&#8211;S batteries, as well as an impressively low cyclic decay rate of 0.17% at a sulfur loading of 4.0 mgS cm&#8722;2. This work opens up new opportunities toward the rational design of Li&#8211;S electrocatalysts by dilute alloying and also enlightens the understandings of complex domain&#8208;catalyzed reactions in energy applications.

Dilute Co dopants activate the surrounding N and Ti atoms to construct multiatom active domains for efficient bidirectional catalysis of S redox reactions. The corresponding dilute nitride alloy improves the reaction kinetics and electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dilute alloying is an effective strategy to tune properties of solid catalysts but is rarely leveraged in complex reactions beyond small molecule conversion. In this work, dilute dopants are demonstrated to serve as activating centers to construct multiatom catalytic domains in metal nitride electrocatalysts for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, of which the sulfur cathode suffers from sluggish and complex conversion reactions. With titanium nitride (TiN) as a model system, the dilute cobalt alloying is shown to greatly improve the reaction kinetics while inducing negligible catalyst reconstruction. Compared to the pristine TiN, the dilute nitride alloy catalyst enables onefold increase in the high rate (2.0 C) capacities of Li&#8211;S batteries, as well as an impressively low cyclic decay rate of 0.17% at a sulfur loading of 4.0 mg&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work opens up new opportunities toward the rational design of Li&#8211;S electrocatalysts by dilute alloying and also enlightens the understandings of complex domain-catalyzed reactions in energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuned Ultramicroporous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework in Mixed&#8208;Matrix Membrane: Pore&#8208;Tailoring Optimization for C2H2/C2H4 Separation</title>

Abstract
Effective separation of ethyne from ethyne/ethylene (C2H2/C2H4) mixtures is a challenging and crucial industrial process. Herein, an ultramicroporous MOF platform, Cd(dicarboxylate)2(ditriazole), with triangular channels is proposed for high&#8208;efficiency separation of C2H2 from C2H4. The targeted structures are constructed via a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy by selecting different&#8208;sized ligands, allowing for tunable pore sizes and volumes. The pore properties can be further optimized by additional modification via pore environment tailoring. This concept leads to the successful synthesis of three ultramicroporous Cd&#8208;MOFs (JLU&#8208;MOF87&#8208;89). As intended, C2H2 uptake and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity gradually increase with progressively optimizing the pore structure by adjusting ligand length and substituents. JLU&#8208;MOF89, functionalized with methyl groups, features the most optimal pore chemistry, and shows selective recognition of C2H2 over C2H4, owing to the framework&#8208;C2H2 host&#8208;guest interactions. Furthermore, JLU&#8208;MOFs are fabricated into mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for C2H2/C2H4 separation. C2H2 permeability and C2H2/C2H4 permselectivity are substantially enhanced by &#8805;400% and &#8805;200%, respectively, after hybridization of JLU&#8208;MOF88 and JLU&#8208;MOF89 with a 6FDA&#8208;ODA polymer. These membranes can work efficiently and are stable under different conditions, demonstrating their potential in actual ethyne separation.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Bioadhesive Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Instant Wound Sealing and Electrically Accelerated Healing in Emergencies</title>

Abstract
In this work, we design a bioadhesive triboelectric nanogenerator (BA&#8208;TENG) as a first&#8208;aid rescue for instant and robust wound sealing, and ultrasound&#8208;driven accelerated wound healing. This BA&#8208;TENG is fabricated with biocompatible materials, and integrates a flexible TENG as the top layer and bioadhesive as the bottom layer, resulting in effective electricity supply and strong sutureless sealing capability on wet tissues. When driven by ultrasound, BA&#8208;TENG can produce stable voltage of 1.50&#160;V and current of 24.20&#160;&#956;A underwater. The ex vivo porcine colon organ models showed that BA&#8208;TENG sealed defects instantly (&#8764; 5 s) with high interfacial toughness (&#8764; 150 J m&#8722;2), while the rat bleeding liver incision model confirmed that BA&#8208;TENG performed rapid wound closure and hemostasis, reducing the blood loss by 82%. When applied in living rats, BA&#8208;TENG not only sealed skin injuries immediately but also produced a strong electric field (E&#8208;field) of about 0.86&#160;kV m&#8722;1 stimulated by ultrasound to accelerate skin wound healing significantly. The in vitro studies confirmed that these effects were attributed to the E&#8208;field&#8208;accelerated cell migration and proliferation. In addition, these TENG adhesives could be applied to not only wound treatment, nerve stimulation and regeneration, and charging batteries in implanted devices.

         <title>Robust Transport:An Artificial SEI Design for Anode Free Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
One of the most challenging issue in the practical implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs) is the sharp capacity attenuation caused by the mechanical degradation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, developing an artificial SEI to address this issue remains challenge due to the trade&#8208;off between ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness for general ionic conducting films. In this study, a tenacious composite artificial SEI with integrated heterostructure of lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) is prepared using a co&#8208;sputtering approach to achieve both high ionic conductivity and fracture toughness. The embedded LiF domain has an extremely high Young's modulus and surface energy compared with those of bulk LiPON film, enabling a significant increase in fracture toughness by an order of magnitude. Most importantly, the interface between LiPON and LiF in the integrated structure generates additional fast Li+ transport pathways, providing the artificial SEI with a conductivity higher than 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1. Consequently, the artificial SEI implementation significantly increases the cycling lifetime of the corresponding AFLMBs by more than 250%. This study highlights the importance of fracture toughness for the structural integrity of batteries and provides suggestions for designing viable SEI materials for high&#8208;performance AFLMBs.

         <title>Transformation from Magnetic Soliton to Skyrmion in a Monoaxial Chiral Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological spin textures are of great interest for both fundamental physics and applications in spintronics. The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya (DM) interaction underpins the formation of single&#8208;twisted magnetic solitons or multi&#8208;twisted magnetic skyrmions in magnetic materials with different crystallographic symmetries. However, topological transitions between these two kinds of topological objects have not been verified experimentally. Here, we report the direct observation of transformations from a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) to magnetic skyrmions in a nanostripe of the monoaxial chiral magnet CrNb3S6 using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. In the presence of an external magnetic field, helical spin structures first transform into CSLs and then evolve into isolated elongated magnetic skyrmions. The detailed spin textures of the elongated magnetic skyrmions are resolved using off&#8208;axis electron holography and are shown to comprise two merons, which enclose their ends and have unit total topological charge. Magnetic dipolar interactions are shown to play a key role in the magnetic soliton&#8208;skyrmion transformation, which depends sensitively on nanostripe width. Our findings, which are consistent with micromagnetic simulations, enrich the family of topological magnetic states and their transitions and promise to further stimulate the exploration of their emergent electromagnetic properties.

         <title>pH&#8208;Activatable Copper&#8208;Biomineralized Proenzyme for Synergistic Chemodynamic/Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy against Aggressive Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Artificial enzymes have demonstrated therapeutic benefit against diverse malignant tumors, yet their antitumor potencies are still severely compromised by non&#8208;selective catalysis, low atomic utilization efficiency, and undesired off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, we report that the peroxidase&#8208;like biomineralized copper (II) carbonate hydroxide nanocrystals inside single albumin nanocages (CuCH&#8208;NCs) act as a pH&#8208;activatable proenzyme to achieve tumor&#8208;selective and synergistic chemodynamic/chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against aggressive triple&#8208;negative breast cancers (TNBCs). These CuCH&#8208;NCs show pH&#8208;sensitive Cu2+ release, which spontaneously undergoes glutathione (GSH)&#8208;mediated reduction into Cu+ species for catalyzing the evolution of H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals in a single&#8208;atom&#8208;like manner to cause chemodynamic cell injury, and simultaneously activates non&#8208;toxic disulfiram to cytotoxic complex for yielding selective chemotherapeutic damage via blocking cell proliferation and amplifying cell apoptosis. CuCH&#8208;NCs exhibit considerable tumor&#8208;targeting capacity with deep penetration depth, thus affording preferable efficacy against orthotopic breast tumors through synergistic chemodynamic/chemotherapy, together with good in vivo safety. Moreover, CuCH&#8208;NCs arouse distinct immunogenic cell death effect and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression upon disulfiram combination, and thus synergize with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody to activate adaptive and innate immunities, together with relieved immunosuppression, finally yielding potent antitumor efficacy against both primary and metastatic TNBCs. These results provide insights into smart and high&#8208;performance proenzymes for synergistic therapy against aggressive cancers.

Herein, we report that the peroxidase-like biomineralized copper (II) carbonate hydroxide nanocrystals inside single albumin nanocages (CuCH-NCs) act as a pH-activatable proenzyme to achieve tumor-selective and synergistic chemodynamic/chemo-immunotherapy against aggressive triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). These CuCH-NCs show pH-sensitive Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release, which spontaneously undergoes glutathione (GSH)-mediated reduction into Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; species for catalyzing the evolution of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into hydroxyl radicals in a single-atom-like manner to cause chemodynamic cell injury, and simultaneously activates non-toxic disulfiram to cytotoxic complex for yielding selective chemotherapeutic damage via blocking cell proliferation and amplifying cell apoptosis. CuCH-NCs exhibit considerable tumor-targeting capacity with deep penetration depth, thus affording preferable efficacy against orthotopic breast tumors through synergistic chemodynamic/chemotherapy, together with good in vivo safety. Moreover, CuCH-NCs arouse distinct immunogenic cell death effect and upregulate PD-L1 expression upon disulfiram combination, and thus synergize with anti-PD-L1 antibody to activate adaptive and innate immunities, together with relieved immunosuppression, finally yielding potent antitumor efficacy against both primary and metastatic TNBCs. These results provide insights into smart and high-performance proenzymes for synergistic therapy against aggressive cancers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stable Anode&#8208;Free All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Battery through Tuned Metal Wetting on the Copper Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithiophilic Li2Te is synthesized by exposing the collector to tellurium vapor, followed by in&#160;situ Li activation. The Li2Te significantly reduces the electrodeposition/electrodissolution overpotentials and improves Coulombic efficiency. An anode&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery employing a sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte (argyrodite Li6PS5Cl) with NMC811&#160;cathode delivers an initial CE of 83% at 0.2C, with a cycling CE above 99%.








Abstract
A stable anode&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (AF&#8208;ASSB) with sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte (SE) (argyrodite Li6PS5Cl) is achieved by tuning wetting of lithium metal on &#8220;empty&#8221; copper current&#8208;collector. Lithiophilic 1&#160;&#181;m Li2Te is synthesized by exposing the collector to tellurium vapor, followed by in&#160;situ Li activation during the first charge. The Li2Te significantly reduces the electrodeposition/electrodissolution overpotentials and improves Coulombic efficiency (CE). During continuous electrodeposition experiments using half&#8208;cells (1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), the accumulated thickness of electrodeposited Li on Li2Te&#8211;Cu is more than 70&#160;&#181;m, which is the thickness of the Li foil counter&#8208;electrode. Full AF&#8208;ASSB with NMC811&#160;cathode delivers an initial CE of 83% at 0.2C, with a cycling CE above 99%. Cryogenic focused ion beam (Cryo&#8208;FIB) sectioning demonstrates uniform electrodeposited metal microstructure, with no signs of voids or dendrites at the collector&#8208;SE interface. Electrodissolution is uniform and complete, with Li2Te remaining structurally stable and adherent. By contrast, an unmodified Cu current&#8208;collector promotes inhomogeneous Li electrodeposition/electrodissolution, electrochemically inactive &#8220;dead metal,&#8221; dendrites that extend into SE, and thick non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interspersed with pores. Density functional theory (DFT) and mesoscale calculations provide complementary insight regarding nucleation&#8208;growth behavior. Unlike conventional liquid&#8208;electrolyte metal batteries, the role of current collector/support lithiophilicity has not been explored for emerging AF&#8208;ASSBs.

         <title>m6A Reader YTHDF1&#8208;Targeting Engineered Small Extracellular Vesicles for Gastric Cancer Therapy via Epigenetic and Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The m6A reader YTH N6&#8208;methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1)&#8208;targeting engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) inhibit gastric tumor progression and metastasis through epigenetic and immune regulation. The engineered sEVs hamper frizzled7 translation and inactivate Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin pathway in an m6A dependent manner, and promote immunotherapy by direct self&#8208;presentation of immunogenic tumor and CD47&#160;blockade&#8208;based immunosuppression reversal.








Abstract
N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) modulators decide the fate of m6A&#8208;modified transcripts and drive cancer development. RNA interference targeting m6A modulators promise to be an emerging cancer therapy but is challenging due to its poor tumor targeting and high systematic toxicity. Here engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) with high CD47&#160;expression and cyclic arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartic (c(RGDyC)) modification are developed for effective delivery of short interfering RNA against m6A reader YTH N6&#8208;methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) to treat gastric cancer via epigenetic and immune regulation. This nanosystem efficiently depletes YTHDF1&#160;expression and suppresses gastric cancer progression and metastasis through hampering frizzled7 translation and inactivating Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin pathway in an m6A dependent manner. Loss of YTHDF1&#160;mediates overexpression of interferon (IFN)&#8208;&#947; receptor 1 and enhances IFN&#8208;&#947; response, promoting expression of major histocompatibility complex class I on tumor cells to achieve self&#8208;presentation of the immunogenic tumor cells to stimulate strong cytotoxic T lymphocytes responses. CD47&#160;expression on the engineered sEVs can competitively bind with signal regulatory protein &#945; to enhance phagocytosis of the tumor cells by tumor&#8208;associated macrophages. This versatile nanoplatform provides an efficient and low toxic strategy to inhibit epigenetic regulators and holds great potential in promoting immunotherapy.

         <title>A BF3&#8208;Doped MXene Dual&#8208;Layer Interphase for a Reliable Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;layer interphase consisting of an in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated lithium carboxylate organic layer and a thin BF3&#8208;doped monolayer Ti3C2&#160;MXene is formed on the surface of Li&#8208;metal. The functional BF3&#160;groups along with MXene lead to a homogenous lithium deposition. The battery with the dual&#8208;layer coated lithium metal as the anode shows improved electrochemical property and battery capacity retention.








Abstract
A dual&#8208;layer interphase that consists of an in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed lithium carboxylate organic layer and a thin BF3&#8208;doped monolayer Ti3C2 MXene on Li metal is reported. The honeycomb&#8208;structured organic layer increases the wetting of electrolyte, leading to a thin solid electrolyte interface (SEI). While the BF3&#8208;doped monolayer MXene provides abundant active sites for lithium homogeneous nucleation and growth, resulting in about 50% reduced thickness of inorganic&#8208;rich components among the SEI layer. A low overpotential of less than 30&#160;mV over 1000&#160;h cycling in symmetric cells is received. The functional BF3&#160;groups, along with the excellent electronic conductivity and smooth surface of the MXene, greatly reduce the lithium plating/stripping energy barrier, enabling a dendrite&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal anode. The battery with this dual&#8208;layer coated lithium metal as the anode displays greatly improved electrochemical performance. A high capacity&#8208;retention of 175.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#160;C is achieved after 350&#160;cycles. In a pouch cell with a capacity of 475&#160;mAh, the battery still exhibits a high discharge capacity of 165.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 90.2% after 200&#160;cycles. In contrast to the fast capacity decay of pure Li metal, the battery using NCA as the cathode also displays excellent capacity retention in both coin and pouch cells. The dual&#8208;layer modified surface provides an effective approach in stabilizing the Li&#8208;metal anode.

         <title>Unlock the Potassium Storage Behavior of Single&#8208;Phased Tungsten Selenide Nanorods via Large Cation Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, in/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations are performed to investigate the role of tunnel cations in governing the charge storage performances of electrodes by focusing on K&#8208;ions in layer&#8208;structured WSe2. It clearly reveals that the pre&#8208;intercalated K&#8208;ions inside interlayers of WSe2 increases the electronic conductivity, and improves K&#8208;ion diffusivity, having fast kinetics response during the K&#8208;ion (de)insertion.








Abstract
Metal chalcogenide anodes with a layered structure have been regarded as potential K&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy density for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, their development is impeded by the slow K&#8208;ion transport kinetics and poor structural stability. In this work, the energy&#8208;storage behavior is investigated first and decisively associated them with the capacity&#8208;degradation of the promising layer&#8208;structured WSe2 from an integrated chemical and physical point of view. Then, a single&#8208;phased WSe2 with pre&#8208;intercalated high K content (SP&#8208;KxWSe2) is designed to overcome the capacity&#8208;degradation issue fundamentally. Theoretical calculations clarify the beneficial effect of K&#8208;ions inside the interlayer of WSe2 on boosting its electrochemical performance, including increasing the electronic conductivity, promoting the K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and improving the structural stability. The novel design enables the K&#8208;ions pre&#8208;intercalated WSe2 anode material to exhibit a high reversible specific capacity of 211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 and superior cycling stability (89.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). Especially, the K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor, assembled from the anode of SP&#8208;KxWSe2 and the cathode of porous activated carbon, delivers superior energy&#8208;density up to 175&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, high power&#8208;density as well as exceptional cycling stability.

&lt;p&gt;Here, in/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations are performed to investigate the role of tunnel cations in governing the charge storage performances of electrodes by focusing on K-ions in layer-structured WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It clearly reveals that the pre-intercalated K-ions inside interlayers of WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases the electronic conductivity, and improves K-ion diffusivity, having fast kinetics response during the K-ion (de)insertion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal chalcogenide anodes with a layered structure have been regarded as potential K-based electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy density for large-scale energy storage applications. However, their development is impeded by the slow K-ion transport kinetics and poor structural stability. In this work, the energy-storage behavior is investigated first and decisively associated them with the capacity-degradation of the promising layer-structured WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from an integrated chemical and physical point of view. Then, a single-phased WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with pre-intercalated high K content (SP-K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is designed to overcome the capacity-degradation issue fundamentally. Theoretical calculations clarify the beneficial effect of K-ions inside the interlayer of WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on boosting its electrochemical performance, including increasing the electronic conductivity, promoting the K-ion diffusivity, and improving the structural stability. The novel design enables the K-ions pre-intercalated WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; anode material to exhibit a high reversible specific capacity of 211 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and superior cycling stability (89.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Especially, the K-ion hybrid capacitor, assembled from the anode of SP-K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the cathode of porous activated carbon, delivers superior energy-density up to 175&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, high power-density as well as exceptional cycling stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bidirectional Water&#8208;Stream Behavior on a Multifunctional Membrane for Simultaneous Energy Generation and Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy generation from environmental sources such as water is mainly focused on the power generation characteristics. However, the purification technology of environmental sources are also desired techniques for recent environmental and energy global issues. In this work, bifunctional (energy generation and water purification) membranes are successfully developed by controlling the water flow directions on the membranes (electricity generation and purification membrane).








Abstract
Hydroelectric nanogenerators have been previously proposed to recycle various water resources and polluted water. However, as conventional hydroelectric nanogenerators only utilize water resources, they cannot provide a fundamental solution for water recycling. In this study, a water purification membrane is proposed that can simultaneously generate electricity during the purification process (electricity generation and purification membrane (EPM)) for water recycling. As polluted water passes through the EPM, the water is purified in the perpendicular direction, while electricity is simultaneously produced in the horizontal direction by the movement of ions. Notably, the EPM exhibits high energy generation performance (maximum power 16.44&#160;&#181;W and energy 15.16&#160;mJ) by the streaming effect of water&#8208;streaming carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Moreover, by using a poly(acrylic acid)/carboxymethyl cellulose (PAA/CMC) binder to EPM, the energy&#8208;generation performance and long&#8208;term stability are substantially improved and outstanding mechanical stability is provided, regardless of the acidity of the water source (pH 1&#8211;10). More importantly, the EPM exhibits the water purification characteristics of &gt;90% rejection of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm pollutants and potentiality of &#229;ngstrom level cation rejection, with simultaneous and continuous energy generation. Overall, this study proposes an efficient EPM model, which can be potentially used as a next&#8208;generation renewable energy generation approach, thus laying the foundation for effective utilization of polluted water resources.

         <title>Unlocking the Full Potential of Electron Acceptor Molecules for Efficient and Stable Hole Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding the hole injection mechanism and improving the hole injection property are of pivotal importance in the future development of organic optoelectronic devices. Electron acceptor molecules with high electron affinity (EA) are widely used in electronic applications, such as hole injection and p&#8208;doping. Although p&#8208;doping has generally been studied in terms of matching the ionization energy (IE) of organic semiconductors with the EA of acceptor molecules, little is known about the effect of the EA of acceptor molecules on the hole injection property. Here, the hole injection mechanism in devices is completely clarified, and a strategy to optimize the hole injection property of acceptor molecules is developed. Efficient and stable hole injection is found to be possible even into materials with IEs as high as 5.8&#160;eV by controlling the charged state of an acceptor molecule with an EA of about 5.0&#160;eV. This excellent hole injection property enables direct hole injection into an emitting layer, realizing a pure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode with an extraordinarily low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.67&#160;V, a power efficiency of 29&#160;lm W&#8211;1, an external quantum efficiency of 28% and a Commission internationale de l&#8217;&#233;clairage y coordinate of less than 0.10.

         <title>Transition Metal Ion Doping on ZIF&#8208;8 Enhances the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;rich sp2 C atoms of optimized copper doping on ZIF&#8208;8 lead to a local effect between the Zn&#8211;N4 and Cu&#8211;N4 moieties, achieving a maximum Faradaic efficiency for CO2 to CO of 88.5% at &#8211;1.0&#160;V (versus RHE) with a stability over 6&#160;h.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2&#160;to diverse value&#8208;added chemicals is a unique, environmentally friendly approach for curbing greenhouse gas emissions while addressing sluggish catalytic activity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) of electrocatalysts. Here, zeolite&#8208;imidazolate&#8208;frameworks&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) containing various transition metal ions&#8212;Ni, Fe, and Cu&#8212;at varying concentrations upon doping are fabricated for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to carbon monoxide (CO) without further processing. Atom coordination environments and theoretical electrocatalytic performance are scrutinized via X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)&#160;and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon optimized Cu doping on ZIF&#8208;8, Cu0.5Zn0.5/ZIF&#8208;8 achieves a high partial current density of 11.57&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 and maximum FE for CO of 88.5% at &#8211;1.0&#160;V (versus RHE) with a stable catalytic activity over 6&#160;h. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;rich sp2 C atom facilitates COOH* promotion after Cu doping of ZIF&#8208;8, leading to a local effect between the zinc&#8211;nitrogen&#160;(Zn&#8211;N4) and copper&#8211;nitrogen (Cu&#8211;N4) moieties. Additionally, the advanced CO2RR pathway is illustrated from various perspectives, including the pre&#8208;H&#8208;covered state under the CO2RR. The findings expand the pool of efficient metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based CO2RR catalysts, deeming them viable alternatives to conventional catalysts.

         <title>A Universal Perovskite Nanocrystal Ink for High&#8208;Performance Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional CsPbI3&#160;perovskite nanocrystal ink is developed through solution&#8208;phase ligand exchange with 3,3&#8208;diphenylpropylammonium iodide, attributed to singular stabilization by diphenyl group and rigorous surface passivation. This enables a &#8220;universal&#8221; demonstration of high&#8208;performance photovoltaics and light&#8208;emitting devices while ensuring excellent phase stability and device longevity.








Abstract
Semiconducting lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are regarded as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices due to their solution processability and outstanding optoelectronic properties. While the field of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaics (PVs), two prime examples of optoelectronic devices, has recently seen a multitude of efforts toward high&#8208;performance PNC&#8208;based devices, realizing both devices with high efficiencies and stabilities through a single PNC processing strategy has remained a challenge. &#160;In this work, diphenylpropylammonium (DPAI) surface ligands, found through a judicious ab&#8208;initio&#8208;based ligand search, are shown to provide a solution to this problem. The universal PNC ink with DPAI ligands presented here, prepared through a solution&#8208;phase ligand&#8208;exchange process, simultaneously allows single&#8208;step processed LED and PV devices with peak electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 17.00% and power conversion efficiency of 14.92% (stabilized output 14.00%), respectively. It is revealed that a careful design of the aromatic rings such as in DPAI is the decisive factor in bestowing such high performances, ease of solution processing, and improved phase stability up to 120&#160;days. This work illustrates the power of ligand design in producing PNC ink formulations for high&#8208;throughput production of optoelectronic devices; it also paves a path for &#8220;dual&#8208;mode&#8221; devices with both PV and LED functionalities.

         <title>Significant Zero Thermal Expansion Via Enhanced Magnetoelastic Coupling in Kagome Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero thermal expansion&#160;(ZTE) with a negligible coefficient of thermal expansion av of 2.4 ppm K&#8722;1 in a broad temperature range is achieved owing to the significant contribution of interstitial C into a Hf&#8211;Ta&#8211;Fe magnet. The corresponding mechanism of tuning normal positive thermal expansion into intriguingly ZTE via enhanced magnetoelastic coupling during magnetic transition is clarified by comprehensive property measurements, direct observation of magnetic transition, and theoretical calculations.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (ZTE) alloys, as dimensionally stable materials, are urgently required in many fields, particularly in highly advanced modern industries. In this study, high&#8208;performance ZTE with a negligible coefficient of thermal expansion av as small as 2.4&#160;ppm K&#8722;1 in a broad temperature range of 85&#8211;245 K is discovered in Hf0.85Ta0.15Fe2C0.01 magnet. It is demonstrated that the addition of trace interstitial atom C into Ta&#8208;substituted Hf0.85Ta0.15Fe2 exhibits significant capability to tune the normal positive thermal expansion&#160;into high&#8208;performance ZTE via enhanced magnetoelastic coupling in stabilized ferromagnetic structure. Moreover, direct observation of the magnetic transition between ferromagnetic and triangular antiferromagnetic states via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, along with corresponding theoretical calculations, further uncovers the manipulation mechanism of ZTE and negative thermal expansion. A convenient and effective method to optimize thermal expansion and achieve ZTE with interstitial C addition may result in broadened applications based on the strong correlation between the magnetic properties and crystal structure.

         <title>Defect Engineering Stabilized AgSbTe2 with High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) generators enable the direct and reversible conversion between heat and electricity, providing applications in both refrigeration and power generation. The grand challenge in the field is related to the low conversion efficiency of TE devices. In the last decade, several TE materials with relatively high figures of merit (zT) have been reported in low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature regimes. However, there is an urgent demand for high&#8208;performance TE materials working in the mid&#8208;temperature range (400&#8208;700 K). Herein, p&#8208;type AgSbTe2 materials stabilized with S and Se co&#8208;doping are demonstrated to exhibit an outstanding maximum figure of merit (zTmax) of 2.3 at 673 K and an average figure of merit (zTave) of 1.59 over the wide temperature range of 300 &#8211; 673 K. This exceptional performance arises from an enhanced carrier density resulting from a higher concentration of silver vacancies, a vastly improved Seebeck coefficient enabled by the flattening of the valence band maximum and the inhibited formation of n&#8208;type Ag2Te, and a highly improved stability beyond 673 K. The optimized material is used to fabricate a single&#8208;leg device with efficiencies of up to 13.3% and an unicouple TE device reaching energy conversion efficiencies up to 12.3% at a temperature difference of 370 K. These results highlight an effective strategy to engineer high&#8208;performance TE material for cost&#8208;effective waste heat recovery in the mid&#8208;temperature range.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;fusion&#8208;mediated Multiplex Engineering of Tumor Cell Surface Glycans for Enhanced NK Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell therapies show potential for tumor treatment but were immunologically resisted by the overexpressed immunosuppressing tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;surface glycans. To reverse this glycan&#8208;mediated immunosuppression, the surface NK&#8208;inhibitory glycan expressions need to be downregulated and NK&#8208;activating glycan levels should be elevated synchronously with optimal efficiency. Here, we design a core&#8208;shell membrane&#8208;fusogenic liposome (MFL) to simultaneously achieve the physical modification of NK&#8208;activating glycans and biological inhibition of immunosuppressing glycans on the tumor cell surface via a membrane&#8208;fusion manner. Loaded into a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;triggered&#8208;degradable thermosensitive hydrogel, MFLs could be conveniently injected and controllably released into local tumor. Through fusion with tumor cell membrane, the released MFLs could simultaneously deliver sialyltransferase&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;loaded core into cytoplasm, and anchor NK&#8208;activating&#8208;glycan&#8208;modified shell onto tumor surface. This spatially&#8208;differential distribution of core and shell in one cell ensures the effective inhibition of intracellular sialyltransferase to downregulate immunosuppressing sialic acid, and direct presentation of NK&#8208;activating Lewis X trisaccharide (LeX) on tumor surface simultaneously. Consequentially, the sialic acid&#8208;caused immunosuppression of tumor surface was reprogrammed to be LeX&#8208;induced NK activation, resulting in sensitive susceptibility to NK&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated recognition and lysis for improved tumor elimination. This MFL provides a novel platform for multiplex cell engineering and personalized regulation of intercellular interactions for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Conformal Volumetric Grayscale Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conformal artificial electromagnetic media that feature tailorable responses as a function of incidence wavelength and angle represent universal components for optical engineering. We introduce conformal grayscale metamaterials as a new class of volumetric electromagnetic media capable of supporting highly multiplexed responses and arbitrary, curvilinear form factors. Subwavelength&#8208;scale voxels based on irregular shapes are designed to accommodate a continuum of dielectric values, enabling the freeform design process to reliably converge to exceptionally high Figure of Merits for a given multi&#8208;objective design problem. Through additive manufacturing of ceramic&#8208;polymer composites, we experimentally fabricate microwave metamaterials, designed for the radio frequency range of 8&#8211;12&#160;GHz, and demonstrate devices with extreme dispersion profiles, an airfoil&#8208;shaped beam steering device, and a broadband, broad angle conformal carpet cloak. We anticipate that conformal volumetric metamaterials will lead to new classes of compact and multi&#8208;functional imaging, sensing, and communications systems.

         <title>Dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and preventing susceptible patients from lethal infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but have proven to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity. A combination of checkpoint blocking antibody and virus&#8208;specific antigen is covalently conjugated to polydopamine nanoparticles, which can be anchored onto bacterial surface, by a one&#8208;step in&#8208;situ polymerization of dopamine under a cell&#8208;friendly condition. By virtue of the ability to colonize and penetrate deep tumor tissue, dressed bacteria enable sustained release and expanded exposure of carried immunoactivators to stimulate immune cells. In addition to a carrier role, bacteria are able to further provoke innate immunity due to native immunogenicity of the pathogen&#8208;associated molecular patterns. Immunization with dressed bacteria promote the maturation and activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells, which induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. As evidenced by efficient production of viral antigen&#8208;specific immunoglobulin G antibody in serum and significantly suppressed tumor growth in different models, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface paves an avenue to prepare next&#8208;generation therapeutics for synergistic treatment and prevention.

Abstract
Supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is a novel device that integrates ion diode functionality into a conventional electrical double layer capacitor and is expected to have great applications in emerging fields such as signal propagation, microcircuit rectification, logic operations and neuromorphology. Here we report a brand new pseudocapacitor diode having both high charge storage (50.2 C g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mV s&#8722;1) and high rectification (the rectification ratio of 0.79 at 200&#160;mV s&#8722;1) properties, which is realized by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox reaction of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of the integrated device in the logic gate of circuit system to realize the logic operations of &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;. This work not only expands the types of CAPodes, but also provides a train of thoughts for constructing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

         <title>Hardware and Information Security Primitives Based on Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
It is now well established that hardware security is a major concern for the entire semiconductor ecosystem with annual losses in billions of dollars. Similarly, information security is a critical need for the rapidly proliferating edge devices that continuously collect and communicate a massive volume of data. While silicon&#8208;based complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology offers security solutions, these are mostly inadequate, inefficient, often inconclusive, and resource extensive in time, energy, and cost, offering tremendous scope for innovation in this field. Furthermore, silicon&#8208;based security primitives have shown vulnerability to machine learning (ML) attacks. Finally, the demise of dimension scaling of silicon transistors and the computing bottleneck enforced by von&#8208;Neumann architecture aggravate the security challenges. In recent years, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been intensely explored to mitigate these security challenges. In this review, we summarize 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based hardware security solutions such as camouflaging, true random number generators (TRNGs), watermarking, anti&#8208;counterfeits, physically unclonable functions (PUFs), and logic locking of integrated circuits (ICs) along with the discussion on their reliability and resilience to ML attacks. In addition, we also examine the role of native defects in 2D materials in developing high entropy hardware security primitives. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges for 2D materials, which must be overcome for large&#8208;scale deployment of 2D integrated circuits to meet the security needs of the semiconductor industry.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Use of Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogeneous Photocatalysts in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic photochemistry developed intensely in the 1980s in which the nature of excited electronic states and the energy and electron transfer processes were thoroughly studied and finally well&#8208;understood. This knowledge from molecular organic photochemistry can be transferred to the design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as active visible light photocatalyts. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constitute a new class of crystalline porous materials with substantial application potentials. Featured with outstanding structural tunability, large porosity, high surface area, excellent stability and unique photoelectronic properties, COFs have been studied as potential candidates in various research areas (e.g., photocatalysis). This review was aimed to provide state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art insights into the design of COF photocatalysts (pristine, functionalized, and hybrid COFs) for organic transformations. The catalytic reaction mechanism of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and the influence of dimensionality and crystallinity on heterogenous photocatalysis performance was also discussed, followed by perspectives and prospects on the main challenges and opportunities in future research of COFs and COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Reprocessable and Chemically Recyclable Hard Vitrimers Based on Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Epoxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The rapid increase in demand for recyclable and reusable thermosets has necessitated the development of materials with chemical structures that exhibit these features. Thus, functional mesogenic epoxide monomers bearing both ester and imine groups that can be vitrimerized and recycled are reported herein. The compounds show mesophase characteristics at 100&#8211;200&#176;C and can be converted into hard epoxides by a common curing reaction. The obtained hard epoxides have high isotropic thermal conductivity (&#8764;0.64 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), which is derived from their highly ordered microstructures. The cured products can be easily reprocessed through imine metathesis and transesterification, and decomposed products can be obtained through imine hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions and subsequently be re&#8208;cured. Surprisingly, the recycled materials can be repeatedly reprocessed or chemically decomposed. The reprocessed materials retain the properties of their pristine counterparts, and the recycled products preserve the advantages of the hard thermosets without alteration to any of their unique properties. A dehydration reaction occurs between the residual hydroxyl groups during the re&#8208;hardening, which dramatically increases the glass transition temperature by &#8764;60&#176;C. These reprocessable and recyclable vitrimers demonstrate the effectiveness and environmental friendliness of the molecular design strategy reported herein.
