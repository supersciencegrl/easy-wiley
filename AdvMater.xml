         <title>Regulating Charge Distribution to Achieve High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Single&#8208;Component Organic Neuromorphic Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A torsion&#8208;polarization synergy strategy utilizing cyano&#8208;functionalized thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (2CNTT) achieves intramolecular decoupling and intermolecular polarization, optimizing exciton dissociation and charge transport. The single&#8208;component phototransistor based on 2CNTT exhibits ultralow energy consumption, high photoresponse, and synaptic functionalities, providing an efficient design strategy for multifunctional optoelectronic devices and neuromorphic applications.








Abstract
Organic optoelectronic devices are advancing toward miniaturization and integration, demanding high performance, low energy consumption, and simplified manufacturing. The development of single&#8208;component phototransistors is still in its early stages, particularly for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors. Here, thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene&#8208;3,6&#8208;dicarbonitrile (2CNTT) is developed and a cyano&#8208;mediated torsion&#8208;polarization synergy strategy is proposed to construct conjugated polymers via direct (hetero)arylation polycondensation. This structural modification promotes intramolecular decoupling and enhances intermolecular interactions, enabling intra&#8208;/interchain charge distribution to be regulated. N&#8208;type copolymers based on 2CNTT exhibited broad visible&#8208;light absorption range and small exciton binding energy, capable of stable exciton generation and stepwise dissociation. The PFIID2NTT&#8208;based single&#8208;component phototransistor showed stable unipolar electron mobility and strong photoresponse with light&#8208;current/dark&#8208;current ratio as high as 9.02 &#215; 104, and a paired&#8208;pulse facilitation index over 236% under visible light. The devices also operate at an ultra&#8208;low energy consumption (13.23 aJ), mimicking neural synapse behavior and enabling long&#8208;term memory functionality. The strategy optimizes charge distribution and exciton utilization in n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors, presenting a new paradigm for developing multifunctional organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Carbon Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastics: From Materials to Manufacturing and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A contemporary and critical review on carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics. The common thermoplastic and carbon fiber applied in the manufacture of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics are summarized, and the processing and postprocessing methods are reviewed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art welding techniques. The typical applications of carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics in industry are also highlighted.








Abstract
Carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastics (CFRTs) have witnessed a resurgence in recent times since their first industrial use over five decades ago, with revitalized interest from aerospace companies and other key sectors including energy and automotive sectors. CFRTs are increasingly gaining footholds in high volume rapid manufacturing in aerospace and nonaerospace sectors owing to their inherent recyclability. However, there has been a lack of contemporary and critical review on this topic so far. This work aims to review the recent advances in CFRTs with emphasis on high performance thermoplastics. Both continuous and discontinuous fiber forms in tape, organosheet and short/long fiber architectures are discussed, their processing and postprocessing methods are reviewed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art welding techniques. Typical applications of CFRTs in industry are examined, including fuselage, pressure vessel, and automotive components. Finally, insights are provided into ongoing challenges, future development, and a roadmap for expediting the development of high&#8208;performance CFRTs.

         <title>Double&#8208;side Interfacial Engineering of Hole Transport Layer Enables Efficient and Operationally Stable Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;side interfacial engineering of the hole transport layer (HTL) is presented for lead sulfide colloidal quantum dot solar cells. This strategy achieves a record efficiency of 14.28% by using classic P3HT as HTL and exhibits exceptional stability with unencapsulated devices retaining 90% initial efficiency for over 520 hours at maximum power point in ambient air, doubling the previous best 260 hours.








Abstract
Although lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells demonstrate excellent storage stability under ambient conditions, the operational stability is still rather poor for devices based on both organic or inorganic hole transport layer (HTL), seriously limiting their practical applications. In this work, it is find that both the CQD/polymer HTL bottom interface and the polymer HTL/electrode top interface are critical factors limiting device performance and operational stability. By proposing a double&#8208;side interfacial engineering strategy to achieve surface energy matching and energy level grading, a high efficiency of 14.28% is realized using the classic P3HT HTL material, which is the highest reported efficiency for PbS CQD solar cells with organic HTLs. More importantly, the unencapsulated device can maintain 90% of its initial power (T90) after &#8776;520 hours at the maximum power point (MPP) in ambient air, far exceeding the highest value previously reported in the literature (260 hours). This work provides new insights into the development of stable CQD&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>In Situ Engineering of Grain Boundary Phase toward Superior Thermoelectric Performance in Mg3(Sb,Bi)2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of grain boundary phases with low resistivity can effectively enhance the thermoelectric performance of Mg3(Sb,Bi)2. This work proposes an in situ engineering approach inducing TiO2&#8208;n to reduce interfacial barriers, which is attributed to the formation of Ti3Sb. These secondary phases significantly enhance the power factor while simultaneously reducing the lattice thermal conductivity, thereby resulting in a superior figure of merit (zT) and conversion efficiency.








Abstract
As a promising thermoelectric material for electronic cooling and power generation, Mg3(Sb,Bi)2 has received extensive attention. Despite efforts to enhance its performance through composite modulation, challenges such as secondary phase refinement, dispersion, and interfacial mismatch, particularly at grain boundaries, remain critical. In this work, by incorporating TiO2&#8208;n into the Mg3(Sb,Bi)2&#8208;based matrix, the grain boundary phases are in situ engineered, yielding a superior figure of merit (zT) exceeding 2 at 798 K. The electrical conductivity is significantly enhanced with only slight changes to the Seebeck coefficient over the entire temperature range, mainly due to the contribution to carrier concentration and mobility from the newly generated Ti3Sb at grain boundaries. Benefiting from the remarkably enhanced power factor and the diminished lattice thermal conductivity, the zT value shows an overall increase within the temperature range of 300&#8211;798 K, leading to a considerable conversion efficiency of 15% for the single&#8208;leg device.

         <title>Superhigh Magnetostriction in Non&#8208;Equilibrium Grown Fe&#8208;Ga Single&#8208;Crystals by Rapid&#8208;Directional&#8208;Solidification</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy of rapid&#8208;directional&#8208;solidification is developed to unexpectedly grow non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals of Fe&#8208;Ga magnetostrictive material with the supersaturation of Tb, leading to an unprecedentedly giant magnetostriction of 489&#160;ppm in bulk Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals. This study paves the way for realizing revolutionary material performance by innovating the concept and fabrication method of non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals.








Abstract
The non&#8208;equilibrium microstructure characterized by Tb supersaturation within Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals is deduced to induce a substantial enhancement in magnetostriction. However, the growth of the non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystal remains a formidable obstacle, as existing methods can only produce either non&#8208;equilibrium polycrystal or near&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystal, leading to the stagnation in magnetostriction. Herein, a rapid&#8208;directional&#8208;solidification (RDS) strategy is devised to grow non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals. The RDS is realized through achieving an ultrahigh temperature gradient of &#8776;106 K&#160;m&#8722;1 at S&#8208;L interface front, accompanied by an ultrafast growth velocity. This results in single&#8208;crystal growth under non&#8208;equilibrium conditions with a giant cooling rate of 102&#8211;103 K&#160;s&#8722;1, which is &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude greater than the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of directional&#8208;solidification methods. A non&#8208;equilibrium Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystal, featured with traces of Tb supersaturation, is successfully grown with a significantly enhanced magnetostriction of 489&#160;ppm. This magnitude of magnetostriction sets a record in bulk Fe&#8208;Ga materials, surpassing the maximum value reported for Fe&#8208;Ga single&#8208;crystals by 60%. The advent of RDS strategy opens an avenue for fabricating non&#8208;equilibrium single&#8208;crystals with revolutionary performance, and paves the way for fabricating currently unattainable single&#8208;crystals for engineering applications.

         <title>Radical p&#8208;Doping Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD for Efficient, Stable and Self&#8208;Healing Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing nitroxide redical, DT&#8208;TEMPO, has been used to address slow oxidation and mechanical stability limitations of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD in perovskite solar cells, achieving good power conversion efficiency of 25.69% (rigid, certified 25.30%), 21.23% (rigid mini&#8208;module), and 24.19% (flexible). Most impressively, the flexible devices with DT&#8208;TEMPO show remarkable machnical stability, maintaining &#8764;95% of initial efficiency after 20&#8201;000 bending cycles through a dynamic disulfide bond cleavage and reformation mechanism.








Abstract
Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is the primary hole transport material (HTM) for high&#8208;efficiency and stable flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs). However, the slow oxidation rate and susceptibility to film cracking under stress in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD lead to reduced device stability and efficiency. In this paper, a multi&#8208;functional novel self&#8208;healing nitroxide radical monomer, 4&#8208;[[5&#8208;(1,2&#8208;dithiolane&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&#8208;oxopentyl]amino]&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl (DT&#8208;TEMPO), has been introduced to address these challenges. DT&#8208;TEMPO, on one side, enhances the hole mobility and conductivity by p&#8208;doping Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, while boosting the charge transfer process from perovskite to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD with an optimized energy level alignment on the other side. Additionally, DT&#8208;TEMPO endows a self&#8208;healing capability to Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD through the introduction of dynamic breaking and reconstructing disulfide bond. The optimized perovskite solar cells achieve impressive power conversion efficiencies, 25.69% on rigid substrates (certified 25.30%), 21.23% on rigid mini&#8208;modules, and 24.19% on flexible substrates. Remarkably, the FPSCs with DT&#8208;TEMPO retain over 90% of their initial efficiency even after 20&#8201;000 bending cycles (r = 6&#160;mm) and recover to &#8776;95% of their initial value through the self&#8208;healing process.

         <title>Enabling High Reversibility of Both Cationic and Anionic Redox in Layered Oxide Cathodes via NiMn6 Superlattice Topology for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered oxide cathode material (NNLMO) with the LiMn6 and NiMn6 dual&#8208;topology superlattice is constructed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, realizing the reversible cationic and anionic redox. The Ni2+ electronic configuration serves as a redox buffer to tune the redox activity, while the NiMn6 topology provides topological protection to reinforce the superstructure stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage oxygen anionic redox provides a transformative opportunity to achieve high energy density of batteries. However, it is challenging to guarantee the reversibility of both cationic and anionic redox for layered transition metal (TM) oxide cathode materials due to the high oxygen&#8208;redox reactivity and the complex structural rearrangements. Herein, a honeycomb&#8208;layered Na0.78Ni0.12Li0.18Mn0.7O2 (NNLMO) cathode material with the NiMn6 and LiMn6 dual&#8208;topology superlattice is proposed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate that the Ni2+ electronic configuration serves as a redox buffer to tune the cationic and anionic redox activity by enlarging the energy gap between O 2p and Mn 3d orbitals, while the NiMn6 topology renders the LiMn6 topology delocalized in the TM layers to reinforce the superstructure stability through suppressing the intralayer Mn migration and O2 formation. As a result, NNLMO delivers a highly reversible capacity of 224 mAh g&#8722;1 with the mitigated voltage hysteresis and exhibits remarkable capacity retention of 92.2% over 50 cycles within the wide voltage range of 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V. The findings suggest a new insight into the topological superstructure design of high&#8208;energy oxide cathode materials for sustainable batteries.

         <title>Direct Experimental Evidence of Low Carrier Scattering Potential in High Performance Thermoelectric AgSbSe2 Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of high&#8208;quality AgSb0.973Cd0.017Se2 crystals with short&#8208;range order embeds within a long&#8208;range periodic structure, achieving the synergistic optimization of both electrical and phonon transport properties. Time&#8208;resolved reflectance spectroscopy provides clear evidence of a pronounced reduction in carrier scattering barriers, leads to a threefold enhancement in the average power factor (PFavg), ultimately achieving superior thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Thermoelectric materials, like other electronic materials, require high carrier mobility, which is governed by carrier scattering potential. In addition to intrinsic acoustic phonon scattering, the extrinsic factors such as microstructure and atomic arrangement also have great influence on carrier transport in solids, e.g., the emerging thermoelectric material AgSbSe2 with strong cation disorder. However, the experimental evaluation of total carrier scattering potential and distinguishing the contributions from intrinsic and extrinsic scatterings is challenging at present. Here, the time&#8208;resolved ultrafast spectroscopy analysis utilizing a pump&#8208;probe scheme is performed to characterize the charge carrier dynamics of AgSbSe2 with femtosecond time resolution quantitatively. A significantly lowered total carrier scattering potential energy in Cd&#8208;doped AgSbSe2 crystal is determined, resulting from the elimination of grain boundaries and the presence of short&#8208;range order that leads to a negative extrinsic scattering potential. The reduction in carrier scattering potential leads to a threefold increase in the average power factor from 323 to 723 K. A maximum thermoelectric figure of merit of 1.7 is achieved in high&#8208;quality AgSb0.973Cd0.017Se2 crystal at 723 K, with the output efficiency of the single&#8208;leg thermoelectric device reaching a competitive value of 8%. This work reveals how to effectively characterize and modulate carrier scattering potential in thermoelectric compounds.

         <title>Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte Engineering for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines recent advancements in low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) and analyzes current challenges, limitations, and failure mechanisms across various rechargeable battery systems using LCEs, including lithium&#8208;ion, lithium&#8208;metal, lithium&#8208;sulfur, sodium&#8208;ion, sodium&#8208;metal, zinc, potassium, calcium, and magnesium batteries. Modification strategies, theoretical simulations, and cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques for LCEs are discussed, and future directions for high&#8208;performance LCEs are proposed to address ongoing challenges.








Abstract
Low&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LCEs) present significant potential for actual applications because of their cost&#8208;effectiveness, low viscosity, reduced side reactions, and wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical stability. However, current electrolyte research predominantly focuses on regulation strategies for conventional 1 m electrolytes, high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, and localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes, leaving design principles, optimization methods, and prospects of LCEs inadequately summarized. LCEs face unique challenges that cannot be addressed by the existing theories and approaches applicable to the three common electrolytes mentioned above; thus, tailored strategies to provide development guidance are urgently needed. Herein, a systematic overview of recent progress in LCEs is provided and subsequent development directions are suggested. This review proposes the core challenge of the high solvent ratio in LCEs, which triggers unstable organic&#8208;enriched electrolyte/electrode interface formation and anion depletion near the anode. On the basis of these issues, modification strategies for LCEs, including passivation interface construction and solvent&#8210;anion interaction optimization, are used in various rechargeable battery systems. Finally, the role of advanced simulations and cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques in revealing LCE failure mechanisms is further highlighted, offering new perspectives for their future development and practical application in next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Two&#8208;Layer Graphite Anode for Energy and Power Densified LiFePO4 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work identifies the lithium plating failure mechanism in energy&#8208;type and power&#8208;type single&#8208;layer graphite electrodes. Based on this, a two&#8208;layer graphite anode is designed and scaled up, with energy&#8208;type graphite on the top and power&#8208;type graphite on the bottom. This design inhibits lithium plating and greatly extends the lifespan of energy and power&#8208;densified LFP batteries.








Abstract
Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries are increasingly adopted in grid&#8208;scale energy storage due to their superior performance and cost metrics. However, as the desired energy and power are further densified, the lifespan of LiFePO4 batteries is significantly limited, mainly because the lithium plating severely occurs on the graphite anode. Here, first the lithium plating characteristics of both energy&#8208;type and power&#8208;type graphite electrodes in single&#8208;layer design are deciphered. Based on these findings, a suitable two&#8208;layer design with energy&#8208;type graphite on the top layer and power&#8208;type one on the bottom layer, is disclosed. Such configuration effectively inhibits lithium plating throughout the graphite electrode, drastically increasing the lifespan in an energy&#8208; and power&#8208;densified LiFePO4 battery. The assembled pouch cell with an energy density of 161.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, delivers a capacity retention rate of 90.8% after 2000 cycles at 2&#160;C. This work provides valuable insights into the failure mechanism of graphite electrodes, but also innovative strategies of electrode engineering for extending batteries&#8217; performance horizon.

         <title>Surface Single Atom Alloys for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt1&#8208;MoL&#8208;Mo2C surface single atom alloys (SSAAs) that integrate the advantages of Single atom catalysts (SACs) and Single atom alloys (SAAs) are successfully fabricated via incorporating ultrathin Mo layer on the surface of Mo2C matrix, exhibiting superior catalytic activity toward HER.








Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) achieve 100% utilization of metal atoms and have versatile support effects, whereas single atom alloys (SAAs) with metallic bonds own the free&#8208;atom&#8208;like electronic structure. Herein, surface single atom alloys (SSAAs) are developed that integrate the advantages of SACs and SAAs via incorporating an ultrathin metallic layer during the synthetic process of SACs. It is shown that the Pt single atom preferentially coordinates with metallic Mo nanolayer, thereby forming a Pt1&#8208;MoL surface atom alloy on Mo2C (marked as Pt1&#8208;MoL&#8208;Mo2C SSAAs). Comprehensive spectroscopic and theoretical calculations reveal that the Mo nanolayer in SSAAs not only functions as an electron buffer between Pt1 and Mo2C, leading to a free&#8208;atom&#8208;like d state at Pt1 sites and thereby balancing the adsorption and desorption of H, but also enhances the aggregation, adsorption, and activation of H2O. Consequently, the Pt1&#8208;MoL&#8208;Mo2C SSAAs exhibit superior alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance compared to Pt1/Mo2C SACs, achieving a low overpotential of 12&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a low Tafel slope of 17&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights into the design of advanced single&#8208;site catalysts.

         <title>Observation of Conductive Interstitial Ga Line Defects in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using near&#8208;field infrared and atomic&#8208;resolution transmission electron imaging, a novel phenomenon is observed: the presence of conductive interstitial Ga line defects within &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanoflakes. These defects lead to an associated increase in conductivity, which in turn results in a broadband infrared response and the quenching of cathodoluminescence. Functioning as an antenna, these defects can excite phonon polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride cladding layers, offering exciting prospects for applications in nanophotonic devices.








Abstract
Beta&#8208;phase gallium sesquioxide (&#946;&#8208;Ga2O3), possessing an ultrawide bandgap and high breakdown voltage, exhibits strong potential for deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetection and high&#8208;power electronics. However, nanometer&#8208;scale line defects, prevalent in &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 growth, degrade device performance by increasing leakage currents and reducing breakdown voltages, thus termed &#8220;killer defects&#8221;. Critically, the impact of these defects at the atomic scale remains unclear due to limited characterization and a lack of detailed understanding. Here, the observation of novel conductive atomic line defects is reported within &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 nanoflakes using near&#8208;field infrared imaging. Combining atomic&#8208;resolution imaging with density functional theory calculations, these defects are identified as interstitial Ga atoms migrating along the c&#8208;axis. These atomic line defects exhibit a broadband infrared response and quenched cathodoluminescence, indicative of significantly enhanced local conductivity. This elevated conductivity enables subsurface near&#8208;field detection of the defects and remote excitation of phonon polaritons in a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) capping layer. These findings underscore the distinct conductivity of atomic&#8208;scale line defects, emphasizing the need for their controlled management during material synthesis and device fabrication, while simultaneously suggesting opportunities for their exploitation in nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Mediated Nanocathode for Synchronized Generation of Picosecond Pulsed Electron Beam and Electromagnetic Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative plasmon&#8208;mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathode is developed through gold nanoparticle&#8208;decorated vertically aligned few&#8208;layer graphene, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond electron pulses and GHz electromagnetic radiation. This room&#8208;temperature system achieves exceptional performance of 8.81 &#215; 109 A&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;sr&#8722;1&#183;V&#8722;1 brightness and 0.97 eV energy spread, while operating at moderate excitation, offering a promising platform for compact and high&#8208;efficiency vacuum electronic devices.









Abstract
Vacuum electronic devices offer superior electron mobility and spatiotemporal electron manipulating precision, with recent challenges focusing on ultrafast electron pulses for high&#8208;frequency, high&#8208;energy, and high&#8208;resolution applications. Plasmon&#8208;mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathodes provide a promising solution by producing high&#8208;quality ultrafast electron pulses while simplifying the electron beam manipulation. In this study, we developed a PMEE Au&#8208;on&#8208;Gr nanocathode using vertically aligned few&#8208;layer graphene decorated with gold nanoparticles, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond pulsed electron beam and electromagnetic radiation. The nanocathode achieved 80 MHz electron pulses with a 500 ps pulsewidth, 0.91 A&#183;cm&#8722;2 peak current density, 6.53% external quantum efficiency, and 8.81 &#215; 109 A&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;sr&#8722;1&#183;V&#8722;1 reduced brightness.

&lt;p&gt;An innovative plasmon-mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathode is developed through gold nanoparticle-decorated vertically aligned few-layer graphene, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond electron pulses and GHz electromagnetic radiation. This room-temperature system achieves exceptional performance of 8.81 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; A&#183;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; brightness and 0.97 eV energy spread, while operating at moderate excitation, offering a promising platform for compact and high-efficiency vacuum electronic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vacuum electronic devices offer superior electron mobility and spatiotemporal electron manipulating precision, with recent challenges focusing on ultrafast electron pulses for high-frequency, high-energy, and high-resolution applications. Plasmon-mediated electron emission (PMEE) nanocathodes provide a promising solution by producing high-quality ultrafast electron pulses while simplifying the electron beam manipulation. In this study, we developed a PMEE Au-on-Gr nanocathode using vertically aligned few-layer graphene decorated with gold nanoparticles, enabling synchronized generation of picosecond pulsed electron beam and electromagnetic radiation. The nanocathode achieved 80 MHz electron pulses with a 500 ps pulsewidth, 0.91 A&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; peak current density, 6.53% external quantum efficiency, and 8.81 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; A&#183;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; reduced brightness. Additionally, it exhibited a 7.1&#176; divergence angle and 0.97 eV energy spread under low excitations. Synchronized radiation pulses at 2.3, 5.7, and 9.2 GHz corresponded to electron pulse features. The excellent performance stems from plasmonic field enhancement and efficient hot electron generation driven by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in the PMEE nanocathode. The dynamic effects of high-energy hot electron injection at the Au-Gr interface also play a critical role. This system enables compact, room-temperature, low-power vacuum electronic devices for ultra-high spatiotemporal resolution and high-frequency applications, driving progress in materials science and nanotechnology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface&#8208;Controlled Redox Chemistry in Aqueous Mn2&#8314;/MnO&#8322; Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores how interfacial redox mediation influences Mn2&#8314;/MnO&#8322; conversion, focusing on local environmental regulation. It is found that the VO2&#8314;/VO&#8322;&#8314; redox couple stabilizes pH, controls H&#8322;O activity, and mediates Mn3&#8314;, enabling 100% Mn2&#8314;/MnO&#8322; conversion. This approach suppresses Mn degradation, extends electrode lifespan, and achieves record&#8208;high electrode capacity (100&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2), offering a breakthrough for static Mn2+/MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Manganese dioxide (MnO2) deposition/dissolution (Mn2+/MnO2) chemistry, involving a two&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer process, holds promise for safe and eco&#8208;friendly large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, challenges like electrode/electrolyte interface environment fluctuations (H+ and H2O activity), irreversible Mn degradation, and limited understanding of degradation mechanisms hinder the reversibility of the Mn2+/MnO2 conversion. This study demonstrates a vanadyl/pervanadyl (VO2+/VO2+) redox&#8208;mediated interface designed for high&#8208;energy Mn2+/MnO2 batteries. Unlike flow systems, this work uncovers, for the first time, the mechanism of a static redox&#8208;mediated interface in regulating interfacial H+ and H2O activities. Significantly, the VO2+/VO2+ chemical redox mediation targets Mn3+ intermediates, suppressing their hydrolysis and enabling 100% Mn2+/MnO2 conversion. The redox&#8208;mediated interface enhances the Mn redox electron transfer process, achieving a stable &#8776;95% coulombic efficiency and ultrahigh capacity of 100&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an areal energy density of 111&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;2, outperforming flow systems. The electrode also exhibits an average specific capacity of 593&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical limit of 616&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, and a specific energy density of 721&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at high MnO2 loadings (50&#8211;150&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2). The findings highlight the critical role of interfacial redox mediation in regulating H+ and H2O activities and underscore the significance of interface dynamics.

         <title>Modular Design of T Cell Nanoengagers for Tumor Immunotherapy via Genetically Engineered Lipid&#8208;Tagged Antibody Fragments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;display&#8221; strategy for constructing T cell nanoengagers by directly embedding genetically engineered lipid&#8208;tagged antibodies into lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles. This versatile approach enables the design of both bi&#8208; and tri&#8208;specific nanoengagers, which effectively recruit T cells to tumor cells, enhance T cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity, and mitigate T cell exhaustion.









Abstract
T cell engagers, which bind tumor&#8208;associated antigens and T cell specific molecules, represent a promising class of immunotherapies for enhancing targeted immune responses. Here, a &#8220;plug&#8208;and&#8208;display&#8221; platform is introduced for engineering T cell nanoengagers by anchoring antibody fragments into lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles. This approach utilizes a genetically engineered lipoprotein fused with single&#8208;chain variable fragments (scFv) and nanobodies, which spontaneously integrate into lipid bilayer of the nanoparticles, achieving a high surface density of at least 0.102&#160;scFv&#160;nm&#8722;2 (&#8776;3200&#160;scFv per particle). Modular bi&#8208;specific (Lipo&#8208;BiTE) and tri&#8208;specific (Lipo&#8208;TriTE) immunoliposomes are designed to enhance anti&#8208;tumor T cell immune responses. The Lipo&#8208;BiTE, integrating anti&#8208;CD3 and anti&#8208;HER2 scFv at an optimized surface density of 1.28&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;scFv&#160;nm&#8722;2, exhibits enhanced CD8+ T cell&#8208;mediated cytotoxicity in HER2&#8208;positive tumor models by simultaneously engaging tumor cells and T cells. Incorporating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 nanobodies to create Lipo&#8208;TriTE further addresses T cell exhaustion. This modular platform provides a robust foundation for designing immune cell engagers, with broad applications in targeted immunotherapy.

         <title>Superwetting&#8208;Enabled In Situ Silicification for Artificial Silicified Wood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superwetting&#8208;enabled in situ silicification strategy is proposed to fabricate artificial silicified wood without high pressure and high temperature. The artificial silicified wood exhibits super flexural strength (&#8776;216.49 MPa) and resistance to termites (98.70% mass retention) and fungi (over 90.64% mass retention), meeting the highest AWPA and ASTM standards. This method offers a promising approach to the conservation of wooden artifacts.








Abstract
Wooden artifacts have attracted comprehensive concern as the witnesses of human civilization; however, their conservation suffers from many difficulties, such as natural degradation and biological invasion. Silicified wood, as a fossil material that has existed for millions of years, provides a valuable clue for the long&#8208;term conservation of wooden materials. In this work, a superwetting&#8208;enabled in situ silicification strategy is reported to silicify wood in a confined way, fabricating artificial silicified wood within 100 h. The superwetting process of the silica sol enables multi&#8208;scale high silica filling throughout the entire wood from the nanoscale to the macroscale. The artificial silicified wood shows a high flexural strength of &#8776;216.49&#160;MPa and super resistance against termites and fungi. The artificial silicified wood retains 98.70% of its mass against termites, and over 90.64% of its mass against fungi, meeting the safest level in the global standards. The finding provides a general silicification approach for wood&#8208;like materials with complex hierarchical structures and a promisingly alternative solution for the conservation of wooden artifacts.

A novel near&#8208;infrared II J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine has been observed to target tumor tissue and achieve effective penetration and prolonged retention in tumor tissue using an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy. These nanomedicines induce tumor pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species (superoxide anions), facilitating robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and activating tumor photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism that bypasses apoptosis resistance and triggers tumor&#8208;specific immune responses, has gained much attention as a promising approach to cancer therapy. Despite enhancing tumor accumulation and extending the circulation of small&#8208;molecule drugs, nanomedicines still face significant challenges, including poor tissue penetration, tumor resistance, and hypoxic microenvironments. To overcome these challenges, a novel near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;based nanomedicine is designed, leveraging an in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly strategy to fabricate highly targeted nanoparticles (MSDP NPs). These nanomedicines trigger pyroptosis by generating type I reactive oxygen species, especially superoxide anions, while simultaneously activating photoimmunotherapy. In vivo studies demonstrate that MSDP NPs achieve efficient tumor penetration and prolong tumor&#160;retention, which is facilitated by the J&#8208;aggregate&#8208;driven formation of microscale spindle&#8208;shaped fibrillar bundles through in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly at the tumor site. This unique structural transformation enhances nanomedicine accumulation in tumor tissues, enabling robust NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and improving therapeutic efficacy even in hypoxic tumor microenvironments. This study provides an innovative phototheranostic strategy that utilizes the in situ secondary self&#8208;assembly of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to induce tumor pyroptosis, offering a potential solution to the limitations of current nanomedicines in cancer therapy.

         <title>Ultrahigh Piezoelectric Coefficients Achieved by Tailoring the Sequence and Nano&#8208;Domain Structure of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)</title>

Here, the study reports morphotropic phase boundary like behavior in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer with a unique head&#8208;to&#8208;head/tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail chain structure by the complete hydrogenation of poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene), achieving an outstanding piezoelectric coefficient of &#8722;107 pC/N, over five times higher than commercial polyvinylidene difluoride. This breakthrough enables next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible devices.








Abstract
During past decades, the construction of morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) behavior in ceramic&#8208;based relaxor ferroelectrics has successfully led to a significant enhancement in the piezoelectric coefficient for actuators, transducers, and sensors application. However, MPB&#8208;like behavior is achieved only in the ferroelectric state in flexible ferroelectric polymers such as poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) with the highest piezoelectric coefficients of &#8776;&#8722;63.5 pC/N, due to the lack of a rational design in polymer chain structure and composition. Here, the study reports the first MPB&#8208;like behavior observed in a relaxor ferroelectric polymer synthesized by fully hydrogenating poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;chlorotrifluoroethylene), which are primarily linked in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head/tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner, and trifluoroethylene units are randomly dispersed along the molecular chain. The unique polymer chain structure is found to be responsible for the formation of conformations disorder, thus strong relaxor behavior, and phase transition from an all&#8208;trans conformation to 3/1 helix, thus inducing phase boundary behavior. As a result, an outstanding longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient of &#8722;107 pC/N, more than five times higher than that of commercial poly(vinylidene fluoride) (&#8722;20 pC/N), is observed. This work opens up a new gate for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible devices.

         <title>A Microphase Separation&#8208;Driven Supramolecular Tissue Adhesive with Instantaneous Dry/Wet Adhesion, Alcohol&#8208;Triggered Debonding, and Antibacterial Hemostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microphase separation&#8208;driven supramolecular tissue adhesive based on guanidinium&#8208;functionalized polydimethylsiloxane exhibits instantaneous adhesion in both dry and wet environments. In the meantime, this material demonstrates the capacity for antibacterial hemostasis upon application to biological tissues and can be readily removed from tissue surfaces through wet wiping with medical&#8208;grade alcohol.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives are promising materials for expeditious hemorrhage control, while it remains a grand challenge to engineer a superior formulation with instantaneous adhesion, on&#8208;demand debonding, and the integration of multiple desirable properties such as antibacterial and hemostatic capabilities. Herein, a multifunctional supramolecular tissue adhesive based on guanidinium&#8208;modified polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is introduced, driven by a reversible microphase separation mechanism. By optimizing the content of guanidinium ions, precise control over cohesive strength, adhesion, and wettability is achieved, resulting in strong instantaneous adhesion under both dry and wet conditions. Notably, the supramolecular nature of the adhesive allows for convenient on&#8208;demand removal using medical&#8208;grade alcohol, offering a critical advantage for easy debonding. Additionally, the adhesive exhibits remarkable antimicrobial properties while maintaining excellent biocompatibility and hemocompatibility. Its underwater injectability supports minimally invasive surgical procedures. Furthermore, the adhesive's ability to incorporate solid particles enhances its versatility, particularly for the development of drug&#8208;embedded bioadhesives. This work addresses key challenges in tissue adhesive design via a microphase separation&#8208;driven working principle, thereby opening promising new avenues for the development of advanced bioadhesives with tailored properties and enhanced surgical and wound care outcomes.

         <title>An Optimized Aerogel&#8208;Based Apheresis Device for Targeted Lipid Clearance in Elderly Hyperlipidemia Patients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces an aerogel apheresis device specifically designed for hyperlipidemia management in elderly patients. Leveraging the unique properties of aerogels, LipClean achieves selective lipid adsorption from plasma while maintaining efficiency and biocompatibility. The optimized hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic network ensures effective water permeability and reduces the unintended removal of essential plasma components.








Abstract
Elderly patients with hyperlipidemia often exhibit resistance to conventional hypolipidemic treatments, underscoring the need for more effective strategies to address lipid imbalances in this high&#8208;risk group. This study introduces LipClean, an aerogel&#8208;based apheresis device specifically designed to remove harmful plasma lipids. LipClean is constructed using hydrophilic cellulose fibers, which serve as a supramolecular platform for synthesizing hydrophobic conjugated polymers through a Sonogashira&#8208;Hagihara reaction. These conjugated polymers are then cross&#8208;linked with the cellulose fibers via phosphorylation, generating an aerogel monolith with an interpenetrating network of hydrophilic fibers and hydrophobic polymers. Unlike bilayer aerogels that separate hydrophilic and hydrophobic layers, LipClean's interpenetrating structure is precisely engineered through polymer design and gradient cross&#8208;linking. This optimization enhances both bodily fluid flow and lipid adsorption while minimizing the removal of essential plasma components and ensuring unobstructed cell passage. In preclinical testing, LipClean significantly reduced triglyceride and cholesterol levels in an elderly rat model of hyperlipidemia and normalized lipid levels in blood samples from hypertensive patients. Importantly, purified blood maintained normal levels of blood cells and physiological and biochemical indicators after apheresis, highlighting LipClean's potential for managing hyperlipidemia&#8208;related disorders. This study, therefore, underscores the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving medical device innovation.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processable PEDOT for Organic Solar Cells: From One&#8208;Pot Synthesis to Kinetically&#8208;Controlled Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that the synthesis of solution&#8208;processable poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) hole transporting materials (HTMs) follows the principle of oxidative polymerization&#8208;induced electrostatic self&#8208;assembly (OPIESA), with the kinetic behavior strongly correlated to the volume of the polyanion matrix, and propose a kinetically&#8208;controlled polymerization (KCP) approach to synthesize solution&#8208;processable, high&#8208;performance PEDOT HTMs by halting the polymerization at certain stages within a low&#8208;volume polyanion matrix.








Abstract
The updating of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transporting material (HTM) is crucial for organic solar cells (OSCs). Despite decades of development in PEDOT:PSS and its derivatives, a comprehensive understanding of their supramolecular polymerization mechanisms remains elusive, precluding the attainment of the optimal architectures and functions. Herein, it is shown that the synthesis of PEDOT:PSS follows the principle of oxidative polymerization&#8208;induced electrostatic self&#8208;assembly, with the kinetic behavior strongly correlated to the volume of PSS polyanion matrix. Moreover, a kinetically controlled polymerization approach is proposed to synthesize PEDOT HTMs with exceptional time efficiency by prematurely halting the rapid polymerization process within a low&#8208;volume PSS matrix. The reduced interference from PSS confers unique advantages to the methodology in achieving highly oxidized and interconnected PEDOTs. This leads to comprehensive improvements in the physico&#8208;chemical properties of PEDOT:PSS, significantly enhancing OSC efficiency to 20.04%. Furthermore, the optimized PEDOT maintains exceptional semiconducting characteristics and outstanding OSC efficiency even at an unprecedentedly high PSS insulator content of 94.12%. The substantial increase in loading significantly amplifies the manifestation of polyanion functionalities, such as improving colloidal stability, thereby facilitating the resurgence of previously underutilized naphthalene sulfonate polyanion in the fabrication of high&#8208;quality, solution&#8208;processable PEDOT HTMs.

         <title>An Implantable In&#8208;Hydrogel Wireless Supercapacitor&#8208;Activated Neuron System Enables Bidirectional Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An implantable wireless supercapacitor&#8208;activated neuro (W&#8208;SCAN) system consisting of the coil, diode bridge circuit, in&#8208;hydrogel supercapacitor, and stimulation electrodes has been developed for neuronal excitation and inhibition. By applying an adjustable electric field to stimulation electrodes, a spontaneously induced ionic oscillatory stimulation within tissue fluids is generated, which enables electro&#8208;interventional therapy for brain&#8208;related neurological disorders.








Abstract
The bidirectional modulation of cerebral neurons in the brain possesses enhancement and inhibition of neural activity, which is of great interest in the treatment of motor nerve disorders and emotional disorders, and cognitive defects. However, existing approaches usually rely on electrical/electrochemical stimulations, which show low security by implanting metal probes and unidirectional currents with single modulation. Herein, an implantable in&#8208;hydrogel wireless supercapacitor&#8208;activated neuron system consisting of the coil, diode bridge circuit, in&#8208;hydrogel supercapacitor, and stimulation electrodes is fabricated, which provides a bidirectional and adjustable ion diffusion current to safely and effectively excite and inhibit brain neurons. The designed in&#8208;hydrogel supercapacitor exhibits a high storage charge ability of &#8776;90 times larger than the devices without hydrogel encapsulation, owing to the in situ radical addition mechanism. Moreover, the in&#8208;hydrogel electrodes are implanted into the thalamus, amygdala, and prefrontal lobes of the brain to evoke the corresponding changes in potential intensity and frequency through the external chargeable coil and diode bridge circuit, which verifies the potential of the multimodule supercapacitor in amelioration and treatment Parkinson's, severe depression, and Alzheimer's disease.

         <title>Ultrasound Tip&#8208;Assisted Piezotronic Transduction in Monolayer MoS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric transduction in monolayer MoS2 is demonstrated using an ultrasound tip (&#160;100 kHz) from a wire bonder. Transient current measurements reveal sharp peaks with high peak&#8208;to&#8208;base ratios, tunable via gate voltage and ultrasound power. Multiple acoustic wave reflections enhance signal linewidth, validated by microacoustic simulations, establishing a robust platform for ultrasound&#8208;driven piezoelectric sensing.








Abstract
The interaction of ultrasonic waves with piezoelectric materials provides a quantitative route to enhance electrical and mechanical coupling in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. Here, wire&#8208;bonding tip&#8208;assisted ultrasound (&#8776;100 kHz) is presented as an effective approach to achieve piezoelectric transduction in monolayer MoS2 on Si/SiO2 substrates. Transient current measurements show reproducible sharp peaks with a peak&#8208;to&#8208;base ratio (Ipeak/Ibase &#8776; 12) unique to monolayer MoS2, under an impact duration of 10&#8211;100 ms. Electrostatic gate voltage (Vg) and ultrasound power (WP) tunable piezocurrent exhibit 3&#8211;5 times higher sensitivity in the ON&#8208;state (Vg &#10878; 0) compared to the OFF&#8208;state. Multiple reflections of acoustic waves at source&#8208;drain electrodes, with an increment in reflection coefficients, enhance the linewidth of peak currents, validated by microacoustic simulations of surface acoustic wave (SAW) propagation in submicron geometries. The localized strain and Joule heating under ultrasonic excitation may generate a temperature rise of &#8776;20 K, which reduces activation energy barriers, potentially enhancing reaction rates in temperature&#8208;sensitive chemical processes, such as hydrogen peroxide decomposition. This thermal&#8208;damage&#8208;free method integrates with silicon&#8208;based fabrication, establishing a robust platform for on&#8208;chip catalysis and energy harvesting in FET&#8208;based&#160;piezotransducers.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Skyrmion Bags</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates stabilization of complex magnetic skyrmion bags in ferromagnetic thin films through precisely engineered anisotropy defects using ion irradiation. The researchers achieve controlled field&#8208; and laser&#8208;induced generation of skyrmionia, target skyrmions, and higher&#8208;order skyrmion bags at room temperature. This reliable platform opens opportunities for studying the dynamics of these topological textures and their implementation in advanced spintronic devices.








Abstract
Topologically non&#8208;trivial magnetic solitons are complex spin textures with a distinct single&#8208;particle nature. Although magnetic skyrmions, especially those with unity topological charge, have attracted substantial interest due to their potential applications, more complex topological textures remain largely theoretical. In this work, the stabilization of isolated higher&#8208;order skyrmion bags beyond the prototypical &#960;&#8208;skyrmion in ferromagnetic thin films is experimentally demonstrate, which has posed considerable challenges to date. Specifically, controlled generation of skyrmionium (2&#960;&#8208;skyrmion), target skyrmion (3&#960;&#8208;skyrmion), and skyrmion bags (with variable topological charge) are achieved through the introduction of artificially engineered anisotropy defects via local ion irradiation. They act as preferential sites for the field&#8208; or laser&#8208;induced nucleation of skyrmion bags. Remarkably, ultrafast laser pulses achieve a substantially higher conversion rate transforming skyrmions into higher&#8208;order skyrmion bags compared to their formation driven by magnetic fields. High&#8208;resolution x&#8208;ray imaging enables direct observation of the resulting skyrmion bags. Complementary micromagnetic simulations reveal the pivotal role of defect geometry&#8211;particularly diameter&#8211;in stabilizing closed&#8208;loop domain textures. The findings not only broaden the experimental horizon for skyrmion research, but also suggest strategies for exploiting complex topological spin textures within a unified material platform for practical&#160;applications.

         <title>Characterization and Inverse Design of Stochastic Mechanical Metamaterials Using Neural Operators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a DeepONet&#8208;based machine learning framework for designing stochastic mechanical metamaterials with tailored nonlinear mechanical properties. By leveraging sparse but high&#8208;quality experimental data from in situ micro&#8208;mechanical tests, high predictive accuracy and enable efficient inverse design are achieved. This approach integrates experimental mechanics and AI, advancing next&#8208;generation metamaterials for aerospace, healthcare, and energy applications.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a transformative tool for the design of mechanical metamaterials, offering properties that far surpass those achievable through lab&#8208;based trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods. However, a major challenge in current inverse design strategies is their reliance on extensive computational and/or experimental datasets, which becomes particularly problematic for designing micro&#8208;scale stochastic architected materials that exhibit nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Here, a comprehensive end&#8208;to&#8208;end scientific ML framework, leveraging deep neural operators (including DeepONet and its variants) is introduced, to directly learn the relationship between the complete microstructure and mechanical response of architected metamaterials from sparse but high&#8208;quality in situ experimental data. Various neural operators and standard neural networks are systematically compared to identify the model that offers better interpretability and accuracy. The approach facilitates the efficient inverse design of structures tailored to specific nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Results obtained from stochastic spinodal microstructures, printed using two&#8208;photon lithography, reveal that the prediction error for mechanical responses is within a range of 5 &#8208; 10%. This work underscores that by employing neural operators with advanced nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;mechanical experiments, the design of complex micro&#8208;architected materials with desired properties becomes feasible, even in scenarios constrained by data scarcity. This work marks a significant advancement in the field of materials&#8208;by&#8208;design, potentially heralding a new era in the discovery and development of next&#8208;generation metamaterials with unparalleled mechanical characteristics derived directly from experimental&#160;insights.

         <title>Retarding the Growth Kinetics of Chemical Bath Deposited Nickel Oxide Films for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Minimodules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino&#8208;alcohol ligand with strong binding affinity to Ni2+ is employed to modulate the growth kinetics of chemical bath deposited NiOx for preparing compact NiOx film with superior coverage, enhanced conductivity and reduced defect density, finally realizing the highest efficiency of 26.53% along with great operational stability and scalability for the champion device based on NiOx/SAM hole transport layer.








Abstract
The interfacial contact between the hole transport layer (HTL) and perovskite layer plays a critical role in determining the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, to address the limitations of commercial NiOx nanoparticles and realize low temperature fabrication of compact NiOx film, a chemical bath deposition (CBD) approach is employed and strategically modified. By introducing an amino&#8208;alcohol ligand of triisopropanolamine (TPA) into the precursor, the deposition process is effectively controlled. TPA binds strongly with Ni2+ ions, facilitating their gradual release and promoting the in situ formation of a compact Ni(OH)2 intermediate.

&lt;p&gt;An amino-alcohol ligand with strong binding affinity to Ni2+ is employed to modulate the growth kinetics of chemical bath deposited NiOx for preparing compact NiOx film with superior coverage, enhanced conductivity and reduced defect density, finally realizing the highest efficiency of 26.53% along with great operational stability and scalability for the champion device based on NiOx/SAM hole transport layer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interfacial contact between the hole transport layer (HTL) and perovskite layer plays a critical role in determining the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, to address the limitations of commercial NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles and realize low temperature fabrication of compact NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; film, a chemical bath deposition (CBD) approach is employed and strategically modified. By introducing an amino-alcohol ligand of triisopropanolamine (TPA) into the precursor, the deposition process is effectively controlled. TPA binds strongly with Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, facilitating their gradual release and promoting the in situ formation of a compact Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate. This retarded growth kinetics yield high-quality NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; films with enhanced coverage, increased conductivity, and reduced trap-state. The films also feature abundant hydroxyl groups, providing sufficient anchoring sites for MeO-2PACz. Based on this bilayer HTL, a PCE of 26.53% (certified 26.44%) with improved operational stability is achieved for the 0.09&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; device, marking the highest efficiency for inverted PSCs based on CBD NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, the strategy demonstrates excellent scalability, delivering efficiencies of 24.75% for a 1&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; device and 22.96% for a 12.96&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; minimodule. This work provides a facile but effective CBD approach for preparing high-quality NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; films, offering a promising and scalable pathway for inverted PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Time&#8208;Resolved Ratiometric Fluorescence Nanothermometer for Real&#8208;Time Endoscopic Temperature Guidance during Tumor Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a time&#8208;resolved ratiometric fluorescence nanothermometer with high quantum yield and exceptional thermal sensitivity, enabling rapid and accurate in vivo temperature imaging by eliminating the interference of wavelength&#8208;dependent signal attenuation and autofluorescence. A further developed fluorescence temperature endoscopy system overcomes the light penetration limitation, realizing real&#8208;time temperature guidance during liver tumor ablation in rabbit model.








Abstract
Thermal ablation is a common treatment option for early&#8208;stage cancers, but the lack of real&#8208;time temperature imaging feedback method increases the risk of incomplete or excessive ablation. Although ratiometric nanothermometer offers a rapid temperature imaging solution, accurate in vivo signal extraction remains challenging due to the autofluorescence and wavelength&#8208;dependent tissue absorption and scattering. Herein, a time&#8208;resolved ratiometric fluorescence nanothermometer composed of europium and iridium complex with identical working wavelength but distinguishing lifetimes is reported, whose well&#8208;designed structures enable 450&#160;nm excitation of both complexes with a high quantum yield (57.8%). Based on the nanothermometer, accurate signal extraction is realized in whole blood, beneath a 2 cm tissue phantom and a 5 mm pork slice through a time&#8208;resolved ratiometric method. By leveraging the exceptional thermal sensitivity (6.9% K&#8722;1), high temperature resolution (0.02 K), and clinically relevant temperature range (30&#8211;96&#160;&#176;C) of the nanothermometer, a fluorescence temperature endoscopy system is further designed with a real&#8208;time temperature imaging speed of 10 fps, which is applied to minimally invasive temperature monitoring during microwave ablation of liver tumors in rabbits, realizing precise ablation control through dynamic ablation power adjustment. The real&#8208;time and accurate temperature imaging performance of the nanothermometer may offer a new perspective for intraoperative guidance.

         <title>Golden Single&#8208;Atom Alloys Selectively Boosting Oxygen Reduction and Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic design and control of golden single&#8208;atom alloys (PdAu1 and PtAu1 SAAs) are achieved by taking full advantage of the intrinsically isolated Bi atoms in fully ordered PdBi and PtBi matrixes, serving as highly selective, active, and stable cathode oxygen reduction and anode methanol oxidation electrocatalysts, respectively, to trigger a direct methanol fuel cell with high power density.








Abstract
Engineering electrocatalysts at a single&#8208;atomic site can enable unprecedented atomic utilization and catalytic activity, yet it remains challenging in multimetallic active centers to simultaneously achieve high catalytic selectivity and stability. Herein, the atomic design and control of golden single&#8208;atom alloys (PdAu1 and PtAu1 SAAs) based on fully ordered PdBi and PtBi matrixes is presented, serving as highly selective, active, and stable cathode and anode electrocatalysts, respectively, to trigger direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC). The octahedral PdAu1 SAA exhibits ultrahigh mass&#8208;activity of 5.37 A mgPd + Au&#8722;1 without noticeable decay for 12&#160;0000 cycles toward oxygen reduction. While PdAu1 SAA is inactive for methanol oxidation, PtAu1 SAA exhibits an ultrahigh mass&#8208;activity of 28.59 A mgPt + Au&#8722;1. The selective electrocatalysts drive a practical DMFC with a high&#8208;power density of 155.0&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations reveal the desired regulation of selectivity via reducing the energy barrier for potential&#8208;determining steps (PDS) of *OH to H2O and *HCOO to CO2. This work provides a general strategy to engineer multimetallic alloys at the atomic level, advancing the development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts.

         <dc:description>
This study presents glutathione&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ) targeting prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen to deliver a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor. The system simultaneously suppresses P&#8208;glycoprotein&#8208;mediated drug resistance, enhances chemotherapy sensitivity, and reprograms immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments by inactivating myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, offering a dual chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic strategy against advanced prostate cancer.








Abstract
Acquired drug resistance and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment significantly limit the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer. Blocking the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway has been recently proved as a new strategy to improve sensitivity to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Herein, glutathione (GSH)&#8208;sensitive nanoparticles (PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ) are developed that can target prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA), loaded with PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor prodrug BEZ235. BEZ235 can be released from PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ in response to elevated GSH levels in prostate cancer tissues, inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and impairing downstream cellular functions such as cell proliferation, DNA repair, and protein synthesis. When combined with paclitaxel, PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ could reduce drug efflux by downregulating P&#8208;glycoprotein expression in cancer cells, thus enhancing the sensitivity to chemotherapy. Furthermore, PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ could impair the immunosuppressive functions of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells and reshape the &#8220;cold&#8221; immune microenvironment in prostate cancer, enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy and including long&#8208;term immune memory against tumor recurrence. PSMA&#8208;NP/BEZ serves a safe and promising strategy to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced prostate cancer.

         <title>Titanium&#8210;Nickel Dual Active Sites Enabled Reversible Hydrogen Storage of Magnesium at 180&#160;&#176;C with Exceptional Cycle Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst, featuring Mg2Ni and stable Ti&#9472;MgO with stable Ti valence state, is applied to Mg/MgH2. It simultaneously facilitates the hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation processes, enabling moderate&#8208;temperature hydrogen storage reactions with long&#8208;term cycle stability. These findings suggest the importance of combining early&#8208; and late&#8208;transition metals in a gas&#8208;solid phase reaction.








Abstract
Enhancing hydrogenation and dehydrogenation (de/hydrogenation) kinetics without compromising cycle stability is a major challenge for Mg&#8208;based hydrogen storage materials (Mg/MgH2). The de/hydrogenation reactions of Mg/MgH2 are one of the gas&#8211;solid reactions involving hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation, which often results in the catalysts being unable to simultaneously accelerate these distinct kinetic processes. Here, the Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst with dual active sites is reported to be designed to address this issue. The stabilization of Ti2+ and Ti3+ valence states in the MgO lattice simultaneously accelerates hydrogen adsorption and dissociation. Additionally, Mg2Ni serves as a hydrogen diffusion and nucleation center, synergistically enhancing de/hydrogenation reactions. Consequently, it enables MgH2 to release 5.28&#160;wt.% H2 in 2&#160;min at 280&#160;&#176;C, and achieves 1.96&#160;wt.% H2 of hydrogen release in 60&#160;min at 180&#160;&#176;C. The Mg2Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst exhibits remarkable chemical stability at the interfacial structure, minimizing structural and chemical degradation impact, and realizing excellent de/hydrogenation performance over 1000 cycles. These results provide a new methodology for optimizing multiple kinetic steps, attaining highly efficient and stable de/hydrogenation reactions.

The de/hydrogenation reactions of Mg/MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are one of the gas&#8211;solid reactions involving hydrogen adsorption, dissociation, diffusion, and nucleation, which often results in the catalysts being unable to simultaneously accelerate these distinct kinetic processes. Here, the Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst with dual active sites is reported to be designed to address this issue. The stabilization of Ti&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; valence states in the MgO lattice simultaneously accelerates hydrogen adsorption and dissociation. Additionally, Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni serves as a hydrogen diffusion and nucleation center, synergistically enhancing de/hydrogenation reactions. Consequently, it enables MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to release 5.28&#160;wt.% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 2&#160;min at 280&#160;&#176;C, and achieves 1.96&#160;wt.% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of hydrogen release in 60&#160;min at 180&#160;&#176;C. The Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni@Ti&#9472;MgO catalyst exhibits remarkable chemical stability at the interfacial structure, minimizing structural and chemical degradation impact, and realizing excellent de/hydrogenation performance over 1000 cycles. These results provide a new methodology for optimizing multiple kinetic steps, attaining highly efficient and stable de/hydrogenation reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art, Insights, and Perspectives for MOFs&#8208;Nanocomposites and MOF&#8208;Derived (Nano)Materials</title>

Different approaches to MOF&#8208;NP composite formation, such as ship&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;bottle, bottle&#8208;around&#8208;the&#8208;ship and in situ one&#8208;step synthesis, are used. Owing to synergistic effects, the advantageous features of the components of the composites are beneficially combined, and their individual drawbacks are mitigated. In this way, the performance in applications ranging from batteries and supercapacitors to chemical catalysis, electrocatalysis, sensing, photodegradation of contaminants, and biomedicine is boosted.








Abstract
Composite structures created from metal&#8210;organic framework (MOF) matrices are reviewed in this work. Depending on the nature of the second component apart from the MOF platform, several synergistic properties may arise; at the same time, the initial features of the single constituent materials are usually maintained, and individual shortcomings are mitigated. Currently, timely energy and environmental challenges necessitate the quest for more advanced materials and technologies. Significant developments in MOF&#8208;nanocomposites have enabled their application across a wide range of modern and traditional fields. This review demonstrates in an exhaustive and critical way a broad range of MOF&#8208;based nanocomposites, namely, MOF/perovskite nanoparticles (NPs), MOF/metal (non&#8208;iron) oxide NPs, MOF/Fe3O4 NPs, MOF/metal chalcogenide NPs, MOF/metal NPs, and MOF/carbon&#8208;based materials, as well as nanocomposites of MOFs with other semiconductor NPs. Key points related to the synthesis, characterization, and applications of these materials are provided. Depending on their configuration, the composites under discussion can be applied in domains such as photoelectrochemical sensing, antibiotic/dye degradation, optoelectronics, photovoltaics, catalysis, solar cells, supercapacitors, batteries, water remediation, and drug loading. Sometimes, MOFs can undergo certain processes (e.g. pyrolysis) and act as precursors for composite materials with appealing characteristics. Therefore, a special section in the manuscript is devoted to MOF&#8208;derived NP composites. Toward the end of the text, we conclude while also describing the challenges and possibilities for further investigations in the umbrella of material categories analyzed herein. Despite the progress achieved, key questions remain to be answered regarding the relationships among the morphology, properties, and polyvalent activity of these materials. The present work aims to shed light on most of their aspects and innovative prospects, facilitating a deeper comprehension of the underlying phenomena, functionality, and mechanistic insights governing their behavior.

         <title>Halide Chemistry Boosts All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide chemistry is an emerging approach in promoting the kinetics of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries (ASSLSBs). In this perspective, the distinct roles of halide chemistry are discussed at both the cathode and anode, analyzing the atomic arrangement, phase composition, and morphology evolution in various halogenation strategies. further research and broad discussion of halogenation strategies are expected to inspire ASSLSBs.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries (ASSLSBs) are emerging as a promising energy storage solution due to their low cost and high energy density. Their solid&#8208;state configuration effectively eliminates the notorious shuttle effect caused by soluble polysulfides in conventional liquid electrolytes. However, the heterogeneous solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid interfaces introduce significant challenges, including sluggish ion/electron transport and interfacial instability among electrode materials, conductive additives, and solid electrolytes (SEs). Recently, halide&#8208;based strategies have gained attention for enabling high&#8208;performance ASSLSBs. This perspective highlights these strategies, emphasizing the role of halide chemistry in enhancing ASSLSB kinetics. It is contended that halides (e.g., iodides) in sulfur&#8208;based cathode composites&#8212;such as Li2S and transition metal sulfides&#8212;can activate S/Li2S redox reactions, improving both ionic and electronic conductivities. This &#8220;catalytic effect&#8221; of halides accelerates the reversible transition, even in the absence of conductive additives like SEs or conductive carbons. Moreover, halides at the anode interface play a crucial role in preventing Li dendrite formation and SE degradation, owing to their large polarizability and high interfacial energy. This perspective provides a timely and insightful summary of halide chemistry's impact on ASSLSB kinetics, offering inspiration for further research and broader adoption of halide&#8208;based strategies in next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Insight into the Role of Closed&#8208;Pore Size on Rate Capability of Hard Carbon for Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The correlation between closed&#8208;pore size and Na&#8208;filling potentials and their influence on fast charging performance is unveiled. Smaller closed pores exhibit higher Na&#8208;filling potentials, thereby preventing Na plating at high current rates. A 2.2 Ah pouch cell incorporating optimizes hard carbon material with closed micropores (1.6 nm) and P2&#8208;type layered oxide positive electrodes enables 10 min charging for &#8776;90% of the capacity.








Abstract
The sluggish Na ion diffusion kinetics and Na metal plating in hard carbon negative electrodes restrict the fast&#8208;charging of sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is intricately entwined with the crystal structure and pore structure. Here, the pore structures of hard carbon materials are focused on and reveal that the pore size significantly affects the Na&#8208;filling potentials during the sodiation process. Specifically, the micro closed pores exhibit higher Na&#8208;filling potentials, which reduces risks of Na metal plating at high current densities, thus enabling improved rate performance. As a result, the optimized hard carbon with closed micropores (1.6&#160;nm) achieves an initial capacity exceeding 400 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and a plateau retention rate of 73.3% at a current density of 500&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Paired with P2&#8208;type layered oxide positive electrodes, the 2.2 Ah pouch cell shows 10&#160;min charging for &#8776;90% of the capacity and &#8776;90% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at a 6C rate. This work establishes a bridge between pore size and rate performance, offering guidance for the design of fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Ultrafast Laser Synthesis of Zeolites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study presents a novel ultrafast laser&#8208;driven synthesis technique for zeolites directly in liquid. Laser pulses create a microscopic reactor that controls reaction kinetics at femto&#8208; and picosecond timescales. Nonlinear light&#8208;matter interactions drive nucleation and growth, allowing the process to be paused at any stage of self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
Research demonstrates that zeolite nucleation and growth can be controlled by fine&#8208;tuning chemical composition, temperature, and pressure, resulting in structures with diverse porosities and functionalities. Nevertheless, current energy delivery methods lack the finesse required to operate on the femto&#8208; and picosecond timescales of silica polymerization and depolymerization, limiting their ability to direct synthesis with high precision. To overcome this limitation, an ultrafast laser synthesis technique is introduced, capable of delivering energy at these timescales with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. Unlike conventional or emerging approaches, this method bypasses the need for specific temperature and pressure settings, as nucleation and growth are governed by dynamic phenomena arising from nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, such as convective flows, cavitation bubbles, plasma formation, and shock waves. These processes can be initiated, paused, and resumed within fractions of a second, effectively &#8220;freezing&#8221; structures at any stage of self&#8208;assembly. Using this approach, the entire nucleation and growth pathway of laser&#8208;synthesized TPA&#8208;silicate&#8208;1 zeolites is traced, from early oligomer formation to fully developed crystals. The unprecedented spatiotemporal control of this technique unlocks new avenues for manipulating reaction pathways and exploring the vast configurational space of zeolites.

         <title>Fluorine Engineering Induces Phase Transformation in NiCo2O4 for Enhanced Active Motifs Formation in Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely manipulating the reconstruction process to generate specific active motifs remains challenging during the alkaline OER. NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn, structured with NiCo2O4 cores and (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 shells, facilitate the dual&#8208;metal NiCoOOH active phase with Ov forming at a lower voltage than the single&#8208;metal NiOOH in NiCo2O4, which is demonstrated by in situ Raman and XAFS. The NiCoOOH generation is attributed to the transformation of (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 into NixCo1&#8722;x(OH)2 hydroxide in electrolyte without bias. Consequently, NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn exhibits enhanced OER intrinsic activities compared to NiCo2O4.









Abstract
Dynamic reconstruction of catalysts is key to active site formation in alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but precise control over this process remains challenging. Herein, F&#8208;doped NiCo2O4 (NiCo2O4&#8208;Fn), consisting of a NiCo2O4 core and a (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 shell is reported, which promotes the formation of a dual&#8208;metal NiCoOOH active phase. In situ Raman and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses reveal that the NiCoOOH, rich in oxygen vacancies (Ov), forms at 1.2&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for NiCo2O4&#8208;F1, in contrast to the NiOOH phase formation at 1.4&#160;V versus RHE for undoped NiCo2O4. This is facilitated by the transformation of (NH4)NixCo1&#8722;xF3 into amorphous NixCo1&#8722;x(OH)2 in the KOH electrolyte without bias. Electrochemical tests show that NiCo2O4&#8208;F1 exhibits a 14&#8208;fold increase in intrinsic activity compared to NiCo2O4. Theoretical calculations suggest that Ov&#8208;induced unsaturated Co and Ni sites enhance electroactivity by promoting *OH intermediates adsorption and conversion, lowering the OER energy barrier. The oriented control of NiCoOOH active motifs in NiCo2O4 spinel, achieved through fluorine engineering, paves a new avenue for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Dual Doping of N and F on Co3O4 to Activate the Lattice Oxygen for Efficient and Robust Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel plasma strategy is reported to introduce N and F in Co3O4 (N, F&#8208;Co3O4) simultaneously as the heteroatoms, which enables the OER to occur via the lattice oxygen mechanism. The N, F&#8208;Co3O4 sample exhibits superior OER performance with a low overpotential and superior stability.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a pivotal process in numerous renewable energy conversion technologies. However, its sluggish intrinsic kinetics and intricate transfer process impede the efficient conversion of energy. Activating the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is of paramount importance to break through the theoretical scaling relationship and boost the oxygen evolution catalytic activity. In this contribution, N and F are successfully introduced into Co3O4 simultaneously as heteroatoms via a controllable plasma strategy to modulate the covalency property of metal&#8208;oxygen. Theoretical simulations and experiment results demonstrated that the covalency of the cobalt&#8208;oxygen bond is significantly enhanced under the synergistic effect of N and F, successfully triggering the LOM pathway and facilitating the OER process. The N, F&#8208;Co3O4 composite displays an impressive OER performance, exhibiting a low overpotential of 254&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and remarkable stability at 20, 150, and 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, The N, F&#8208;Co3O4 also exhibits&#160;a low overpotential of 285&#160;mV at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 m KOH + 0.5&#160;m NaCl solution, and remarkable performance on overall water splitting. This work offers profound insights into the OER mechanism and a crucial strategy for enhancing the electrocatalytic activity of spinel oxides.

         <title>Materials Advances in Devices for Heart Disease Interventions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the crucial role of materials in heart disease interventions, focusing on strategies for monitoring, managing, and repairing heart conditions. It discusses the material requirements for medical devices, highlighting recent innovations and their impact on cardiovascular health. It aims to provide insights into the challenges in cardiovascular interventions and the essential role of materials in developing effective solutions.








Abstract
Heart disease encompasses a range of conditions that affect the heart, including coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, congenital heart defects, heart valve disease, and conditions that affect the heart muscle. Intervention strategies can be categorized according to when they are administered and include: 1) Monitoring cardiac function using sensor technology to inform diagnosis and treatment, 2) Managing symptoms by restoring cardiac output, electrophysiology, and hemodynamics, and often serving as bridge&#8208;to&#8208;recovery or bridge&#8208;to&#8208;transplantation strategies, and 3) Repairing damaged tissue, including myocardium and heart valves, when management strategies are insufficient. Each intervention approach and technology require specific material properties to function optimally, relying on materials that support their action and interface with the body, with new technologies increasingly depending on advances in materials science and engineering. This review explores material properties and requirements driving innovation in advanced intervention strategies for heart disease and highlights key examples of recent progress in the field driven by advances in materials research.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Mediated Redox Strategy for Sustainable Lithium Extraction From Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;mediated electrochemical strategy recycles spent LiFePO4 cathodes, extracting lithium as carbonate and producing metallic zinc. Delithiated LiFePO4 is transformed into an efficient oxygen evolution catalyst. This scalable, sustainable approach reduces energy use and emissions while offering economic benefits for clean energy applications.








Abstract
With the widespread application of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, the recycling of spent batteries, especially those involving LiFePO4 (LFP) cathodes for their low&#8208;cost and high safety, has become an urgent environmental and resource challenge. Traditional recycling methods (hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy) struggle to achieve green and efficient recycling. Herein, this study proposes an iodine&#8208;mediated electrochemical strategy to utilize a recyclable I3&#8722;/I&#8722; redox system and efficiently extract Li+ from spent LFP through liquid&#8208;phase reactions on one side (achieving a 93% leaching rate and recovery as lithium carbonate), while simultaneously producing metallic zinc through electrodeposition, which can be directly used in Zn&#8208;air batteries or hydrogen production. Furthermore, the delithiated LFP is upcycled into an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, achieving an overpotential of only 250&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, superior to commercial RuO2 catalysts. Eventually, this system reduces energy consumption by 32% (9.2&#160;MJ kg&#8722;1) compared to traditional hydrometallurgical processes, decreases greenhouse gas emissions by 35% compared to traditional pyrometallurgical processes, while achieving a net profit of &#8776;$0.44 per kg. This work establishes a novel, scalable recycling system, providing a robust sustainable solution for spent LFP cathodes recycling and clean energy storage.

         <title>Perspectives on Devices for Integrated Phononic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phononic devices offer unique advantages in RF applications due to their shorter wavelengths compared to photons. This perspective explores functional phononic devices that can enable integrated phononic circuits. These circuits promise to enable miniaturized communication systems with improved SWaP&#8208;C characteristics, while also finding applications in quantum information science, sensing, and biomedical engineering.








Abstract
The phonon wavelength, being much shorter than that of photons at the same frequency, offers phononic devices a unique niche in radio frequency (RF)&#160;applications. However, the current limitations of these devices, particularly their restricted functionality, hinder their broader integration and application. Currently, many functions are achieved using alternative signal forms like electric and photonic signals, requiring bulky converters to transform between phonon signals and other forms. The development of functional phononic devices paves the way for integrated phononic circuits, which aim to minimize the need for signal conversion while accomplishing all necessary functions. In this perspective, a brief overview of several types of functional phononic devices is provided that hold promise for integration, such as phononic modulators, amplifiers, lasers, nonreciprocal devices, and those inspired by topological physics. It is envisioned that through continued developments in materials, fabrication techniques, and designs, it's possible to realize integrated phononic circuits which will be applied in miniaturized communication devices with reduced size, weight, power consumption, and cost (SWaP&#8208;C), as well as in other fields including quantum information science, sensing, biomedical engineering, and beyond.

         <title>Quantifying Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance Induced Enhancement on Metal@Cu2O Composites for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal@Cu2O composites are developed as platforms to investigate the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) induced enhancement on photoelectrocatalysis. The contributions of two LSPR mechanisms, plasmon&#8208;induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) and hot electron transfer (HET), to the photocurrent are quantified using different bands of incident light, providing a quantitative understanding of the role of PIRET and HET in boosting photoelectrocatalysis.








Abstract
The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of metal nanoparticles can substantially enhance the activity of photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) reactions. However, quantifying the respective contributions of different LSPR mechanisms to the enhancement of PEC performance remains an urgent challenge. In this work, Cu@Cu2O composites prepared by annealing Cu2O under an inert atmosphere and electrodeposited metal@Cu2O composites (MED@Cu2O, MED = CuED, AuED, AgED, PdED, PtED) are employed as platform materials to investigate the LSPR effect on the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). All the composites exhibited remarkably LSPR&#8208;enhanced activity toward PEC HER. The contributions of two LSPR mechanisms, plasmon induced resonance energy transfer (PIRET) and hot electron transfer (HET), to the photocurrent on Cu@Cu2O and CuED@Cu2O are quantified by using different bands of incident light. Moreover, using MED@Cu2O composites, the effects of both the metal species and the applied potential on HET are quantitatively investigated. The results reveal that a pronounced HET enhancement occurs only when the LSPR peak energy is lower than the semiconductor bandgap energy (Eg) and that HET strengthens as the applied potential becomes more negative for PEC HER. This work therefore provides a quantitative understanding of the roles of PIRET and HET in boosting PEC activity.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired Magnetic Shape&#8208;Morphing System for Complex 3D Transformations with Broad Reconfigurability in 3D Displays and Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emulating skin&#8208;texturing capabilities of cephalopods, a magnetic shape&#8208;morphing platform (MMP) is developed to enable systems that reversibly modulate their morphology and stiffness. The MMP, consisting of polymer composites embedded with liquid metal droplets and ferromagnetic particles, achieves complex and sophisticated 3D configurations through thermo&#8208;magnetic stimuli under programmed magnetization profiles. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations suggest potential applications in 3D displays and soft robotics.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;morphing systems capable of actively achieving diverse three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#160;configurations are essential for advancements in 3D electronics and soft robotics. However, current shape&#8208;morphing technologies encounter challenges such as iterative shape reconfiguration with high geometrical complexity, mechanical stability, and slow response times. Inspired by the 3D skin texturing abilities of cephalopods, 3D magnetic shape&#8208;morphing systems are introduced, enabling reversible and continuous transformation with a broad range of complex reconfigurable shapes. This is achieved through thermo&#8208;magnetoactive actuation, guided by magnetization profiles created via a 3D magnetic encoding strategy. The system leverages magnetic shape&#8208;morphing platforms (MMPs) built with a composite containing elastomer mixed with low melting point alloy (LMPA) particles comprising ferromagnetic particles. The MMP can produce intricate, robust 3D configurations using multimodal magnetic actuation facilitated by tunable stiffness and magnetoactive reconfigurability. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations of 3D visio&#8208;tactile displays and light&#8208;responsive flower robots highlight the potential of bioinspired 3D magnetic shape&#8208;morphing systems, suggesting promising applications in 3D electronics, soft robotics, and visio&#8208;haptic human interfacing.

         <title>A Robust and Tough Composite Hydrogel Electrolyte with Anion&#8208;Locked Supramolecular Network for Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite hydrogel electrolyte is prepared by constructing a 3D supramolecular network. The hydrogel electrolyte possesses good mechanical properties, superior ionic conductivity, and high zinc ion transference number, which can inhibit dendrite growth, enable uniform zinc deposition, achieve long cycle life, and realize high capacity retention.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes have garnered extensive attention in zinc ion batteries due to their excellent flexibility and good safety. However, their limited mechanical properties, low ionic conductivity, and poor Zn2+ transference number pose significant challenges for developing high&#8208;performance zinc ion batteries. Herein, this work constructs a 3D supramolecular network capable of locking anions and active water molecules through the abundant hydrogen bonding interactions between aramid nanofibers, polyvinyl alcohol, and anions. This network synergistically enhances the mechanical properties (with a mechanical strength of 0.88&#160;MPa and a toughness of 3.28&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), ionic conductivity (4.22 S m&#8722;1), and Zn2+ transference number (0.78). As a result, the supramolecular composite hydrogel electrolyte can effectively inhibit dendrite growth and side reactions, facilitate interface regulation, and enable uniform zinc deposition. The Zn anode exhibits a cycle life of 1500&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5 mAh cm&#8722;2, with an average coulombic efficiency of 99.1% over 600 cycles. Additionally, the Zn||polyaniline full cell maintains a high capacity retention of 78% after 9100 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. The assembled pouch cells demonstrate good flexibility, deformability, and compression resistance. This work provides valuable insights into the design of high&#8208;performance hydrogel electrolytes for zinc ion batteries.

         <title>Engineering Magnetotactic Bacteria as Medical Microrobots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are living microorganisms that produce magnetosomes for navigation using the Earth's geomagnetic field. Their built&#8208;in magnetic components, along with their intrinsic and/or modified biological functions, make them one of the most promising platforms for making future living and programmable microrobots. This review highlights recent advances in MTB&#8208;based microrobotics, detailing their interactions with magnetic fields, propulsion mechanisms, motion control, and emerging strategies for engineering and functionalizing MTB for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Nature's ability to create complex and functionalized organisms has long inspired engineers and scientists to develop increasingly advanced machines. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB), a group of Gram&#8208;negative prokaryotes that biomineralize iron and thrive in aquatic environments, have garnered significant attention from the bioengineering community. These bacteria possess chains of magnetic nanocrystals known as magnetosomes, which allow them to align with Earth's geomagnetic field and navigate through aquatic environments via magnetotaxis, enabling localization to areas rich in nutrients and optimal oxygen concentration. Their built&#8208;in magnetic components, along with their intrinsic and/or modified biological functions, make them one of the most promising platforms for future medical microrobots. Leveraging an externally applied magnetic field, the motion of MTBs can be precisely controlled, rendering them suitable for use as a new type of biohybrid microrobotics with great promise in medicine for bioimaging, drug delivery, cancer therapy, antimicrobial treatment, and detoxification. This mini&#8208;review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of recent advancements in MTB microrobots, delineates the interaction between MTB microrobots and magnetic fields, elucidates propulsion mechanisms and motion control, and reports state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for modifying and functionalizing MTB for medical applications.

         <title>Efficient Kinetic Separation of Carbon Dioxide from Acetylene Using Mordenites Featuring Modified 1D Channels with Excellent Selectivity and Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the precise recognition of gas molecules with similar kinetic sizes while maintaining high gas diffusivity through the modification of the 1D channels of micrometer&#8208;sized mordenite. The weak acid salt&#8208;modified mordenite NaAlO2@MOR(0.5) exhibits remarkable carbon dioxide/acetylene kinetic selectivity (534.3), and high carbon dioxide capacity and diffusion constant.








Abstract
The design of physical adsorbents for a precise recognition of gas molecules with similar kinetic sizes is of importance as adsorptive separation can serve as an alternative to energy&#8208;intensive distillation processes. However, it is challenging to balance the selectivity, capacity, and adsorption kinetics of the adsorbents. Herein, an efficient kinetic separation of acetylene and carbon dioxide is reported, which have nearly identical kinetic sizes, achieved through modification of the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) channels of a micrometer&#8208;sized mordenite. Under ambient conditions, the weak acid salt&#8208;modified mordenite denoted as NaAlO2@MOR(0.5), exhibits a remarkable kinetic separation selectivity of 534.3 while retaining an excellent diffusivity for CO2. Compared to other adsorbent materials, its dynamic column performance for carbon dioxide significantly exceeds those of molecular sieve materials. In terms of separation selectivity, it is superior to thermodynamic separation adsorbents. The high efficiency of NaAlO2@MOR(0.5) in CO2/C2H2 kinetic separation is validated by column breakthrough experiments. Furthermore, NaAlO2@MOR(0.5) has a low cost and high thermal stability. This study can guide the design of adsorbents that balance selectivity, capacity, and gas diffusivity, to provide a highly efficient kinetic separation of gas molecules with similar kinetic diameters.

Recreating Silk's Fibrillar Nanostructure
In article number 2413786, Martin Zaki, Benjamin James Allardyce, and co&#8208;workers present a new method to solubilise silk without degumming and use it to successfully wet spin fibres with a nanofibrillar structure akin to natural silk, but twice as tough. This new spinning dope, which contains both undegraded fibroin and sericin, spontaneously exhibited naturally&#8208;occurring liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation behaviour, which is likely to be a crucial step in replicating native silk spinning. Cover art by Ella Maru Studios.

Directly Printed Soft 3D Plasmonic Resonators
Conventional 2D plasmonic resonators face limitations in their application to soft electronic platforms due to signal attenuation induced by lossy media. In article number 2418182, Seungjun Chung and co&#8208;workers developed directly printed 3D plasmonic resonators with highly conductive elastomeric composites. Diverse soft 3D resonators demonstrated structural and signal integrities under repetitive strain cycles, highlighting higher Q&#8208;factor resonances even on lossy media.

Organic Redox Mediators
In article number 2415805, Hyun&#8208;Wook Lee, Ji&#8208;Won Hwang, Ja&#8208;Yeong Kim, Shuming Chen, Sung&#8208;Eun Suh, Won&#8208;Jin Kwak, and co&#8208;workers present reactive oxygen&#8208;resistive redox mediator (RM) by rational design strategies based on Bredt's rule. Unlike other bi&#8208;cyclic RMs, the as&#8208;designed RM shows exceptional chemical stability against reactive oxygens and consequently delivers improved electrochemical reversibility with high oxygen yield during cycles.

Rapid Drying
Rapid drying is a key principle for scalable, high&#8208;speed, uniform, and pinhole&#8208;less deposition of 2D materials. Using hot dipping and air knife sweeping (AKS), deposition speeds up to 0.21 m2 min&#8722;1 are achieved, surpassing conventional protocols by 2&#8211;4 orders of magnitude. This approach can extend to 1D and 3D materials if they are uniformly dispersible in rapidly evaporable liquids. More details can be found in article number 2411447 by, Chuan Wang, Dongwook Lee, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Colored Radiative Cooling: from Photonic Approaches to Fluorescent Colors and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colored radiative cooling (CRC) has become a prevailing technology for achieving colorful appearance and simultaneously enhancing the effective solar reflectance of cooling coatings. This review presents recent advancements in CRC and its profound impact on energy savings in real&#8208;world applications. After introducing the fundamentals of CRC and color characterization methods, it reviews CRC coloration approaches, including photonic structural colors, complementary color absorption and Purcell&#8208;enhanced fluorescent colors. The review concludes with self&#8208;adaptive CRC materials featuring dynamic optical modulation and their potentially practical applications as well as critical challenges.









Abstract
Radiative cooling technology is gaining prominence as a sustainable solution for improving thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption associated with cooling demands. To meet diverse functional requirements such as aesthetics, switchable cooling, camouflage, and colored smart windows, color is often preferred over a white opaque appearance in the design of radiative cooling materials. Colored radiative cooling (CRC) has emerged as a prevailing technology not only for achieving a colorful appearance but also for increasing the effective solar reflectance to enhance cooling performance (through the incorporation of fluorescent materials). This paper reviews recent advancements in CRC and its profound impact on energy savings and real&#8208;world applications. After introducing the fundamentals of CRC and color characterization, various photonic approaches are explored that leverage resonant structures to achieve coloration in radiative cooling, comparing them with conventional coloration methods based on optical materials like fluorescent pigments that can convert absorbed ultraviolet light into visible&#8208;light emission. Furthermore, the review delves into self&#8208;adaptive CRC materials featuring dynamic optical modulation that responds to temperature fluctuations. Lastly, the potential application of CRC materials is assessed, a comprehensive outlook on their future development is offered, and the critical challenges in practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Heterostructured Electrocatalysts: from Fundamental Microkinetic Model to Electron Configuration and Interfacial Reactive Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructures have emerged as advanced electrocatalysts to convert earth&#8208;abundant simple molecules into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. On the basis of atomistic understanding to accelerate the electrochemical processes, the architecture of heterostructured electrocatalysts is comprehensively discussed from the point of view of modulating electronic configuration and interface reactive microenvironment. The influence of rectification, space charge region, built&#8208;in electric field, synergistic interactions, lattice strain, and geometric effect is considered.








Abstract
Electrocatalysts can efficiently convert earth&#8208;abundant simple molecules into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. In this context, heterostructures, which are largely determined by the interface, have emerged as a pivotal architecture for enhancing the activity of electrocatalysts. In this review, the atomistic understanding of heterostructured electrocatalysts is considered, focusing on the reaction kinetic rate and electron configuration, gained from both empirical studies and theoretical models. We start from the fundamentals of the microkinetic model, adsorption energy theory, and electric double layer model. The importance of heterostructures to accelerate electrochemical processes via modulating electron configuration and interfacial reactive microenvironment is highlighted, by considering rectification, space charge region, built&#8208;in electric field, synergistic interactions, lattice strain, and geometric effect. We conclude this review by summarizing the challenges and perspectives in the field of heterostructured electrocatalysts, such as the determination of transition state energy, their dynamic evolution, refinement of the theoretical approaches, and the use of machine learning.

         <title>Isolated Metal Centers Activate Small Molecule Electrooxidation: Mechanisms and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent progress in the design, synthesis, and characterization of isolated atom site catalysts for the electro&#8208;oxidation of small molecules such as hydrogen, water, alcohols, formic acid, HMF, urea, ethylene, glycerol, and more. It highlights precise modulation strategies and delves into the detailed exploration of structure&#8208;activity relationships.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxidation of small molecules shows great promise to substitute oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) to enhance reaction kinetics and reduce energy consumption, as well as produce high&#8208;valued chemicals or serve as fuels. For these oxidation reactions, high&#8208;valence metal sites generated at oxidative potentials are typically considered as active sites to trigger the oxidation process of small molecules. Isolated atom site catalysts (IASCs) have been developed as an ideal system to precisely regulate the oxidation state and coordination environment of single&#8208;metal centers, and thus optimize their catalytic property. The isolated metal sites in IASCs inherently possess a positive oxidation state, and can be more readily produce homogeneous high&#8208;valence active sites under oxidative potentials than their nanoparticle counterparts. Meanwhile, IASCs merely possess the isolated metal centers but lack ensemble metal sites, which can alter the adsorption configurations of small molecules as compared with nanoparticle counterparts, and thus induce various reaction pathways and mechanisms to change product selectivity. More importantly, the construction of isolated metal centers is discovered to limit metal d&#8208;electron back donation to CO 2p* orbital and reduce the overly strong adsorption of CO on ensemble metal sites, which resolve the CO poisoning problems in most small molecules electro&#8208;oxidation reactions and thus improve catalytic stability. Based on these advantages of IASCs in the fields of electrochemical oxidation of small molecules, this review summarizes recent developments and advancements in IASCs in small molecules electro&#8208;oxidation reactions, focusing on anodic HOR in fuel cells and OER in electrolytic cells as well as their alternative reactions, such as formic acid/methanol/ethanol/glycerol/urea/5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reactions as key reactions. The catalytic merits of different oxidation reactions and the decoding of structure&#8211;activity relationships are specifically discussed to guide the precise design and structural regulation of IASCs from the perspective of a comprehensive reaction mechanism. Finally, future prospects and challenges are put forward, aiming to motivate more application possibilities for diverse functional IASCs.

The catalytic merits of different oxidation reactions and the decoding of structure&#8211;activity relationships are specifically discussed to guide the precise design and structural regulation of IASCs from the perspective of a comprehensive reaction mechanism. Finally, future prospects and challenges are put forward, aiming to motivate more application possibilities for diverse functional IASCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrolyte Regulation toward Cathodes with Enhanced&#8208;Performance in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to highlight the effect of electrolyte regulation on alleviating issues on the cathode side in aqueous ZIBs. The recent advances of electrolyte regulation strategies are present, with a comprehensive discussion and summary of regulation mechanisms, which can provide guidance to develop novel and multifunctional electrolytes for next&#8208;generation aqueous ZIBs.








Abstract
Enhancing cathodic performance is crucial for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, with the primary focus of research efforts being the regulation of the intrinsic material structure. Electrolyte regulation is also widely used to improve full&#8208;cell performance, whose main optimization mechanisms have been extensively discussed only in regard to the metallic anode. Considering that ionic transport begins in the electrolyte, the modulation of the electrolyte must influence the cathodic performance or even the reaction mechanism. Despite its importance, the discussion of the optimization effects of electrolyte regulation on the cathode has not garnered the attention it deserves. To fill this gap and raise awareness of the importance of electrolyte regulation on cathodic reaction mechanisms, this review comprehensively combs the underlying mechanisms of the electrolyte regulation strategies and classifies the regulation mechanisms into three main categories according to their commonalities for the first time, which are ion effect, solvating effect, and interfacial modulation effect, revealing the missing puzzle piece of the mechanisms of electrolyte regulation in optimizing the cathode.

This review probes recent advancements in PEMWEs for green hydrogen production from the perspective of acidic OER, identifies challenges related to corrosive environments and oxidative conditions, and proposes strategies to enhance the long&#8208;term stability of PEMWEs by addressing both catalyst and membrane electrode assembly deactivation.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) represents a promising technology for renewable hydrogen production. However, the large&#8208;scale commercialization of PEMWE faces challenges due to the need for acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with long&#8208;term stability and corrosion&#8208;resistant membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). This review thoroughly examines the deactivation mechanisms of acidic OER and crucial factors affecting assembly instability in complex reaction environments, including catalyst degradation, dynamic behavior at the MEA triple&#8208;phase boundary, and equipment failures. Targeted solutions are proposed, including catalyst improvements, optimized MEA designs, and operational strategies. Finally, the review highlights perspectives on strict activity/stability evaluation standards, in situ/operando characteristics, and practical electrolyzer optimization. These insights emphasize the interrelationship between catalysts, MEAs, activity, and stability, offering new guidance for accelerating the commercialization of PEMWE catalysts and systems.

         <title>Rapid Drying Principle for High&#8208;speed, Pinhole&#8208;Less, Uniform Wet Deposition Protocols of Water&#8208;Dispersed 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;speed and inexpensive deposition techniques are crucial for the practical application of 2D materials. Rapid drying principle deriving hot dipping and air knife sweeping deposition protocols achieves film uniformity, scalability, and tunable thickness simultaneously by suppressing time for secondary flows. The large&#8208;area extendibility, pinhole&#8208;less feature, and m2&#160;min&#8722;1&#8208;level deposition speed offer unprecedented processes for 2D materials&#8208;based nanodevices more cheaply.








Abstract
Inexpensive, high&#8208;speed deposition techniques that ensure uniformity, scalability, wide applicability, and tunable thickness are crucial for the practical application of 2D materials. In this work, rapid drying is identified as a key mechanism for pioneering two high&#8208;speed wet deposition methods: hot dipping and air knife sweeping (AKS). Both techniques allow thickness control proportional to flake concentration, achieving tiled monolayers and pinhole&#8208;free coverage across the entire substrate, as long as evaporation outpaces flake diffusion. AKS prevents non&#8208;uniformity along substrate edges by eliminating contact line pinning. The achieved deposition speed of 0.21 m2&#160;min&#8722;1 with AKS significantly surpasses traditional methods, enabling the equipment for large substrates &gt;&#160;1 m2. Combined with the ultralow debonding force for mechanically susceptible flexible display production and short&#8208;circuit&#8208;proof nanometer&#8208;thin capacitors with capacitance comparable to commercial multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), these new protocols showcase simple and swift solutions for manufacturing 2D materials&#8208;based nanodevices.

         <title>2D Vacancy Confinement in Anatase TiO2 for Enhanced Photocatalytic Activities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to spatially confine oxygen vacancy (VO) is demonstrated in the homo&#8208;interface of anatase TiO2. The confined VO in anatase TiO2 not only exhibits metallic behavior with high carrier density and electron mobility, but also promotes photocarrier lifetime. This synthetic strategy emphasizes how sub&#8208;bandgap energy levels in confined imperfections influence the kinetics of light&#8208;driven catalytic reactions.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven energy conversion devices call for the atomic&#8208;level manipulation of defects associated with electronic states in solids. However, previous approaches to produce oxygen vacancy (VO) as a source of sub&#8208;bandgap energy levels have hampered the precise control of the distribution and concentration of VO. Here, a new strategy to spatially confine VO at the homo&#8208;interfaces is demonstrated by exploiting the sequential growth of anatase TiO2 under dissimilar thermodynamic conditions. Remarkably, metallic behavior with high carrier density and electron mobility is observed after sequential growth of the TiO2 films under low pressure and temperature (L&#8208;TiO2) on top of high&#8208;quality anatase TiO2 epitaxial films (H&#8208;TiO2), despite the insulating properties of L&#8208;TiO2 and H&#8208;TiO2 single layers. Multiple characterizations elucidate that the VO layer is geometrically confined within 4 unit cells at the interface, along with low&#8208;temperature crystallization of upper L&#8208;TiO2 films; this 2D VO layer is responsible for the formation of in&#8208;gap states, promoting photocarrier lifetime (&#8776;300%) and light absorption. These results suggest a synthetic strategy to locally confine functional defects and emphasize how sub&#8208;bandgap energy levels in the confined imperfections influence the kinetics of light&#8208;driven catalytic reactions.

Spinning the solution leads to fibers with a &#8776;20&#160;nm nanofibrillar hierarchy that are 2.3 times tougher than natural silk fibers. This establishes the importance of retaining molecular weight, presence of sericins, and priming LLPS in designing tougher&#8208;than&#8208;nature fibers with fibrillar hierarchy.








Abstract
The remarkable toughness (&gt;70&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) of silkworm silk is largely attributed to its hierarchically arranged nanofibrillar nanostructure. Recreating such tough fibers through artificial spinning is often challenging, in part because degummed, dissolved silk is drastically different to the unspun native feedstock found in the spinning gland. The present work demonstrates a method to dissolve silk without degumming to produce a solution containing undegraded fibroin and sericin. This solution exhibits liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation above 10% (wt/wt), a behavior observed in the silk gland but not in degummed silk solutions to date. This partitioning enhances the stability of the undegummed solution, delaying gelation two&#8208;fold compared with degummed silk at the same concentration. When spun under identical conditions, undegummed solutions produces fibers 8&#215; stronger and 218&#215; tougher than degummed silk feedstocks. Through ultrasonication, undegummed wet spun fibers are seen to possess hierarchical structure of densely packed &#8776;20&#160;nm nanofibrils, similar to native silks, although completely absent from fibers wet&#8208;spun from degummed silk solutions. This work demonstrates that the preservation of molecular weight, presence of sericin and stimulation of liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation underpin a new pathway to recreate a hierarchical fiber with structures akin to native silk.

         <title>Epitaxial Ferroelectric Hexagonal Boron Nitride Grown on Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The epitaxial growth of hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) multilayer films on graphene, synthesized on a miscut SiC (0001) substrate, is demonstrated using nitrogen plasma&#8208;assisted molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy. Robust ferroelectricity with switchable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization via interlayer sliding is supported by theoretical and experimental insights, providing a scalable pathway for integrating ferroelectric vdW materials into advanced 2D devices with diverse functionalities.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity realized in van der Waals (vdW) materials with non&#8208;centrosymmetric stacking configurations holds promise for future 2D devices with nonvolatile and reconfigurable functionalities. However, the epitaxial growth of ferroelectric vdW materials often struggles to achieve an energetically unfavorable stacking configuration that enables electric polarization. This challenge is particularly evident when performing heteroepitaxy on another vdW substrate to create versatile and scalable ferroelectric building blocks designed for large&#8208;area, atomic&#8208;scale thicknesses. Here, epitaxial hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) multilayer films are successfully grew on single&#8208;crystal graphene synthesized on a miscut SiC (0001) substrate. Theoretical calculations illustrate that the moir&#233;&#8208;patterned h&#8208;BN/graphene hetero&#8208;interface intrinsically exhibits polarization, leading to a polarized AB stacking in multilayer h&#8208;BN films to minimize the total formation energy, which is validated experimentally by the layer&#8208;dependent band dispersions. The as&#8208;grown multilayer h&#8208;BN layers demonstrated robust, homogeneous ferroelectricity with switchable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization via interlayer sliding. This study establishes an effective route for stacking&#8208;controlled heteroepitaxy, enabling the large&#8208;scale integration of vdW materials with ferroelectricity and versatile functionalities, offering a promising platform for next&#8208;generation 2D ferroelectric devices.

         <title>Unconventional Ferroelectric&#8208;Ferroelastic Switching Mediated by Non&#8208;Polar Phase in Fluorite Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>

The in situ atomic scale transmission electron microscopy experiment reveals a non&#8208;polar phase&#8208;mediated ferroelectric&#8208;ferroelastic coupled switching pathway in fluorite oxides.








Abstract
HfO2/ZrO2&#8208;based ferroelectrics present tremendous potential for next&#8208;generation non&#8208;volatile memory due to their high scalability and compatibility with silicon technology. Unlike the continuous polar layers in perovskite ferroelectrics, HfO2/ZrO2&#8208;based ferroelectrics are composed of alternating polar layers with oxygen shifts and non&#8208;polar spacers, which leads to a distinct ferroelectric switching mechanism. However, directly observing the switching process has been a big challenge due to the polymorph feature of nanoscale fluorites and the difficulty in in situ imaging on light elements. Here, the ferroelectric&#8208;ferroelastic coupled switching process in freestanding ZrO2 thin films is directly visualized by in situ imaging on oxygen motions. A multi&#8208;step 90&#8208;degree polarization switching mechanism is uncovered that challenges the conventional one&#8208;step 180&#8208;degree switching paradigms in fluorite oxides, which is highly consistent with the interlocked nature of ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity. A non&#8208;polar tetragonal (T) phase is discovered as a crucial intermediate state, lowering the energy barrier for polarization switching by 35%. More importantly, the T phase prevents irreversible transitions to the non&#8208;polar ground state and facilitates stable ferroelectric switching. These findings are fundamental to understanding nanoscale polarization switching mechanisms in fluorite ferroelectrics, paving the way for advanced high&#8208;durability devices.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Resistive Redox Mediator in Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic redox mediators (ORMs) reactive nature with 1O2 causes the functional degradation but the reactivity of ORMs is often neglected. The ORM is systematically designed, which has superior 1O2 stability than ORMs with similar molecular structures and promises enhanced cyclability sustaining its catalytic function. This work emphasizes the necessity of suitable design of ORMs and the importance of controlling 1O2.








Abstract
The utilization of redox mediators (RMs) in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs) has underscored their utility in high overpotential during the charging process. Among the currently known RMs, it is exceptionally challenging to identify those with a redox potential capable of attenuating singlet oxygen (1O2) generation while resisting degradation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as 1O2 and superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8722;). In this context, computational and experimental approaches for rational molecular design have led to the development of 7,7&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;7&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (BAC), a newly suggested RM incorporating N&#8211;N interconnected aza&#8208;bicycles. BAC harnesses the advantages of falling within the potential range that suppresses 1O2 generation, as previously reported N&#8211;N embedded non&#8208;bicyclic RMs, and effectively defends against ROS&#8208;induced degradation due to the incorporation of a novel bicyclic moiety. Unlike the non&#8208;bicyclic RMs, which exhibit reduced O2 evolution after exposure to 1O2, BAC maintains consistent O2 profiles during charging, indicating its superior 1O2 resistance and steady redox&#8208;catalyst performance in LOBs. This study introduces a precise and rational design strategy for low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight RMs, marking a significant step forward in advancing LOB development by improving efficiency, stability, and practical applicability.

         <title>Buckle&#8208;Barrel Correspondence Based on Topological Polarization Conversion in Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number XXXX, Jingyi Zhang, Johan Christensen, and co&#8208;workers take a mechanical metamaterial approach to study topological transitions in the context of complex deformations. A buckle&#8208;barrel correspondence has been established that links local polarization conversions to global instabilities.








Abstract
Harnessing instabilities in architected lattices and metamaterials allows for controlled nonlinear deformations, enabling desired mechanical functions like shape morphing and energy absorption.

&lt;p&gt;In article number XXXX, Jingyi Zhang, Johan Christensen, and co-workers take a mechanical metamaterial approach to study topological transitions in the context of complex deformations. A buckle-barrel correspondence has been established that links local polarization conversions to global instabilities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harnessing instabilities in architected lattices and metamaterials allows for controlled nonlinear deformations, enabling desired mechanical functions like shape morphing and energy absorption. By precisely tailoring instabilities such as buckling into the structure, deformations become a powerful instrument rather than a failure mode, offering new possibilities for predictable responses to mechanical loads. Inspired by the bulk-boundary correspondence in condensed matter physics, an analogous relationship is explored in metamaterials, where the underlying topology dictates whether the structure under load buckles or barrels. The underlying mechanism that originates from a polarization conversion in the elementary beam network is discussed. Moreover, these predictions, which can be extended to more complex topologies and higher dimensions, showcase that a mode inversion process governs both global deformations and the orientation of localized shear strains within the bulk. It is anticipated that the buckle-barrel correspondence can be extended to non-Hookean materials, paving the way for predicting the onset and evolution of true&#160;failure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Xantphos&#8211;Cu&#8208;Decorated Covalent Organic Frameworks for C&#9472;H Arylation through Sensitized Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of a tetrahedral Cu(I) single site into the bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) is shown to effectively drive photocatalytic carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation through simultaneous energy and electron transfer pathways. The COF&#8208;based photocatalyst demonstrates efficient and durable performance for the preparation of a series of oxindole and isoindolinones.








Abstract
The isoindolinone scaffold is an important structural motif found in a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic biologically active compounds. However, the synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives typically requires multi&#8208;step procedures or the use of palladium&#8208;based catalysts, which are often hampered by low reaction yields and high costs. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8212;emerging crystalline and porous materials&#8212;have gained considerable attention for their applications in various organic transformations, particularly in C&#9472;H functionalization, cross&#8208;coupling and redox reactions. Although COFs have been extensively studied for photocatalysis, the development of sustainable heterogeneous catalysts using low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based photosensitizers is still in its early stages. Herein, a strategy is presented to incorporate a copper&#8208;Xantphos complex with a tetrahedral Cu(I) geometry into a crystalline and porous COF matrix. This modification enables unprecedented simultaneous electron and energy transfer efficiency during photocatalysis. The Cu&#8211;Xantphos coordinated COF exhibits potent photocatalytic activity for the synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives via C&#9472;Br and C&#9472;H bond cleavage followed by C&#9472;C bond formation. In addition, the catalyst shows excellent recyclability as it can be rejuvenated by reintroducing the Cu&#8211;Xantphos complex after multiple photocatalytic cycles&#8212;highlighting its potential as a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective solution for valuable organic transformations.

A novel 3D printing method enables the fabrication of materials with precisely controlled mechanical properties at nanoscale resolution. A volume&#8208;conserving photoresist combined with the free and open&#8208;source software, OpenScribe, achieves mechanical transitions over 770 nanometers &#8208; representing a 130&#8208;fold improvement over existing approaches.

Abstract
Fabrication methods that synthesize materials with higher precision and complexity at ever smaller scales are rapidly developing. Despite such advances, generating&#160;complex 3D materials with controlled mechanical properties at the nanoscale remains challenging. Exerting precise control over mechanical properties at the nanoscale would enable material strengths near theoretical maxima, and the replication of natural structures with hitherto unattainable strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios. Here, a method for fabricating materials with nanovoxelated elastic moduli by employing a volume&#8208;conserving photoresist composed of a copolymer hydrogel, along with OpenScribe, an open&#8208;source software that enables the precise programming of material mechanics, is presented. Combining these, a material composed of periodic unit cells featuring heteromechanically tessellated soft&#8208;stiff structures, achieving a mechanical transition over an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude change in elastic modulus within 770&#160;nm, a 130&#8208;fold improvement on previous reports, is demonstrated. This work critically advances material design and opens new avenues for fabricating materials with specifically tailored properties and functionalities through unparalleled control over nanoscale mechanics.

         <title>Gasotransmitter&#8208;Nanodonor for Spatial Regulation of Anxiety&#8208;Like Behavior and Bone Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gasotransmitter&#8208;nanodonor FSG@AB co&#8208;releases hydrogen sulfide (H&#8322;S) and glucose oxidase (GOx) at bone metastases, disrupting mitochondrial function and inhibiting glycolysis to deplete tumor energy sources, exerting robust anti&#8208;tumor effects. The released H&#8322;S travels to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), upregulating glutamate transporter 1 (GLT&#8208;1) expression, reducing extracellular glutamate levels, and mitigating glutamatergic hyperactivity, ultimately alleviating anxiety&#8208;like behaviors.








Abstract
Anxiety is highly prevalent among cancer patients, significantly impacting their prognosis. Current cancer therapies typically lack anxiolytic properties and may even exacerbate anxiety. Here, a gasotransmitter&#8208;nanodonors (GND) system is presented that exerts dual anxiolytic and anti&#8208;tumor effects via a &#8220;tumor&#8208;brain axis&#8221; strategy. The GND, synthesized by co&#8208;embedding Fe2&#8314; and S2&#8315; ions along with glucose oxidase (GOx) within bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles (FSG@AB), enables the controlled release of the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H&#8322;S) in the acidic tumor microenvironment. H&#8322;S and GOx synergistically deplete tumor energy sources, resulting in robust anti&#8208;tumor effects. Meanwhile, H&#8322;S generated at the tumor site is transported through the bloodstream to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the brain, where it modulates neuronal activity. Specifically, in the ACC, H&#8322;S upregulates glutamate transporter 1 (GLT&#8208;1), which reduces extracellular glutamate levels and attenuates the hyperactivity of glutamatergic neurons, thereby alleviating anxiety&#8208;like behavior. This study proposes a GND system that targets both oncological and psychiatric dimensions of cancer through the &#8220;tumor&#8208;brain axis&#8221; strategy, resulting in improved therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Frozen by Heating: Temperature Controlled Dynamic States in Droplet Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the design of smart materials based on active agents or microswimmers, the gaits or motile states of the agents are to be controlled, preferably by external parameters that do not require modifying the composition of the system. A facile, universal parameter is temperature. Here, in the experimental model system of self&#8208;propelling active emulsions, a temperature sensitive mixture of co&#8208;surfactants is used as fuel for propulsion. It is demonstrated that three distinct states of reorienting, then straight motion, and subsequent arrest, can be accessed, counterintuitively, with increasing temperature.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propelling active matter relies on the conversion of energy from the undirected, nanoscopic scale to directed, macroscopic motion. One of the challenges in the design of synthetic active matter lies in the control of dynamic states, or motility gaits. Here, an experimental system of self&#8208;propelling droplets with thermally controllable and reversible dynamic states is presented, from unsteady over meandering to persistent to arrested motion. These states are known to depend on the P&#233;clet number of the molecular process powering the motion, which can now be tuned by using a temperature sensitive mixture of surfactants as propulsion fuel. The droplet dynamics are quantified by analyzing flow and chemical fields for the individual states, comparing them to canonical models for autophoretic particles. In the context of these models, in situ, the fundamental first broken symmetry that translates an isotropic, immotile base state to self&#8208;propelled&#160;motility, is experimentally demonstrated.

         <title>Engineering Ultra&#8208;Small Ag Nanoparticles with Enhanced Activity in Microporous Polymer Membranes for C2H4/C2H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small silver nanoparticles are formed in situ and activated in an amidoxime&#8208;modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity to fabricate a metallic nanocomposite membrane for C2H4/C2H6 separation. The activated silver nanoparticles promote C2H4 transport and effectively enhance C2H4/C2H6 separation selectivity, resulting in an outstanding membrane separation performance with C2H4 permeability of 322.1 barrer and C2H4/C2H6 selectivity as high as 8.8.








Abstract
The separation of C2H4 and C2H6 is a critical yet energy&#8208;intensive operation in the petrochemical industry. Gas separation membranes offer energy&#8208;efficient alternatives, but their effectiveness is hindered by the similar physical properties of C2H4 and C2H6. Here, a metallic nanocomposite membrane (MNM) comprising ultra&#8208;small Ag nanoparticles embedded in an amidoxime&#8208;modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity (AOPIM&#8208;1) is reported for highly efficient C2H4/C2H6 separation. The microporous structure of AOPIM&#8208;1, combined with anchoring groups (amidoxime groups) inside the microcavities, enables size&#8208;controlled growth of Ag nanoparticles with &#8210;&#8776;3&#160;nm diameter, which maximizes the contact with ethylene molecules. The amidoxime groups as electron acceptors effectively enrich the positive charge on the surface of Ag nanoparticles. The activated Ag form reversible complexes with ethylene molecules endowing them with preferential affinity over ethane. The resulting Ag nanocomposite membrane demonstrates a &#8776;10&#8208;fold increase in C2H4 permeability, reaching 322.1 barrer, and a &#8776;3&#8208;fold increase in C2H4/C2H6 selectivity, reaching 8.8. The comprehensive separation performance is superior over all the polymer membranes and mixed matrix membranes reported so far. The MNMs also demonstrate stable mixed gas separation performance under elevated feed gas pressures. This study provides valuable insights into designing and fabricating polymer membranes with high C2H4/C2H6 separation performance.

         <title>Antibody&#8208;level Bacteria Grabbing by &#8220;Mechanic Invasion&#8221; of Bioinspired Hedgehog Artificial Mesoporous Nanostructure for Hierarchical Dynamic Identification and Light&#8208;Response Sterilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the de novo design of bioinspired hedgehog artificial mesoporous nanostructure with virus&#8208;like spiky topography (mAPt), the antibody&#8208;level bacteria grabbing attributed to the &#8220;mechanic invasion&#8221;&#8208;induced hierarchical dynamic identification ranging from rough surface contact to penetration fixation is verified. Further integrated with spiky&#8208;induced near&#8208;superblack characteristic and plasmonic &#8220;hot spot&#8221;, mAPt enables advanced applications in immunoassay and photothermal sterilization.








Abstract
The interactions exploration between microorganisms and nanostructures are pivotal steps toward advanced applications, but the antibody&#8208;level bacteria grabbing is limited by the poor understanding of interface identification mechanisms in small&#8208;sized systems. Herein, the de novo design of a bioinspired hedgehog artificial mesoporous nanostructure (core&#8211;shell mesoporous Au@Pt (mAPt)) are proposed to investigate the association between the topography design and efficient bacteria grabbing. These observations indicate that virus&#8208;like spiky topography compensates for the obstacles faced by small&#8208;sized materials for bacteria grabbing, including the lack of requisite microscopic cavities and sufficient contact area. Molecular dynamics simulation reveals that spiky topography with heightened mechano&#8208;invasiveness (6.56&#160;&#215;&#160;103 KJ mol&#8722;1) facilitates antibody&#8208;level bacteria grabbing, attributed to the &#8220;mechanic invasion&#8221;&#8208;induced hierarchical dynamic identification ranging from rough surface contact to penetration fixation. Furthermore, light reflectance and finite element calculation confirmed that mAPt exhibits near&#8208;superblack characteristic and plasmonic hot spot, facilitating enhanced photothermal conversion with power dissipation density at 2.04&#160;&#215;&#160;1021&#160;W m&#8722;3. After integrating the hierarchical dynamic identification with enhanced light response, mAPt enables advanced applications in immunoassay with 50&#8208;fold sensitivity enhancement and over 99.99% in vitro photothermal sterilization. It is anticipated that this novel biomimetic design provides a deeper understanding of bacteria grabbing and a promising paradigm for bacteria combating.

         <title>Surface Template Realizing Oriented Perovskites for Highly Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface quasi&#8208;2D template is introduced in the two&#8208;step fabrication technology to induce an ordered crystallization, enhancing photovoltaic device stability and efficiency. This resulted in 25.79% power conversion efficiency and a 1.188V open&#8208;circuit voltage, retaining 90.38% efficiency after 500 h.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite films, ensuring optically active phase purity with uniform crystal orientation, are ideal for photovoltaic applications. However, the optically active &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase is easy to degrade into &#948;&#8208;phase due to numerous defects within randomly oriented films. Here, a &#8220;quasi&#8208;2D&#8221; perovskite template is pre&#8208;deposited on the film surface within the crystallization process based on the two&#8208;step preparation technology, which directly induced pure and highly orientated crystallization of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 across the downward growth process. Furthermore, the enlarged interaction between 2D components with colloidal properties and lead iodide delayed the crystallization process effectively, yielding high crystallinity with low trap state density. The resulting perovskite photovoltaic devices exhibited a champion efficiency as high as 25.79% with comprehensively improved device stability. This work provides new insights into the utilization of 2D components and the formation mechanism behind 2D perovskites.

         <title>Cholesterol Cocrystal Ferroelectrics Modulated by Solvent Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ferroelectric cocrystals of cholesterol methanol (CHOL&#8208;MeOH) and cholesterol ethanol (CHOL&#8208;EtOH) have been constructed through the solvent effect, where the introduction of hydroxyl&#8208;containing solvents like methanol and ethanol can induce ferroelectricity in cholesterol by reducing the O&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bond length as well as largely decreasing the maximum energy barrier for polarization reversal.








Abstract
Cholesterol (CHOL) is an inherently biodegradable material with multiple chiral centers, being an essential component for cell membranes. Considering the close relationship between chirality and ferroelectric feature, this compound with chiral&#8208;polar structure is an intrinsic polar material. However, the ferroelectricity of CHOL crystals has never been found to date. Herein, a series of ferroelectric cocrystals of CHOL methanol (CHOL&#8208;MeOH) and CHOL ethanol (CHOL&#8208;EtOH) have been constructed through the solvent effect. It is found that the introduction of some solvent molecules containing hydroxyls such as methanol and ethanol can reduce the acceptor&#183;&#183;&#183;donor length and thus form a 1D electroactive channel and further induce ferroelectricity in CHOL. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation analyses represented by CHOL&#8208;EtOH, the largely decreased maximum energy barrier for the polarization reversal of &#8776;50% suggests that the electric polarization of the cocrystal is much easier to be reoriented under the external electric field through the solvent effect. These ferroelectric materials show good biocompatibility and biodegradability through in vitro and in vivo evaluation. These attributes make these CHOL cocrystals good candidates for the application of next&#8208;generation smart implantable electronic devices. This work sheds light on the chemical design of biodegradable ferroelectrics in biomaterials.

         <title>Strong Proquinoidal Acceptor Enables High&#8208;Performance Ambipolar Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proquinoidal building blocks are demonstrated that could enable a narrow bandgap while facilitating the delocalization of both positive and negative polarons, making them ideal for high&#8208;performance ambipolar OECTs. Using this strategy, a record&#8208;breaking ambipolar OECT material featuring high &#181;C*, low operating voltage, and rapid response is developed.








Abstract
Ambipolar organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) can simplify manufacturing processes and reduce device footprints, yet their performance still lags behind their p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type counterparts due to limited molecular design strategies. Here, incorporating strong proquinoidal building blocks effectively addresses this challenge is demonstrated. Using a computational acceptor screening approach, three TBDOPV&#8208;based polymers are designed and synthesized: P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;T), P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;EDOT), and P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;MeOT2), all exhibiting ambipolar behavior across various donor moieties. Remarkably, P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;EDOT) achieves record&#8208;high figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#181;C*) values, reaching 268&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for p&#8208;type and 107&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for n&#8208;type operations. Additionally, P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;EDOT) exhibits low operation voltages (VTh,p&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.55&#160;V and VTh,n&#160;=&#160;0.32&#160;V), with fast response times (&#964;on/&#964;off = 0.48/0.36&#160;ms for p&#8208;type and 0.41/0.41&#160;ms for n&#8208;type) and enhanced operational stability. Inverter devices based on P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;EDOT) show high voltage gains of 173&#160;V/V. Theoretical calculations and data analysis confirm that strong proquinoidal acceptors significantly enhance the delocalization of both positive and negative polarons, offering an effective pathway for higher&#8208;performance ambipolar OECT materials.

         <title>Deciphering the Purification Additive Chemistries for Ultra&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This work deciphers the fundamental factors and proposes a general design rule for screening hydrogen fluoride (HF)&#8208;elimination additives. The cherry&#8208;picked additive according to this rule enables a remarkable success in protecting electrodes and interphases over high&#8208;voltage LIBs.









Abstract
Hydrogen fluoride (HF)&#8208;induced degradation of electrode materials and interphases presents a significant challenge for high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, progress in developing advanced HF&#8208;scavenging additives is hindered by a limited understanding of HF&#8208;elimination reactions and the absence of a robust design principle. Herein, it is proposed to analyze the energy decomposition analysis of 24 additives to elucidate the underlying HF&#8208;scavenging mechanism and identify key factors influencing HF&#8208;additives reactions. The findings reveal that orbital contribution ratio (OCR) is a critical determinant of chemical bonding in HF&#8208;additive reactions. Specifically, an 80% OCR for H+ and a 53% OCR for F&#8722; are essential for completing HF elimination. Based on these insights, a general principle for designing effective HF&#8208;elimination additives is proposed and heptamethyldisilazane as a particularly well&#8208;suited candidate, exhibiting optimal OCR for both H+ and F&#8722; ions is identified. Remarkably, the addition of just 1&#160;wt.% HMDS significantly eliminats HF, inhibiting cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode crosstalk behaviors and limiting electrode and interphase degradation. This guardian endows graphite/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells with a significant performance improvement, achieving 80% capacity retention over 2528 cycles, a substantial improvement compared to the 1139 cycles observed without HF&#8208;elimination additive. The study provides valuable insights for the design of advanced electrolyte additives for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Radical Molecular Network&#8208;Buffer Minimizes Photovoltage Loss in FAPbI&#8323; Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ polymerizable radical molecule (ATEMPO) preferentially interacting with the {111}c facets, is employed as an additive to promote perovskite crystal growth. During annealing, ATEMPO polymerizes, forming a network&#8208;buffer that mitigates lattice strain and suppresses intragrain planar defects. This strategy yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films, achieving a champion PCE of 25.28% with a remarkably high VOC of 1.203 V, minimizing photovoltage loss in FAPbI&#8323; perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI&#8323;) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hold immense potential for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics, but maximizing their open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) remains challenging. Targeting the inherently stable {111}c&#8208;dominant facets is a promising approach for enhancing stability, but their formation typically suffers from high defect densities and disordered growth. This study introduces a novel approach using an in situ polymerizable radical molecule, ATEMPO, as an additive to address these issues. ATEMPO preferentially interacts with the {111}c perovskite facets, guiding their growth and forming a &#8220;radical molecular network&#8208;buffer&#8221; upon polymerization. The network effectively mitigates lattice strain, suppresses defect formation, enhances charge transport via redox&#8208;mediated hopping, and provides a hydrophobic barrier, significantly improving moisture resistance. This strategy yields high&#8208;quality, {111}c &#8208;oriented FAPbI&#8323; films, leading to a champion PCE of 25.28% with a remarkably high VOC of 1.203 V, corresponding to an energy loss (Eloss) of only 0.297 eV, among the highest VOC reported for FAPbI&#8323;&#8208;based PSCs. Furthermore, a mini&#8208;module fabricate with an active area of 12.5 cm2 achieve a high PCE of 21.39%. the work paves the way for developing high&#8208;performance, stable PSCs with minimized photovoltage loss. Furthermore, it offers a promising strategy to enhance device longevity and address environmental concerns.

Spatiotemporal Controlled Release Inks of Biocompatible polyEsters (SCRIBE) is a novel 2PP resin family with sub&#8208;micron resolution and tuneable hydrolysis. SCRIBE enables direct printing of hollow microparticles with complex chemistries and geometries inaccessible to molding techniques, which are used to modulate antibody titers and class switching as a function of antigen release rate in vivo.









Abstract
Two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) 3D printing enables top&#8211;down biomaterial synthesis with nanoscale spatial resolution for de novo design of monodisperse injectable drug delivery systems. Spatiotemporal Controlled Release Inks of Biocompatible polyEsters (SCRIBE) is a novel poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid)&#8208;triacrylate resin family with sub&#8208;micron resolution and tuneable hydrolysis that addresses the limitations of current 2PP resins. SCRIBE enables the direct printing of hollow microparticles with tuneable chemistry and complex geometries inaccessible to molding techniques, which are used to engineer controlled protein release in vitro and in vivo. SCRIBE microparticles are used to modulate antibody titers and class switching as a function of antigen release rate and extend these findings to enable a single&#8208;injection vaccine formulation with extended antibody induction kinetics. Demonstrating how the chemistry and computer&#8208;aided design of 2PP&#8208;printed microparticles can be used to tune responses to biomacromolecule release in vivo opens significant opportunities for a new generation of drug delivery vehicles.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-photon polymerization (2PP) 3D printing enables top&#8211;down biomaterial synthesis with nanoscale spatial resolution for de novo design of monodisperse injectable drug delivery systems. Spatiotemporal Controlled Release Inks of Biocompatible polyEsters (SCRIBE) is a novel poly(lactic-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-glycolic acid)-triacrylate resin family with sub-micron resolution and tuneable hydrolysis that addresses the limitations of current 2PP resins. SCRIBE enables the direct printing of hollow microparticles with tuneable chemistry and complex geometries inaccessible to molding techniques, which are used to engineer controlled protein release in vitro and in vivo. SCRIBE microparticles are used to modulate antibody titers and class switching as a function of antigen release rate and extend these findings to enable a single-injection vaccine formulation with extended antibody induction kinetics. Demonstrating how the chemistry and computer-aided design of 2PP-printed microparticles can be used to tune responses to biomacromolecule release in vivo opens significant opportunities for a new generation of drug delivery vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fully Recyclable Pluripotent Networks for 3D Printing Enabled by Dissociative Dynamic Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pluripotent materials, i.e., materials that can attain different properties from a single stock, where applied to 3D printing. Their accessibility is expanded using a monomer that is CO2&#8208;derived and is prepared at the 100&#8208;gram scale. Exploiting pluripotency, spatially patterned 3D objects are produced showcasing new direction for the additive manufacturing community.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) has risen in popularity due to its ability to produce complex shapes in a material&#8208;efficient way. However, to produce objects with advanced properties, complex multimaterial strategies are often employed. This one&#8208;polymer&#8208;one&#8208;property paradigm significantly slows down the application of AM, and in particular of fused deposition modeling (FDM), for manufacturing of functional objects. In this study advantage of pluripotency in materials is taken, i.e., the ability to attain different properties from a single stock, to afford mechanically tunable 3D printed dynamic thermosets (moduli from 2&#160;MPa &#8211; 3&#160;GPa, 1500&#215; increase, Stress at break from 2 to 70&#160;MPa, 35&#215; increase). To do so, FDM&#8208;compatible CO2&#8208;derived dissociative polymer networks are designed that undergo a dynamic reaction&#8208;induced phase&#8208;separation (DRIPS). This strategy enables the control of the size of the rigid phase with a simple post&#8208;printing thermal treatment, cascading in spatially patterned mechanical properties. This study showcases new directions for the 3D printing communities, with deep implications in soft robotics and compliant mechanics.

         <title>Organomolecular Ferroelectric Nanocatalyst Augments Tumor Immunotherapy by Inducing Apoptosis and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of a biodegradable organomolecular ferroelectric nanoplatform to facilitate effective ferroelectric nanocatalyst catalysis for augmented tumor immunotherapy through inducing apoptosis and ferroptosis.








Abstract
Immunogenic programmed cell death effectively triggers acute inflammatory responses, thereby enhancing antitumor immunity. The advancement of biodegradable nonmetallic dual inducers represents a promising strategy. Herein, a biodegradable organomolecular ferroelectric nanoplatform (C60&#8208;TCNQ, CT) is designed to facilitate effective ferroelectric catalysis, thereby augmenting tumor immunotherapy through apoptosis and ferroptosis. CT&#8208;mediated ultrasound&#8208;triggered ferroelectric catalysis promotes ferroelectric polarization and significantly increases the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to substantial tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, the polycyano group of CT nanoparticles selectively reacts with cysteine under mild conditions, resulting in redox imbalances and the accumulation of lipid peroxides, which contribute to the induction of ferroptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, the apoptosis and ferroptosis induced by CT stimulate immunogenic cell death progression, eliciting robust immune responses. In vivo evaluation using a bilateral tumor model demonstrates the capacity of CT to sensitize anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy under ultrasound irradiation, achieving an impressive antitumor response rate of 96.2% against malignant melanoma and an 80% inhibition of tumor metastasis. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that treatment with CT resulted in a downregulation of gene signatures associated with the immune&#8208;related Jak&#8208;Stat signaling pathway. This study opens a novel avenue to developing organomolecular ferroelectric nanomedicines for effective tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Cooling&#8208;induced Strains in 2D Materials and Their Modulation via Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the internal and external cooling&#8208;induced strains in monolayer MoSe2 at cryogenic temperatures, focusing on strain effects arising from thermal expansion coefficient mismatch at 2D&#8208;bulk interfaces. Interface engineering demonstrates that compressive strain induces direct&#8208;to&#8208;indirect bandgap transitions. Notably, hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation effectively mitigates external strain via 2D&#8211;2D interfaces, yielding performance comparable to suspended samples.








Abstract
2D materials exhibit unique properties for next&#8208;generation electronics and quantum devices. However, their sensitivity to temperature variations, particularly concerning cooling&#8208;induced strain, remains underexplored systematically. This study investigates the effects of cooling&#8208;induced strain on monolayer MoSe2 at cryogenic temperatures. It is emphasized that the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between the material and bulk substrate leads to significant external strain, which superimposes the internal strain of the material. By engineering the material&#8208;substrate 2D&#8208;bulk interface, the resulting strain conditions are characterized and reveal that substantial compressive strain induces new emission features linked to direct&#8208;to&#8208;indirect bandgap transition, as confirmed by photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy studies. Finally, it is demonstrated that encapsulation with hexagonal boron nitride can mitigate the external strain by 2D&#8211;2D interfaces, achieving results similar to those of suspended samples. The findings address key challenges in quantifying and characterizing strain types across different 2D&#8208;bulk interfaces, distinguishing cooling&#8208;induced strain effects from other temperature&#8208;dependent phenomena, and designing strain&#8208;sensitive 2D material devices for extreme temperature conditions.

         <title>Exploring Structure Diversity in Atomic Resolution Microscopy With Graph</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a few&#8208;shot learning framework based on an equivariant graph neural network to automatically analyze a library of atomic structures (vacancies, grain boundaries, stacking configurations, etc.) represented by graphs. This framework significantly promotes robustness, reduces computing parameters by three orders of magnitude compared to the image&#8208;driven learning framework, and facilitates new structure and knowledge discovery.








Abstract
The emergence of deep learning (DL) has provided great opportunities for the high&#8208;throughput analysis of atomic&#8208;resolution micrographs. However, the DL models trained by image patches in fixed size generally lack efficiency and flexibility when processing micrographs containing diversified atomic configurations. Herein, inspired by the similarity between the atomic structures and graphs, a few&#8208;shot learning framework based on an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) to analyze a library of atomic structures (e.g., vacancies, phases, grain boundaries, doping, etc.) is described, showing significantly promoted robustness and three orders of magnitude reduced computing parameters compared to the image&#8208;driven DL models, which is especially evident for those aggregated vacancy lines with flexible lattice distortion. Besides, the intuitiveness of graphs enables quantitative and straightforward extraction of the atomic&#8208;scale structural features in batches, thus statistically unveiling the self&#8208;assembly dynamics of vacancy lines under electron beam irradiation. A versatile model toolkit is established by integrating EGNN sub&#8208;models for single structure recognition to process images involving varied configurations in the form of a task chain, leading to the discovery of novel doping configurations with superior electrocatalytic properties for hydrogen evolution reactions. This work provides a powerful tool to explore structure diversity in a fast, accurate, and intelligent manner.

         <title>LiF&#8208;Rich Cathode Electrolyte Interphases Homogenizing Li+ Fluxes toward Stable Interface in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel vapor phase method is first proposed to reconstruct a robust LiF coating layer on the Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes. The designed LiF layer effectively modulates the electric field distribution on the electrode surface, thereby promoting the formation of a uniform LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase&#160;(CEI). The optimized CEI facilitates homogeneous Li+ fluxes on the electrode surface, contributing to a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Constructing a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) is crucial to enhance the battery performance of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LMO) cathodes. To achieve an ideal CEI, a gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique is proposed to pre&#8208;structure a robust LiF layer (&#8776;1&#160;nm) on the LMO surface. The designed LiF layer effectively modulates the electric field distribution on the electrode surface and mitigates undesirable side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, thereby promoting the formation of a uniform LiF&#8208;rich CEI layer on the LMO&#8208;F&#8208;1. The optimized CEI facilitates homogeneous Li+ fluxes across the electrode surface and enhances Li+ diffusion in the electrode during (de)intercalation, contributing to a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, the robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI layer effectively suppresses the decomposition of lithium salts in the electrolyte and reduces autocatalytic side reactions triggered by the by&#8208;products. In addition, it improves the structural stability of LMO by increasing the formation energies of oxygen and manganese vacancies. As a result, the modified LMO with the LiF&#8208;rich CEI retains 95% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles, demonstrating remarkable electrochemical stability. The proposed gas&#8208;phase Li+ flux homogenization strategy offers a promising avenue for enhancing the interface stability of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials with lithium storage.

         <title>Stereoisomerism of Vicinal Polydichloronorbornene for Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoisomerism engineering plays a crucial role in tailoring the properties of vicinal dichloronorbornene (PDCNB), with profound effects in backbone spacing, &#960;&#8208;stacking, barrier height, and trap states, empowering PDCNB with superior capacitive performance that outperforms existing polymers and nanocomposites in capacitive energy storage at 250 &#176;C.








Abstract
The emergence of high&#8208;density electronics in aerospace and renewable energies demands high temperature dielectrics. Molecular engineering represents a vital strategy for designing dielectric polymers, yet the influence of stereochemistry remains untapped. Herein, by designing halogen substituents of an aromatic pendant attached to a bicyclic mainchain, vicinal polydichloronorbornene (PDCNB) with a high glass&#8208;transition temperature (Tg) of 263&#160;&#176;C is obtained. Further study unveils the profound effect of stereochemistry on the properties of exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;PDCNB. Both isomers show identical high Tg and bandgap (4.3 eV), imparting PDCNBs with remarkable capacitive energy storage, outperforming existing polymers and nanocomposites with two orders of magnitude lower conduction at an ultra&#8208;high temperature of 250&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the effect of stereoisomerism is manifested in the differences in backbone spacing, &#960;&#8208;stacking, barrier height, and trap states, and the resulting distinct high field performance. Exo&#8208;PDCNB displays an extremely low conduction of 6.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;14 S&#160;m&#8315;1 at 200 mV&#160;m&#8315;1 and maintains a record charge&#8208;discharge efficiency of 82% at 450 mV&#160;m&#8315;1, while endo&#8208;PDCNB exhibits a high breakdown strength of 600 mV&#160;m&#8315;1 with a remarkable discharged density of 4.47 J&#160;cm&#8315;3, all at 250 &#176;C. This study unleashes a stereochemistry&#8208;based strategy with vicinal dichloro substitution to further boost the Tg of polynorbornene for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;temperature&#160;applications.

         <title>Quantum Geometric Moment Encodes Stacking Order of Moir&#233; Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Berry curvature dipole (BCD) changes across valley Chern transitions. A new electrical technique is developed to use such BCD sign flips for distinguishing the stacking order of a moir&#233; material, namely twisted double bilayer graphene. Such a method, analogous to spectroscopic techniques, establishes a link between quantum geometry and stacking order, and is applicable to other moir&#233; materials.








Abstract
Exploring the topological characteristics of electronic bands is essential in condensed matter physics. Moir&#233; materials featuring flat bands provide a versatile platform for engineering band topology and correlation effects. In moir&#233; materials that break either time&#8208;reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry or both, electronic bands exhibit Berry curvature hotspots. Different stacking orders in these materials result in varied Berry curvature distributions within the flat bands, even when the band dispersion remains similar. However, experimental studies probing the impact of stacking order on the quantum geometric quantities are lacking. 1.4&#176; twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) facilitates two distinct stacking orders (AB&#8208;AB, AB&#8208;BA) and forms an inversion broken moir&#233; superlattice with electrically tunable flat bands. The valley Chern numbers of the flat bands depend on the stacking order, and the nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect distinguishes the differences in Berry curvature dipole (BCD), the first moment of Berry curvature. The BCD exhibits antisymmetric behavior, flipping its sign with the polarity of the perpendicular electric field in AB&#8208;AB TDBG, while it displays a symmetric behavior, maintaining the same sign regardless of the electric field's polarity in AB&#8208;BA TDBG. This approach electronically detects stacking&#8208;induced quantum geometry, while opening a pathway to quantum geometry engineering and&#160;detection.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction to Invert Hydrogen Evolution Overpotential of Cu Coating for High&#8208;Coulombic&#8208;Efficiency Stable Zn Anode in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherently small HER overpotential of Cu is reversed by strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) to modulate the electronic structure of the coating surface, thereby overturning the high HER tendency of Cu unsolved in previous Cu metal/alloy&#8208;based Zn anode protection strategies. This revolution enables an impressive 99.11% CE of Zn plating/stripping at very harsh conditions (0.2 mA cm&#8315;2) in asymmetric cells, as well as long cycle life (1400 h) and high DOD (51.7%) at 30 mA cm&#8315;2 in symmetric cells.








Abstract
Cu exhibits strong zincophilic properties but suffers from a much lower hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotential compared to Zn, which significantly undermines the coulombic efficiency and stability of the Zn anode. Consequently, Cu is regarded as an unsuitable coating for Zn anode protection. In this work, the HER overpotential of Cu versus Zn is inverted through strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) to modify the electronic structure of Cu. This interaction facilitates electron transfer, enriching positive charge and slowing down the adsorption kinetics of H+ on the Cu surface. As a result, at very low current densities of 0.2 and 2 mA cm&#8315;2, the Cu&#8208;coated&#8208;Zn||Cu cell achieves exceptionally high coulombic efficiencies of 99.11% and 99.91% over 2500 and 1600 h of cycling (100% depth of discharge (DOD)), which remarkably surpasses the performance of Zn anode protective coatings all reported. Moreover, a 1 Ah soft&#8208;packed full battery is not bulged and retains 94.7% of its initial capacity after 150 cycles. This study overturns the conventional concept by leveraging SMSI to tune the electronic structure, reverses the HER overpotential, and expands the range of viable metals for anode protection in aqueous metal batteries.

         <title>Sequential Stimuli&#8208;Response System of Eu&#8208;MOF Isomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;1 and QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;2 isomers were synthesized for the construction of sequential stimuli&#8208;response (SSR) system. Solvent&#8208;driven structural transformation of the two isomers into QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;3 occurred, accompanied by the solid color changes from white to yellow and emergence of new emission band centered at 495 nm. Furthermore, yellow QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;3 powder transformed into brown QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;4 powder upon light illumination.








Abstract
Multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive materials hold excellent potential for the next generation smart materials owing to their unique response to external stimuli, providing a powerful impetus for the development of intelligent optical devices. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of common multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive materials are independent of each other, causing the lack of multiplicity and identification for information technology, which is easy to decode. Herein, QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;1 and QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;2 isomers were prepared from QIPA and EuCl3&#183;6H2O in different solvent thermal conditions for building sequential stimuli&#8208;response (SSR) system. Solvent&#8208;driven structural transformations of the isomers into QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;3 occurred, along with color change and fluorescence emission variation ascribed to the generation of QIPA aggregates. Furthermore, QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;3 displayed excellent photochromic behaviors. Combining theoretical calculation with well&#8208;defined experiments to reveal the mechanism, it was found that light drove the change in the dihedral angles between the quinoline nucleus and adjacent benzene rings in QIPA aggregates. Finally, on the basis of sequential stimuli&#8208;induced stepwise responsive behavior of QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;1, the sequential logic gate and time&#8208;dependent fluorescence dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting pattern were successfully constructed. This study provided a new perspective for design and construction of SSR system, which showed promising potential in the fields of data transmission and information encryption.

         <title>Biomimetic rhCOL17&#8208;P334 Conjugate for Enhanced Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel bioscaffold combining recombinant human collagen XVII (rhCOL17) with porphyra&#8208;334 (P334) to create a transparent, injectable hydrogel (GCP) for enhanced wound healing. GCP integrates extracellular matrix&#8208;like cues with UVA shielding properties, preventing fibroblast senescence and improving repair outcomes. This platform offers significant potential for advanced, protective wound management.








Abstract
Wound healing remains a significant global health challenge, affecting millions annually and imposing substantial economic burdens. Most commercially available biomaterials for wound management primarily address external symptoms, including hemostasis, exudation, scarring, and infection. Advanced biomaterials derived from endogenous molecules aim to better replicate the native wound microenvironment, promoting enhanced repair. Since wounds frequently occur on exposed skin, which is vulnerable to UVA radiation and requires protective yet invisible materials, traditional wound care products often lack these essential features. Inspired by natural UV protection mechanisms, a novel bioscaffold is developed using recombinant human collagen XVII (rhCOL17) crosslinked with porphyra&#8208;334 (P334) to improve wound healing under UVA exposure. The resulting rhCOL17&#8208;P334 conjugate integrates extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;like cues with UVA&#8208;shielding properties provided by P334. This conjugate is used to construct a transparent, injectable hydrogel combining gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and rhCOL17&#8208;P334 (GCP). GCP significantly inhibits UVA&#8208;induced fibroblast senescence and improves wound healing outcomes by targeting integrin &#945;6&#946;4 through rhCOL17. Its transparency facilitates convenient wound monitoring while also addressing the aesthetic requirement for invisibility. By combining UVA shielding with wound repair capabilities, GCP presents a promising platform for advanced wound management.

         <title>Electrolyte Chemistry Modulation Toward High&#8208;Performance and Ultralow&#8208;Temperature Silicon Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategic electrolyte design principle is reported to enhance the electrochemical performance of Si anode at subzero temperature (e.g., &#8804; &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C). The combination of cyclopentylmethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran solvents simultaneously enables enhanced electrode reaction kinetics and interfacial stability, including high cation conductivity, low Li&#8208;ion desolvation barrier, and formation of robust LiF&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with polymer outer layer.








Abstract
The high&#8208;capacity silicon (Si) anode usually suffers from rapid capacity decay and low Coulombic efficiency in carbonate electrolytes resulting from large volume expansion and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). In addition, the sluggish electrode kinetics in routine electrolytes at subzero temperatures severely hampers the operational capabilities of Si&#8208;based batteries. Herein, a rational electrolyte design strategy is reported to tune the solvation chemistry and interfacial behavior of the electrolyte for high&#8208;performance Si anode. The interfacial stability and electrochemical reaction kinetics can be enhanced simultaneously at both room temperature and ultralow temperature by combining two kinds of ether&#8208;based solvents (cyclopentylmethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran), which enables high cation conductivity, low Li&#8208;ion desolvation barrier, and formation of a robust LiF&#8208;elastic polymer SEI. Consequently, the optimized electrolyte extends the cyclability of the Si anode, maintaining more than 80% capacity retention over 200 cycles at &#8722;20 and &#8722;35&#160;&#176;C. Even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, the Si electrode still delivers a high reversible capacity of 2157.0 mAh g&#8722;1, showing the highest capacity retention of 68.5% up to date relative to its room&#8208;temperature capacity. Moreover, the assembled full cells Si||LiFePO4 and Si||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance with no capacity degradation over 180 and 120 cycles, respectively, at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles&#8208;Based Doxorubicin and CD47&#8208;siRNA Co&#8208;Delivery Nanoplatform Overcomes Immune Resistance to Potentiate the Immunotherapy of Glioblastoma</title>

The nanoplatform based on engineered attenuated OMVs has good biosafety and can cross the BBB and target GBM with the assistance of Angiopep&#8208;2. The co&#8208;delivery of doxorubicin and CD47&#8208;siRNA and the immunogenicity of OMVs synergistically overcome the intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance of GBM, which ultimately triggers a powerful antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Apart from the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), the efficacy of immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM) is limited by the presence of intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance, implying that co&#8208;delivery of various immunotherapeutic agents or simultaneous regulation of different cells is urgently needed. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) offer a unique advantage in the treatment of GBM, owing to their multifunctional properties as carriers and immune adjuvants and their ability to cross the BBB. However, traditional OMVs can lead to toxic side effects and disruption of tight junctions in the BBB. Therefore, to enhance the in vivo safety and targeting capability of OMVs, we introduced engineered OMVs to reduce toxicity and further constructed a modularly assembled nanoplatform by performing simple peptide modifications. This nanoplatform demonstrates satisfactory biosafety and is able to continuously cross the BBB and target GBM with the assistance of Angiopep&#8208;2. Subsequently, immunogenic substances on OMVs, along with carried small&#8208;interfering RNA (siRNA) and doxorubicin, can promote and enhance the reprogramming and phagocytic abilities of macrophages and microglia, respectively, and increase the immunogenicity of GBM, ultimately overcoming GBM immune resistance to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. This OMVs&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a new paradigm and insights into the development of immunotherapy for GBM.

         <title>Directly Printed 3D Soft Microwave Plasmonic Enhanced&#8208;Q Resonators by Decoupling from Lossy Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional 2D plasmonic resonators are limited to be employed onto soft electronic platforms owing to the attenuation caused by lossy media. To overcome this, directly printed 3D plasmonic resonator configurations are developed with highly conductive elastomeric composites. These 3D soft resonators demonstrate wireless, multidirectional strain&#8208;sensing capabilities with higher quality factor resonances than their 2D counterparts, enabling advanced sensing applications.









Abstract
Soft electronic components are essential building blocks for realizing form&#8208;factor&#8208;free applications; however, most designs are confined to 2D or 2.5D structures due to challenges in maintaining 3D structural integrity. This limitation is particularly critical for electromagnetic devices, such as resonators, where dielectric losses from elastomeric substrates severely hinder high&#8208;performance functionality. Here, directly printed 3D electromagnetic soft plasmonic enhanced&#8208;quality(Q) factor resonators are proposed, using highly conductive composites. By incorporating an immiscible solvent into an elastomer matrix, emulsion phases are formed that significantly enhance the storage modulus, enabling the fabrication of 3D&#8208;printed structures while improving their electrical conductivity. 3D microwave plasmonic resonators with a high degree of design freedom, such as pillars and hooks are demonstrated. These structures exhibit improved resistance to dielectric interference by leveraging the resonance in lossless air. Moreover, integrating a coplanar ground plane further decouples the resonators from lossy substrates, resulting in a 3.4&#8208;fold enhancement in the Q&#8208;factor (octupole mode) compared to 2D resonators. This improvement enables stable operation on high&#8208;permittivity surfaces, such as human skin. Additionally, a single 3D resonator demonstrates wireless deformation&#8208;sensing capabilities, facilitating the simultaneous detection of strain amplitude and orientation. This result can pave the way for advanced sensing applications in soft electronics.

         <title>Nanopore&#8208;Functionalized Hybrid Lipid&#8208;Block Copolymer Membranes Allow Efficient Single&#8208;Molecule Sampling and Stable Sensing of Human Serum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological nanopores are highly promising tools for single&#8208;molecule biosensors, but the fragile supporting lipid membranes is a major bottleneck. An alternative hybrid membrane is presented, comprising phospholipids and block co&#8208;polymers, that can be functionalized by a broad variety of nanopores for single&#8208;molecule sensing. Crucially, the hybrid membrane provides substantially increased stability to harsh conditions, providing new opportunities for nanopore&#8208;based biosensors.








Abstract
Biological nanopores are powerful tools for single&#8208;molecule detection, with promising potential as next&#8208;generation biosensors. A major bottleneck in nanopore analysis is the fragility of the supporting lipid membranes, that easily rupture after exposure to biological samples. Membranes comprising PMOXA&#8208;PDMS&#8208;PMOXA (poly(2&#8208;methyloxazoline&#8208;b&#8208;dimethylsiloxane&#8208;b&#8208;2&#8208;methyloxazoline)) or PBD&#8208;PEO (poly(1,2&#8208;butadiene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide)) polymers may form robust alternatives, but their suitability for the reconstitution of a broad range of nanopores has not yet been investigated. Here, PBD&#8208;PEO membranes are found to be highly robust toward applied voltages and human serum, while providing a poor environment for nanopore reconstitution. However, hybrid membranes containing a similar molar ratio of PBD11PEO8 polymers and diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) lipids show the best of both worlds: highly robust membranes suitable for the reconstitution of a wide variety of nanopores. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that lipids form &#8776;12&#160;nm domains interspersed by a polymer matrix. Nanopores partition into these lipid nanodomains and sequester lipids, possibly offering the same binding strength as in a native bilayer. Nanopores reconstituted in hybrid membranes yield efficient sampling of biomolecules and enable sensing of high concentrations of human serum. This work thus shows that hybrid membranes functionalized with nanopores allow single&#8208;molecule sensing, while forming robust interfaces, resolving an important bottleneck for novel nanopore&#8208;based biosensors.

         <title>Co Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for High&#8208;Efficiency LiCl/Cl2 Conversion in Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Chlorine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (Co&#8208;N&#8324;) enhances Cl&#8322; adsorption and lowers LiCl reaction barriers in Li&#8208;Cl&#8322; batteries. The Li&#8208;Cl&#8322;@Co&#8208;NC battery exhibits &gt;600 cycles at 1500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at room temperature and 650 cycles at 500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, with a 0.6 V reduction in polarization voltage. This strategy delivers high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;Cl&#8322; batteries with wide temperature adaptability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;chlorine (Li&#8208;Cl2) secondary batteries are emerging as promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density power sources and an extensive operational temperature range. However, conventional electrode materials suffer from weak adsorption for&#160;chlorine gas (Cl2) and low conversion efficiency of lithium chloride (LiCl), leading to significant loss of chlorine&#8208;based active materials. This issue hampers the cyclability of Li&#8208;Cl2 batteries. In this work, it is demonstrated that synergistic Cl2 adsorption on the electrode surface and the energy barrier for LiCl reactions are crucial for enhancing Cl2/LiCl conversion efficiency. Consequently, a cobalt (Co) single&#8208;atom site catalyst with a Co&#8208;N4 coordination environment has been developed, which significantly diminishes the transformation barrier of solid LiCl particles into Cl2 and concurrently enhances the chemical adsorption of Cl2, facilitating uniform nucleation of LiCl. As a result, the Li&#8208;Cl2@Co&#8208;NC battery developed has achieved a 0.6&#160;V reduction in polarization voltage under high current densities, effectively addressing the issue of low conversion efficiency between Cl2 and LiCl. At room temperature, the Li&#8208;Cl2@Co&#8208;NC battery achieves over 600 cycles at 1500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1; At &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, it reaches 650 cycles at 500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. The research overcomes the cycle stability barrier in high&#8208;current Li&#8208;Cl2 batteries and offers a strategy for batteries with a wide temperature range and long cycle life.

         <title>Elimination of Concentration Polarization Under Ultra&#8208;High Current Density Zinc Deposition by Nanofluid Self&#8208;Driven Ion Enrichment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc anodes face severe instability under extreme conditions of high current density, high areal capacity, and high depth of discharge (DOD) due to severe concentration polarization caused by the imbalance between Zn2&#8314; consumption and transfer rates. To overcome this, a nanofluid layer is introduced to rapidly absorb Zn2&#8314; and regulate interfacial ion transport, effectively mitigating polarization and enabling stable zinc deposition. This work provides key insights into interfacial engineering for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
The commercialization of zinc metal batteries aims at high&#8208;rate capability and lightweight, which requires zinc anodes working at high current density, high areal capacity, and high depth of discharge. However, frequent zinc anode fades drastically under extreme conditions. Herein, it is revealed that the primary reason for the anode instability is the severe concentration polarization caused by the imbalanced consumption rate and transfer rate of Zn2+ under extreme conditions. Based on this finding, a nanofluid layer is constructed to rapidly absorb Zn2+ and mitigate the polarization induced by the nonlinear transport of interfacial ions. The modified zinc anode sustains at extreme conditions for over 1573 h (40 mA cm&#8722;2, 40 mAh cm&#8722;2, DOD = 75.97%) and 490 h (100 mA cm&#8722;2, 100 mAh cm&#8722;2, DOD = 90.91%), and achieving an unprecedented cumulative capacity of 62.92 Ah cm&#8722;2. This work offers both fundamental and practical insights for the interface design in energy storage devices.

         <title>Infrared In&#8208;Sensor Computing Based on Flexible Photothermoelectric Tellurium Nanomesh Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An infrared&#8208;sensitive image sensor based on self&#8208;welded tellurium (Te) nanomesh is proposed, demonstrating advancements in flexible integration and scalable fabrication. By leveraging the unique photothermolelectric (PTE) operation, thermal&#8208;coupled bi&#8208;directional photoresponse is explored to illustrate the proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in&#8208;sensor convolutional network for edge computing.








Abstract
The inherent limitations of traditional von Neumann architectures hinder the rapid development of internet of things technologies. Beyond conventional, complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technologies, imaging sensors integrated with near&#8208; or in&#8208;sensor computing architectures emerge as a promising solution. In this study, the multi&#8208;scale van der Waals (vdWs) interactions in 1D tellurium (Te) atomic chains are explored, leading to the deposition of a photothermoelectric (PTE) Te nanomesh on a polymeric polyimide substrate. The self&#8208;welding process enables the lateral vapor growth of a well&#8208;connected Te nanomesh with robust electrical and mechanical properties, including a PTE responsivity of &#8776;120&#160;V&#160;W&#8722;1 in the infrared light regime. Leveraging the PTE operation, the thermal&#8208;coupled bi&#8208;directional photoresponse is investigated to demonstrate a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in&#8208;sensor convolutional network for edge computing. This work presents a scalable approach for assembling functional vdWs Te nanomesh and highlights its potential applications in PTE image sensing and convolutional processing.

         <title>Unveiling the Origin of Oxygen Framework Stability in Ultra&#8208;High Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of oxygen framework stability is studied by integrating high covalent element Mo into the bulk and surface of ultra&#8208;high nickel cathode materials through a one&#8208;step method. Mo with strong covalency can suppress Li/Ni antisite defects and reduce Li&#8208;O&#8208;Li configurations, thus suppressing irreversible phase transition and stabilizing the oxygen framework structure at high voltage.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;high nickel layered oxides are recognized as promising cathode candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their enhanced overall capacity and elevated operating voltage. However, the interlayer sliding of transition metal&#8208;oxygen octahedra (TMO6) and the instability of lattice oxygen at high voltages for ultra&#8208;high nickel oxide cathodes pose significant challenges to their development. Herein, the origin of oxygen framework stability is investigated by incorporating high&#8208;covalent element Mo in both bulk and surface using a one&#8208;step integrated method for ultra&#8208;high nickel cathode material LiNi0.92Co0.08O2. It is revealed that apart from the isolation and protection effect of the Mo&#8208;enriched surface layer, the suppression of Li/Ni antisite defects by Mo6+ with strong covalency in the bulk plays a critical role in reducing the configurations of the activated anionic redox reaction and stabilizing the lattice oxygen and oxygen framework structure. Benefiting from this, the reversibility of anionic redox reaction and the stability of oxygen framework is significantly enhanced, enabling more oxidized oxygen to exist in the form of oxygen dimer ions O2n&#8722;$O_2^{n - }$ rather than being lost as gaseous O2. Consequently, the modified ultra&#8208;high nickel material demonstrates improved diffusion kinetics and optimized electrochemical performance at high voltage.

         <title>Surface Engineering Enabling Efficient Upcycling of Highly Degraded Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid etching assisted direct upcycling strategy that selectively removals rock&#8208;salt phases on the surface of highly degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 and dissociating polycrystalline structure to single crystals simultaneously, facilitating direct repair of its composition and structure via simple solid&#8208;state sintering. The regenerated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 exhibits comparable capacity and more excellent electrochemical stability to commercialized ones.








Abstract
Direct recycling of cathode materials has attracted phenomenal attention due to its economic and eco&#8208;friendly advantages. However, existing direct recycling technologies are difficult to apply to highly degraded layered materials as the accumulation of thick rock&#8208;salt phases on their surfaces not only blocks lithiation channels but also is thermodynamically difficult to transform into layered phases. Here, a surface engineering&#8208;assisted direct upcycling strategy that reactivates the lithium diffusion channels at the highly degraded cathode surfaces using acid etching explored. Acid can selectively remove the electrochemically inert rock&#8208;salt phases on the surface while simultaneously dissociating the degraded polycrystalline structure to single crystals, thereby reducing the thermodynamic barrier of the relithiation process and enhancing the stability of the regenerated cathode. This strategy can restore the capacity of highly degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 from 59.7 to 165.4 mAh g&#8722;1, comparable to that of commercialized ones. The regenerated cathode also exhibits excellent electrochemical stability with a capacity retention of 80.1% at 1 C after 500 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2 V (vs graphite) in pouch&#8208;type full cells. In addition, the generality of this strategy has also been validated on Ni&#8208;rich layered materials and LiCoO2. This work presents a promising approach for direct recycling of highly degraded cathode materials.

         <title>Towards Stable Metal&#8211;I2 Battery: Design of Iodine&#8211;Containing Functional Groups for Enhanced Halogen Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen bond (XB)&#8208;enhanced strategy is proposed, where &#9472;B(OH)I3 groups are incorporated into a highly integrated porous carbon/I2 cathode (HOCF&#8211;BIn) to extend interactions between &#9472;B(OH)I3 and subsequent I2 molecules. The strong intermolecular forces in HOCF&#8211;BIn cathodes significantly enhance I2/I3&#8722;/I&#8722; confinement, enabling exceptional cycling stability at I2 loadings of 1.8&#8211;6.2 mg cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The redox chemistries of iodine have attracted tremendous attention for charge storage owing to their high theoretical specific capacity and natural abundance. However, the practical capacity and cycle life are greatly limited by the active mass loss originating from the dissolved iodine species in either non&#8208;aqueous or aqueous batteries. Despite intensive progress in physical and physicochemical confinements of iodine species (I2/I3&#8722;/I&#8722;), less attention has been paid to confining iodine species beyond the host&#8211;iodine interface, inhibiting further development of iodine cathodes with high I2 contents. Here a halogen bond (XB)&#8211; enhanced design concept is proposed between I2 molecules to achieve stable cycling performances, as exemplified by the Na&#8211;I2 battery. The enhanced XB is derived from the incorporation of &#8211;B(OH)I3 groups in highly integrated porous carbon/I2 cathode (HOCF&#8211;BIn), which can generate extended interactions between &#8211;B(OH)I3 and following I2 molecules. Due to the strong intermolecular force between I2 molecules, the HOCF&#8211;BIn cathodes exhibit substantially strengthened I2/I3&#8722;/I&#8722; confinement, enabling outstanding cycling stability at I2 loading ranging from 1.8 to 6.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This findings demonstrate a functional group to manipulate XB chemistry within I2 molecules and polyiodides for stable and low&#8208;cost metal&#8211;iodine batteries.

         <title>Hydration Induces Dehydration: Creating Negative Swelling Gel by a Paradox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative swelling of hydrogel is achieved via a paradoxical hydration&#8208;induced&#8208;dehydration pathway. Chemically crosslinked polymer network generates considerable hydrostatic pressure upon swelling, which forces transformable polymers to self&#8208;assemble and collapse. The as&#8208;fabricated gels can lose 35% weight underwater and exhibit water&#8208;strengthened mechanical properties, enhanced structural responsiveness, underwater repair ability, resistance to deformation, and swelling turn&#8208;off effect, which significantly broadened potential applications.









Abstract
Swelling positively in water is a common behavior of hydrogels, which, however, can lead to reduced mechanical performance and stability. Enabling negative swelling represents a promising way to address those issues but is extremely challenging to realize. Here, real negative swelling hydrogels are successfully prepared for the first time through a unique molecular architecture. Specifically designed interpenetrating transformable&#8208;rigid polymer network undergoes self&#8208;assembly and collapses upon hydration, which in turn dehydrates itself. This paradoxical hydration&#8208;induced&#8208;dehydration process brings about revolutionary outcomes. Gels can now lose up to 35% weight underwater and exhibit water&#8208;strengthened mechanical properties, enhanced structural responsiveness, underwater repair ability, resistance to deformation, and swelling turn&#8208;off effect. Those unique properties allow future material development and applications to be carried out in much broader dimensions.

         <title>Transparent and Conductive Polyimide&#8208;Ionene Hybrid Interlayers for High Performance and Cost&#8208;Effective Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel polyimide&#8208;ionene hybrids that exhibit desirable alcohol processability, conductivity, transparency, and metal/semiconductor interface modification ability are furnished by melding pyromellitic diimides into ionene backbones. These merits render them universal cathode interlayer materials with outstanding thickness tolerance, leading to not only highly efficient and stable opaque devices but also high&#8208;performance semitransparent devices even when pairing with low&#8208;cost Cu electrodes.








Abstract
The contradiction between high transmittance and favorable conductivity poses a great challenge in developing effective cathode interlayer (CIL) materials with sufficient thickness tolerance, which hinders the further advancement of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a completely new class of alcohol processable polyimide&#8208;ionene hybrids (PIIHs) is proposed by melding pyromellitic diimide (PMD) subunits into imidazolium&#8208;based ionenes backbone covalently. These PIIHs, named PMD&#8208;DI and PMD&#8208;PD, boast high transparency, suitable energy levels, and decent conductivity. A higher PMD content endows PMD&#8208;PD with improved work function tunability, electrical properties, and crystallinity, enabling PMD&#8208;PD as CIL material with excellent thickness&#8208;insensitive characteristics, while simultaneously improving device stability significantly. Furthermore, PMD&#8208;PD also exhibits good compatibility with various electrodes and active layers, offering solar cell efficiencies of up to 19.91% and 19.29% with Ag and Cu cathodes, respectively. More importantly, the application of PMD&#8208;PD can improve the performance of semi&#8208;transparent OSCs without losing transmittance, thereby drastically enhancing the light utilization efficiency to 4.04% with an ultrathin, low&#8208;cost Cu cathode, that competes with leading optical modulation&#8208;free semitransparent OSCs with expensive Ag cathodes. This work opens a pathway to realize transparent and conductive interlayers by strategic molecular design, leading to highly efficient, stable, and cost&#8208;effective OSCs suitable for diverse applications.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Switchable Photomultiplication and Photovoltaic Dual&#8208;Mode Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BFDO&#8208;4F, is integrated into organic photodetectors (OPDs) to enable electron trapping. The resulting devices exhibit dual&#8208;mode functionality, with bias&#8208;switchable operation between photovoltaic (PV) and photomultiplication (PM) modes. An on&#8208;chip module is demonstrated, where the PV section supplies bias for the PM section achieving self&#8208;powered amplifier&#8208;free system, highlighting the potential for multifunctional OPDs in advanced optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodetectors (PM&#8208;OPDs) provide for signal amplification, ideal for detecting faint light, and simplifying detection systems. However, current designs often suffer from slow response speed and elevated dark current. Conversely, photovoltaic&#8208;type organic photodetectors (PV&#8208;OPDs) provide fast response and high specific detectivity (D*) but have limited photoresponse. This study presents the synthesis and incorporation of a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BFDO&#8208;4F, into the active layer to introduce trap states for capturing photogenerated electrons. The resulting device exhibits dual&#8208;mode characteristic and is bias&#8208;switchable between PV and PM&#8208;modes. In PV&#8208;mode, the OPDs achieve high D* of 1.92 &#215; 10&#185;2 Jones and a response time of 2.83/4.43 &#181;s. In PM&#8208;mode, the OPDs exhibit exceptional external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 3484% and a D* of up to 1.13 &#215; 10&#185;2 Jones. An on&#8208;chip self&#8208;powered module with PV&#8208;mode pixels driving a PM&#8208;mode pixel is demonstrated, yielding a photocurrent approximately five times higher than the reference device. This approach paves the way for developing multifunctional bias&#8208;switchable dual&#8208;mode on&#8208;chip OPDs, suitable for various applications.

         <title>Covalent Anchoring of Mechanical Polymer for Highly Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable Zn interfacial architecture is established, where a robust polyimide nanofilm is covalently anchored to the Zn substrate through electronegative F atoms. The strong covalent interactions provide excellent interfacial adhesion during repeated Zn/Zn2+ cycling. The remarkable resilience, modulus, and low creep of FPI film effectively resist the impact stress from electroplated Zn while maintaining structural integrity.








Abstract
Artificial interfacial protective coatings (IPCs) on Zn anodes provide a viable solution for suppressing dendritic growth by spatially confining and homogenizing the Zn2+ flux. However, repeated Zn deformation during electroplating/stripping cycles can lead to the rupture or exfoliation of IPCs, as well as the formation of detrimental interfacial gaps. Herein, a highly durable IPC is developed on a Zn substrate using a mechanically robust fluorinated polyimide nanofilm (FPI). This unique FPI interphase forms strong covalent bonds with Zn through electronegative fluorine atoms, facilitating Zn plating/stripping while maintaining interfacial adhesion. The superior resilience, modulus, and low creep of the FPI film resist the impact stresses from electroplated Zn, ensuring structural integrity. With this FPI coating, the FPI&#8208;Cu||Zn half cells demonstrate high reversibility in Zn2+ electroplating/stripping over 4000 h, maintaining Coulombic efficiency above 99.33%. When coupled with a MnO2 cathode, the MnO2||FPI&#8208;Zn full cells exhibit a long lifespan, surpassing 5000 cycles, with a high specific capacity retention of 75.21%. This study highlights the importance of achieving a balance between the customized compatibility and mechanical properties of IPCs to modulate zinc interfacial chemistries.

         <title>Localized Electrolyte Grain Engineering to Suppress Li Intrusion in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a highly scalable chemical approach based on the anion exchange reaction is developed to engineer an amorphous metal compound layer on the surface of argyrodite&#8208;type electrolyte grains. Further, a novel localized grain engineering concept is introduced, which combines engineered and pure electrolyte grains to enable aggregates with favorable macroscopic properties for suppressing Li intrusion.








Abstract
Li intrusion is the primary factor contributing to the undesirable cycling durability and rate capability of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, conventional engineering methodologies for solid electrolytes (SEs) that focus on crystalline scales, such as doping, have limited efficacy in addressing this issue, as they not only involve cumbersome trial&#8208;and&#8208;error processes but also struggle to simultaneously optimize the multiple macroscopic properties necessary for effectively suppressing Li intrusion. Herein, rather than following the conventional practice of SE engineering, it is concentrated on optimizing SEs at the grain&#8208;aggregate level. A highly scalable chemical approach based on a thermodynamic&#8208;favored anion exchange reaction is first developed to engineer an amorphous metal compound layer on the surface of argyrodite&#8208;type electrolyte grains. Further, a novel localized grain engineering concept is introduced, which combines engineered and pure electrolyte grains to enable aggregates with favorable macroscopic properties for suppressing Li intrusion. The localized grain&#8208;engineered electrolyte aggregates greatly enhance Li reversibility and are able to suppress Li intrusion under practical working conditions. Notably, the 20 &#181;m&#8208;Li||LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cell using localized grain&#8208;engineered electrolyte aggregates can stably cycle for over 2000 cycles at a high current density of 1.6 mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Lean&#8208;Water Hydrogel with Multipolar Sites for Flexible and High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Aluminum Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel inorganic/organic hybrid hydrogel electrolyte is prepared via in situ sol&#8208;gel polymerization. A high ion conductivity is achieved even under a lean&#8208;water condition. Abundant polar functional groupstend to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, thereby reducing the hydrogen evolution reaction. This hydrogel electrolyte exhibits excellent performance in both symmetrical Al batteries and full batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AAIBs) offer a promising avenue for achieving safe, high&#8208;energy, and low&#8208;cost large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, the practical development of AAIBs is hindered by competitive reduction reactions in the aqueous solution, which lead to insufficient aluminum (Al) deposition and a severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HRE). In this work, an inorganic/organic hybrid hydrogel with a stable silicon&#8208;based network and multiple polar sites is successfully fabricated via an in situ sol&#8208;gel polymerization method. The preferential formation of hydrogen bonds between the polar functional groups and water molecules effectively reduces the thermodynamic reactivity of water. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) analyses confirm the formation of a stable, inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which kinetically suppresses undesirable side reactions. This hydrogel electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 2.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, even under lean&#8208;water conditions. As a result, Al|hydrogel|potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate (KNHCF) full cells demonstrate excellent cycling performance, delivering a high initial discharge capacity of 74.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 mA g&#8722;1 and achieving an outstanding capacity retention of 90.0% after 200 cycles. Additionally, pouch cells exhibit stable open&#8208;circuit voltage under various mechanical abuse conditions.

         <title>Machine Learning Relationships Between Nanoporous Structures and Electrochemical Performance in MOF Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study constructs a unified supercapacitor database comprising hundreds of MOF electrodes based on constant&#8208;potential molecular simulation. The relationships between porous structures and electrochemical performance are thoroughly examined through interpretable machine learning techniques, with molecular insights by analyzing in&#8208;pore electrode&#8208;ion coordination and ion diffusion. These findings pave the way for the design and optimization of advanced electrode materials.









Abstract
The development of supercapacitors is impeded by the unclear relationships between nanoporous electrode structures and electrochemical performance, primarily due to challenges in decoupling the complex interdependencies of various structural descriptors. While machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution, their application is hindered by the lack of large, unified databases. Herein, constant&#8208;potential molecular simulation is used to construct a unified supercapacitor database with hundreds of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) electrodes. Leveraging this database, well&#8208;trained decision&#8208;tree&#8208;based ML models achieve fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions of capacitance and charging rate, experimentally validated by a representative case. SHAP analyses reveal that specific surface area (SSA) governs gravimetric capacitance while pore size effects are minimal, attributed to the strong dependence of electrode&#8208;ion coordination on SSA rather than pore size. SSA and porosity, respectively, dominate volumetric capacitance in 1D&#8208;pore and 3D&#8208;pore MOFs, pinnacling the indispensable effects of pore dimensionality. Meanwhile, porosity is found to be the most decisive factor in the charging rate for both 1D&#8208;pore and 3D&#8208;pore MOFs. Especially for 3D&#8208;pore MOFs, an exponential increase in porosity is observed in both ionic conductance and in&#8208;pore ion diffusion coefficient, ascribed to loosened ion packing. These findings provide profound insights for the design of high&#8208;performance supercapacitor electrodes.

Meter&#8208;scale MXene/GO@monstera nanocellulose core&#8208;shell nanofiber textiles are produced, integrating ultra&#8208;broadband EMI shielding covering GHz and THz bands, super&#8208;strong stealth properties within NIR and MIR ranges, and excellent multifunctionality, including heat resistance, flame retardant, joule heating, and stress sensing capabilities, which are promising for comprehensive electromagnetic defense in both military and civilian fields.








Abstract
The rapid development of wireless communication and infrared (IR) detection technologies has generated an increasing demand for large&#8208;size high&#8208;performance wearable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and IR stealth textiles. Herein, meter&#8208;scale MXene/graphene oxide (MG)@monstera nanocellulose (MC) core&#8208;shell nanofiber textiles are fabricated for the first time using a multi&#8208;stage cryogenic drying&#8208;assisted coaxial wet spinning assembly strategy, with MG as the conductive composite core and MC as the organic skeleton shell. The highly aligned shell and dense core endow the nanofibers with a great toughness of &#8776;39.6&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, a strong strength &gt;&#8776;180&#160;MPa, and a high conductivity of 6.4 &#215; 103 S&#160;m&#8722;1. The textiles exhibit unprecedented ultra&#8208;broadband EMI shielding performance covering gigahertz and terahertz bands, with optimal shielding effectiveness up to 84 and 85&#160;dB in the band of 8.2&#8211;26.5&#160;GHz and 0.3&#8211;1.5 THz, respectively, at only 185&#160;&#181;m thick. Superb IR stealth performance in the near&#8208; and mid&#8208;IR ranges is also achieved, benefitting from their good heat resistance and low IR emissivity. Furthermore, the textiles also demonstrate excellent dyeability, flame retardancy, Joule heating, and stress&#8208;sensing properties. Such scalable prepared core&#8208;shell nanofiber textiles with superior comprehensive performance have broad application prospects in future smart wearable protective devices.

         <title>Advancing Beyond 800 Nm: Highly Stable Near&#8208;Infrared Thermally Activated Delayed Lasing Triggered by Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Process</title>

         <dc:description>
A D&#8211;A&#8211;D type TADF molecule, TPA&#8208;DHAQ, is designed and synthesized by introducing an ESIPT&#8208;active molecule DHAQ as the acceptor unit, based on which the NIR TADF laser with a low threshold and high stability is successfully realized. In addition, a single&#8208;mode NIR TADF laser can be realized by adjusting the size of the resonator. This work provides a novel molecular design strategy to overcome the problem of poor stability of conventional NIR organic lasers.









Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic lasers have undergone rapid development in recent years, but still facing challenges in lowering the threshold and improving the stability. Herein, to overcome these challenges, a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy involving the integration of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) activity in a single molecule is proposed. Specifically, a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor type TADF material 2,6&#8208;bis[4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl]&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone (TPA&#8208;DHAQ) with an ESIPT&#8208;active moiety as the acceptor, is designed and synthesized, based on which, a NIR organic laser at 820&#160;nm with an exceptionally low threshold of 6.3&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 can be realized. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the TADF property and the ESIPT process, the resulting organic laser showed excellent stability by maintaining the laser intensity at &#8776;80% of the initial value after 580 min of continuous excitation. Finally, by modulating the size of the resonator, a single&#8208;mode NIR laser is successfully realized. This work provides a novel molecular design strategy for the development of new TADF gain materials to overcome the problem of high threshold and poor stability of conventional NIR organic lasers, and shed light on the future development of NIR organic lasers.

&lt;p&gt;A D&#8211;A&#8211;D type TADF molecule, TPA-DHAQ, is designed and synthesized by introducing an ESIPT-active molecule DHAQ as the acceptor unit, based on which the NIR TADF laser with a low threshold and high stability is successfully realized. In addition, a single-mode NIR TADF laser can be realized by adjusting the size of the resonator. This work provides a novel molecular design strategy to overcome the problem of poor stability of conventional NIR organic lasers.

&lt;p&gt;Near-infrared (NIR) organic lasers have undergone rapid development in recent years, but still facing challenges in lowering the threshold and improving the stability. Herein, to overcome these challenges, a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy involving the integration of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) activity in a single molecule is proposed. Specifically, a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor type TADF material 2,6-bis[4-(diphenylamino)phenyl]-1,5-dihydroxyanthraquinone (TPA-DHAQ) with an ESIPT-active moiety as the acceptor, is designed and synthesized, based on which, a NIR organic laser at 820&#160;nm with an exceptionally low threshold of 6.3&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; can be realized.

         <title>Hybrid Soft Segments Boost the Development of Ultratough Thermoplastic Elastomers with Tunable Hardness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hardness of a polymer material greatly affects its applicability, but traditionally, increasing hardness tends to reduce toughness. This study introduces a hybrid soft segment strategy that effectively regulates the hardness of thermoplastic elastomers without compromising their inherent toughness, enhancing their safety and structural integrity for broader applications.








Abstract
The hardness of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) significantly influences their suitability for various applications, but traditionally, enhancing hardness reduces toughness. Herein a method is introduced that leverages hybrid soft segments to fine&#8208;tune the hardness of TPEs without compromising their exceptional toughness. Through the selective copolymerization of polytetramethylene ether glycols (PTMEGs) at various molecular weights, supramolecular poly(urethane&#8208;urea) TPEs are molecularly engineered to cover a wide spectrum of hardness while retaining good toughness. It is achieved through the formation of graded functional zones&#8212;densely packed for enhanced hardness and strength, and loosely packed for greater extensibility and toughness&#8212;driven by variations in PTMEG chain length and mismatched supramolecular interactions. Through the establishment and systematic investigation of a TPE library, the intricate interplay between design, structure, and performance of these materials is elucidated, refining the optimization techniques. The TPEs demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties, including a variant with a Shore hardness of 86A and a toughness of 819&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, alongside a softer variant with a 59A hardness and a 786&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 toughness. The innovation extends to a scalable solvent&#8208;based TPE production line, promising widespread industrial application. This advancement reimagines the potential of high&#8208;performance TPEs and composites, offering versatile materials for demanding applications.

         <title>A Library of Polyphenol&#8208;Amino Acid Condensates for High&#8208;Throughput Continuous Flow Production of Nanomedicines with Ultra&#8208;High Drug Loading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable and flexible library of natural, renewable tea polyphenol, and amino acid condensate colloidal spheres, synthesized via a one&#8208;step process, facilitates the preparation of ultra&#8208;high drug&#8208;loading nanomedicines with precise size control and uniform dispersion using continuous&#8208;flow microfluidics. This approach effectively addresses the challenges associated with the nanonization of poorly soluble drugs and holds significant promise for advancing pharmaceutical formulations.









Abstract
Synthesizing high drug&#8208;loading nanomedicines remains a formidable challenge, and achieving universally applicable, continuous, large&#8208;scale engineered production of such nanomedicines presents even greater difficulties. This study presents a scalable library of polyphenol&#8208;amino acid condensates. By selecting amino acids, the library enables precise customization of key properties, such as carrier capacity, bioactivity, and other critical attributes, offering a versatile range of options for various application scenarios. Leveraging the properties of solvent&#8208;mediated disassembly and reassembly of condensates achieved an ultra&#8208;high drug loading of 86% for paclitaxel. For a range of poorly soluble molecules, the drug loading capacity exceeded 50%, indicating broad applicability. Furthermore, employing a continuous microfluidic device, the production rate can reach 5 mL&#160;min&#8722;1 (36 g&#160;per day), with the nanoparticle size precisely tunable and a polydispersity index (PDI) below 0.2. The polyphenol&#8208;based carrier demonstrates efficient cellular uptake and, in three distinct animal models, has been shown to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel without significant side effects. This study presents a streamlined, efficient, and scalable approach using microfluidics to produce nanomedicines with ultra&#8208;high drug loading, offering a promising strategy for the nanoformulation of poorly soluble drugs.

         <title>Folding of mRNA&#8208;DNA Origami for Controlled Translation and Viral Vector Packaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The packaging of mRNA into a compact, predefined shape can impact cellular delivery. This study presents a first set of design rules for the efficient folding of mRNA&#8208;DNA origami structures, while preserving its initial translation functionality, which is demonstrated extracellularly as well as in vitro by using virus capsid proteins for packaging and enhancing cellular uptake.








Abstract
mRNA is an important molecule in vaccine development and treatment of genetic disorders. Its capability to hybridize with DNA oligonucleotides in a programmable manner facilitates the formation of RNA&#8208;DNA origami structures, which can possess a well&#8208;defined morphology and serve as rigid supports for mRNA delivery. However, to date, comprehensive studies on the requirements for efficient folding of mRNA into distinct mRNA&#8208;DNA structures while preserving its translation functionality remain elusive. Here, the impact of design parameters on the folding of protein&#8208;encoding mRNA into mRNA&#8208;DNA origami structures is systematically investigated and the importance of the availability of ribosome&#8208;binding sequences on the translation efficiency is demonstrated. Furthermore, these hybrid structures are encapsulated inside virus capsids resulting in protecting them against nuclease degradation and also in enhancement of their cellular uptake. This multicomponent system therefore showcases a modular and versatile nanocarrier. The work provides valuable insight into the design of mRNA&#8208;DNA origami structures contributing to the development of mRNA&#8208;based gene delivery platforms.

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;Templated Ceria Nanozyme Reinforced Microneedle for Diabetic Wound Treatments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an effective strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;catalytic and stable nanozymes, and introduces the first example of amyloid&#8208;ceria nanozymes reinforced microneedle which features a complex, synergistic catalytic behavior combining superoxide dismutase and catalase&#8208;like activities, promoting to remodel the infection microenvironment in diabetic wounds, and holding significant promise for clinical applications.








Abstract
Amyloid fibrils have emerged as excellent templates and building blocks for the development of ordered functional materials with considerable potential in biomedical applications. Here, lysozyme amyloid fibrils (Lys&#8208;AFs) are employed as templates for the in situ synthesis of ceria nanozymes (Lys&#8208;AFs&#8208;Ceria) with ultrafine dimensions, an optimized Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio, and uniform distribution on the fibril surface, addressing the challenges of low catalytic efficiency and high susceptibility to aggregation typical of traditional methods. As a proof of concept, it is further applied Lys&#8208;AFs&#8208;Ceria to develop hydrogel/microneedle for treating bacteria&#8208;infected diabetic wounds via non&#8208;covalent interactions between polyphenols and amyloid fibrils incorporating glucose oxidase (GOX). The hydrogel/microneedle facilitates superoxide dismutase and catalase cascade catalysis by Lys&#8208;AFs&#8208;Ceria, and integrates GOX&#8208;mediated glucose consumption, synergistically achieving glucose reduction, reactive oxygen species elimination, and hypoxia alleviation in the diabetic wound infection microenvironment. In addition to antibacterial properties and tissue regeneration promotion of Lys&#8208;AFs scaffold, Lys&#8208;AFs&#8208;Ceria regulates macrophages polarization toward an anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 state. Collectively, these attributes contribute to the enhanced efficacy of diabetic wound healing, with in vivo studies demonstrating increased healing efficiency following a single application, and more in general an effective strategy toward high&#8208;catalytic and stable nanozymes.

The hydrogel/microneedle facilitates superoxide dismutase and catalase cascade catalysis by Lys-AFs-Ceria, and integrates GOX-mediated glucose consumption, synergistically achieving glucose reduction, reactive oxygen species elimination, and hypoxia alleviation in the diabetic wound infection microenvironment. In addition to antibacterial properties and tissue regeneration promotion of Lys-AFs scaffold, Lys-AFs-Ceria regulates macrophages polarization toward an anti-inflammatory M2 state. Collectively, these attributes contribute to the enhanced efficacy of diabetic wound healing, with in vivo studies demonstrating increased healing efficiency following a single application, and more in general an effective strategy toward high-catalytic and stable nanozymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Negative&#8208;Valent Platinum Stabilized by Pt&#9472;Ni Electron Bridges on Oxygen&#8208;Deficient NiFe&#8208;LDH for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Pt anchored in oxygen&#8208;deficient NiFe&#8208;LDH via Pt&#9472;Ni bonds reduces Pt's valence state, enhancing hydrogen evolution reaction performance. Oxygen vacancies facilitate electron transfer, while elevated Ni valence boosts hydrophilicity and lowers hydrolysis barriers. The catalyst achieves ultra&#8208;low overpotentials and significantly higher mass activity compared to Pt/C, showcasing a novel coordination design strategy.








Abstract
The unique hydrogen adsorption characteristics of negatively charged platinum play a crucial role in enhancing the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. However, atomically dispersed Pt atoms are typically anchored to the support through non&#8208;metallic atom bonds, resulting in a high oxidation state. Here, atomically dispersed Pt atoms are anchored in oxygen&#8208;deficient NiFe&#8208;LDH. Electron transfer between Pt and NiFe&#8208;LDH occurs primarily through Pt&#9472;Ni bonds rather than the conventional Pt&#9472;O bonds. Oxygen vacancies in the NiFe&#8208;LDH promote additional electron transfer from Ni to Pt, thereby reducing the valence state of Pt and enhancing hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, the elevated valence state of Ni increases the catalyst's hydrophilicity and reduces the energy barrier for hydrolysis dissociation. This catalyst demonstrates remarkably low overpotentials of 4 and 9&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;m KOH and 1&#160;m KPi, respectively. Additionally, its mass activity is 51.5 and 23.7 times higher that of Pt/C, respectively. This study presents a novel strategy for enhancing electrocatalytic performance through the rational design of coordination environments and electronic structures in supported metal catalysts.

         <title>Critical Ingredients Revitalize Magnesium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Rationality and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Critical ingredients can revitalize magnesium&#8208;metal anode in conventional electrolytes. Mechanistic insights, with an emphasis on Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure regulation, interfacial evolution, solvent ionization, and weak interfacial passivation, have been especially underscored in terms of the close relationship between electrolyte chemistries and weakly&#8208;passivated interphase properties.









Abstract
Multivalent&#8208;metal batteries hold tremendous promise in solving safety and sustainability problems encountered by common lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but the lack of ideal electrolyte solutions restricts their large&#8208;scale adoption. Tuning electrolyte structures with functional ingredients, especially amines/methoxy&#8208;based amines and phosphates, can revitalize multivalent&#8208;metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes in conventional electrolytes, unlocking their full potential. However, a rational and clear understanding of the implications of these ingredients, notwithstanding critically important to commercially available electrolyte design, has not been widely accepted. This concise perspective aims to provide timely analysis and discussion on ingredients&#8217; functionalities of solvation shell speciation, interphase evolution, and consequently metal plating/stripping kinetics acceleration. In addition to prevailing coordination interactions, fresh understandings of intermolecular ionization/association and unique interphase formation are underscored by the close relationship between electrolyte chemistries and weakly passivated interphase properties. The existing understandings and proposed outlooks are expected to promote the next breakthroughs for rechargeable multivalent&#8208;metal batteries.

Abstract
This note responds to Schwartz and Hutchison's Comment. Differences appear to have arisen not in the experimental results themselves but in their interpretation: more extensive experiments allow one to distinguish between &#8220;true positive&#8221; and &#8220;false positive&#8221; results. Potential evidence of non&#8208;polaritonic effects in Schwartz and Hutchison's own work is identified. It is hoped that this work will encourage others to produce more systematic investigations of strong coupling.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Out&#8208;Of&#8208;Plane Ferroelectricity in 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2 Heterophase Bilayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity is observed in 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2 bilayers synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The phenomenon is confirmed through structural analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), as well as switching behavior characterized by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) measurements. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the ferroelectricity originates from interlayer sliding. This discovery extends the scope of 2D ferroelectrics to vertically stacked heterophase systems, offering new opportunities for exploring coupled phenomena in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs).








Abstract
The emergence of heterophase 2D materials, distinguished by their unique structures, has led to the discovery of a multitude of intriguing physical properties and a broad range of potential applications. Here, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity is uncovered in a heterophase structure of 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2, which is synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by tuning the formation energies for MoS2 with varied phases. The atomically resolved structures of the obtained 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2 bilayers are captured using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and are confirmed to be non&#8208;centrosymmetric using second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) characterizations. The intrinsic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is visualized by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), which reveals that ferroelectric domains can be manipulated under an applied electric field. Ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) devices fabricated on these bilayers exhibit reversible switching between a high resistance state (HRS) and a low resistance state (LRS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that the intrinsic ferroelectricity in 1T&#8242;/1H bilayers is attributed to interlayer sliding and lattice mismatch. The findings not only expand the scope of 2D ferroelectrics to include vertically stacked heterophase bilayers but also open avenues for exploring the coupling effect between ferroelectricity and other phenomena such as magnetism, superconductivity, and photocatalysis in 2D heterophase TMDCs.

         <title>Photoinduced, Swift, and Reversible Spatiotemporal Programming of Double Dynamically Bonded Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating anthracene&#8208;based dynamic bonds into a supramolecular liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) enables swift and reversible alternation of its local nematic&#8208;isotropic transition temperature and global actuation strain. The morphing behavior of the LCE actuator can be spatiotemporally programmed by varying the local UV exposure. This empowers precise motion control to accomplish intricate tasks, such as the aligning, threading, and locking mechanism.








Abstract
Spatiotemporal programming of the morphing behavior of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) by local tailoring of the nematic to isotropic temperature (TNI) can empower the precise design of their versatile motions. The current approach and materials design to achieve this process are either slow or irreversible, limiting its efficiency and efficacy. Here, a dynamic bond of anthracene and ethyl acrylate (An&#8208;A) is introduced to enable photoinduced topology transformation to alter the TNI of the LCE, into a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular LCE network, where the actuation modes can already be reconfigured upon annealing. Experiments and molecular dynamics simulation demonstrate that the An&#8208;A bonds undergo reversible cycloaddition with 365&#160;nm UV exposure for as short as 10&#160;min, and depolymerization with 254&#160;nm UV. The resulting topological transformations of the network give rise to changes in the TNI, actuation strain, and mechanical properties, which can be programed and erased by light. With that, a spatiotemporally reprogrammable LCE actuator: a single LCE that morphs into different shapes, especially those that are far more achievable when the trajectory can be designed by sequential actuation, is developed. This system offers a promising strategy for swift and reversible morphing behavior with custom&#8208;designed trajectory in future smart soft robots.

The morphing behavior of the LCE actuator can be spatiotemporally programmed by varying the local UV exposure. This empowers precise motion control to accomplish intricate tasks, such as the aligning, threading, and locking mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spatiotemporal programming of the morphing behavior of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) by local tailoring of the nematic to isotropic temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;NI&lt;/sub&gt;) can empower the precise design of their versatile motions. The current approach and materials design to achieve this process are either slow or irreversible, limiting its efficiency and efficacy. Here, a dynamic bond of anthracene and ethyl acrylate (An-A) is introduced to enable photoinduced topology transformation to alter the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;NI&lt;/sub&gt; of the LCE, into a hydrogen-bonded supramolecular LCE network, where the actuation modes can already be reconfigured upon annealing. Experiments and molecular dynamics simulation demonstrate that the An-A bonds undergo reversible cycloaddition with 365&#160;nm UV exposure for as short as 10&#160;min, and depolymerization with 254&#160;nm UV. The resulting topological transformations of the network give rise to changes in the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;NI&lt;/sub&gt;, actuation strain, and mechanical properties, which can be programed and erased by light. With that, a spatiotemporally reprogrammable LCE actuator: a single LCE that morphs into different shapes, especially those that are far more achievable when the trajectory can be designed by sequential actuation, is developed. This system offers a promising strategy for swift and reversible morphing behavior with custom-designed trajectory in future smart soft robots.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Recyclable Polyester Elastomers Through Transient Strain&#8208;Stiffening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient strain&#8208;crystallization simultaneously strengthens and toughens block polyester elastomers while conserving recyclability. Using controlled polymerization catalysis and commercial monomers, block polyester elastomers outperform current commercial elastomers, entering a new region of tensile mechanical property space.








Abstract
Polyester thermoplastic elastomers are promising sustainable materials but their mechanical properties need improvement, in particular, attempts to increase strength often result in compromised elasticity. Strong and tough elastomers are known but require complex polymer formulations together with control over cross&#8208;linking or crystallinity, both of which challenge recycling. Here, the introduction of transient strain&#8208;stiffening approaches into fully amorphous structures show both strengthening and toughening of elastomers while conserving recyclability. The new amorphous block polyester elastomers are prepared by controlled polymerization methods using commercial monomers. The block polymers comprise a central poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone&#8208;co&#8208;&#603;&#8208;decalactone) block flanked by poly(cyclohexene oxide&#8208;alt&#8208;phthalate) blocks. Elastomer thermomechanical properties are tuned by varying ratios of &#603;&#8208;caprolactone to &#603;&#8208;decalactone within the mid&#8208;block to access materials with excellent mechanical properties. The best elastomers feature 30&#8211;50 wt.% polycaprolactone and exhibit tensile strengths up to 40&#160;MPa, elongations at break above 2000%, with excellent elastic recovery (&gt;90%). These materials exhibit strain&#8208;induced crystallization and outperform current commercial elastomers, entering a new region of tensile mechanical property space. They have service temperature ranges from &#8722;60 to 140&#160;&#176;C and high temperature stability (&#8805;300&#160;&#176;C), with wide thermal (re)processing windows. These new polyester elastomers also show high resistance to creep, humidity resistance, and excellent recyclability.

         <title>A Sprayable Hydrogel Based on Biomimetic Polypeptide&#8208;Modified Lipid Nanoparticles for Treating Non&#8208;Compressible Hemorrhaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a sprayable hydrogel based on polypeptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles (PLNs) mimicking natural hemostasis. PLNs integrate platelet adhesion peptide (GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (GGQQLK), DSPS, and Ca2&#8314; to activate coagulation. Combined with Ca2&#8314;&#8208;sodium alginate hydrogels, they synergistically enhance rapid clot formation via platelet aggregation, prothrombin activation, and fibrin crosslinking, offering an efficient biomimetic strategy for hemorrhage.








Abstract
Non&#8208;compressible hemorrhaging is the main cause of death in modern warfare. A biomimetic peptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based sprayable hydrogel is developed to mimic and amplify the blood coagulation process for effective hemostasis. A platelet adhesion peptide (PAP, sequence: GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (PCP, sequence: GGQQLK) are customized and conjugated to 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;N[methoxy (polyethylene glycol) 2000] acid (DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;COOH) via amido bonds to form DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;PAP and DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;PCP, respectively. These compounds are mixed with distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine, cholesterol, and distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;L&#8208;serine (DSPS) to construct the peptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles via thin film rehydration. The nanoparticles are incorporated into a CaCl2&#8208;sodium alginate sprayable hydrogel crosslinked via ionic bonds. The application of the hydrogel solution quickly gels and seals the wound. The PAP activates and adheres platelets, the DSPS and Ca2+ amplify prothrombin activation, and PCP strengthens the fibrin network. The hydrogel achieves rapid hemostasis within 30 s in a liver hemorrhage model. This sprayable hydrogel has significant potential for managing non&#8208;compressible hemorrhaging.

         <title>Electron Extraction Optimization for Carbon&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Conductor&#8208;Free Perovskite Photovoltaics With Record 1.41&#160;V VOC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient electron energy level strategy is constructed to reduce voltage losses in planar HTL&#8208;free CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs. This electron extraction optimization enables rapid photogenerated electron extraction and carrier separation, thereby suppressing recombination at the back contact. The resulting PSCs deliver a record VOC of 1.41 V, a high PCE of 17.42% and a high stability, simultaneously.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) free of a hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) have emerged as promising photovoltaics due to their low processing cost and superior stability. However, the voltage deficit resulting from inefficient carrier extraction causes insufficient power conversion efficiency (PCE), severely hindering their progress. Here, a gradient electron energy level modulation strategy proves effective in reducing voltage losses through the rapid extraction of photogenerated electrons. This process enhances carrier separation/collection and reduces recombination at the back contact, thereby achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics. It is demonstrated that the front electron extraction, equally critical as the prevailing back perovskite/carbon contact, accounts for the significant contributing factor of voltage deficit in carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free PSCs. The resulting PSCs deliver a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.41&#160;V and a PCE of 17.42% and retain more than 92% of their initial efficiency after 1, 000&#160;h. These results highlight the significant potential of carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Nacre&#8208;Inspired 2D Carbon&#8208;Based Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advancements in nacre&#8208;inspired 2D carbon&#8208;based nanocomposites (TDCNs) based&#8208;graphene and MXene. Innovative fabrication strategies have been developed to align nanosheets while effectively eliminating voids through interfacial bridging, synergistic toughening, and confined assembly. The resulting densified TDCNs demonstrate exceptional fatigue resistance, electrical conductivity, and durability, making them suitable for applications in flexible electronics, bone tissue regeneration, and thermal insulation.








Abstract
Nacre has become the golden standard for the structural design of high&#8208;performance composites due to extraordinary fracture toughness, which exceeds the mixing principle of traditional composites by two orders of magnitude. Surprisingly, the unique biomaterials are formed under ambient temperature and pressure conditions, resulting in low energy consumption and no pollution. It is an effective approach to obtain inspiration from structure&#8208;activity relationships of biomaterials for developing the next&#8208;generation of high&#8208;performance composites. Furthermore, 2D carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene and MXene, having exceptional mechanical and electrical properties, are ideal candidates for fabricating new generation high&#8208;performance composites that would replace carbon fiber (CF) composites. This review systematically summarizes relevant works for high&#8208;performance 2D carbon nanocomposites (TDCNs) inspired by nacre. The review first explores structural insights from the nacre. Next, the fabrication strategies of TDCNs are systematically summarized, with an emphasis on achieving highly aligned 2D carbon nanosheets through advanced assembly techniques. Subsequently, the critical role of void defects, which is a key factor governing the mechanical properties of TDCNs, is addressed by analyzing their formation mechanisms, characterization methodologies, and elimination strategies. Finally, the applications and challenges of high&#8208;performance TDCNs obtained through highly aligned assembly and densification processes are discussed.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Upconversion Nanoparticles for Emerging NIR Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The special photo&#8208;responsiveness of upconversion nanoparticles has opened up a new path for the advancement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive optoelectronics. However, challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and high nonradiative losses still persist. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between materials properties and device performance, offering both theoretical and empirical guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance NIR optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), incorporating lanthanide (Ln) dopants, can convert low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared photons into higher&#8208;energy visible or ultraviolet light through nonlinear energy transfer processes. This distinctive feature has attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and advanced optoelectronics. Challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and nonradiative losses limit the performance of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Recent advancements including optimized core&#8211;shell structures, tailed Ln&#8208;doping concentration, and surface modifications show significant promise for improving the efficiency and stability. In addition, combining UCNPs with functional materials can broaden their applications and improve device performance, paving the way for the innovation of next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. This paper first categorizes and elaborates on various upconversion mechanisms in UCNPs, focusing on strategies to boost energy transfer efficiency and prolong luminescence. Subsequently, an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various materials that can enhance the efficiency of UCNPs and expand their functionality is provided. Furthermore, a wide range of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices is explored, and multiple emerging applications in UCNP&#8208;based neuromorphic computing are highlighted. Finally, the existing challenges and potential solutions involved in developing practical UCNPs optoelectronic devices are considered, as well as an outlook on the future of UCNPs in advanced technologies is provided.

         <title>Pairing N&#8208;Vacancy and Adjacent Ni&#8208;Sites in the Local Microenvironment to Regulate the Urea Oxidation Reaction Pathway With Enhanced Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nitrogen vacancies&#8208;rich nickel nitride (Ni3N&#8208;VN), a local microenvironment of nitrogen vacancies and adjacent Ni sites is formed. The electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites can be converted to NiOOH at a lower potential, and urea adsorption on the electron&#8208;deficient nitrogen vacancy region is conducive to its partial dissociation, conceiving to efficient urea oxidation reaction.








Abstract
The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising approach for replacing the oxygen evolution reaction in hydrogen production, offering lower energy consumption. However, the kinetics of Ni&#8208;based catalysts for UOR are hindered by the high formation potential of NiOOH and its repeated transition with Ni(OH)2. In this study, a local microenvironment featuring electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;vacancies (VN) paired with adjacent electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites on Ni3N (Ni3N&#8208;VN) to enhance UOR kinetics is constructed. The electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites significantly reduce the energy barrier for NiOOH formation and promote the conversion of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH. Meanwhile, the VN sites induce low charge transfer resistance in Ni3N, facilitating efficient electron transfer and boosting UOR performance while ensuring the stability of the active NiOOH phase. The VN sites promote the adsorption of the urea N atom at the active site, favoring the reaction pathway toward &#8220;NCO&#8315;&#8221; formation without requiring complete urea dissociation. This pathway alleviates the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 conversion cycle, lowers charge transfer resistance, and improves reaction kinetics. Ni3N&#8208;VN demonstrates excellent UOR activity (low potential of 1.46&#160;V at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and industrial prospects (integrating into an anion exchange membrane flow electrolyzer with 20% Pt/C, producing 600&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.84&#160;V), highlighting its potential for practical applications.

         <title>Direct Recycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes Through Photocatalytic Correction of Anti&#8208;Site Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ photocatalysis to decrease the iron migration barrier, enabling the repositioning of disordered iron atoms into their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously facilitating Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thereby realizing the direct recovery of S&#8208;LFP. This method has substantial environmental and economic benefits, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;Li (FeLi) anti&#8208;site defects, commonly observed in degraded LiFePO4 cathodes, impede Li+ mobility and disrupt the electronic pathways, leading to significant performance degradation in LFP. However, addressing FeLi anti&#8208;site defects to achieve direct recycling of LFP remains challenging due to Fe high migration energy barriers and the lattice distortions they induce. Here, a feasible strategy is proposed for LFP regeneration by utilizing photocatalysis to reduce the Fe migration barrier. This approach facilitates repositioning disordered Fe atoms to their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously enabling Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thus restoring capacity and ensuring cycling stability. The mechanism of the photocatalysis regeneration strategy is comprehensively analyzed through a combination of theoretical calculations, in&#8208;depth atomic characterization techniques, and electrochemical evaluations. Notably, this strategy is adaptable to varying levels of FeLi anti&#8208;site defects in spent LFP. Furthermore, life cycle analysis highlights the substantial environmental and economic benefits of this advanced strategy, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.

Flexible QZPCs formulated by the MES@CNT/CC air cathode and IL&#8208;PANa hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105 Wh kgcell&#8722;1, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 4000 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 even at low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. The electronic synergy within the bifunctional MES@CNT/CC air cathode, initiates an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;site&#8208;switching catalytic mechanism during the reciprocating ORR and OER processes, thereby sustaining the high performance of the QZPCs.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air pouch cells (QZPCs) promise a high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratio while ensuring inherent safety. However, addressing the challenges associated with exploring superior energy&#8208;wise cathode catalysts along with their activity origin, and the super&#8208;ionic electrolytes remains a fundamental task. Herein, the realistic high&#8208;performance QZPCs are contrived, underpinned by a robust NiVFeCo medium&#8208;entropy metal sulfides (MESs) bifunctional air cathode with a record&#8208;low potential polarization of 0.523&#160;V, paired with a sodium polyacrylate&#8208;ionic liquid hydrogel exhibiting exceptional conductivity (234 mS cm&#8722;1) and water retention (93.8% at 7 days) at room temperature as the super&#8208;ionic conductor electrolyte. Through combined studies of in situ Raman, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis, and theoretic calculations, an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;sites&#8208;switching mechanism of the MESs cathode during discharging/charging processes is unveiled, revealing a dynamic role transition of Co and Ni active sites in the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Consequently, the persistent low cathode polarization and super ion&#8208;conductive electrolyte endorse QZPCs an excellent rate performance from 1 to 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. Moreover, an impressively high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105&#160;Wh kgcell&#8722;1 with an ultra&#8208;long cycle lifespan of 4000 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C is achieved.

The electronic synergy within the bifunctional MES@CNT/CC air cathode, initiates an intriguing adaptive active-site-switching catalytic mechanism during the reciprocating ORR and OER processes, thereby sustaining the high performance of the QZPCs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-solid-state Zn-air pouch cells (QZPCs) promise a high energy-to-cost ratio while ensuring inherent safety. However, addressing the challenges associated with exploring superior energy-wise cathode catalysts along with their activity origin, and the super-ionic electrolytes remains a fundamental task. Herein, the realistic high-performance QZPCs are contrived, underpinned by a robust NiVFeCo medium-entropy metal sulfides (MESs) bifunctional air cathode with a record-low potential polarization of 0.523&#160;V, paired with a sodium polyacrylate-ionic liquid hydrogel exhibiting exceptional conductivity (234 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and water retention (93.8% at 7 days) at room temperature as the super-ionic conductor electrolyte. Through combined studies of in situ Raman, ex situ X-ray absorption fine structure analysis, and theoretic calculations, an intriguing adaptive active-sites-switching mechanism of the MESs cathode during discharging/charging processes is unveiled, revealing a dynamic role transition of Co and Ni active sites in the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Consequently, the persistent low cathode polarization and super ion-conductive electrolyte endorse QZPCs an excellent rate performance from 1 to 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature. Moreover, an impressively high cell-level energy density of 105&#160;Wh kg&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an ultra-long cycle lifespan of 4000 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired O2&#8208;Evolution Catalysts with Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Pathway for Portable Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Bioinspired Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxide (Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x) is developed as an O2&#8208;evolution catalyst with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway for efficient and low&#8208;energy O2 generation. The lattice H species in Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x optimizes Ru&#8208;oxygen intermediates interactions, thereby enhancing O2 production performance. This technique ensures an uninterrupted O2 supply during emergencies and in regions with limited O2 availability, providing significant societal benefits.









Abstract
Producing high&#8208;purity oxygen (O2) has a wide range of applications across diverse sectors, such as medicine, tunnel construction, the chemical industry, and fermentation. However, current O2 production methods are burdened by complexity, heavy equipment, high energy consumption, and limited adaptability to harsh environments. Here, to address this grand challenge, the de novo design of Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxide is proposed to serve as bioinspired O2&#8208;evolution catalysts with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway for low&#8208;energy, environmentally friendly, cost&#8208;effective, and portable O2 generation. The comprehensive studies confirm that the lattice H species in Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x&#8208;based O2&#8208;evolution catalyst can trigger a PCET pathway to optimize Ru&#8208;oxygen intermediates interactions, thus ultimately reducing reaction energy barriers and improving the activities and durabilities. Consequently, the prepared Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x&#8208;loaded membrane catalysts exhibit rapid and long&#8208;term stable O2 production capabilities. Furthermore, the proposed material design strategy of lattice H&#8208;species shows remarkable universality and adaptability to broad Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxides. This efficient, portable, and cost&#8208;effective O2 generation technique is suggested to ensure an uninterrupted O2 supply during emergencies and in regions with limited O2 availability or air pollution, thus offering significant societal benefits in broad applications.

         <title>Suppression of Stacking Faults for Stable Formamidinium&#8208;Rich Perovskite Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors show that the (011)C perovskite planes are prone to stacking faults formation in all leading formamidinium&#8208;rich perovskite compositions. Using ethylene thiourea as a precursor additive, Othman et&#160;al. suppress those vulnerable facets, significantly enhancing the absorber's intrinsic stability under various operational conditions.









Abstract
The poor intrinsic perovskite absorber stability is arguably a central limitation challenging the prospect of commercialization for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Understanding the nanoscopic structural features that trigger instabilities in perovskite materials is essential to mitigate device degradation. Using nanostructure characterization techniques, we observe the local degradation to be initiated by material loss at stacking faults, forming inherently in the (011)&#8208;faceted perovskite domains in different formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite compositions. We introduce Ethylene Thiourea (ETU) as an additive into the perovskite precursor, which manipulates the perovskite crystal growth and results in dominantly in&#8208;and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (001) oriented perovskite domains. Combining in&#8208;depth experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations, we find that ETU lowered the perovskite formation energy, readily enabling crystallization of the perovskite phase at room temperature without the need for an antisolvent quenching step. This facilitated the fabrication of high&#8208;quality large area 5 cm by 5 cm blade&#8208;coated perovskite films and devices. Encapsulated and unmasked ETU&#8208;treated devices, with an active area of 0.2 cm2, retained &gt; 93 % of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for &gt; 2100 hours at room temperature, and additionally, 1 cm2 ETU&#8208;treated devices maintained T80 (the duration for the PCE to decay to 80 % of the initial value) for &gt; 600 hours at 65 &#176;C, under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at the maximum power point in ambient conditions. Our demonstration of scalable and stable perovskite solar cells represents a promising step towards achieving a reliable perovskite PV technology.

Bayesian Optimization of Carbon Nanolattices
Machine Learning designs new nanolattice geometries with the strength of carbon steel, but the density of Styrofoam, offering record strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight of lightweight materials. By implementing multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization in combination with two&#8208;photon polymerization and pyrolysis, these ultrahigh specific strength carbon nanolattices more than double the performance of benchmark materials. More details can be found in article number 2410651 by Peter Serles, Tobin Filleter, Seunghwa Ryu, and co&#8208;workers.

True Random Number Generator
In article number 2419579, Hocheon Yoo and co&#8208;workers present arc discharge light&#8208;induced true random number generator (ALTRNG), using a bipolar photo&#8208;responsive photodetector to generate random bits through unpredictable arc discharge illumination. Validated by 15 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tests, ALTRNG produces highly random bit streams and, with a 2&#8208;kbps readout circuit, enables wireless random number transmission for secure password systems and artificial X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Ultrahigh Specific Strength by Bayesian Optimization of Carbon Nanolattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization algorithm designs high&#8208;strength nanolattices made of pyrolytic carbon which offer the compressive strength of carbon steel at the density of Styrofoam. This study combines machine learning with nanoscale strengthening and nanoscale 3D printing to achieve unattained material properties with millimeter scalability for light&#8208;weight high&#8208;strength materials.








Abstract
Nanoarchitected materials are at the frontier of metamaterial design and have set the benchmark for mechanical performance in several contemporary applications. However, traditional nanoarchitected designs with conventional topologies exhibit poor stress distributions and induce premature nodal failure. Here, using multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization and two&#8208;photon polymerization, optimized carbon nanolattices with an exceptional specific strength of 2.03&#160;MPa&#160;m3&#160;kg&#8722;1 at low densities &lt;215&#160;kg m&#8722;3 are created. Generative design optimization provides experimental improvements in strength and Young's modulus by as much as 118% and 68%, respectively, at equivalent densities with entirely different lattice failure responses. Additionally, the reduction of nanolattice strut diameters to 300&#160;nm produces a unique high&#8208;strength carbon with a pyrolysis&#8208;induced atomic gradient of 94% sp2 aromatic carbon and low oxygen impurities. Using multi&#8208;focus multi&#8208;photon polymerization, a millimeter&#8208;scalable metamaterial consisting of 18.75 million lattice cells with nanometer dimensions is demonstrated. Combining Bayesian optimized designs and nanoarchitected pyrolyzed carbon, the optimal nanostructures exhibit the strength of carbon steel at the density of Styrofoam offering unparalleled capabilities in light&#8208;weighting, fuel reduction, and contemporary design applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoarchitected materials are at the frontier of metamaterial design and have set the benchmark for mechanical performance in several contemporary applications. However, traditional nanoarchitected designs with conventional topologies exhibit poor stress distributions and induce premature nodal failure. Here, using multi-objective Bayesian optimization and two-photon polymerization, optimized carbon nanolattices with an exceptional specific strength of 2.03&#160;MPa&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at low densities &amp;lt;215&#160;kg m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; are created. Generative design optimization provides experimental improvements in strength and Young's modulus by as much as 118% and 68%, respectively, at equivalent densities with entirely different lattice failure responses. Additionally, the reduction of nanolattice strut diameters to 300&#160;nm produces a unique high-strength carbon with a pyrolysis-induced atomic gradient of 94% sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; aromatic carbon and low oxygen impurities. Using multi-focus multi-photon polymerization, a millimeter-scalable metamaterial consisting of 18.75 million lattice cells with nanometer dimensions is demonstrated. Combining Bayesian optimized designs and nanoarchitected pyrolyzed carbon, the optimal nanostructures exhibit the strength of carbon steel at the density of Styrofoam offering unparalleled capabilities in light-weighting, fuel reduction, and contemporary design applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Neutrophil Nanovesicles for Inhibiting Corneal Neovascularization by Synergistic Anti&#8208;Inflammatory, Anti&#8208;VEGF, and Chemoexcited Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nanovesicle&#8208;based eye drop for cornea neovascularization treatment has been developed. The nanovesicle inherits the chemotactic and anti&#8208;inflammatory capabilities of the neutrophils and acts as a drug carrier. By incorporating ranibizumab on its surface and loading photosensitizers into the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane, a synergistic and complementary treatment of cornea neovascularization is achieved by anti&#8208;inflammation, anti&#8208;VEGF, and PDT therapy.








Abstract
Corneal neovascularization (CorNV) develops under various pathological conditions and is one of the main causes of blindness. Due to that CorNV progression involves multiple steps, anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs alone could not sufficiently suppress this process, highlighting an urgent need for an efficient delivery system for the multi&#8208;step management of CorNV. In this study, a neutrophil nanovesicle&#8208;based eye drop (NCCR) is developed for CorNV therapy that simultaneously inhibits angiogenesis and inflammation, while eliminating pathological cells through chemoexcited photodynamic therapy (PDT). NCCR targets inflammatory lesions by leveraging the expression of chemokine receptors from the source cells. Then, NCCR exerts inhibitory effects on the sequential steps of neovascularization. First, it acts as a decoy and exerts an anti&#8208;inflammatory effect by neutralizing cytokines via its receptors on the surface of nanovesicles. Second, thioketals bond&#8208;linked ranibizumab is released in the high reactive oxygen species microenvironment of CorNV sites to bind VEGF, inhibiting vascular endothelial cell activation and proliferation. Finally, chemoexcited PDT eliminates preformed corneal blood vessels, disrupting tube formation and pericyte recruitment. The synergistic effects of NCCR on angiogenesis and inflammation, combined with the induction of apoptosis in neovessels via chemoexcited PDT, offer a novel and efficient strategy for CorNV treatment.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Polarized Photoresponse in Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Phototransistors for Bionic Night&#8208;Time Polarization Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;adaptive polarization&#8208;sensitive organic phototransistor (POL&#8208;OPT) based on highly anisotropic organic crystals is developed for bionic night&#8208;time polarization perception. Ultrahigh dichroic ratio (DR) of &gt;105 is achieved through time accumulation under ultraweak light of 200 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2. High&#8208;contrast polarization imaging is realized in artificial moonlit environment with a low degree of linear polarization (DoLP) of 0.26, reaching the detection threshold of night&#8208;active dung beetles.








Abstract
The emerging semiconductor micro/nanocrystals with intrinsic anisotropy have provided new perspectives for low&#8208;cost and simplified polarimetry. However, the low polarization sensitivity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polarimeters based on anisotropic semiconductors under weak and partially polarized light severely hinders their practical application in complex dim environments. Here, a photo&#8208;adaptive polarization&#8208;sensitive organic phototransistor (POL&#8208;OPT) is demonstrated for bionic weak&#8208;light polarization perception. The combination of highly anisotropic organic crystals with charge&#8208;storage accumulative effect enables a self&#8208;adaptive polarized photoresponse of the phototransistor to imitate the bionic scotopic adaptation process. Consequently, an ultrahigh dichroic ratio (DR) of over 105 is achieved through time accumulation under an ultraweak light intensity of 200 nW cm&#8722;2, which is among the highest in polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. Furthermore, POL&#8208;OPT array is constructed for effective polarization perception in an artificial moonlit environment with a low degree of linear polarization (DoLP) down to 0.26, reaching the detection threshold of night&#8208;active dung beetles. This study offers a new opportunity for the development of new&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance polarimeters for polarization imaging, bionic navigation, and artificial visual systems.

         <title>Engineered Stem Cell Booster Breaks&#160;Pathological Barriers to Treat Chronic Pancreatitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the treatment of chronic pancreatitis with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), two main pathological barriers are encountered: 1) Fibrotic collagen hinders cell delivery, and 2) Malignant microenvironment attacks cell inactivation. Here, a MSCs&#8208;based nitric oxide system is constructed to regulate collagen fibers and enhance therapeutic efficacy of MSCs, showing the synergetic effect and successfully breaking two pathological barriers.








Abstract
Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a long&#8208;standing progressive fibrosis and has long been considered incurable, which remains a heavy health burden worldwide. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with anti&#8208;fibrosis properties are currently used in the treatment of fibroinflammatory diseases. However, its therapeutic effect is limited mainly due to two main types of pathological barriers in CP: 1) Fibrotic collagen hinders cell delivery, and 2) Malignant microenvironment attacks cell inactivation. Here, a MSCs&#8208;based exogenous nitric oxide (NO) delivery system (MSCs&#8208;Lip@RNO) is constructed. In the MSCs&#8208;Lip@RNO, NO not only can be a cell booster to regulate collagen fibers, relieve the vascular compression and enhance the accumulation of MSCs in the whole pancreas, but also can form a protective gas layer on the cell surface, which enhances the therapeutic effect of MSCs. In the CP rat model, the pancreatic injury and fibrosis are reduced with 7 days after a single dose administration of this long&#8208;acting MSCs. Collectively, this study offers a promising strategy for enhancing the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of MSCs to break pathological barriers in CP treatment.

         <title>Deep Learning Analysis of Localized Interlayer Stacking Displacement and Dynamics in Bilayer Phosphorene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer displacement plays a crucial role in tuning properties of layered crystals, yet its precise and efficient determination remains challenging. A deep learning&#8208;based analysis is presented for atomic&#8208;resolution phase&#8208;contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, accurately identifying stacking displacement in bilayer phosphorene with near unit&#8208;cell resolution. The model processes large&#8208;scale in situ TEM data, capturing time&#8208;dependent displacement dynamics linked to edge reconstruction.








Abstract
The interlayer displacement has recently emerged as a crucial tuning parameter to control diverse physical properties in layered crystals. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), an exceptionally powerful tool for structural analysis, directly observes the interlayer stacking and strain fields in various crystals. However, conventional analysis methods based on high&#8208;resolution phase&#8208;contrast TEM images are inadequate for recognizing spatially varying unit&#8208;cell patterns and their associated structure factors, hindering precise determination of interlayer displacements. Here, a deep learning&#8208;based analysis is introduced for atomic resolution TEM images, enabling unit&#8208;cell pattern recognition and precise identification of interlayer stacking displacement in bilayer phosphorene. The deep learning model applied to bilayer phosphorene accurately determines stacking displacement, with an error level of 3.3% displacement within the unit cell and a spatial resolution approaching the individual unit&#8208;cell level. Additionally, the model successfully processes a large set of in situ TEM data, capturing spatially varying, time&#8208;dependent interlayer displacement dynamics associated with edge reconstruction, demonstrating its potential for processing large&#8208;scale microscopy datasets.

         <title>Hole&#8208;selective Transparent In Situ Passivation Contacts for Efficient and Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Graded Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an in situ internal encapsulation strategy by integrating cross&#8208;linkable p&#8208;type small molecules into the antisolvent to construct a highly hole&#8208;selective, transparent, and robust passivation contact. The 1.65 eV n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSC achieves a 19.8% PCE, with better thermal, UV, and operational stabilities, and a bifaciality of 101.4%, alongside a 29.2% certified PCE tandem cell.








Abstract
The optically deficient and intrinsically unstable hole transport layer (HTL) is the Achilles&#8217; heel of n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite/silicon tandems. Here, a minimalist transparent hole&#8208;selective contact is developed without additional HTL by simply integrating cross&#8208;linkable p&#8208;type small molecules into antisolvent. This strategy not only improves the perovskite crystallinity, shields the perovskite from external stressors, and suppresses interfacial mass exchange, but also provides efficient defect passivation and favorable band alignment via the formation of graded heterojunction. Consequently, the corresponding 1.65 eV perovskite solar cell achieves a stabilized efficiency of 19.6%, alongside significantly improved thermal, ultraviolet, and operation stabilities. Furthermore, leveraging its outstanding transparency, a bifacial single&#8208;junction device is showcased achieving a record bifaciality of 101.4%, and a monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem boasting a certified efficiency of 29.2% for 1.04 cm2, which represents the highest certified efficiency achieved for n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite/silicon tandems. The demonstration of efficient and stable minimalist hole&#8208;selective contacts encourages the tandem community to reevaluate the n&#8211;i&#8211;p structure, with the goal of harnessing the high open&#8208;circuit voltage of single&#8208;junction n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs.

         <title>An Electron Transfer Mediated Mechanism for Efficient Photoreforming of Waste Plastics Using a Ni3S4/ZnCdS Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3S4/ZnCdS heterojunction is prepared for the efficient production of H2 and high&#8208;selectivity value&#8208;added chemicals from waste plastic. The catalyst exhibits high H2 production rates of 27.9 and 17.4 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, along with selectivities of 94.2% and 78.3% in the liquid product toward pyruvate and acetate production from PLA and PET, respectively.








Abstract
The oxidative degradation of plastics in conjunction with the production of clean hydrogen (H2) represents a significant challenge. Herein, a Ni3S4/ZnCdS heterojunction is rationally synthesized and employed for the efficient production of H2 and high&#8208;selectivity value&#8208;added chemicals from waste plastic. By integrating spectroscopic analysis techniques with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a solely electron transfer&#8208;mediated reaction mechanism is confirmed, wherein Ni3S4 extracts electrons from ZnCdS (ZCS) to promote the spatial segregation of photogenerated electrons and holes, which not only facilitates H2 production but also maintains the high oxidation potential of holes on the ZCS&#160;surface, favoring hole&#8208;dominated plastic oxidation. Notably, the catalyst exhibited efficient H2 production rates as high as 27.9 and 17.4 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, along with a selectivity of 94.2% and 78.3% in the liquid product toward pyruvate and acetate production from polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), respectively. Additionally, carbon yields of 26.5% for pyruvate and 2.2% for acetate are measured after 9 h of photoreforming, representing the highest values reported to date. Overall, this research presents a promising approach for converting plastic waste into H2 fuel and high&#8208;selectivity valuable chemical products, offering a potential solution to the growing issue of &#8220;White Pollution&#8221;.

         <title>Win&#8211;Win Integration of Genetically Engineered Cellular Nanovesicles with High&#8208;Absorbing Multimodal Phototheranostic Molecules for Boosted Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synergistic approach utilizing genetically engineered cancer cellular nanovesicles displaying PD&#8208;1 ligands as both tumor&#8208;targeted nanocarriers and immunotherapeutic agents, combined with high&#8208;absorbing multimodal AIEgens as phototheranostic module is developed to implement NIR&#8208;II FLI&#8208;PAI&#8208;PTI trimodal imaging while simultaneously improve the efficacy of photo&#8208;immunotherapy for both primary and distant metastatic tumors.









Abstract
Photo&#8208;immunotherapy is one of the most promising cancer treatment strategies. As immunotherapeutic agents, immune checkpoint blockade antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#8208;1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) exhibit substantial potential, but have to face non&#8208;specific distribution and the subsequent immune&#8208;related adverse events. Meanwhile, high&#8208;performance phototheranostic agents concurrently possessing multiple phototheranostic modalities and high light&#8208;harvesting capacity are really attractive and highly desired as touching phototheranostic modules. Herein, a win&#8211;win strategy that integrates phototheranostic molecule design and targeted immunotherapeutic module preparation is developed to construct high&#8208;powered photo&#8208;immunotherapy systems. Specifically, the phototheranostic agent (AOTTIT) displaying typical aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence extending to the second near&#8208;infrared II window, as well as outstanding reactive oxygen species and heat production capacity is first obtained via ingenious design. Notably, AOTTIT exhibits a record high molar extinction coefficient among the reported organic multimodal phototheranostic molecules. Meanwhile, PD&#8208;1 genetically engineered cancer cell membrane&#8208;derived nanovesicles (PD&#8208;1/CMNVs) are prepared as both nanocarriers and immunotherapeutic agents to camouflage AOTTIT nanoparticles, yielding a multifunctional photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic agent (CMNPs/PD&#8208;1) with tumor&#8208;specific active and homologous targeting ability. The distinct suppression of primary and metastatic lung tumors after only once treatment to the primary tumor substantiated the synergistically strengthened photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficiency of this win&#8208;win strategy.

A series of novel arylamine&#8208;linked and bipolar porous organic polymers (POPs) are designed and prepared as organic cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Benefiting from their high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active sites, bipolar feature, and arylamine linkage, these POPs exhibited high&#8208;capacity, high&#8208;rate, and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability as organic cathode materials for LIBs.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;active porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged as promising and sustainable organic cathode materials (OCMs) for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their performance is significantly limited by insufficient redox&#8208;active sites and low intrinsic conductivity. Herein, a series of novel arylamine&#8208;linked and bipolar POPs (denoted as HATN&#8208;AQ, HATN&#8208;BQ, HATN&#8208;CBD, and HATN&#8208;PTO) are designed and prepared as OCMs for LIBs. Benefiting from their high density of redox&#8208;active sites, bipolar feature, and arylamine linkage, these POPs exhibited high capacity, high rate, and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability. Among them, HATN&#8208;PTO displayed an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 329.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 with a high energy density of 716.7 Wh kg&#8722;1, outstanding rate performance (208.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), and superior cycling stability (188.9 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity retained after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). Furthermore, the HATN&#8208;PTO//graphite full battery exhibited a high specific capacity of 227.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 and maintained a high capacity of 99.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. Ex situ FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra combined with theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the dual&#8208;ion storage mechanism. This work provides an effective strategy for designing POPs with high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;rate for OCMs.

Among them, HATN-PTO displayed an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 329.6 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a high energy density of 716.7 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, outstanding rate performance (208.7 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and superior cycling stability (188.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; capacity retained after 500 cycles at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Furthermore, the HATN-PTO//graphite full battery exhibited a high specific capacity of 227.3 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and maintained a high capacity of 99.1 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Ex situ FT-IR and XPS spectra combined with theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the dual-ion storage mechanism. This work provides an effective strategy for designing POPs with high-capacity and high-rate for OCMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Liquid Reinforcing Ether Coordination of Localized High Concentration Electrolyte Enables High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust strategy is proposed by adding ionic liquid of Pyr13TFSI as co&#8208;solvent into the bulk electrolyte. The Pyr13TFSI can balance the interaction among the electrolyte components to reduce the dynamic de&#8208;coordinated DME molecules and promote the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with excellent electrochemical stability and high Li+ transport dynamics.








Abstract
The decomposition of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) under high voltage produces fragile and unstable organic fragments at the cathode/electrolyte interphase, which greatly damages the cycling performance of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. Herein, a robust strategy is proposed by adding ionic liquid of 1&#8208;Methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Pyr13TFSI) as co&#8208;solvent into the bulk electrolyte to significantly improve the stability of solvated DME through reinforcing the ion&#8208;dipole interaction between TFSI&#8722; and DME. The Pyr13TFSI can balance the interaction among the electrolyte components to reduce the dynamic de&#8208;coordinated DME molecules and promote the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with excellent electrochemical stability and high Li+ transport dynamics. The Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 coin cells with Pyr13TFSI exhibit capacity retention of 76.1% after 1800 cycles at 1&#160;C rate (4.5 V), and 77.1% after 800 cycles at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. Furthermore, the cells using Li anode with the thickness of 50 &#181;m and high LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 loading of 18.68 mg cm&#8722;2 can operate for 175 cycles with high&#8208;capacity retention of 73.35%. This work demonstrates that modulating the interactions among electrolyte components using ionic liquid can optimize the coordination chemistry for advanced high&#8208;energy density Li metal batteries.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of 2D Polymeric Fullerene for Broadband Photodetection</title>

         <dc:description>
2D polymeric C60 is an emerging all&#8208;carbon semiconductor possessing unique hierarchical electronic structures. A hydrogen&#8208;assisted electrochemical strategy has been developed to produce gram&#8208;scale large size (&#8776;52.5 &#181;m2) and monolayer thick 2D polymeric C60 with high exfoliation yield (&#8776;83%). The thin&#8208;film photodetectors demonstrate broad spectral response from visible light to near&#8208;infrared region.








Abstract
2D polymeric fullerene scaffolds, composed of covalently bonded superatomic C60 nanoclusters, are emerging semiconductors possessing unique hierarchical electronic structures. Hitherto their synthesis has relied on complex and time&#8208;consuming reactions, thereby hindering scalable production and limiting the technological relevance. Here, the study demonstrates a facile electrochemical exfoliation strategy based on the intercalation and expansion of a layered fullerene superlattice, to produce large size (&#8776;52.5 &#181;m2) and monolayer thick 2D polymeric C60 with high exfoliation yield (&#8776;83%). In situ reduction of solvated protons (H+) weakens the interlayer interactions thereby promoting the rapid and uniform intercalation of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium (TBA+), ensuring gram&#8208;scale throughput and high structural integrity of exfoliated 2D polymeric C60. As a proof of concept, the solution&#8208;processed 2D polymeric C60 nanosheets have been integrated into thin&#8208;film photodetectors, exhibiting a broad spectral photoresponse ranging from 405 to 1200 nm, with a peak photocurrent at 850 nm and a stable response time. This efficient and scalable exfoliation method holds great promise for the advancement of multifunctional composites and optoelectronic devices based on 2D polymeric C60.

         <title>Mechanosensitive and pH&#8208;Gated Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Artificial Ion Channel for High&#8208;Selective K+ Transport and Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To advance the exploration of mechanisms underlying natural ion channels, this research presents a novel butterfly&#8208;shaped bionic K+ transmembrane channel GnC7 (n = 3, 4) with record&#8208;breaking K+/Na+ selectivity. The unique mobile channels constructed from poly (propylene imine) dendritic polymers and benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7&#8208;ethers exhibit dual mechanical and pH responsiveness in liposomes/cells. Drastic G4C7&#8208;induced intracellular K+ efflux effectively activates mitochondrial&#8208; and ER&#8208;associated apoptosis.








Abstract
To advance the exploration of mechanisms underlying natural multi&#8208;gated ion channels, a novel butterfly&#8208;shaped biomimetic K+ channel GnC7 (n = 3, 4) is developed with dual mechanical and pH responsiveness, exhibiting unprecedented K+/Na+ selectivity (G3C7: 34.4; G4C7: 41.3). These channels constructed from poly(propylene imine) dendrimer and benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7&#8208;ethers achieve high K+ transport activity (EC50: 0.72 &#181;m for G3C7; 0.9 &#181;m for G4C7) due to their arc&#8208;like mechanical rotation. The dynamic mode relies on butterfly&#8208;shaped topology derived from the highly symmetrical core and multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds. GnC7 can sense mechanical stimulus applied to liposomes/cells and then adapt the K+ transport rate accordingly. Furthermore, reversible ON/OFF switching of K+ transport is realized through the pH&#8208;controllable host&#8208;guest complexation. G4C7&#8208;induced ultrafast cellular K+ efflux (70% within only 9 min) efficiently triggers mitochondrial&#8208;dependent apoptosis of cancer cells by provoking endoplasmic reticulum stress accompanied by drastic Ca2+ sparks. This work embodies a multi&#8208;dimensional regulation of channel functions; it will provide insights into the dynamic behaviors of biological analogs and promote the innovative design of artificial ion channels and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Abnormal Slow Phonon Dynamics Toward Prolonging Excited States Dynamics Enabled by Crystalline&#8208;Assembling Donor&#8211;Acceptor Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>

Crystalline&#8208;packing donor&#8211;acceptor molecular structures into dipolar crystals enables slow phonon dynamics from lattice vibrations when optical phonons develop mutual&#8208;opposite phase relations. Through electron&#8211;phonon coupling, slow phonon dynamics interact with light&#8208;emitting singlet charge&#8208;transfer states containing contribution from triplets through triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet intersystem crossing, consequently leading to extended excited states dynamics with prolonged PL lifetime shown as super&#8208;delayed fluorescence in dipolar organic crystals.








Abstract
Phonon dynamics are a critical factor to control the optical properties of excited states in light&#8208;emitting materials. Here, we report an extremely slow relaxation of photoexcited lattice vibrations enabled by assembling the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) molecules [2&#8208;(9,9&#8208;dimethylacridin&#8208;10(9H)&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;thioxanthene 10,10&#8208;dioxide], namely AC molecules, into dipolar crystal. By using photoexcitation&#8208;modulated Raman spectroscopy, we find that the crystalline&#8208;lattice vibrations monitored by Raman&#8208;scattering laser beam of 785&#160;nm demonstrate an un&#8208;usual slow relaxation in the time scale of seconds after ceasing photoexcitation beam of 343&#160;nm in such dipolar crystal. This presents extremely slow phonon dynamics enabled by crystalline&#8208;assembling the D&#8211;A molecules into a dipolar crystal. Simultaneously, the photoluminescence (PL) exhibits a prolonged behavior, lasting 10&#160;ms after ceasing photoexcitation in dipolar AC crystal. This phenomenon provides an experimental hypothesis that the slow phonon dynamics function as an important mechanism to unusually prolong excited states dynamics upon crystalline&#8208;assembling the D&#8211;A molecules into dipolar crystal. This hypothesis can be verified by directly suppressing the phonon dynamics through freezing D&#8211;A molecular liquid into dipolar crystalline solid at 77 K to largely prolong the PL to 1 s&#8208; after removing photoexcitation. Clearly, crystalline&#8208;assembling D&#8211;A molecules provide the necessary conditions to enable slow phonon dynamics toward prolonging excited states dynamics.

         <title>Rational Design of Methylated Triazine&#8208;Based Linear Conjugated Polymers for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction with Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of porous methylated triazine&#8208;based linear conjugated polymers is developed for successful photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. The key lies in the generation of methylated triazine linkages through a facile condensation reaction between benzamidine and acetic anhydride, which impedes the formation of conventional triazine&#8208;based frameworks.








Abstract
The development of semiconducting conjugated polymers for photoredox catalysis holds great promise for sustainable utilization of solar energy. Herein a new family of porous methylated triazine&#8208;based linear conjugated polymers is reported that enable efficient photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. It is demonstrated that the key lies in the generation of methylated triazine linkages through a facile condensation reaction between benzamidine and acetic anhydride, which impedes the formation of conventional triazine&#8208;based frameworks. It is also shown that regulating conjugated linear backbones with different lengths of electron&#8208;donated benzyl units provides a facile means to modulate their optical properties and the exciton dissociation, thereby affording more long&#8208;lived photogenerated charge carriers and boosting charge separation and transfer. A high&#8208;performance carbon monoxide (CO) production rate of 218.9 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is achieved with &#8776; 100% CO selectivity, which is accompanied by exceptional H2O oxidation to oxygen (O2). It anticipates this new study will advance synthetic approaches toward polymeric semiconductors and facilitate new possibilities for triazine&#8208;based conjugated polymers with promising potential in artificial photocatalysis.

         <title>Pillared Laminar Vermiculite Membranes with Tunable Monovalent and Multivalent Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alumina pillared vermiculite membrane is fabricated with a laminar structure. Enhanced water stability is observed due to the strengthened interlamellar binding. Through cation doping, the surface charge and pore size of the pillared laminar membrane are tuned, demonstrating highly selective and tunable ion sieving performance promising for water treatment and resource recovery applications.








Abstract
Effective membrane separation of Li+ from Na+ and Mg2+ is crucial for lithium extraction from water yet challenging for conventional polymeric membranes. Two dimensional (2D)&#160;membranes with ordered laminar structures and tunable physicochemical properties offer distinctive ion&#8208;sieving capabilities promising for lithium extraction. Recently, phyllosilicates are introduced as abundant and cost&#8208;effective source materials for such membranes. However, their water instability and low inherent ion transport selectivity hinder practical applications. Herein, a new class of laminar membranes with excellent stability and tunable ion sieving is reported by incorporating inorganic alumina pillars into vermiculite interlayers. Crosslinking vermiculite flakes with alumina pillars significantly strengthens interlamellar interactions, resulting in robust water stability. Doping of Na+ before the pillaring process reverses the membrane's surface charge, substantially boosting Li+ separation from multivalent cations via electrostatic interactions. Lithium extraction is often complicated by the presence of co&#8208;existing monovalent cations (e.g., Na+) at higher concentrations. Here, by introducing excess Na+ into the membrane after the pillaring process, the separation of Li+ from monovalent cations is enhanced through steric effects. This work realizes both monovalent/multivalent and monovalent/monovalent selective ion sieving with the same membrane platform. A separation mechanism is proposed based on Donnan exclusion and size exclusion, providing new insights for membrane design for resource recovery applications.

         <title>Red Phosphorescence at Elevated Temperatures Enabled by Dexter Energy Transfer in Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon&#8208;Xanthone Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure Organic red persistent phosphorescent materials, possessing high&#8208;temperature resistance and superior tissue penetration, can be efficiently fabricated using a host&#8211;guest doping strategy. The triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet Dexter energy transfer process plays a crucial role in modulating the luminescent properties of both the host and the guest. These materials hold promise for applications in advanced information encryption and bioimaging.








Abstract
Organic materials with red persistent phosphorescence hold immense promise for biotechnology due to their excellent tissue permeability and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios. However, inefficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling, high triplet susceptibility, and narrow energy gapspromoted&#160;nonradiative deactivations, pose a formidable obstacle to achieving efficient red phosphorescence. This study addresses these challenges by introducing xanthone (Xan)&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems. Utilizing polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as guests, efficient red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescent materials with ultralong lifetimes and high quantum yields of up to 821 ms and 2.32%, respectively, are successfully developed. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that Dexter energy transfer (DET) is the dominant mechanism responsible for red phosphorescence. This DET process between Xan and PAHs not only effectively utilizes the dark triplet state of the Xan host but also significantly enhances the triplet generation of the PAH guests, transforming them into potent phosphorescent luminophores. Furthermore, the inherent rigidity of Xan and PAHs endows the resulting materials with excellent phosphorescence performance, even at elevated temperatures (e.g., 423 K). This strategy, proven to be general, paves the way for designing efficient red/NIR phosphorescent materials through the DET mechanism, enabling their applications in molecular imaging and advanced high&#8208;temperature encryption.

         <title>Photopolymer Resins from Sulfenyl Chloride Commodity Chemicals for Plastic Optics, Photopatterning and 3D&#8208;Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
From oil refining to high refractive index photopolymers for bulk plastic optics. The synthesis of a new photopolymer resin derived from inexpensive sulfur petrochemicals is reported affording a high&#8208;quality optical glass that is amenable to a wide range of photopolymerization&#8208;based fabricated methods, including 3D Printing, for precision plastic optics and micropatterned arrays.








Abstract
The development of a low&#8208;cost photopolymer resin to fabricate optical glass of high refractive index for plastic optics is reported.

         <title>Leveraging Strong Electric Field Gradients at Anapole Resonances for Enhanced Second Harmonic Generation from Molybdenum Disulfide Disks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) disks supporting combined anapole scattering and Fabry&#8208;Perot resonances with not just strong electric field enhancement but also enhanced field gradients for application in resonant enhancement of second harmonic generation (SHG) are designed, fabricated, and experimentally studied. Some of the highest enhancement numbers reported for the case of the widely used 2H&#8208;polytype of MoS2 are reported.








Abstract
Van der Waals layered materials are emerging as promising nanophotonic platforms for realizing linear and nonlinear optical devices. In particular, the high refractive indices of transition metal dichalcogenides, combined with their strong layer dependent optical properties offer interesting possibilities for designing photonic functionalities. In this study, the resonant enhancement of second harmonic generation (SHG) using molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) disks on a silicon substrate with an intermediate silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer is demonstrated. The resonant enhancement observed here is attributed to the combined interaction of the anapole scattering modes supported within the disk and Fabry&#8208;Perot (FP) modes within the multilayer stack. For a fixed MoS2 disk dimensions, an optimized SiO2 layer thickness results in constructive interference between the anapole and FP modes, thereby enhancing the fundamental field within the disk. Utilizing this resonance mechanism, SHG enhancements as high as 160 and 85&#8208;times are experimentally demonstrated when compared with unpatterned multilayer and monolayer MoS2 flakes respectively. These are the highest reported enhancement values for the widely used 2H&#8208;polytype MoS2. A significant enhancement in SHG is observed here for 2H&#8208;MoS2 despite the alternating sheet dipoles canceling the far&#8208;field emission owing to the strong electric field gradient setup within the disk at the anapole resonance.

Smart windows with anti&#8208;UV, fast&#8208;response, and thermally stable characteristics for all&#8208;day modulation are crafted, demonstrating appealing stability and durability for practical building energy&#8208;saving applications.








Abstract
Thermochromic smart windows offer energy&#8208;saving potential through temperature&#8208;responsive optical transmittance adjustments, yet face challenges in achieving anti&#8208;UV radiation, fast response, and high&#8208;temperature stability characteristics for long&#8208;term use. Herein, the rational design of Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced, nanoparticle&#8208;shielded composite hydrogels, composed of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAA), sodium sulfate, and polydopamine nanoparticles, for anti&#8208;UV, fast&#8208;response, and all&#8208;day&#8208;modulated smart windows is reported. Specifically, a three&#8208;dimensional network of PDMAA is created as the supporting skeleton, markedly enhancing the thermal stability of pristine HPMC hydrogels. Sodium sulfate induces a Hofmeister effect, lowering the lower critical solution temperature to 32 &#176;C while accelerating phase transition rates fivefold (30 s vs. 150 s). Intriguingly, small&#8208;sized polydopamine nanoparticles simultaneously enable high luminous transmittance of 66.9% and outstanding anti&#8208;UV capability. Additionally, the smart window showcases a high solar modulation (51.2%) and maintains a 10.2 &#176;C temperature reduction versus a glass window during all&#8208;day modulation applications. The design strategy is effective, opening up new avenues for manufacturing fast&#8208;response and durable thermochromic smart windows for energy savings and emission reduction.

         <title>Point Defects Enhance Cross&#8208;Plane Thermal Conductivity In Graphite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Point defects typically reduce thermal conductivity (&#954;) by scattering heat&#8208;carrying phonons. However, introducing spiro interstitials through particle irradiation in graphite surprisingly increases cross&#8208;plane &#954; from 10.8 to 18.9 W&#160;m&#160;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The scanning transmission electron microscope and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that these defects bridge graphene planes, increasing group velocity while reducing phonon&#8208;phonon scattering, thereby enhancing cross&#8208;plane &#954; of graphite.








Abstract
Point defects typically reduce the thermal conductivity (&#954;) of a crystal due to increased scattering of heat&#8208;carrying phonons, a mechanism that is well understood and widely used to enhance or impede heat transfer in the material for different applications. Here an opposite effect is reported where the introduction of point defects in graphite with energetic particle irradiation increases its cross&#8208;plane &#954; by nearly a factor of two, from 10.8 to 18.9 W&#160;m&#160;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. Integrated differential phase contrast imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the creation of spiro interstitials in graphite by the irradiation. The enhancement in &#954; is attributed to a remarkable mechanism that works to the benefit of phonon propagation in both the harmonic and anharmonic terms: these spiro interstitial defects covalently bridge neighboring basal planes, simultaneously enhancing acoustic phonon group velocity and reducing phonon&#8211;phonon scattering in the graphite structure. The enhancement of &#954; reveals an unconventional role of lattice defects in heat conduction, i.e., easing the propagation of heat&#8208;carrying phonons rather than impeding them in layered materials, inspiring their applications for thermal management in heavily radiative environments.

Two MCOFs with dual&#8208;active centers are designed as LMB separators to enable efficient Li plating/stripping. Synergistic effects between trinuclear copper clusters and electron&#8208;donating diarylamine nitrogen create an electron&#8208;rich environment, regulating the local conjugated Li+ microenvironment. The designed Li symmetric cell exhibits excellent Li plating/stripping stability for over 1600 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal has gained attention as an anode material for lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) owing to its low electrochemical potential, high specific capacity, and low density. However, the accumulation of Li dendrites and unstable solid electrolyte interphases, caused by sluggish Li+ migration and uneven Li deposition, limit practical LMB applications. This study presents the first report on redox&#8208;active metal&#8211;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with dual&#8208;active centers as functional separators for LMBs. These MCOFs facilitate homogeneous Li nucleation and accelerate Li+ ion transport. The synergistic effects of redox&#8208;active diarylamine units and trinuclear copper clusters modulate local electron&#8208;cloud density, regulating microenvironment of Li+ ions and ensuring homogeneous Li nucleation. The MCOF&#8208;based separator's well&#8208;defined 1D channels in MCOF&#8208;based separator enable uniform Li+ flux, and promote homogeneous Li deposition, resulting in high Li+ transference number of 0.93 and an ionic conductivity of 2.01 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. The Li|Cu cell demonstrates a low Li nucleation barrier of 16 mV, while the Li symmetric cell exhibits stable Li plating/stripping for over 1600 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. When coupled with LiFePO4 cathodes, the assembled LMB exhibits stable capacity retention of &#8776;98%. This work paves the way for dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes in high&#8208;performance LMBs.

&lt;p&gt;Two MCOFs with dual-active centers are designed as LMB separators to enable efficient Li plating/stripping. Synergistic effects between trinuclear copper clusters and electron-donating diarylamine nitrogen create an electron-rich environment, regulating the local conjugated Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microenvironment. The designed Li symmetric cell exhibits excellent Li plating/stripping stability for over 1600 h at 0.5 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

         <title>Inverse Oxide/Alloy&#8208;Structured Nanozymes with NIR&#8208;Triggered Enzymatic Cascade Regulation of ROS Homeostasis for Efficient Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse oxide/alloy&#8208;structured nanozyme, Co7Fe3/ZnO@C, is developed to achieve near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;triggered enzymatic cascade regulation. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, hot electrons are transferred from Co7Fe3 to ZnO, activating synchronized superoxide dismutase&#8208;like, catalase&#8208;like, peroxidase&#8208;like, and hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity&#8208;like enzymatic activities. These cascaded activities enable spatiotemporal modulation of reactive oxygen species dynamics, synergistically integrating chemodynamic therapy, photodynamic therapy, and photothermal therapy to accelerate infected wound healing.








Abstract
The precise spatiotemporal control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and scavenging remains pivotal for infected wound healing. However, conventional nanozymes fail to adaptively regulate ROS dynamics across inflammatory and proliferative phases. A near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;activated inverse oxide/alloy&#8208;structured nanozyme (Co7Fe3/ZnO@C) is developed, featuring enzymatic cascade activities to tune ROS homeostasis through synergistic chemodynamic (CDT), photodynamic (PDT), and photothermal (PTT) therapies. The nanozyme orchestrates a self&#8208;regulated cascade: peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity initially generates bactericidal hydroxyl radicals in acidic wounds, while subsequent NIR triggers hot electron transfer from Co7Fe3 to ZnO, facilitating synchronized superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like, catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC) activities to scavenge residual ROS. This cascaded network dynamically balances ROS production (POD) and scavenging (NIR&#8208;driven SOD/CAT/HORAC), eradicating bacteria while resolving inflammation. In vitro/vivo studies have shown that the proposed method for maintaining ROS homeostasis can markedly enhance the rate of wound healing by the regulation of the inflammatory environment within the injured tissue and the facilitation of rapid re&#8208;epithelialization. This work provides an intelligent nanozyme platform that simulates the function of natural enzymes and constructs a cascade reaction strategy to balance the antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory demands in the wound microenvironment.

         <title>Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeted Type I Photodynamic Therapy for Agonist Independent cGAS&#8208;STING Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis of mitochondrion&#8208;targeted nanodrugs containing a BODIPY&#8208;derived type I photosensitizer and a dual nanozyme for light&#8208;controlled mitochondrial stress&#8208;inducing and agonist&#8208;independent cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation. Their tumor therapeutic ability, dual nanozyme activities, mitochondrion&#8208;targeted cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation, and intratumoral and systemic immunositimulation capacity underscore their potential as a paradigm for efficient photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
CGAS&#8208;STING agonists generally lead to hyperimmunity and systemic toxicity, hindering their immunotherapeutic outcomes. Herein, a mitochondrion&#8208;targeted nanoagonist (termed HABH) containing boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;derived type I photosensitizer (BDP) and Au&#160;nanoparticle&#8208;engineered hollow mesoporous silica (HMSN/AuNPs) has been fabricated for light&#8208;controlled mitochondrial stress&#8208;inducing and agonist&#8208;independent cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation. The HABH nanoagonist can actively target tumor tissues and release the mitochondrion&#8208;targeted BDP. Under light illumination, BDP achieves type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) in mitochondria, generating massive hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and inducing mitochondrial stress in an oxygen&#8208;independent manner, promoting the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Simultaneously, the HMSN/AuNPs act as dual nanozymes to derive cascade reactions for &#8226;OH production, elevating the intracellular oxidative state, and together with the BDP&#8208;induced mitochondrial stress, finally evoking the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and facilitating the release of type I interferon. In the orthotopic breast tumor models, the HABH nanoagonist achieved intratumoral and systemic immunoactivation for eradicating primary tumors and preventing metastasis tumors. Therefore, the constructed mitochondrion&#8208;targeted nanoagonist enabled light&#8208;controlled and agonist&#8208;independent cGAS&#8208;STING activation, providing a paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Induced Static and Dynamic Interface Double Shields for Long&#8208;Lifespan All&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic&#8208;liquid based wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte inducing static and dynamic interface double shields of Zn anodes is developed for achieving highly stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries with an operating temperature range of &#8776;&#8722;40&#8211;60 &#176;C.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have experienced substantial advancements recently, while the aqueous electrolytes exhibit limited thermal adaptability. The low&#8208;cost Zn(BF4)2 salt possesses potential low&#8208;temperature application, while brings unsatisfied stability of Zn anodes. To address this challenge, an ionic liquid based eutectic electrolyte (ILEE) utilizing the Zn(BF4)2 presenting remarkable stability across a temperature range of &#8776;&#8722;100&#8211;150 &#176;C is developed, enabling ZIBs to operate in diverse thermal conditions. The inner Zn2+ solvation structure can be modulated to a BF4&#8722;&#8208;rich state within the ILEE system, forming a static ZnF&#8322; layer at the electrolyte&#8208;Zn anode interface, as evidenced by ab initial molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, the positively charged EMIM+ can accumulate on the Zn anodes to form the secondary electrostatic dynamic shield that mitigates the uncontrollable Zn dendrites growth, enhancing the overall cycling life of Zn anodes to over 10 times compared with the pure Zn(BF4)2 system. When utilizing the ILEE as the electrolyte, PANI||Zn full cells demonstrate acceptable performances under the all&#8208;temperature environments, especially presenting a long life of over 9500 cycles at a low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C and 500 cycles at a high temperature of 60 &#176;C. This special ILEE holds significant promise for future aqueous batteries in extreme environment.

A water&#8208;soluble Pt(II) pincer complex probe is proposed to achieve the direct recognition of anionic [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; using a new strategy where the overlapping of thick hydration shells drives an assembly. This hydration&#8208;shell&#8208;promoted assembly endows the probe with excellent specificity, a rapid response, and high sensitivity (14.89&#160;fg). This study paves the way for exploring new approaches for the direct detection of highly hydrated ions.








Abstract
It is still challenging to directly recognize the anionic species [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722;, the dominant species in the environment (82%&#8208;93%), using current optical probes because of the adverse effects of its thick hydration shell on binding interactions. In this study, a water&#8208;soluble Pt(II) methylated terpyridine complex ([Pt(CH3&#8208;tpy)NCO]+) supramolecular probe is designed to directly target [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; by a new strategy of thick hydration shell overlapping arrangement. The optical response demonstrates excellent selectivity among &#8776;30 investigated interfering substances, along with rapid response (&#8776;15&#160;s), high sensitivity (64.1&#160;nm) and dual&#8208;signals. It is confirmed both experimentally and theoretically that the superior detection performance is attributed to the formation of a unique supramolecular structure featuring biplane&#8208;like building block, bicolumnar stacking and water&#8208;bridged anionic networks, via the overlap of thick hydration shells of aligned [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; to boost a superentropic driving force, and the distinguishable dual&#8208;signals arises from the emergence of four types of Pt&#8208;Pt interactions, generating low&#8208;energy metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer adsorption/emission. In addition, a [Pt(CH3&#8208;tpy)NCO]+&#8208;based hydrogel platform is constructed for detecting both anionic and cationic uranium, with a detection limit of 14.89&#160;fg. This work unlocks not only a way to directly detect [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722;, but also a new idea for sensing ions with extreme thick hydration layers.

         <title>Incorporating Ordered Indium Sites into Rhodium for Ultra&#8208;Low Potential Electrocatalytic Conversion of Ethylene Glycol to Glycolic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating ordered oxyphilic In sites into Rh to form RhIn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) facilitates the ultra&#8208;low&#8208;potential electrooxidation of ethylene glycol into the high&#8208;value chemical, glycolic acid. The synthesized RhIn IMCs&#160;also exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Using RhIn&#160;IMCs as bifunctional catalysts, a two&#8208;electrode system is established for ethylene glycol electrooxidation coupled with hydrogen production.








Abstract
The upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) to glycolic acid (GA, a biodegradable polymer monomer) via electrocatalysis not only produces valuable chemicals but also mitigates plastic pollution. However, the current reports for electrooxidation of EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA usually operate at reaction potentials of &gt;1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), much higher than the theoretical potential (0.065 V vs RHE), resulting in substantial energy wastage. Herein, body&#8208;centered cubic RhIn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) anchored on carbon support (denoted as RhIn/C) are synthesized, which shows excellent performance for the EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA with an onset potential of only 0.35 V vs RHE, lower than the values reported in current literature. The catalyst also possesses satisfactory GA selectivity (85% at 0.65 V vs RHE). Experimental results combined with density functional theory calculations demonstrate that RhIn IMCs enhance the adsorption of EG and OH&#8722;, facilitating the generation of reactive oxygen species and thereby improving catalytic performance. RhIn/C also exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction, ensuring that it can be used as a bifunctional catalyst in the two&#8208;electrode system for EG electrooxidation coupled with hydrogen production. This work opens new avenues for reducing the energy consumption of electrocatalytic upcycling of PET&#8208;derived EG and clean energy production.

         <title>3D Molecular&#8208;Reconstructed Disordered Precursor Toward Highly Stable Porous Ramie Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D disordered ramie precursors (DRPs) with high mechanical strength and high density are achieved via the molecular reconstruction method. As a demonstration, this highly stable porous ramie carbon&#8208;based supercapacitor delivers a prominent energy density of 28.11 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a high&#8208;power density of 47.94 kW kg&#8722;1 simultaneously, evidently higher than commercial YP&#8208;50F (12.67 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 40.86 kW kg&#8722;1).








Abstract
Biomass porous carbon possesses broad application prospects in the field of energy storage. However, soft biomass materials with high cellulose content and orders structure usually represent low mechanical strength, which leads to unstable pore structure of prepared porous carbon and even prone to collapse, thus reducing the quality and stability of carbon. Herein, a simple molecular reconstruction method is proposed to effectively re&#8208;construct 3D disordered ramie precursors (DRPs) by regulating the chemical interaction of hydrogen bonds. Benefiting from high mechanical strength and high density of DRPs, the highly stable porous ramie carbon (PRC) can display a higher specific surface area of 2404.36 m2 g&#8722;1 than that of ordinary ramie carbon (2142.25 m2 g&#8722;1). Moreover, this PRC&#8208;based supercapacitor delivers a high specific capacitance of 39.35 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and an excellent capacity retention rate of 89.5% at 40 A g&#8722;1 in 1 M Et4NBF4/AN. Attractively, the evolution process of ion adsorption during the charge&#8211;discharge process has been uncovered by using in situ electrochemical infrared spectroscopy, confirming the excellent structural stability of PRC. This work provides new insights into preparing biomass precursors with high strength derived from soft biomass materials, greatly promoting the application of soft biomass materials in commercial activated carbon.

         <title>Hierarchical&#8208;Structured RGO@EGaIn Composites as Advanced Self&#8208;Healing Anode for Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
GO naturally adsorbs onto the surface of LMPs via electrostatic interactions, self&#8208;assembles into a core&#8211;shell structure, and subsequently reduces to RGO in an acidic solution. The presence of RGO in the hierarchical structural composites significantly improves the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, suppressing and accommodating the irregular deformation of LMPs during the electrochemical reaction process and promoting the formation of a stable SEI film.









Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metal (LM) has emerged as a promising candidate anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), exhibiting high theoretical capacity, excellent electrode kinetics, and unique self&#8208;healing ability. However, the liquid&#8208;solid&#8208;liquid transition during the electrochemical reactions can disrupt the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and damage the structural integrity, ultimately limiting the cycling stability. Here, hierarchical&#8208;structured reduced graphene oxide coated eutectic gallium&#8208;indium liquid metal particles (RGO@EGaIn LMPs) are synthesized using a facile self&#8208;assembly strategy. The customized RGO@EGaIn electrode demonstrated impressive performance in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell configurations for LIBs. The morphological and phase transitions of RGO@EGaIn LMPs during the lithiation/delithiation processes are uncovered by real&#8208;time in situ transmission electron microscopy tests. It is clarified that the presence of RGO in the hierarchical structure buffers the volume expansion of LMPs from &#8776;160% to 125% and provides a fast pathway for the rapid transfer of ions and electrons during the electrochemical reaction, which effectively enhances the electrochemical performance of the electrode. This work introduces a straightforward and effective method for preparing high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature liquid metal electrodes, representing a significant step forward toward the commercial application of liquid metal batteries.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Decoupling Drives Gold&#8208;Assisted Exfoliation of Large&#8208;Area Monolayer 2D Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au substrate induces a strain in the adhered bottommost MoS2 layer. The strain weakens the coupling at the first MoS2&#8208;MoS2 interface, making it the weakest point in the system, therefore MoS2 crystal preferentially cleaves at this interface, facilitating the selective exfoliation of large&#8208;area monolayers with size comparable to that of the parent crystal.








Abstract
Gold&#8208;assisted exfoliation (GAE) is a groundbreaking mechanical exfoliation technique that produces centimeter&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal monolayers of 2D materials. Such large, high&#8208;quality films offer unparalleled advantages over the micron&#8208;sized flakes typically produced by conventional exfoliation techniques, significantly accelerating the research and technological advancements in the field of 2D materials. Despite its wide applications, the fundamental mechanism of GAE remains poorly understood. In this study, using MoS&#8322; on Au as a model system, ultra&#8208;low frequency Raman spectroscopy is employed to elucidate how the interlayer interactions within MoS2 crystals are impacted by the gold substrate. The results reveal that the coupling at the first MoS2&#8208;MoS2 interface between the adhered layer on the gold substrate and the adjacent layer is substantially weakened, with the binding force being reduced to nearly zero. This renders the first interface the weakest point in the system, thereby the crystal preferentially cleaves at this junction, generating large&#8208;area monolayers with sizes comparable to the parent crystal. Biaxial strain in the adhered layer, induced by the gold substrate, is identified as the driving factor for the decoupling effect. The strain&#8208;induced decoupling effect is established as the primary mechanism of GAE, which can also play a significant role in general mechanical exfoliations.

         <title>&#8220;Water&#8208;In&#8208;Oil&#8221; Electrolyte Enabled by Microphase Separation Regulation for Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microphase separated &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8221; (W/O) electrolyte is proposed to simultaneously regulate the water molecules in both electrolyte bulk and electrode interface. Benefiting from the directed movement and reversible demulsification of micelles under the electric field, the as&#8208;developed zinc metal batteries using W/O electrolyte exhibits extended cyclability, improve interface dynamics and negligible H2 evolution.








Abstract
The sustained hydrogen evolution and zinc (Zn) dendrite growth greatly impede the practical application of low&#8208;cost aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, for the first time, a microphase separation strategy is proposed to construct a &#8243;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (W/O) electrolyte to endow durable ZMBs. As validated by theoretical modeling and experimental characterizations, the unique reverse micelle structure within the electrolyte not only disrupts water hydrogen bonding and efficiently inhibits the water consumption at Zn anode, but also undergoes directed movement and reversible demulsification under electric field, thus enhancing the anode desolvation kinetics and inhibiting the interfacial side reactions. Owing to the simultaneous regulation of water molecules in both electrolyte bulk and anode interface, this W/O electrolyte achieves a high Zn plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.76% over 6000 cycles, and maintains an extend lifespan in Zn||V10O24&#183;12H2O (VOH) cells with negligible hydrogen evolution and dendrite formation. These key findings are expected to promote the electrolyte engineering toward reversible ZMBs.

         <title>Kinetically Dormant Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathode During High&#8208;Voltage Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;rich layered cathode remains thermodynamically reversible but undergoes dramatic kinetic degradation at high voltage, leading to the commonly observed capacity loss that in fact can be recovered under kinetic&#8208;free conditions. Such kinetic dormant behavior highly synchronizes with the lattice strain evolution stemming from layered/rock&#8208;salt structural heterogeneity during charge.








Abstract
The degradation of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes during long&#8208;term operation at high voltage has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. Despite many post&#8208;mortem qualitative structural analyses, precise quantification of their individual and coupling contributions to the overall capacity degradation remains challenging. Here, by leveraging multiscale synchrotron X&#8208;ray probes, electron microscopy, and post&#8208;galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, the thermodynamically irreversible and kinetically reversible capacity loss is successfully deconvoluted in a polycrystalline LiNi0.83Mn0.1Co0.07O2 cathode during long&#8208;term charge/discharge cycling in full cell configuration. Contradicting the dramatic capacity loss, the layered structure remains highly alive even after 1000 cycles at 4.6 V while undergoing a three&#8208;order of magnitude reduction in the mass transfer kinetics, leading to almost fully recoverable capacity under kinetic&#8208;free conditions. Such kinetic dormant behavior after cycling is not simply ascribed to poor chemical diffusion by reconstructed cathode surface but highly synchronizes with the lattice strain evolution stemming from the structural heterogeneity between deeply delithiated layered and degraded rock&#8208;salt phases at high voltage. These findings deepen the degradation mechanism of high&#8208;voltage cathodes to achieve long&#8208;cycling and fast&#8208;charging performance.

         <title>In&#8208;Sensor Computing with Visual&#8208;Tactile Perception Enabled by Mechano&#8208;Optical Artificial Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechano&#8208;optical artificial synapse that enables in&#8208;sensor computing with visual&#8208;tactile perception is achieved by integrating photostimulated luminescence with self&#8208;recoverable mechanoluminescence materials. The multimodal artificial synapse demonstrates an individual and synergistic plasticity in a remotely accessible manner and enables neuromorphic pattern recognition and materials identification. This work paves the way to construct flexible in&#8208;sensor computing systems with crossmodal integration and recognition.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor computing paradigm holds the promise of realizing rapid and low&#8208;power signal processing. Constructing crossmodal in&#8208;sensor computing systems to emulate human sensory and recognition capabilities has been a persistent pursuit for developing humanoid robotics. Here, an artificial mechano&#8208;optical synapse is reported to implement in&#8208;sensor dynamic computing with visual&#8208;tactile perception. By employing mechanoluminescence (ML) material, direct conversion of the mechanical signals into light emission is achieved and the light is transported to an adjacent photostimulated luminescence (PSL) layer without pre&#8208; and post&#8208;irradiation. The PSL layer acts as a photon reservoir as well as a processing unit for achieving in&#8208;memory computing. The approach based on ML coupled with PSL material is different from traditional circuit&#8211;constrained methods, enabling remote operation and easy accessibility. Individual and synergistic plasticity are elaborately investigated under force and light pulses, including paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, learning behavior, and short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory. A multisensory neural network is built for processing the obtained handwritten patterns with a tablet consisting of the device, achieving a recognition accuracy of up to 92.5%. Moreover, material identification has been explored based on visual&#8208;tactile sensing, with an accuracy rate of 98.6%. This work provides a promising strategy to construct in&#8208;sensor computing systems with crossmodal integration and recognition.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hermitian Boundary in a Surface Selective Reconstructed Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study is the first to propose that the surface reconstruction of a Weyl semimetal creates a Hermitian bulk&#8208;non&#8208;Hermitian boundary system. The non&#8208;Hermitian effects arising from the surface reconstruction are manifested by the emergence of non&#8208;topological surface Fermi arcs (NTSFAs) and the broadening of both topological surface Fermi arcs (SFAs) and NTSFAs.

Non&#8208;Hermitian physics, studying systems described by non&#8208;Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals unique phenomena not present in Hermitian systems. Unlike Hermitian systems, non&#8208;Hermitian systems have complex eigenvalues, making their effects less directly observable. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted to incorporating the non&#8208;Hermitian effects into condensed matter physics. However, progress is hindered by the absence of a viable experimental approach. Here, the discovery of the surface&#8208;selectively spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi provides a feasible experimental platform for studying non&#8208;Hermitian physics. Utilizing angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements, surface&#8208;projected density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements, it is demonstrated that surface reconstruction in NdAlSi alters surface Fermi arc (SFA) connectivity and generates new isolated non&#8208;topological SFAs (NTSFAs) by introducing non&#8208;Hermitian terms. The surface&#8208;selective spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi can be viewed as a Hermitian bulk &#8211; non&#8208;Hermitian boundary system. The isolated non&#8208;topological SFAs on the reconstructed surface act as a loss mechanism and open boundary condition (OBC) for the topological electrons and bulk states, serving as non&#8208;Hermitian boundary states. This discovery provides a good experimental platform for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications based on boundary non&#8208;Hermitian effects, extending beyond purely mathematical concepts. Furthermore, it provides important enlightenment for constructing topological photonic crystals with surface reconstruction and studying their topological&#160;properties.

&lt;p&gt;This study is the first to propose that the surface reconstruction of a Weyl semimetal creates a Hermitian bulk-non-Hermitian boundary system. The non-Hermitian effects arising from the surface reconstruction are manifested by the emergence of non-topological surface Fermi arcs (NTSFAs) and the broadening of both topological surface Fermi arcs (SFAs) and NTSFAs. These effects are demonstrated through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements in a surface-reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi.

         <title>Rolling the Dice with Light Competition: Introducing a True Random Number Generator Powered by Photo&#8208;Induced Polarity Current</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces the ALTRNG, utilizing a BPPD to generate random bits via unpredictable&#160;arc discharge illumination. Validated by 15 NIST tests, ALTRNG produces highly random bit streams. With a 2&#8208;kbps readout circuit, it enables wireless random number transmission, offering potential for secure password systems and artificial X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
The pursuit of hardware&#8208;based security solutions has highlighted the true random number generator (TRNG). Various physical phenomena, from noise generation to quantum physics complexities, have been explored for random number generation. The arc discharge light&#8208;induced TRNG (ALTRNG) is introduced, featuring wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent generation and arc discharge irradiation. A bipolar photo&#8208;responsive photodetector (BPPD) differentiates &#8220;1&#8221; and &#8220;0&#8221; states, producing highly random bits validated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 15 tests. The BPPD's response to deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) and blue light enables distinct photocurrent generation under arc discharge illumination. The ALTRNG generates true random signals, yielding bit streams with unpredictability, uniform distribution, and stability. With a readout circuit achieving 2&#8208;kbps, wireless random number transmission is demonstrated, highlighting potential for secure password systems and artificial X&#8208;ray image generation.

         <title>A Supramolecular Nanoengine Generates Nanomechanical Force on Demand for Precise Cytosolic Delivery of Anti&#8208;miRNAs and Synergistic TNBC Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carrier&#8208;free supramolecular nanoengine (AMGA) is developed, which significantly enhances the cytosolic delivery of anti&#8208;miRNAs without requiring light irradiation for precise targeting and synergistic chemo&#8208;gene therapy of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. AMGA can specifically generate nanomechanical force to promote the endo/lysosome escape of anti&#8208;miRNAs, simultaneously downregulating miRNA&#8208;21 and miRNA&#8208;10b, and release the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine.








Abstract
Although anti&#8208;microRNA (miRNA) is capable of silencing target miRNA and regulating multiple mRNAs in diverse signaling pathways, RNA medicines still encounter numerous challenges, especially in terms of poor delivery, inefficient endo/lysosomal escape, and suboptimal treatment. Herein, we have developed a carrier&#8208;free supramolecular nanoengine, AMGA (anti&#8208;miRNA/GEM2&#8208;Azo), which significantly enhances the cytosolic delivery of anti&#8208;miRNA without requiring light irradiation, thereby facilitating precise targeting and synergistic chemo&#8208;gene therapy for triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). AMGA can be rapidly internalized by cancer cells and specifically generate nanomechanical force to promote the efficient escape of anti&#8208;miRNAs from the endo/lysosome to the cytoplasm, simultaneously downregulating miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;10b. In comparison to Lipofectamine 2000, AMGA demonstrated superior efficacy in inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Significantly, AMGA exhibited profound antitumor and gene silencing effects in an orthotopic human TNBC mouse model. This novel supramolecular nanoengine presents a promising strategy for cytosolic delivery of anti&#8208;miRNAs.

         <title>Colossal Electromechanical Response in Antiferroelectric&#8208;based Nanoscale Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The careful design of interfaces in PbHfO3&#8208; and PbHf1&#8208;xTixO3&#8208;based multilayer heterostructures results in electromechanical strain &#8776;4.8% for films as thin as 120 nm. Such studies can significantly advance the understanding about electromechanically&#8208;active thin films which can surpass the detrimental effects of substrate&#8208;induced clamping to demonstrate strain values and be implemented in real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
The pursuit of smaller, energy&#8208;efficient devices drives the exploration of electromechanically active thin films (&lt;1 &#181;m) to enable micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;electromechanical systems. While the electromechanical response of such films is limited by substrate&#8208;induced mechanical clamping, large electromechanical responses in antiferroelectric and multilayer thin&#8208;film heterostructures have garnered interest. Here, multilayer thin&#8208;film heterostructures based on antiferroelectric PbHfO3 and ferroelectric PbHf1&#8208;xTixO3 overcome substrate clamping to produce electromechanical strains &gt;4.5%. By varying the chemistry of the PbHf1&#8208;xTixO3 layer (x = 0.3&#8208;0.6) it is possible to alter the threshold field for the antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric phase transition, reducing the field required to induce the onset of large electromechanical response. Furthermore, varying the interface density (from 0.008 to 3.1 nm&#8722;1) enhances the electrical&#8208;breakdown field by &gt;450%. Attaining the electromechanical strains does not necessitate creating a new material with unprecedented piezoelectric coefficients, but developing heterostructures capable of withstanding large fields, thus addressing traditional limitations of thin&#8208;film piezoelectrics.

         <title>Enhancing the Performance of Fluorinated Graphdiyne Moisture Cells via Hard Acid&#8208;Base Coordination of Aluminum Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a groundbreaking MEG method, highlighting the application of fluorinated graphdiyne in novel moisture cells. A unique Al ion&#8208;F coordination mechanism is introduced, significantly enhancing ion migration and conductivity. Coupled with the FGDY's macroporous structure, the FGDY Al&#8208;ion moisture cell achieves outstanding performance metrics.








Abstract
Moisture&#8208;enabled electric generators (MEGs) are emerging as a transformative energy technology, capable of directly converting ambient moisture into electrical energy without producing pollutants or harmful emissions. However, the widespread application of MEGs is hindered by challenges such as intermittent output and low current densities, which limit power density and prevent large&#8208;scale integration. Here, a novel moisture cell based on Al ion&#8208;F coordination&#8212;specifically, a fluorinated graphdiyne (FGDY) Al&#8208;ion moisture cell (FGDY AlMC) is introduced. This new moisture cell achieves an exceptionally high mass&#8208;specific power density of 371.36&#160;&#181;W&#160;g&#8722;&#185;, stable output (0.65 V for 15 h), and broad applicability across varying humid environments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the large&#8208;pore molecular structure of FGDY significantly reduces the diffusion barriers for Al ions compared to other 2D carbon materials. Furthermore, the F atoms as &#8220;hard base&#8221; on FGDY effectively coordinate with &#8220;hard acid&#8221; Al ions, enhancing ionic conductivity, accelerating ion migration, and promoting the generation of a higher number of mobile cations. These combined advantages lead to a marked improvement in the performance of the FGDY AlMC. These findings position Al ion coordinated FGDY as a highly promising candidate for the development of high&#8208;performance MEG active materials.

Coupled with the FGDY's macroporous structure, the FGDY Al-ion moisture cell achieves outstanding performance metrics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moisture-enabled electric generators (MEGs) are emerging as a transformative energy technology, capable of directly converting ambient moisture into electrical energy without producing pollutants or harmful emissions. However, the widespread application of MEGs is hindered by challenges such as intermittent output and low current densities, which limit power density and prevent large-scale integration. Here, a novel moisture cell based on Al ion-F coordination&#8212;specifically, a fluorinated graphdiyne (FGDY) Al-ion moisture cell (FGDY AlMC) is introduced. This new moisture cell achieves an exceptionally high mass-specific power density of 371.36&#160;&#181;W&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#185;, stable output (0.65 V for 15 h), and broad applicability across varying humid environments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the large-pore molecular structure of FGDY significantly reduces the diffusion barriers for Al ions compared to other 2D carbon materials. Furthermore, the F atoms as &#8220;hard base&#8221; on FGDY effectively coordinate with &#8220;hard acid&#8221; Al ions, enhancing ionic conductivity, accelerating ion migration, and promoting the generation of a higher number of mobile cations. These combined advantages lead to a marked improvement in the performance of the FGDY AlMC. These findings position Al ion coordinated FGDY as a highly promising candidate for the development of high-performance MEG active materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Engineered lipid vesicles, powered by enzyme&#8208;driven symmetry breaking and transient lipid ordering, demonstrate rotational and translational motion. This innovative approach presents exciting possibilities for biomedical applications, particularly in targeted drug delivery.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propelled lipid&#8208;based artificial cells that can achieve controlled rotation and directed translation present significant potential for biomedical applications, yet their engineering poses considerable challenges. Lipid vesicles synthesized via solution&#8208;based methods naturally adopt isotropic spherical shapes. Active motion of these spherical objects requires symmetry breaking and rigidity. In this study, giant vesicles are employed as chassis, utilizing enzymes that undergo cyclic, non&#8208;reciprocal conformational changes as power sources. Weak, transient protein&#8208;protein interactions induce lipid ordering leading to rigidity and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Upon activation of enzyme reactions, these spherical vesicles demonstrate a variety of motion patterns, from pure spinning to 3D spiral trajectories. From experiments and simulations, it is demonstrated how such motion enables the vesicles to cross complex barriers. By utilizing biocompatible and scalable materials, The methodology establishes a solid framework for the design of such self&#8208;propelled systems. The work paves the way for advancements in biomedical and environmental technologies such as targeted drug delivery and active matter research.

         <title>CuPt Alloy Enabling the Tandem Catalysis for Reduction of HCOOH and NO3&#8722; to Urea at High Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic liquid HCOOH and NO3&#8722; synthesis of urea with high Faraday efficiency at high current density is successfully achieved by synthesizing the Cu4Pt tandem catalyst loaded on copper foam. The doped Pt sites can enrich liquid HCOOH reactants, promote HCOOH intermolecular dehydration, and form a large number of *CO key intermediates to lay the foundation for subsequent C&#9472;N coupling.








Abstract
The formation of urea by electrocatalytic reduction of C1&#8208;reactants and NO3&#8722; is an attractive way to store renewable electricity, close the carbon cycle, and eliminate nitrate contaminants from wastewater. Involving insufficient supply of C1 reactants and multiple electron transfers makes the reaction difficult to achieve high Faraday efficiency and high yield at high current density. Here, a urea synthesis approach is presented via electrocatalytic reductive coupling between liquid HCOOH and NO3&#8722; on copper foam (CF) loaded Cu4Pt catalyst with optimized ratios. A urea yield of 40.08 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 is achieved with FE up to 58.1% at a current density of &#8722;502.3 mA cm&#8722;2, superior to the productivity of previously reported catalysts. No degradation is observed over 120&#8208;h continuous operation at such a high yield rate. The highly efficient activity of Cu4Pt/CF can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Pt and Cu sites via tandem catalysis, in which the doped Pt sites enrich liquid HCOOH reactants, promote HCOOH intermolecular dehydration, and form and adsorb large amounts of *CO key intermediates. The Cu sites can generate large quantities of the key intermediate *NH2. The Cu4Pt/CF adsorbed intermediates *CO and *NH2 are the basis for subsequent thermodynamic spontaneous C&#9472;N coupling.

         <title>An Opto&#8208;Iontronic Cholesteric Liquid Crystalline Retina for Multimodal Circularly Polarized Neuromorphic Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An opto&#8208;iontronic cholesteric liquid crystalline (i&#8208;CLC) film is developed that is both electrically and photonically active, serving as the dielectric in phototransistors. The well&#8208;defined cholesteric structure and broadly tunable pitches of the i&#8208;CLC film enable it to detect CPL across a broad spectrum, with an unprecedentedly high dissymmetry factor (gph = 1.33) at low operating voltages (&lt; 5&#160;V).








Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) is fundamental to phase&#8208;controlled imaging, quantum optics, and optical computing. Conventional CPL detection, relying on polarizers and quarter&#8208;wave plates, complicates device design and reduces sensitivity. Among emerging CPL detectors, organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFET) with helical organic semiconductors are highly promising due to their compact structures but suffer tedious synthesis, low dissymmetric factors (gph &lt;&#160;0.1), and high operating voltages (&gt; 50&#160;V). To address these issues, an opto&#8208;iontronic cholesteric liquid crystalline (i&#8208;CLC) film is developed that is both electrically and photonically active, serving as the dielectric in phototransistors. The well&#8208;defined cholesteric structure and broadly tunable pitches of the i&#8208;CLC film enable it to detect CPL with an excellent &#8220;handedness&#8221; selectivity across a broad spectrum. Moreover, its ionic nature provides a high capacitance (up to 580&#160;nF cm&#8722;2 @20&#160;Hz). The resulting flexible CPL detectors achieve an unprecedentedly high dissymmetry factor (gph = 1.33) at low operating voltages (&lt; 5&#160;V), showcasing significant potential in optical communication and data encryption. Furthermore, leveraging high gph, they can perform in&#8208;sensor computing for highly accurate semantic segmentation using fused multimodal visual inputs (e.g., circularly polarized and ordinary light), achieving an accuracy of 75.73% and a mean intersection over the union of 0.3982, surpassing the performance of non&#8208;CPL photodetectors. Additionally, it optimizes power consumption by a factor of 102 compared to most conventional visual processing systems, offering a groundbreaking hardware solution for high&#8208;performance neuromorphic CPL vision.

         <title>A Soft Nonpolar&#8208;Soluble Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite for General Construction of Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonpolar soluble 2D perovskite, noted as TPA2PbI4, is developed to construct controllable mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite heterojunctions without solid reactions with the initial 3D perovskite films. This strategy improves both the performance of small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells and large&#8208;area perovskite modules, promoting 30&#160;cm &#215; 30&#160;cm FAPbI3 perovskite submodules to achieve a certified efficiency of 22.06%.








Abstract
Constructing mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunctions through ion exchange between functional organic ammonium halides and the already&#8208;deposited bulk 3D perovskite films is a widely adopted strategy to effectively passivate and stabilize perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Such process poses challenges in precisely controlling the composition and distribution of the heterojunctions across the film, in particular for large&#8208;area applications. Here, a soft 2D perovskite based on tetrapheptyl&#8208;ammonium iodide (TPAI), noted as TPA2PbI4 is reported. It is the first&#8208;reported nonpolar readily soluble 2D perovskite, leading to highly compact and oriented perovskite layers. In addition, this nonpolar soluble TPA2PbI4 is beneficial to universally construct thickness&#8208;controllable mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite heterojunctions to suppress the non&#8208;radiative recombination and promote charge&#8208;carrier transfer on all the FA&#8208;, MA&#8208; and CsPbI3 PSCs. Such a unique strategy is also suitable for upscaling fabrication, demonstrated by 30&#160;cm &#215; 30&#160;cm FAPbI3 perovskite submodules with a certified efficiency of 22.06%.

&lt;p&gt;Constructing mixed-dimensional heterojunctions through ion exchange between functional organic ammonium halides and the already-deposited bulk 3D perovskite films is a widely adopted strategy to effectively passivate and stabilize perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Such process poses challenges in precisely controlling the composition and distribution of the heterojunctions across the film, in particular for large-area applications. Here, a soft 2D perovskite based on tetrapheptyl-ammonium iodide (TPAI), noted as TPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is reported. It is the first-reported nonpolar readily soluble 2D perovskite, leading to highly compact and oriented perovskite layers. In addition, this nonpolar soluble TPA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is beneficial to universally construct thickness-controllable mixed-dimensional perovskite heterojunctions to suppress the non-radiative recombination and promote charge-carrier transfer on all the FA-, MA- and CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs. Such a unique strategy is also suitable for upscaling fabrication, demonstrated by 30&#160;cm &#215; 30&#160;cm FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite submodules with a certified efficiency of 22.06%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mixed Electrolyte Enabling Ultrafast Mass Transport and Compatibility with Polypropylene Separator for Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Aluminum Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed electrolyte (IL&#8208;FB (1:5)) for aluminum ion batteries is synthesized by incorporating fluorobenzene into ionic liquid electrolyte. The IL&#8208;FB (1:5) promotes mass transport, enabling cycling for 7500 h under high current density and capacity (8 mA cm&#8722;2, 8 mAh cm&#8722;2). IL&#8208;FB (1:5) also exhibits significantly improved wetting ability with the polypropylene separator, guaranteeing 60% reduction in the cost of the AIB.








Abstract
The energy industry has taken notice of aluminum ion batteries (AIB) for their low cost, high safety, and high capacity. However, using the ionic liquid electrolyte results in the uneven Al electrodeposition and the reliance on expensive glass fiber separators, due to the sluggish mass transport and low wettability for the polypropylene separator. Herein, a mixed electrolyte is introduced by incorporating the co&#8208;solvent fluorobenzene into the traditional AlCl3/1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid, in which the fluorobenzene (FB) mitigates electrostatic interactions between ions and facilitates the ion diffusion. The optimization principle for the mixed electrolyte is proposed based on maximizing the mass transportation, as indicated by the limiting current density. The optimized mixed electrolyte IL&#8208;FB (1:5) offers the highest limiting current density of 12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, highly reversible plate/stripe of Al, and thus stable cycling for 7500 h with the high current density and capacity (8 mA cm&#8722;2, 8 mAh cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, IL&#8208;FB (1:5) also shows enhanced wettability for the polypropylene separator. The AIB with the polypropylene separator, exhibiting 60% decrease in cost, is achieved for the first time by using IL&#8208;FB (1:5), presenting a crucial step toward the initial practical application.

         <title>Homo&#8208;Hetero Double Junction Coupling Weakens Exciton Effects to Enhance Selective Photocatalytic O2 Activation on Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the homo&#8208;hetero double&#8208;junction coupling strategy, the directional electron&#8211;hole migration is precisely regulated, and the exciton effect is substantially weakened. Under the strong built&#8208;in electric field, the FO/HCCN surface exhibits typical charge&#8208;carrier behavior, which achieves &#8776;100% selective generation of &#183;O2&#8722; from O2.








Abstract
Exciton effects caused by the inherent dielectric confinement in the 2D material carbon nitride (CN) severely limit the transfer of photogenerated carriers and the selective generation of free radicals. Herein, a homo&#8208;hetero double junction coupling strategy is reported to address these challenges. Ternary homojunction carbon nitride (HCCN) functionalized with cyano and cyanamide groups is constructed with a built&#8208;in electric field that efficiently separates the electron&#8211;hole into different structural units, thereby reducing reverse charge recombination and weakening exciton effects. The introduction of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 (FO) subsequently constructs the homo&#8208;hetero double junction catalyst FO/HCCN with a built&#8208;in electric field 127 times stronger than HCCN, which promotes the directional migration of carriers after exciton dissociation and achieves &#8776;100% selective generation of &#183;O2&#8722; from O2. These results suggest that FO/HCCN achieves 99.6% removal of tetracycline within 20&#160;min, with a degradation rate 12 and 46 times higher than FO/CN and HCCN, respectively. In addition, the system shows excellent stability and cyclability in real&#8208;life light experiments and trace organic contaminant removal. This homo&#8208;hetero double junction coupling strategy opens up new avenues in weakening exciton effects and precisely controlling the generation of free radicals.

         <title>Kinetics Manipulation Enabled by Solubility Control Toward 19% Organic Solar Cells via Compatible Air Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A twisted guest acceptor BTP&#8208;4Cl is introduced to fine&#8208;tune the solubility of host components to address the excessive aggregation issue in blade&#8208;coated processing. It is found that the twisted molecular conformation profited in inducing longer intermolecular distance and dispersing molecular distribution in the solvent. Simultaneously, the guest acceptor positively influenced the crystalization kinetics by providing nuclei seeding sites. Finally, a fine phase separation is achieved in the open&#8208;air blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversion efficiency of 19.67%.









Abstract
Blade coating is a promising tool for upscaling organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the performances of blade&#8208;coated OSCs still lag behind their spin&#8208;coated counterparts, limiting their competitive edge towards commercialization. One of the main reasons is that controlling the film aggregation kinetics and morphology becomes challenging during the transition from spin coating to blade coating, especially when using high boiling point solvents, which can result in excessive aggregation. Therefore, a deeper understanding and appraisal of film formation kinetics influenced by coating methods is crucial. In this work, it is demonstrated that ink solubility tuning by incorporating a twisted third component (BTP&#8208;4Cl) can induce rapid crystallization behavior and promote fine phase separation between the donor polymer (PM6) and the acceptor (BTP&#8208;eC9) in blade coating. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.67% is obtained in OSCs (0.04 cm2), one of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies among the reported blade&#8208;coated OSCs (19.76% for the spin&#8208;coated devices). In addition, it is found that the inhibited phase aggregation contributes to enhancing the light stability of the device. This strategy offered novel insights into the effectiveness of solubility&#8208;tuning approaches for achieving highly efficient and stable OSCs under open&#8208;air coating conditions.

         <title>Development of Ternary Hydrogel Electrolytes for Superior Gel Thermocells: Exceptional Anti&#8208;Drying, Anti&#8208;Freezing, and Mechanical Robustness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>

A flexible wearable ternary gel thermocell (TGTC) by integrating a thermosensitive crystallizing agent, and supporting electrolyte into a natural nanocellulose hydrogel matrix is designed and constructed, which exhibits a remarkable thermopower, an optimized effective ionic conductivity, anti&#8208;drying, freezing resistance, and mechanical robustness. This work provides a versatile strategy for developing TGTC, contributing to advancements in low&#8208;grade energy harvesting and wearable electronics for the Internet of Things era.








Abstract
Gel thermocells (GTCs) provide a safe, facile, and scalable solution for harvesting waste heat to power ubiquitous electronics. However, achieving a harmonious integration of high power density, wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range stability, and mechanical robustness in GTCs remains a significant challenge. In this work, a novel ternary gel thermocell (TGTC) is proposed and fabricated by integrating ferro/ferricyanide (Fe(CN)63&#8722;/4&#8722;) redox couples, thermosensitive crystallizing agents guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), and supporting electrolytes lithium chloride (LiCl) into natural nanocellulose hydrogels to enhance overall performance. GdmCl selectively induces Fe(CN)64&#8722; crystallization, increasing the concentration difference of redox pairs, resulting in improving thermopower and significantly increased fiber friction, while LiCl rapidly balances charges through electromigration promoting efficient ion transport and reconstructing hydrogen bond networks, contributing to an excellent output power density and the capture of water molecules, which are further elucidated by simulations, achieving synchronous enhancement of anti&#8208;drying, anti&#8208;freezing and mechanical properties. Consequently, the TGTC achieves a remarkable thermopower of 3.42&#160;mV K&#8722;1, a maximum power density of 2.8&#160;mW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2, multiple continuous stable cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, and an impressive strength of 3.06&#160;MPa. Notably, this study elucidates the design principles and underlying mechanisms of ternary gel electrolytes, offering a practical strategy for advancing GTC technology.

GdmCl selectively induces Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; crystallization, increasing the concentration difference of redox pairs, resulting in improving thermopower and significantly increased fiber friction, while LiCl rapidly balances charges through electromigration promoting efficient ion transport and reconstructing hydrogen bond networks, contributing to an excellent output power density and the capture of water molecules, which are further elucidated by simulations, achieving synchronous enhancement of anti-drying, anti-freezing and mechanical properties. Consequently, the TGTC achieves a remarkable thermopower of 3.42&#160;mV K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a maximum power density of 2.8&#160;mW m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, multiple continuous stable cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, and an impressive strength of 3.06&#160;MPa. Notably, this study elucidates the design principles and underlying mechanisms of ternary gel electrolytes, offering a practical strategy for advancing GTC technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Universal Solution for Direct Regeneration of Spent Lithium Iron Phosphate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design criteria for a lithiation solution that enables spontaneous lithiation under ambient conditions for the direct regeneration of spent LiFePO4 are proposed. Using machine learning (ML), the redox potentials of various solution systems are identified and revealed a critical relationship: the lower the redox potential, the more effective the lithiation of degraded LiFePO4 materials.








Abstract
Lithiation reactions driven by chemical potential offer a promising avenue for directly regenerating degraded lithium iron phosphate (LFP). However, the choice of solution system significantly influences the lithium supplementation where improper selection may result in poor lithium recovery or extremely slow kinetics. Herein, it is identified that the most critical factor affecting solution repair effectiveness is the redox potential of the anions in the solution, which determines whether spent LFP (SLFP) can undergo spontaneous lithiation under ambient conditions. Then, machine learning (ML) is used for prediction and screening of huge potential solution systems, and finally a general strategy is proposed: creating a low redox potential solution system that incorporates anions with either low redox potential or moderate redox potential at high concentrations. As a demonstration, the regenerated LFP by ascorbic acid and LiOH solution systems exhibits a high discharge capacity of 144 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, retaining 96% of its capacity after 500 cycles at 5 C. This work establishes an important criteria for designing solution systems to restore degraded LFP, marking a significant advancement in the direct regeneration of cathode materials from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs).

         <title>17.68% Efficiency Nonhalogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cell Modules Driven by Seed Crystal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>

The TOC illustration depicts asymmetric BDTF&#8208;CA2O seed crystals (left) harnessing low nucleation barrier and strong crystallinity to facilitate PM6 crystallization. The module's J&#8211;V curve (right) highlights the transition from small&#8208;area cells to industrial&#8208;scale modules, emphasizing the seed crystal strategy's role in achieving uniform morphology and record efficiencies.








Abstract
Organic solar cells now surpass 20% efficiency in small&#8208;area devices, but the use of chloroform as a solvent poses industrial scalability challenges because of its limited ability of uniform film formation and toxicity. High&#8208;boiling, non&#8208;halogenated solvents are being studied as alternatives, but their low solubility and slow evaporation complicate crystallization process. Here, the study introduces a seed crystal strategy by incorporating oligo (ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified small&#8208;molecule donors to optimize the nucleation and crystallization. The asymmetric BDTF&#8208;CA2O molecule, which combines the strong crystallinity of rodanine group and the low nucleation barrier of oligo (ethylene glycol) chain, significantly promotes the crystallization of the polymer donor PM6. Moreover, BDTF&#8208;CA2O effectively suppresses excessive phase separation, and optimizes vertical distribution, resulting in enhanced exciton extraction, balanced carrier transport, and reduced recombination losses. Small&#8208;area toluene&#8208;processed devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.67%. In the realm of large&#8208;area organic solar cell modules, this strategy leads to a record active area efficiency of 17.68% and aperture area efficiency of 16.80% (certified at 16.26%), which is the highest reported for organic solar cell modules &gt;10 cm2 to date. These achievements highlight the potential of the seed crystal strategy for large&#8208;scale production of efficient, large&#8208;area organic solar cell modules.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Breathable 2D Photothermal Fabric with Three&#8208;Layered Structure for Efficient Four&#8208;Plane Evaporation of Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by leaf structure and the transpiration process, a breathable 2D photothermal fabric with a three&#8208;layer structure for efficient four&#8208;plane evaporation of seawater is developed. The fabric evaporator achieves faster evaporation rates (2.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) under sunlight (1.0 kW m&#8722;2), outperforming single&#8208;plane (1.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and double&#8208;plane (1.9 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) evaporations.








Abstract
2D photothermal membranes have demonstrated numerous advantages in solar desalination due to their flexibility, scalability, and low cost. However, their practical applications are limited by the restricted evaporation area and obstructed vapor channels. A biomimetic design of the breathable 2D photothermal fabric is reported, which is composed of two carbon&#8208;nanotube&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;coated polyester (PET) fabrics separated by fiber pillars, with the upper fabric layer having a hole array as stomatal channels. This fabric shows high solar&#8208;absorption efficiency (96.1%) and decreased water&#8208;evaporation enthalpy (1664.6 kJ kg&#8722;1). The hanging fabric as a heliotropic evaporator exhibits four&#8208;plane evaporation feature and achieves a high evaporation rate of 2.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under sunlight (1.0 kW m&#8722;2) illumination, better than the traditional floated model (single&#8208;plane, 1.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1). The evaporation rate can be further enhanced to 4.2 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 upon introducing adscititious airflow (2 m s&#8722;1). Simultaneously, the heliotropic&#8208;hanging design allows the dropping of concentrated brine, avoiding solid&#8208;salt&#8208;crystallization.

         <title>Regulating Interface Engineering by Helmholtz Plane Reconstructed Achieves Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic regulation strategy is proposed by introducing a small amount of Pyridine oxide (PNO). The preferentially adsorbed PNO constitutes a protective layer in the Inner Helmholtz Plane and inhibits the activity of water within the Outer Helmholtz plane via customizing solvation sheath. That's blocking the direct contact of active water and the anode, leading to highly reversible aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
The rampant dendrite growth and notorious parasitic reactions significantly compromise the stability of zinc anodes in aqueous zinc metal batteries, presenting substantial for their practical applications. Herein, this work proposes a synergistic strategy that reconstructs the Helmholtz plane to precisely regulate the interface chemistry between the anode and the electrolyte. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that even a small amount of pyridine oxide (PNO) additive effectively alters the coordination environment and reorganizes the solvation sheath in the Outer Helmholtz Plane (OHP). Simultaneously, PNO molecules preferentially adsorbed on the anode surface, displacing active water from the Inner Helmholtz Plane (IHP). Through synergistic regulation in both the OHP and IHP, zinc ions achieve compact and dense deposition along the Zn (002) crystal plane, while parasitic reactions catalyzed by active water are effectively suppressed. Consequently, the symmetric cell incorporating the PNO additive demonstrates stable cycling performance, maintaining more than 2300&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and sustaining over 400&#160;h even at a high depth of discharge of 85%. Furthermore, the Zn||AQ cell retains 80% of its capacity after 3000 cycles and exhibits outstanding cycling stability even under the high active material mass loading (22&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) using the modified electrolyte.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Polymer Aerogels with Increased Accessibility of Well&#8208;Defined Single&#8208;Atom Metal Sites as a New Paradigm of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and general strategy is developed to prepare conjugated coordination polymer aerogels (denoted as M&#8208;CCPA, M = Ni, Cu, Zn, etc.) that can markedly increase the accessibility of their well&#8208;defined single&#8208;atom metal sites within their hierarchically porous structures with mesopores and nanopores, which can provide a wide space for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts toward various energy&#8208;conversion systems.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with maximum metal utilization efficiency is of significance, which presents enormous potentials to be extensively applied. It is desired yet challenging to elaborately tailor the coordination structures of active sites in SACs and simultaneously enable sufficient accessibility of these active sites to reactants. Here, a facile and general strategy to prepare conjugated coordination polymer aerogels (CCPA) with porous architectures that can markedly increase the accessibility of their elaborately&#8208;tailored active sites, which as a new electrocatalyst paradigm can fully present both the structural advantages of SACs and aerogel materials, is reported. Taking nickel (Ni) as an example, Ni&#8208;based CCPA (Ni&#8208;CCPA) and its counterpart Ni&#8208;CCP with non&#8208;aerogel feature are studied as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept case. Electrochemical measurements show that, relative to Ni&#8208;CCP, Ni&#8208;CCPA exhibits appreciably higher performance toward alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Both the experimental results and theoretical simulations unravel that the improved OER performance of Ni&#8208;CCPA arises from the accelerated OH&#8722; diffusion within its porous architecture and enhanced OH&#8722; concentration near its highly exposed active sites at its high&#8208;curvature surfaces with localized electric fields. Importantly, as evidenced by the Cu&#8208;CCPA and Zn&#8208;CCPA examples, such strategy can be promisingly applied to prepare high&#8208;performance CCPA targeted toward various catalytic reactions and beyond.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Urea on High&#8208;Density Ga&#9472;Y Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst via Cross&#8208;Tuning</title>

Electrochemically converting carbon dioxide and nitrate into urea via the C&#8211;N coupling route offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional industrial urea production technology. Herein, a high&#8208;density Ga&#8211;Y dual&#8208;atom catalyst supported on N, P&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon substrate is developed for urea electrosynthesis. Experiments and theories reveal that strong cross&#8208;synergizing coupling between Ga&#8208;Y sites contributed to improving the electrosynthesis performance of urea.








Abstract
Electrochemically converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into urea via the C&#9472;N coupling route offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional industrial urea production technology, but it is still limited by poor yield rate, low Faradaic efficiency, and insufficient coupling kinetics. Herein, a high&#8208;density Ga&#9472;Y dual&#8208;atom catalyst is developed with loading up to 14.1 wt.% of Ga and Y supported on N, P&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon substrate (Ga/Y&#8208;CNP) for urea electrosynthesis. The catalyst facilitates efficient C&#9472;N coupling through co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722;, resulting in a high urea yield rate of 41.9 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 22.1% at &#8722;1.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations&#160;reveal that the superior performance is attributed to the cross&#8208;tuning between adjacent pair Ga&#9472;Y sites, which can mutually optimize their electronic states for facilitating CO2 reduction to *CO at Ga sites and promoting NO3&#8722; conversion to hydroxylamine (*NH2OH) at Y sites, followed by spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NH2OH intermediates at Ga&#9472;Y sites to form C&#9472;N bonds. This work offers a pioneering strategy to manipulate C&#9472;N coupling pathways by cross&#8208;tuning active sites to produce high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy 1T&#8208;Phase Quantum Sheets of Transition&#8208;Metal Disulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient high&#8208;entropy strategy is developed to produce 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets of transition&#8208;metal disulfides based on controllable introduction of multiple metal atoms with large size differences to retard the sliding of basal plane. The key is the topological conversion of in&#8208;plane ordered carbide laminates (i&#8208;MAX) compatible with multiple atoms to high&#8208;strained high&#8208;entropy transition&#8208;metal disulfides with 1T phase, which facilely triggers the fracture into 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets during the exfoliation process. The resultant 1T&#8208;phase disulfide quantum sheets show high electrocatalytic activities for lithium polysulfides, achieving good electrochemical properties in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. 








Abstract
Quantum sheets of transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising nanomaterials owing to the combination of both 2D nanosheets and quantum dots with distinctive properties. However, the quantum sheets usually possess semiconducting behavior associated with 2H phase, it remains challenging to produce 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets due to the easy sliding of the basal plane susceptible to the small lateral sizes. Here, an efficient high&#8208;entropy strategy is developed to produce 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets of transition&#8208;metal disulfides based on controllable introduction of multiple metal atoms with large size differences to retard the sliding of basal plane. The key is the topological conversion of in&#8208;plane ordered carbide laminates (i&#8208;MAX) compatible with multiple atoms to high&#8208;entropy transition&#8208;metal disulfides with high strains and 1T phase, which facilely triggers the fracture into 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets with average size of 4.5 nm and thickness of 0.7 nm during the exfoliation process. Thus, the 1T&#8208;phase disulfide quantum sheets show high electrocatalytic activities for lithium polysulfides, achieving a good rate performance of 744 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C and a long cycle stability in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Reduction of Nonradiative Recombination at Perovskite/C60 Interface in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adopting a bimolecular synergistic passivation strategy, it is feasible to achieve micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;structural modulation of the perovskite surface, thereby passivating surface defects, regulating interface energy levels, and enhancing the interface electric field. This approach maximizes the reduction of nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface and demonstrates universal applicability across perovskite/C60 interfaces with different bandgaps.








Abstract
Although p&#8208;i&#8208;n type inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve excellent photoelectric efficiencies, the nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface is still the key factor affecting the overall efficiency of p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs. Herein, a synergistic passivation strategy (meta&#8208;fluoro&#8208;phenylethylammonium iodide and piperazine iodide) is developed to modify the perovskite/C60 interface in p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs. This strategy facilitates in situ reconstruction of the perovskite film to obtain a smooth and flat perovskite surface. Furthermore, the two molecules work synergistically to passivate surface defects, adjust the interface energy levels, and bolster the interface electric field, all of which reduce the nonradiative recombination losses at the perovskite/C60 interface. The optimal PSCs adopting this strategy achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.85%. (certified value of 25.22%). After operating at the maximum power point for 1000 h, the 95% initial efficiency can be maintained. Furthermore, this process is universally applicable and scalable.

         <title>Minimizing Buried Interface Energy Losses with Post&#8208;Assembled Chelating Molecular Bridges for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chelating molecule (CB&#8208;PA) serves as both a top&#8208;interface molecular bridge and a void&#8208;filler to improve the buried interface quality and promote carrier extraction, leading to a high efficiency of 25.27% and superior stability for inverted MA&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole&#8208;collecting materials have made remarkable progress in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the incomplete coverage of SAMs and the non&#8208;intimate interface contact between perovskite/SAMs usually cause inferior interface characteristics and significant energy losses at the heterojunction interface. Herein, a post&#8208;assembled chelating molecular bridge strategy using 5&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)isophthalicacid (CB&#8208;PA) is developed to modify the perovskite/SAMs buried interface. It is found that CB&#8208;PA can be chemically coupled with MeO&#8208;2PACz through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between carbazole groups, and chelate with perovskite by forming double C&#9552;O&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb bonds, thus constructing a bridge&#8208;connected interface to promote carrier extraction. Simultaneously, the post&#8208;assembled CB&#8208;PA can fill the voids of MeO&#8208;2PACz to form dense hybrid SAMs, resulting in uniform surface potential and improved interface contact. Moreover, CB&#8208;PA treatment also tends to induce the oriented crystallization of perovskite films, passivate interface defects, and release lattice stress at the buried interface. Consequently, the CB&#8208;PA&#8208;based inverted PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 25.27% with superior operational stability, retaining &#8776;94% of their initial efficiency after maximum power point (MPP) tracking (65&#160;&#176;C) for 1000 h with ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I protocol. This work provides an innovative strategy to address the buried interface challenges for high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs.

         <title>Crack&#8208;Resistant and Self&#8208;Healable Passive Radiative Cooling Silicone Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the impact of crack damage on passive radiative cooling and introduces a self&#8208;healing, crack&#8208;resistant radiative cooling silicone/boron nitride compound, developed through the synthesis of a dynamic and crack&#8208;resistant polymer/dielectric hydrogen bond network. This approach makes the material self&#8208;heal cracks from micrometers to millimeters wide and can prevent further crack propagation under stress through crack blunting and deflection.








Abstract
Crack damage and expansion are prevalent issues in outdoor materials, which absorb or transmit sunlight to damaged areas, substantially impairing the functionality of passive radiative cooling systems. Herein, a silicone/dielectric radiative cooling compound is introduced that is both self&#8208;healing and crack&#8208;resistant, developed through the synthesis of a dynamic and crack&#8208;resistant polymer/dielectric hydrogen bond network. This network incorporates boron nitride dielectrics, which serve as sunlight scatterers and hydrogen bond acceptors, with customized silicone polymer featuring high atmospheric window emissive chain segments and UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR transparent hydrogen bond moieties. When cracks form, the polymer's chain mobility allows the hydrogen bond moieties in boron nitride and silicone to re&#8208;associate, realizing self&#8208;healing of cracks from micrometers to millimeters wide and restoring cooling performance to &#8776;100%. The combination of rigid boron nitride and sacrificial hydrogen bonds in polymer also enhances the materials&#8217; fracture energy to 865%, effectively preventing further crack propagation under stress through autonomous crack blunting and deflection. These remarkable characteristics make this radiative cooling compound highly suited for increasingly complex, dynamic, and prolonged outdoor application environments.

         <title>Strong and Tough Water&#8208;Tolerant Conductive Eutectogels with Phase&#8208;Separated Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Dual Ionic Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eutectogel (PSDIC&#8208;gel) with exceptional integrative properties is successfully developed by blending hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymerizable deep eutectic solvents, in which spontaneously forming dual ionic channels through in situ polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation. The transparent PSDIC&#8208;gel exhibits remarkable tensile strength, high toughness, excellent ionic conductivity, improved water tolerance, and rapid room temperature self&#8208;healing ability, thus, has wide application prospects in wearable electronics.








Abstract
Eutectogels are emerging as the next&#8208;generation stretchable electronics due to their superior ionic conductivity, non&#8208;volatility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, most eutectogels suffer from weak mechanical strength and toughness and pronounced hygroscopicity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to fabricate phase&#8208;separated eutectogels with dual ionic channels (PSDIC&#8208;gel), which exhibit exceptional integrative properties, especially water resistance. By blending hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymerizable deep eutectic solvents, dual ionic channels spontaneously form via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation. The hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) phase containing Li+&#8208;channels, rich in hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;dipole interactions, provides mechanical strength and conductivity. The hydrophobic poly(hexafluorobutyl acrylate) (PHFBA) phase incorporating cholinium cation (Ch+) channels enhances toughness, conductivity, and water resistance. Adjusting the phase ratio yields a microphase&#8208;separated transparent eutectogel with high tensile strength (6.03&#160;MPa), toughness (16.18&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), excellent ionic conductivity (1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S&#160;m&#8722;1), strong substrate adhesion, and rapid room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing. Solid&#8208;state NMR reveals the conductive mechanism and the phase&#8208;separated structure featuring dual ionic channels in PSDIC&#8208;gels, advancing the understanding of complex ionic interactions at the atomic level. The PSDIC&#8208;gel enables a flexible triboelectric nanogenerator for accurate real&#8208;time self&#8208;powered human motion sensing. This work advances eutectogel design through structure&#8208;property engineering, offering a universal strategy to reconcile mechanical robustness, environmental suitability, and ionic conductivity for wearable electronics.

         <title>Highly Bright Pure Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Circularly Polarized Organic Hyperafterglow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is proposed for achieving highly bright and narrowband organic hyperafterglow by isolating conjugated energy donor with circularly polarized luminescence and energy acceptor with multi&#8208;resonance effect into a rigid host. Efficient energy and chirality transfers afford multi&#8208;color hyperafterglow with photoluminescence efficiency of&#8776;90%, full&#8208;width at half maxima of 31&#8211;39 nm, lifetime of 120&#8211;770 ms, and luminescent dissymmetry of&#8776;10&#8722;3.








Abstract
Pure room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) promises great advantages in both exciton utilization and lifetime manipulation over existing organic luminophores for a variety of emerging applications, but the low brightness, low efficiency, and low color purity constrain the afterglow luminescence significantly. Here, a promising approach to design highly bright, efficient, and narrowband pRTP with long&#8208;lifetime for organic hyperafterglow is proposed by isolating a conjugated energy donor with circularly polarized (CP) luminescence and energy acceptor with multi&#8208;resonance effect into a rigid host. It is shown that the aggregation of chiral P&#8208;containing binaphthyl promotes the generation of CP&#8208;pRTP and afterglow with high brightness up to &#8776;50&#160;cd m&#8722;2, while the simultaneous energy transfer and chirality transfer afford multi&#8208;color organic hyperafterglow with photoluminescence efficiency of &#8776;90%, full&#8208;width at half maxima of 31&#8211;39&#160;nm, lifetime of 120&#8211;770&#160;ms, and luminescent dissymmetry of &#8776;10&#8722;3. Also, excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, organic solvents, and aqueous solutions of strong acids and bases are observed. With these advantages, applications of chirality information encryption, afterglow grayscale imaging, and 3D high&#8208;resolution afterglow models are realized, promoting significantly the fundamental understandings on the modulation of organic afterglow brightness and construction of high&#8208;performance pRTP materials with advanced photophysical properties and applications.

         <title>Benchmarking Corrosion with Anionic Polarity Index for Stable and Fast Aqueous Batteries Even in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since the water&#8208;induced corrosion in aqueous electrolytes, including spontaneous chemical and electrochemical hydrogen evolution corrosion, will have a very adverse impact on the lifespan and rate performance of aqueous batteries. Through theoretical simulation, a strategy of anionic polarity index is proposed to resist corrosion by manipulating interfacial and solvated water simultaneously, thus realizing stable and fast Zn aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Despite aqueous electrolyte endowing batteries with the merits of safe operation, low&#8208;cost fabrication, and high ionic conductivity, water&#8208;induced corrosion, including spontaneous chemical and electrochemical hydrogen evolution corrosion, adversely affects lifespan and rate capability. There is still a lack of selection criteria for benchmarking corrosion behavior qualitatively. Through theoretical simulation, an anionic polarity index (API) tactic is proposed to resist corrosion by manipulating interfacial and solvated water concomitantly, thus realizing stable and fast Zn aqueous batteries (ZABs). As proof of concept, a low&#8208;cost zinc salt of 0.5 m zinc bis(4&#8208;hydroxybenzenesulphonate) (Zn(HBS)2) with low&#8208;API anion is prioritized. Combined in situ spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses reveal that, even in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte, the low&#8208;API anion reduces interfacial water in the inner Helmholtz plane, shielding the chemical water dissociation. Meanwhile, their entering into the solvation sheath of Zn2+ lowers the solvent&#8208;separated ion pair, suppressing the electrochemical corrosion. The elaborated API&#8208;screened zinc salt endows fast plating kinetics of 50 mA cm&#8722;2 (119.1 mV polarization), high coulombic efficiency of 99.8%, dendrite&#8208;free cycling over 1600 h, and prolonged lifespan over 5000 cycles for the Zn&#8208;V cell. The results provide new metrics that can benchmark the success of ZABs for large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Molecular Weight Engineering Modulates Lignin&#8208;Metal Supramolecular Framework to Construct Carbon&#8208;Coated CoRu Alloy for Effective Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoRu&#8208;based alloy catalysts are synthesized via a Lignin&#8208;Metal supramolecular framework by molecular weight engineering. Lignin with low molecular weight formed graphitic carbon layers with high defect density, resulting in excellent activity but limited stability. While lignin with high molecular weight produced amorphous carbon layers that enhanced durability. In&#8208;situ Raman and DFT indicate that defect density controls electron transport and intermediate adsorption.








Abstract
To overcome the challenges of low catalytic activity and instability, a molecular weight engineering strategy coupled with oxidative ammonolysis is developed to synthesize CoRu&#8208;based alloy catalysts with distinct morphologies and properties from biorefinery lignin. This approach effectively modulates intrinsic active sites and exposes unsaturated nitrogen&#8208;oxygen structures, thereby tailoring the morphology and defect structure of the carbon layers in the catalysts. The as&#8208;synthesized CoRu alloy catalysts from lignin precursors with varying molecular weights are designated as CoRu@OALC&#8208;EtOAC, CoRu@OALC&#8208;EtOH, and CoRu@OALC&#8208;Residual. CoRu@OALC&#8208;EtOAC, featuring a defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon&#8208;coated CoRu alloy structure, exhibited exceptional overall water&#8208;splitting performance (1.48 V at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), significantly surpassing Pt/C || Ru/C (1.58 V at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). In contrast, CoRu@OALC&#8208;Residual, with its amorphous carbon&#8208;coated CoRu alloy structure, demonstrated remarkable stability (350 h at 100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), vastly outperforming Pt/C || Ru/C (6 h at 100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations revealed that the defect&#8208;rich carbon layers effectively adsorb *H intermediates, accelerating the catalytic process. This strong adsorption also induces carbon layer rearrangement, leading to its dissolution of the carbon layer and oxidation of CoRu metal particles. This strategy provides a universal method for biomass&#8208;derived catalysts, establishing a direct relationship between molecular weight, catalyst morphology, and electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Targeted High&#8208;Resolution 3D Imaging of Tumor Vasculatures at Different Stages Using Far&#8208;Red AIE Nanoparticles Compatible with Tissue Clearing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an imaging technology for precise mapping and analysis of lung tumor vasculature at different stages using HA@TANP, a supramolecular assembly of far&#8208;red fluorescence nanoparticles with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), compatible with tissue optical clearing (TOC). The advanced imaging technique reveals significant insights into tumor vascular dynamics, offering valuable implications for cancer diagnosis and therapy.








Abstract
The occurrence and progression of blood vessels plays a pivotal role in different stages of tumor development, while current imaging techniques exhibit limited sensitivity to capture the dynamic changes of vasculature at different tumor stages. This drawback hinders the comprehensive understanding of the tumor microenvironment, thereby impeding the development of efficacious therapeutic strategies. Herein, a high&#8208;resolution three&#8208;dimensional (3D) imaging technology is developed for mapping and analyzing vasculatures at different tumor stages using HA@TANP, a supramolecular assembly of far&#8208;red fluorescence nanoparticles with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), compatible with tissue clearing. The hyaluronic acid (HA) in HA@TANP specifically targets CD44 antigen of tumor vasculature, while the acrylic acid in HA@TANP is applied for temperature&#8208;induced polymerization to ensure the covalent attachment of AIE fluorophores. Additionally, tissue optical clearing technology boosts light penetration and imaging resolution in dense tumor tissues. This strategy allows for the quantitative analyses of vascular diameter, length, and straightness and their correlation with various responses to treatments. The findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of distinct tumor vascular stages, providing valuable insights for enhanced cancer diagnosis and therapies from a tumor vascular&#8208;targeted perspective.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Multicompartment Photonic Pigments: Unlocking Non&#8208;Iridescent Pure RGB Structural Colors for Versatile Chromatic Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research presents a novel class of multicompartment photonic pigments derived from vegetable oils, leveraging biodegradable bottlebrush block copolymers to effectively mitigate Ostwald ripening in complex emulsion systems. Through the development of an innovative structural model, non&#8208;iridescent pure red hues are achieved in photonic glass, enabling unprecedented versatility in chromatic engineering via an RGB three&#8208;primary color mixing strategy.








Abstract
Non&#8208;iridescent photonic glass pigments of block copolymers show great potential for sustainable structural coloration. However, the ability to create accurate RGB color mixtures for real&#8208;world applications is limited by the prevalent use of non&#8208;degradable, fossil oil&#8208;derived components and the difficulty in achieving pure red hues. This work presents an alternative strategy for achieving more sustainable structural coloration by fabricating composite photonic pigments through controlled self&#8208;assembly of water, vegetable oil, and biodegradable bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) in a complex emulsion system. The obtained photonic balls feature unprecedented multicompartment structures characterized by a short&#8208;range ordered assembly of water nanodroplets stabilized by the BBCPs, along with oil droplets stabilized by these nanodroplets, which substantially enhances resistance to Ostwald ripening. Furthermore, a new structural model is introduced to eliminate disordered scattering, successfully creating a pure red structural color and overcoming a long&#8208;standing limitation in versatile chromatic engineering.

A novel single&#8208;atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3&#8722;&#948; (BCF) perovskite, develope via a scalable solid&#8208;state approach, forms a distinctive 4&#8208;coordinate Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Fe configuration that induces reverse hydrogen spillover and promotes proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction. The optimized 2Ru&#8208;BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode based fuel cell delivers an excellent peak power density of 1.78 W cm&#8722;2 at 700&#160;&#176;C with stable operation for 200 h.









Abstract
Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) offer a promising avenue for sustainable energy conversion, however, their commercial potential is hindered by sluggish proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction reaction (P&#8208;ORR) kinetics and inadequate durability of cathode materials. Here, a novel single&#8208;atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3&#8722;&#948; (BCF) perovskite, synthesized by a facile and scalable solid&#8208;state approach, as a potential cathode for PCFCs is reported. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the single&#8208;atom Ru on BCF, characterized by a unique 4&#8208;coordinate Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Fe configuration, not only induces reverse hydrogen spillover but also acts as an active site for P&#8208;ORR. The application of the optimized 2Ru&#8208;BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode in a single cell delivers an exceptional peak power density of 1.78 W cm&#8722;2 at 700&#160;&#176;C, along with excellent operational stability over 200 h. These findings provide new insights into single&#8208;atom engineering, advancing the commercial viability of PCFCs.

         <title>Universal Prophylactic Antitumor Vaccination Using Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Induced pluripotent stem cell membrane is coated onto adjuvant&#8208;loaded nanoparticle cores to create a universal cancer vaccine. The formulation utilizes oncofetal antigens present on the cell membrane to elicit broadly protective immune responses in vivo. The enhanced immunity generated by the nanovaccine enables robust prophylactic efficacy against multiple murine tumor models.








Abstract
Cancer vaccines are a promising immunotherapeutic modality that function by training the immune system to recognize and destroy malignant cells. As tumor&#8208;specific and tumor&#8208;associated antigens generally cannot be identified until after a tumor has already been established, these vaccines must be applied therapeutically when strong immunosuppressive mechanisms are already in place. Building upon previous work using cell membrane coating nanotechnology, the development of a broad&#8208;spectrum prophylactic cancer nanovaccine that consists of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) membrane coated around an adjuvant&#8208;loaded nanoparticle core is shown. The resulting nanostructure is capable of presenting iPSC&#8208;derived oncofetal antigens, which are oftentimes re&#8208;expressed on cancer cells but lowly present on normal adult tissues. When administered in vivo, the iPSC membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles are highly immunostimulatory and elicit strong antitumor immunity that can successfully inhibit the growth of multiple tumor types, including five different murine tumor models and in a bilaterial heterogeneous tumor model. Overall, this work demonstrates an effective approach for engineering iPSC&#8208;based nanovaccines that can be applied broadly to prevent cancer before it occurs.

         <title>Molecular Design of Dimeric Acceptor Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.78% Efficiency and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By optimizing building blocks and linking modes, a dimeric acceptor, named DY&#8208;FL, is innovatively designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the efficient molecular design strategy, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based binary OSCs rendered an efficiency of 19.78%. Importantly, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based devices showcased significantly enhanced photo/thermal stability in comparison to small molecule acceptor&#8208;based OSCs.








Abstract
The development of organic solar cells (OSCs) with high efficiency and stability is highly desirable to facilitate its commercial applications. Although dimeric acceptors with distinctive advantages have been widely studied, high&#8208;performance binary OSCs based on such molecules have rarely been achieved. In this work, a new dimeric acceptor (DY&#8208;FL) is constructed by simultaneously optimizing the linking sites and units, as well as the building blocks. Thanks to the effective molecular design, DY&#8208;FL provides improved molecular stacking for fibrous morphology with favorable exciton/charge dynamics. Consequently, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based binary OSCs render a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.78%, representing a record&#8208;breaking efficiency for binary OSCs based on dimeric acceptors. Importantly, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based devices display significantly enhanced operational stability under external stimuli such as light and heat, in comparison to their small molecule acceptor (Y&#8208;F)&#8208;based counterpart. These findings highlight the significance of building blocks and linking modes, providing insight into the effective molecular design strategy of dimeric acceptors for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs.

         <title>Monomolecule Coupled to Oxygen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt phthalocyanine molecule&#8208;modified oxygen&#8208;doped carbon catalyst achieves superior oxygen reduction with two&#8208;electron selectivity of 99% and hydrogen peroxide yield of 10.4 mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. The modulation of the electronic structure of active sites through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking&#8208;mediated oxygen doping optimizes the interaction between active sites and intermediate *OOH.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an ideal alternative for the industrial anthraquinone process because of environmental friendliness and energy efficiency, depending on the activity and selectivity of catalysts. Carbon&#8208;based materials possess prospects as candidate catalysts for the production of H2O2. Herein, cedar&#8208;derived monolithic carbon catalysts modified with coupling oxygen doping and phthalocyanine molecules are synthesized. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)&#160;molecules are introduced onto the carbon surface to construct monomolecular active sites via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. The electronic structure of CoPc is modulated by oxygen doping on carbon substrates, mediated by monomolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. A synergistic effect optimally modulated the interaction between CoPc and key intermediate to H2O2. The energy barrier for oxygen reduction is reduced to optimize the selectivity to H2O2. CoPc@OCW provided up to 99% selectivity to H2O2 at 0.7&#160;V versus RHE. In a three&#8208;phase flow cell, CoPc@OCW achieved an H2O2 yield up to 10.4 mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;V versus RHE with stable running for 24 h. The advantages of carbon&#8208;based catalysts including the adjustable chemical structure depending on &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and electronic structure of carbon atoms through oxygen doping improved the catalytic performances in the production of H2O2. This proof&#8208;to&#8208;concept research demonstrates the potential application of carbon&#8208;based molecular catalysts for electrochemical synthesis.

         <title>Industrial&#8208;current Ammonia Synthesis by Polarized Cuprous Cyanamide Coupled to Valorization of Glycerol at 4,000 mA cm&#8722;2</title>

         <dc:description>
This work presents a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system featuring Cu2NCN as an efficient nitrate reduction (NO3RR) electrocatalyst, coupled with glycerol oxidation for low&#8208;voltage, industrial&#8208;level NH3 production. Achieving 4000 mA cm&#8722;2 at 2.52 V with sustained stability at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 over 100 h, the system offers 83% Faradaic efficiency, with theoretical insights on NO&#8323;* adsorption and O&#8211;N bond cleavage.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO3RR) holds significance in both NH3 synthesis and nitrate contamination remediation. However, achieving industrial&#8208;scale current and high stability in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer remains challenging due to inherent high full&#8208;cell voltage for sluggish NO3RR and water oxidation. Here, Cu2NCN with positive surface electrostatic potential VS(r) is applied as highly efficient NO3RR electrocatalysts to achieve industrial&#8208;current and low&#8208;voltage stable NH3 production in MEA electrolyzer with coupled anodic glycerol oxidation. This paired electro&#8208;refinery (PER) system reaches 4000 mA cm&#8722;2 at 2.52 V and remains stable at industrial&#8208;level 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 for 100 h with the NH3 production rate of 97000 &#181;gNH3 h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 83%. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the asymmetric and electron&#8208;withdrawing [N&#8722;C&#8801;N] units enhance polarization and VS(r), promoting robust and asymmetric adsorption of NO3* on Cu2NCN to facilitate O&#8722;N bond dissociation. A comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis demonstrates the profitability and commercial viability of this coupled system. Our work opens a new avenue and marks a significant advancement in MEA systems for industrial NH3 synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system featuring Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NCN as an efficient nitrate reduction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR) electrocatalyst, coupled with glycerol oxidation for low-voltage, industrial-level NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production.

&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR) holds significance in both NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis and nitrate contamination remediation.

         <title>Lithiophilic&#8208;Gradient, Li+ Supplementary Interphase Design for Lean Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High energy/power density batteries have become an urgent need for the electric vehicle and consumer electronics markets. In this work, Cheng et&#160;al. develop an lean lithium metal batteries (LLMB) prototype with lithiophilic&#8208;gradient, layer&#8208;stacked interfacial design and self&#8208;supplementary Li sources for bare Cu foil. It provides a new perspective for the optimization strategy for next generation lithium metal batteries (LMBs).








Abstract
The practicability of anode&#8208;less/free lithiummetal batteries (LMBs) is impeded by unregulated dendrite formation on thedeposition substrate. Herein, this study presents a lithiophilic&#8208;gradient, layer&#8208;stacked interfacial design for the lean lithium metal battery (LLMB) model. Engineered via a facile wet&#8208;chemistry approach, the high entropy metalphosphide (HEMP) particles with tunable lithiophilic species are dispersedwithin reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Moreover, a poly (vinylidene fluoride co&#8208;hexafluoropropylenepolymer) (PVDF&#8208;HFP), blended with molten Li at the tailorable amounts, forms aLi supplementary top layer through a layer&#8208;transfer printing technique. Theintegrated layer (HEMP@RGO&#8208;MTL@PH) not only regulates the dendrite&#8208;free lithiumdeposition towards the Cu substrate up to 10 mAh cm&#8722;2, but also maintains robust cyclability of the symmetric cell at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 even under 83% depth of discharge. As pairing the modified Cu foil with the LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode (NCM811, 16.9 mg cm&#8722;2, double sided, N/P ratio of 0.21) in the 200 mAh pouch cell, achieves gravimetric energy densities of 414.7 Wh kg&#8722;1, power output of 977.1 W kg&#8722;1, as well as highly reversible phasic evolutionmonitored in operando. This gradient interfacial strategy can promotethe commercialization of energy/power&#8208;dense energy storage solutions.

         <title>Toward Intrinsically Stretchable OLEDs with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>

This perspective provides a systematic discussion on the challenges and solutions in designing materials for intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs). It also highlights prospective challenges and offers insights into the development of highly efficient and stable ISOLEDs for practical applications.








Abstract
Wearable electronics require stretchable displays that can withstand large and repeated mechanical deformation without failure. Intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) that operate under DC voltage provide promising candidates for wearable display applications. However, the lack of sophisticated stretchable materials and processing techniques suitable for ISOLEDs results in a significant deficit in the efficiency of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ISOLEDs compared to industrial standards. The design of stretchable conducting and semiconducting materials poses a significant challenge because of trade&#8208;off relationships between stretchability and properties such as conductivity and charge carrier mobility. To increase the efficiency of ISOLEDs to meet industrial standards, strategies to overcome these trade&#8208;offs must be developed. This perspective discusses recent progress and challenges in designing stretchable electrodes, light&#8208;emitting materials, transport materials, and potential applications of ISOLEDs. It&#160;provides a useful guide in this field to develop efficient ISOLEDs for system&#8208;level integration.

Atomic&#8208;Scale Polarization
In article number 2420510, Walid A. Daoud and colleagues report an atomic&#8208;scale polarization&#8208;functionalized Mn3O4&#8208;based catalyst for vanadium redox flow battery, where the role of vacancy&#8208;induced local polarization on vanadium redox reactions is investigated. The findings shed light on the fundamental rules governing the utility and evolution of vacancies in transition metal oxide electrocatalysts, thereby moving a step closer toward their deployment in a wide range of sustainable energy storage schemes.

Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic MXenes
This cross&#8208;sectional STEM image captures the wave&#8208;like rippling observed in an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid 2D MXene. Here, these ripples, often referred to as Ripplocations, are formed when the organic surface groups are exposed to the electron beam. Ripplocations are a fundamental defect in layered materials and may play a key role in how the material responds to stress and external conditions. More details can be found in article number 2411669 by Francisco Lagunas, Robert F. Klie, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Pioneering the Future: Principles, Advances, and Challenges in Organic Electrodes for Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the numerous advantages of ammonium&#8208;ion (NH&#8324;&#8314;)&#8212;including cost&#8208;effectiveness, low corrosiveness, preferential orientation, and rapid diffusion kinetics&#8212;aqueous NH&#8324;&#8314; batteries (AAIBs) have gained significant attention. This review highlights and evaluates the progress of AAIBs utilizing organic electrode materials such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks, and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials, with the goal of advancing cutting&#8208;edge aqueous energy storage systems.








Abstract
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIBs) have recently been considered as attractive alternatives for next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage systems, on account of their cost&#8208;effectiveness, nonflammability, less corrosive, small hydrated ionic radius, and rapid NH4+ diffusion kinetics. In addition, the tetrahedral structure of NH4+ exhibits preferential orientation characteristics, resulting in a different electrochemical storage mechanism from spherical charge carriers such as Li+, Na+, and K+. Therefore, unlocking the NH4+&#8208;ion storage mechanisms in host electrode materials is pivotal to advancing the design of high&#8208;performance AAIBs. Organic materials, with their customizable, flexible, and stable molecular structures, along with their ease of recycling and disposal, offer tremendous potential. However, the development of cutting&#8208;edge organic electrode materials specifically for ammonium&#8208;ion storage in AAIBs remains an exciting, yet largely untapped, frontier. This review systematically explores the interaction mechanisms between NH4+ ions and organic electrode materials, such as electrostatic interactions including hydrogen bonding. It also highlights the application of diverse organic electrode materials, such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids in AAIBs. Lastly, the review addresses the key challenges and future perspectives of organic&#8208;material&#8208;based AAIBs, aiming to push the boundaries of cutting&#8208;edge aqueous energy storage systems.

         <title>The Influence of Ionizing Radiation on Quantification for In Situ and Operando Liquid&#8208;Phase Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy enables visualization of nanoscale processes involving liquid media. Yet, it suffers from beam effects, such as radiolysis of the liquid, sample heating, and membrane charging. This review summarizes beam effect fundamentals, describes modeling and assessment, and illustrates handling strategies. The findings are transferable to other ionizing radiation techniques using, for example,&#160;&#947;&#8208; or X&#8208;rays.








Abstract
The ionizing radiation harnessed in electron microscopes or synchrotrons enables unique insights into nanoscale dynamics. In liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;TEM), irradiating a liquid sample with electrons offers access to real space information at an unmatched combination of temporal and spatial resolution. However, employing ionizing radiation for imaging can alter the Gibbs free energy landscape during the experiment. This is mainly due to radiolysis and the corresponding shift in chemical potential; however, experiments can also be affected by irradiation&#8208;induced charging and heating. In this review, the state of the art in describing beam effects is summarized, theoretical and experimental assessment guidelines are provided, and strategies to obtain quantitative information under such conditions are discussed. While this review showcases these effects on LP&#8208;TEM, the concepts that are discussed here can also be applied to other types of ionizing radiation used to probe liquid samples, such as synchrotron X&#8208;rays.

         <title>Eliminating Radioresistance With a Magnetic Ion&#8208;Generator by Simultaneously Augmenting DNA Damage and Diminishing Immunosuppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional medicine has encountered certain bottlenecks in dealing with radioresistance. To address this, a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; strategy based on the constructed radioresistance model is developed. This innovative magnetic ion&#8208;generator can not only release Fe2+ and Mn2+ ions to induce ferroptosis and activate the STING pathway, enhancing DNA damage synergistically with radiotherapy, but it can also modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment effectively, thereby reversing radioresistance.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) hinges on DNA damage&#8208;induced cancer cell death and the subsequent anti&#8208;tumor immunity. However, the efficacy of RT is curtailed by cell cycle heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which foster radioresistance. Here an ion generator&#8208;based RT enhancement strategy is demonstrated in a mouse model of the radioresistant tumor. The ion generator is degraded in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in iron&#8208;triggered ferroptosis that enhanced immunogenic cell death and a manganese&#8208;activated stimulator of interferon gene that reversed the immunosuppressive environment. As a result, the proposed strategy promotes dendritic cells maturity, augmentes CD8+ T cell infiltration of tumors, suppresses intratumoral myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and limits the M2 macrophages polarization, indicating the formation of an immunoreactive microenvironment. Significantly, this approach impedes the growth of not just primary, but also distal metastatic tumors. It is thus believed that the current ion generator provides a robust and enduring countermeasure to radioresistant cancer and its metastasis, with potential implications for enhancing the efficacy of RT in clinically resistant tumors.

         <title>Advanced 3D Food Printing with Simultaneous Cooking and Generative AI Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ heating solution for 3D food printing is developed by incorporating noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources during the printing process. This technique ensures food quality control and reduces microbial contamination. The AI&#8208;generated 3D food shape design allows users to create digital models using text input without prior computational skills.








Abstract
3D food printing is an indispensable technology for emerging food technologies. However, conventional nonconcurrent postprocessing methods limit the final food quality, including the unappealing nature of food ink modification, imperfections in retaining the desired food shape, and the risk of microbial contamination. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;enhanced solution is developed to achieve extrusion&#8208;based printing with simultaneous infrared heating, enabling in&#8208;line and rapid cooking of complex starch&#8208;based food. Noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources present outstanding food quality control with microbial studies, microstructure analysis, and heat transfer simulation models. This integrative 3D food printing method with AI&#8208;enhanced food pattern generation and in&#8208;situ cooking significantly expands the applications for customized food creation. It paves the way for the broader adoption of heating&#8208;based 3D printing of functional materials.

         <title>Multi&#8208;material Volumetric Bioprinting and Plug&#8208;and&#8208;play Suspension Bath Biofabrication via Bioresin Molecular Weight Tuning and via Multiwavelength Alignment Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimaterial volumetric and embedded extrusion bioprinting of complex cell&#8208;laden architectures is enabled by unravelling the interplay between molecular weight and degree of functionalization in gelatin&#8208;based bioresins. Tomographic light&#8208;responsive support baths for suspended printing can be easily generated from single component materials. Molecular weight tuning produces a library of printable hydrogels matching the viscoleasticity properties of native tissues, influencing cell self&#8208;organization.








Abstract
Volumetric Bioprinting (VBP), enables to rapidly build complex, cell&#8208;laden hydrogel constructs for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Light&#8208;based tomographic manufacturing enables spatial&#8208;selective polymerization of a bioresin, resulting in higher throughput and resolution than what is achieved using traditional techniques. However, methods for multi&#8208;material printing are needed for broad VBP adoption and applicability. Although converging VBP with extrusion bioprinting in support baths offers a novel, promising solution, further knowledge on the engineering of hydrogels as light&#8208;responsive, volumetrically printable baths is needed. Therefore, this study investigates the tuning of gelatin macromers, in particular leveraging the effect of molecular weight and degree of modification, to overcome these challenges, creating a library of materials for VBP and Embedded extrusion Volumetric Printing (EmVP). Bioresins with tunable printability and mechanical properties are produced, and a novel subset of gelatins and GelMA exhibiting stable shear&#8208;yielding behavior offers a new, single&#8208;component, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use suspension medium for in&#8208;bath printing, which is stable over multiple hours without needing temperature control. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biological application, bioprinted gels are tested with insulin&#8208;producing pancreatic cell lines for 21 days of culture. Leveraging a multi&#8208;color printer, complex multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular geometries are produced, enhancing the accessibility of volumetric printing for advanced tissue models.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Ripplocations in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid MXenes (h&#8208;MXenes) are a family of 2D&#160;transition metal carbides with amino surface groups that exhibit interesting optical properties. The sensitivity of the organic material under high&#8208;energy electron beams complicates conventional TEM analysis. Using cryogenic STEM, we show h&#8208;MXenes are stable until a critical dose threshold. Beyond that threshold, the in situ generation of ripplocations is observed.









Abstract
Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid MXenes (h&#8208;MXenes) are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides functionalized with alkylimido and alkylamido surface groups. Using cryogenic and room temperature scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS), it is shown that ripplocations, a form of a fundamental defect in 2D and layered structures, are abundant in this family of materials. Furthermore, detailed studies of electron probe sample interactions, focusing on structural deformations caused by the electron beam are presented. The findings indicate that at cryogenic temperatures (&#8776;100&#160;K) and below a specific dose threshold, the structure of h&#8208;MXenes remains largely intact. However, exceeding this threshold leads to electron beam&#8208;induced deformation through ripplocations. Interestingly, the deformation behavior, required dose, and resultant structure are highly dependent on temperature. At 100&#160;K, it is demonstrated that the electron beam can induce ripplocations in situ with a high degree of precision.

&lt;p&gt;Hybrid MXenes (h-MXenes) are a family of 2D&#160;transition metal carbides with amino surface groups that exhibit interesting optical properties. The sensitivity of the organic material under high-energy electron beams complicates conventional TEM analysis. Using cryogenic STEM, we show h-MXenes are stable until a critical dose threshold. Beyond that threshold, the in situ generation of ripplocations is observed.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Oxygenating PROTAC Microneedle for Spatiotemporally&#8208;Confined Protein Degradation and Enhanced Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;oxygenating PROTAC microneedle (MN)&#160;is engineered to circumvent the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) and achieve spatiotemporally&#8208;confined bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 (BRD4) protein degradation. PPT7 NPs are swiftly released for rapid cellular uptake, confining the region of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and ARV771 production upon 671 nm laser irradiation. BM NPs are continuously released for generating oxygen (O2) to alleviate tumor hypoxia. This PROTAC&#8208;delivered MN significantly inhibits&#160;tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM tumor models.









Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive subtype of primary brain tumors, which marginally respond&#160;to standard chemotherapy due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and the low tumor specificity of the therapeutics. Herein, a double&#8208;layered microneedle (MN) patch is rationally engineered by integrating acid and light dual&#8208;activatable PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) nanoparticles and self&#8208;oxygenating BSA&#8208;MnO2 (BM) nanoparticles for GBM treatment. The MN is administrated at the tumor site to locally deliver the PROTAC prodrug and BM nanoparticles. The PROTAC nanoparticles are rapidly released from the outer layer of the MN and specifically activated in the acidic intracellular environment of tumor cells. Subsequently, near&#8208;infrared light activates the photosensitizer to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) through photodynamic therapy (PDT), thereby triggering spatiotemporally&#8208;tunable degradation of bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 (BRD4). The BM nanoparticles, in the inner layer of the MN, serve as an oxygen supply station, and counteracts tumor hypoxia by converting hydrogen peroxide&#160;(H2O2) into oxygen (O2), thus promoting PDT and PROTAC activation. This PROTAC prodrug&#8208;integrated MN significantly inhibits tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM tumor models. This study describes the first spatiotemporally&#8208;tunable protein degradation strategy for highly efficient GBM therapy, potentially advancing precise therapy of other kinds of refractory brain tumors.

         <title>Polyamine&#8208;Depleting Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Organic Frameworks Unleash Dendritic Cell and T Cell Vigor for Targeted CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic&#8208;assisted hydrogen&#8208;bond organic framework (HOF) nanoplatforms depletes polyamines in the tumor microenvironment, reversing T&#8208;cell immunosuppression and enhancing dendritic cell activity. By releasing CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 and inducing neoantigen generation via carbonyl stress and mutational burden elevation, this system enables precision cancer immunotherapy through dual&#8208;action mechanisms targeting both immune vigor and tumor vulnerability.








Abstract
Polyamines have tantalized cancer researchers as a potential means to rein in the rampant growth of cancer cells. However, clinical trials in recent decades have disappointed in delivering notable progress. Herein, a microfluidic&#8208;assisted synthetic hydrogen&#8208;bond organic framework (HOF) as a polyamine&#8208;depleting nanoplatforms designed to unleash the vigor of both dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells for precision cancer immunotherapy is reported. Upon internalization by tumor cells, the loaded plasma amine oxidase (PAO) in HOF efficiently depletes polyamines, remolding the tumor microenvironment and alleviating T&#8208;cell immunosuppression. This process also generates acrolein and H2O2, triggering CRISPR&#8208;assisted neoantigen generation. Specifically, Acrolein induces carbonyl stress, increasing mutational burdens. Simultaneously, HOF leverages the energy from the bis[2,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate (CPPO)&#8208;H2O2 reaction for CRET&#8208;triggered singlet oxygen production, leading to thioether bond cleavage and release CRISPR&#8208;Cas9. Once released, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 knocks out the DNA mismatch repair (MMR)&#8208;related MLH1 gene, further elevating mutational burdens and generating neoantigens, ideal targets for DCs. This dual&#8208;action strategy not only corrects T&#8208;cell immunosuppression but also enhances DC efficacy, presenting a powerful approach for tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Hyperspectral Metachip&#8208;Based 3D Spatial Map for Cancer Cell Screening and Quantification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D spatial map for human cancer cells is developed using the designed multiplexed THz metachip with superior Q factors and sensitivity. This method for screening and quantifying cancer cells based on such a 3D spatial map has been experimentally validated to achieve high accuracies (93.33%) under several selected cancer cells from different parts of the human body.








Abstract
In this paper, compact terahertz (THz) metachips for hyperspectral screening and quantitative evaluation of human cancer cells is reported. This pixelated resonant metachips feature the resonance channel from 1 and 3&#160;THz frequency with a record&#8208;high quality factor (up to 230). Through the interactions of various cancer cells of different concentrations, high&#8208;dimensional spectral signatures are obtained, which are further transformed into a spatial map for labelling and quantification purposes. The screening of up to 15 cancer cells is experimentally reported, with very high detecting accuracy of 93.33% and with attractive quantitative concentration sensitivity up to 1320&#160;kHz&#160;cell&#160;mL&#8722;1. This hyperspectral metachips are low&#8208;cost, highly compact, and label&#8208;free for fast, high&#8208;throughput and high&#8208;sensitivity detections and evaluation of human cancer cells. This technology does not require clinical experience, representing an accessible technology for early diagnosis of cancer.

         <title>Bioinspired Nanoscale 3D Printing of Calcium Phosphates Using Bone Prenucleation Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a bone&#8208;bioinspired photoresin containing PNCs of calcium phosphates, enabling nanoscale precision via 2pp. This novel approach allows for 2D patterning and 3D nanostructuring of CaPs with intricate geometries. The technique offers unparalleled control over scaffold design and porosity, paving the way for advanced applications in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Calcium phosphates (CaPs) are ubiquitous in biological structures, such as vertebrate bones and teeth, and have been widely used in biomedical applications. However, fabricating CaPs at the nanoscale in 3D has remained a significant challenge, particularly due to limitations in current nanofabrication techniques, such as two&#8208;photon polymerization (2pp), which are not applicable for creating CaP nanostructures. In this study, a novel approach is presented to 3D print CaP structures with unprecedented resolution of &#8776;300&#160;nm precision, achieving a level of detail three orders of magnitude finer than any existing additive manufacturing techniques for CaPs. This advancement is achieved by leveraging bioinspired chemistry, utilizing bone prenucleation nanoclusters (PNCs, average size of 5&#160;nm), within a photosensitive resin. These nanoclusters form a highly transparent photoresist, overcoming the light&#8208;scattering typically associated with larger calcium phosphate&#8208;based nanoparticles. This method not only allows for nanopatterning of CaPs on diverse substrates, but also enables the precise control of microstructure down to the level of submicron grains. The method paves the way for the developing of bioinspired metamaterials, lightweight damage&#8208;tolerant materials, cell&#8208;modulating interfaces, and precision&#8208;engineered coatings.

However, fabricating CaPs at the nanoscale in 3D has remained a significant challenge, particularly due to limitations in current nanofabrication techniques, such as two-photon polymerization (2pp), which are not applicable for creating CaP nanostructures. In this study, a novel approach is presented to 3D print CaP structures with unprecedented resolution of &#8776;300&#160;nm precision, achieving a level of detail three orders of magnitude finer than any existing additive manufacturing techniques for CaPs. This advancement is achieved by leveraging bioinspired chemistry, utilizing bone prenucleation nanoclusters (PNCs, average size of 5&#160;nm), within a photosensitive resin. These nanoclusters form a highly transparent photoresist, overcoming the light-scattering typically associated with larger calcium phosphate-based nanoparticles. This method not only allows for nanopatterning of CaPs on diverse substrates, but also enables the precise control of microstructure down to the level of submicron grains. The method paves the way for the developing of bioinspired metamaterials, lightweight damage-tolerant materials, cell-modulating interfaces, and precision-engineered coatings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Printing Multi&#8208;Layered Functional Devices Using One Stamp with Programmable Surface Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;layered printed electronics are generally fabricated by overprinting with multiple stamps. Herein, a novel printing approach is introduced by modifying stamp with patterned surface energy. This enables the fabrication of multiple functional layers using only one stamp. Using this method, the fabrication of flexible light&#8208;emitting devices and high&#8208;denstiy transistor array are demonstrated (with over 17,900 transistors on an 8&#8208;inch wafer).








Abstract
Beyond its role in cultural communication, printing technology has emerged as one of the most important approaches to distributing and patterning functional materials for advanced manufacturing. In a printing process, a stamp is employed to transfer functional inks to a target surface, generating a specific pattern that exactly replicates the stamp. Through precise manipulation of different inkdrops, herein, a &#8220;one stamp, diverse patterns&#8221; printing strategy is developed and achieves deposition of varied patterns utilizing a single stamp. This stamp features patterned surface energy, achieved through regioselective energy injection treatment of an ultralow surface energy solid. It is revealed that inks with different surface tensions&#160;can selectively exhibit Cassie or Wenzel state on the stamp to generate diverse ink distributions, which enables the printing of distinct patterns on target surfaces. Leveraging this approach, flexible light&#8208;emitting devices and high&#8208;density transistor array are successfully printed using single stamps. These findings advance the understanding of finely tuning and patterning surface energy for precise liquid manipulation and offer a leap forward in efficient and versatile printing methodology that will boost the innovative integration of functional materials in a simplified manner.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive H2S Composite System Regulates the Nerve Regeneration Microenvironment Through Multiple Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article designs and prepares a photo&#8208;responsive H2S composite nerve transplantation conduit using electrospinning technology and drug delivery system, combining aligned structure, RGD peptide, H2S, and Zn&#8208;CA MOFs. This system can not only achieve artificially controlled H2S release, but also slowly release Zn2+, achieving the joint regulation of Zn2+ and H2S in the nerve regeneration microenvironment.








Abstract
After injury, the imbalance of the regeneration microenvironment caused by inflammation, oxidative stress, insufficient neurovascularization, and inadequate energy supply affects nerve regeneration. Drug&#8208;delivery nerve conduits play a role in repairing the regenerative microenvironment. However, traditional drugs often fail to cross the blood&#8208;nerve barrier and lack multifunctionality, limiting the effectiveness of conduit therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a multifunctional conduit that regulate the regeneration microenvironment timely and effectively. Herein, a photo&#8208;responsive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) composite nerve conduit, artificially controlled H2S release, is developed. A new structure of zinc&#8208;citric acid organic metal framework (Zn&#8208;CA MOFs) is utilized to improve its drug loading rate, achieving the joint regulation of the nerve regeneration microenvironment by H2S and Zn2+. In addition, RGD modification of polyester amide (P(CL&#8208;MMD&#8208;MAC)&#8208;RGD)) combined with aligned structure is used to improve the performance of the conduit. Relevant results demonstrate that H2S and Zn2+ can regulate inflammatory response and oxidative stress and promote mitochondrial function recovery and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the aligned structure can promote cell adhesion and guide cell directed migration. Overall, this study provides a method of combining gas neurotransmitters with ions to improve the nerve regeneration microenvironment, accelerate nerve regeneration, and restore motor function.

         <title>An Integrated Virtual Screening Platform to Identify Potent Co&#8208;Assembled Nanodrugs for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uses ligand&#8208;based virtual screening&#160;(LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to construct a high&#8208;throughput screening platform, which can be used to identify small molecule combinations with potential co&#8208;assembly ability.








Abstract
Co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs provide significant advantages in cancer treatment and drug delivery, yet effective screening methods to identify molecular combinations for co&#8208;assembly are lacking. This study presents a screening strategy integrating ligand&#8208;based virtual screening (LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore new molecular combinations with co&#8208;assembly capabilities. The accuracy of this screening was validated by synthesizing various co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs under mild conditions. Vinpocetine (Vin) and lenvatinib (Len) are representative co&#8208;assembly combinations that can directly co&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. These NPs were further functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulting in PEG&#8208;L/V NPs that exhibited enhanced stability and biocompatibility. In addition, PEG&#8208;L/V NPs can respond to acidic conditions and release Vin and Len, working synergistically to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro while also inhibiting xenograft tumor growth in vivo. RNA sequencing (RNA&#8208;seq) analysis revealed that the co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs exhibited mechanisms that are distinct from those of single drugs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing a computational approach combining LBVS and DFT to identify small molecules with co&#8208;assembly capabilities, leading to innovative anticancer strategies.

         <title>Adhesives with Debonding&#8208;On&#8208;Demand Capability: Leveraging Responsive Microcapsules for Mechanically&#8208;Induced Debonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Debondable adhesives hold promise for advancing sustainable bonding solutions, yet their adoption is often constrained by synthetic challenges that limit practicality and scalability. This study demonstrates how encapsulated plasticizers can impart mechanically triggered debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand functionality to commercial adhesives. By offering a straightforward, adaptable approach, it advances the development of more sustainable, versatile adhesives with enhanced debonding capabilities.








Abstract
Temporary adhesives capable of forming strong yet easily reversible bonds are garnering significant interest as sustainable materials that facilitate the recycling and recovery of high&#8208;value components. Herein is presented a comprehensive design and parameterization framework for developing effective temporary adhesives with mechanically induced debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand capabilities. This framework is achieved by incorporating hexyl acetate&#8208;filled microcapsules into commercial polyvinyl acetate adhesives, creating a responsive adhesive composite. Under controlled compression, these microcapsules rupture precisely, releasing their contents to induce sufficient adhesive plasticization to enable effortless debonding. Our results indicate that while the inclusion of microcapsules affects adhesion strength and toughness, the overall mechanical performance remains stable across different concentrations. Thermal tests highlight a 50&#160;wt.% microcapsule concentration as optimal for enhanced plasticization, while compression tests show that an applied force of 5&#160;kN achieves maximum capsule rupture without compromising substrate integrity. Ultimately, specimens bonded with the responsive composite under compression exhibit a striking 1200% increase in creep rates compared to those bonded with the neat adhesive, allowing for effective debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand&#8212;an outcome unattainable with the neat adhesive. This simple and highly versatile approach lays the groundwork for advancing the development of more sustainable and functional adhesive materials.

         <title>Engineered MSCs Break Endothelial&#8208;Myofibroblast Crosstalk in Pulmonary Fibrosis: Reconstructing the Vascular Niche</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The engineered MSCs (MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN) prepared based on surface&#8208;anchoring nanoparticle technology can trigger the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP&#8208;2) response to release drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (MM@LPHN) and break the malignant regulatory network between myofibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells in the fibroblastic foci. Combined with the pro&#8208;angiogenic effect of MSCs achieve the reconstruction of the vascular niche, the engineered MSCs promote lung tissue regeneration and treat pulmonary fibrosis.








Abstract
In the progress of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the normal vascular niche plays a crucial role in alveolar regeneration by secreting angiocrine factors. However, the malignant interaction between myofibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells results in significant loss of pulmonary capillaries in fibroblast foci, which promotes continuous deterioration of fibrosis. Herein, an engineered mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapeutic named MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN is developed for reconstructing the vascular niche, which is formed by modifying the surface of MSC with ROS&#8208;responsive lipid polymeric hybrid nanoparticles encapsulating the metformin and macitentan. Due to the homing ability of MSC, the MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN can effectively target lung tissue, then induce myofibroblast dedifferentiation to reduce the secretion of cytokines that cause endothelial cell damage and preventing endothelial cells from turning into a fibrotic phenotype, leading to recovery of the vascular endothelial cells function. Combined with the role of MSC&#8208;secreted growth factors promoting angiogenesis, the MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN ultimately constructs normal vascular structure in the fibroblast area and reverses bleomycin&#8208;induced PF. The findings suggest targeting the cell network in the vascular niche can effectively treat PF, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for fibrosis&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Development of Bioorthogonally Degradable Tough Hydrogels Using Enamine N&#8208;Oxide Based Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inducibly degradable enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinkers are integrated into tough double network hydrogels, enabling rapid and bioorthogonal degradation by aqueous diboron solutions. These chemical reagent&#8208;responsive biomaterials maintain structural integrity during use while enabling rapid degradation when needed, making them ideal for applications in intraoral wound dressings. These findings highlight the potential of the enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinker in polymer and materials chemistry.








Abstract
Inducibly degradable polymers present new opportunities to integrate tough hydrogels into a wide range of biomaterials. Rapid and inducible degradation enables fast transition in material properties without sacrificing material integrity prior to removal. In pursuit of bioorthogonal chemical modalities that will enable inducible polymer degradation in biologically relevant environments, enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinkers are developed for double network acrylamide&#8208;based polymer/alginate hydrogels. Bioorthogonal dissociation initiated by the application of aqueous diboron solution through several delivery mechanisms effectively lead to polymer degradation. Their degradation by aqueous B2(OH)4 solution results in a fracture energy half&#8208;life of &lt;10 min. The biocompatibility of the degradable hydrogels and B2(OH)4 reagent is assessed, and the removability of strongly adhered tough hydrogels on mice skin is evaluated. Thermoresponsive PNiPAAm/Alg hydrogels are fabricated and application of the hydrogels as a chemically inducible degradable intraoral wound dressing is demonstrated. It is demonstrated through in vivo maximum tolerated dose studies that diboron solution administered to mice by oral gavage is well tolerated. Successful integration of enamine N&#8208;oxides within the tough double network hydrogels as chemically degradable motifs demonstrates the applicability of enamine N&#8208;oxides in the realm of polymer chemistry and highlights the importance of chemically induced bioorthogonal dissociation reactions for materials science.

         <title>Red, Green and Blue Liquid&#8208;Film Lasers Based on Colloidal Quantum&#8208;Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in liquid films achieve breakthrough vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers across red, green, and blue spectra. By leveraging entropic ligands for ultrahigh solubility and integrating microfluidic cooling, this work overcomes thermal quenching, enabling stable lasing at MHz repetition rates. The platform unlocks customizable, solution&#8208;processed lasers for tunable wavelengths and diverse applications.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (cQD) are heralded for their tunable bandgaps, solution&#8208;processibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, making them ideal candidates for lasing applications. However, previous cQD lasing demonstrations have largely depended on close&#8208;packed solid&#8208;state films, which are deemed essential to counteract the rapid decay of material gain. In this study, a novel approach is introduced utilizing &#8220;entropic ligands and solvent&#8221; to enhance the solubility of cQDs in solution. By achieving the necessary critical volume fraction for lasing, this strategy leads to the groundbreaking development of the first liquid&#8208;state vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers (VCSELs) based on cQDs across the blue and green spectrum, encompassing diverse material systems such as CdSe&#8208;based and InP&#8208;based cQDs. Furthermore, by integrating the liquid&#8208;state VCSEL with a microfluidic channel, it is demonstrated that heat dissipation during intense excitation is pivotal for cQD lasing likely across various excitation modes&#8212;whether pulsed or continuous&#8208;wave, optically or electrically&#8208;pumped&#8212;and different media, including liquid and solid states. The research will lay the foundation for a new era of liquid&#8208;state cQD lasers for specific occasions, distinguished by their customizable and largely&#8208;variable wavelengths, compact form factors, diverse materials basis, and dependable performance.

         <title>Nanoporous Ag Microparticles with Tailorable and Noncontaminated Nanopores for SERS Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous silver microparticles with noncontaminated surfaces have promising applications in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering sensing fields. A method is developed to transform the electrodeposited Ag7O8NO3 microparticles into nanoporous Ag microparticles at room temperature within minutes without using organic ligands. The size of the interconnected nanopores can be controlled from less than 20 nm to more than 110 nm.








Abstract
Nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with noncontaminated surfaces hold significant promise in catalytic and sensing fields. Fabrication of nanoporous metal microparticles without using any organic ligands remains a significant challenge. Here, a green synthesis strategy is presented inspired by dealloying mechanisms. Ag7O8NO3 microparticles are first electrodeposited. Subsequent chemical reduction process selectively removes nitrogen and oxygen species from the Ag7O8NO3 microparticles while preserving the original morphology, giving rise to the formation of nanoporous Ag microparticles without using organic agents under room temperature within several minutes. Based on the ion diffusion limited growth mechanism, a quantitative correlation is established between the opening size of the nanopores and the concentration of the reductive agents, allowing to rationally prepare nanopores with opening size ranging from &lt;&#160;20&#160;nm to &gt;&#160;110&#160;nm. The ultraclean surface of the nanoporous Ag microparticles guarantees a clean surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) background. Reliable and sensitive SERS detection of proteins by unfolding the protein structure is further demonstrated to expose the otherwise concealed parts to the nanoporous Ag microparticles. A simple but powerful approach is developed to design ultraclean nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with promising applications in those fields requiring clean surfaces, such as in SERS sensing and catalytic fields.

         <title>Plasma Membrane Targeted Photodynamic Nanoagonist to Potentiate Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy by Initiating Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Depleting Infiltrating B Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist called PMTPN is designed to target tumor tissues and anchor on plasma membrane, aiming to initiate tumor cell pyroptosis and deplete infiltrating B cells. Consequently, PMTPN promotes DCs maturation and CTLs infiltration, while decreasing Tregs, greatly reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade therapy for primary and distant tumor eradication.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has achieved remarkable benefits in the treatment of malignant tumors, but the clinical response rates are unsatisfied due to the low tumor immunogenicity and the abundant immunosuppressive cells. Herein, a plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist (designated as PMTPN) is developed to potentiate ICB therapy by initiating tumor cell pyroptosis and depleting infiltrating B cells. PMTPN is composed of a rationally designed chimeric peptide sequence loaded with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Ibrutinib). Notably, PMTPN is capable of sequentially targeting tumor and tumor cell membrane to trigger immunogenic pyroptosis and cause overwhelming release of cytokines, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) activation. Meanwhile, PMTPN can also deplete infiltrating B cells and reduce the secretion of interleukin&#8208;10 to decrease immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and enhance CTLs infiltration. Beneficially, the synergistic immune modulating characteristics of PMTPN potentiate ICB therapy to simultaneously eliminate primary and distant tumors.

     alt="Plasma Membrane Targeted Photodynamic Nanoagonist to Potentiate Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy by Initiating Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Depleting Infiltrating B Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist called PMTPN is designed to target tumor tissues and anchor on plasma membrane, aiming to initiate tumor cell pyroptosis and deplete infiltrating B cells. Consequently, PMTPN promotes DCs maturation and CTLs infiltration, while decreasing Tregs, greatly reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade therapy for primary and distant tumor eradication.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has achieved remarkable benefits in the treatment of malignant tumors, but the clinical response rates are unsatisfied due to the low tumor immunogenicity and the abundant immunosuppressive cells. Herein, a plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist (designated as PMTPN) is developed to potentiate ICB therapy by initiating tumor cell pyroptosis and depleting infiltrating B cells. PMTPN is composed of a rationally designed chimeric peptide sequence loaded with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Ibrutinib). Notably, PMTPN is capable of sequentially targeting tumor and tumor cell membrane to trigger immunogenic pyroptosis and cause overwhelming release of cytokines, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) activation. Meanwhile, PMTPN can also deplete infiltrating B cells and reduce the secretion of interleukin-10 to decrease immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and enhance CTLs infiltration. Beneficially, the synergistic immune modulating characteristics of PMTPN potentiate ICB therapy to simultaneously eliminate primary and distant tumors. This study offers a promising strategy to elevate the immunotherapeutic response rate in consideration of the complex immunosuppressive factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lipoic Acid/Choline Ionic Liquid Enhanced Intratumoral Heat/Mass Transfer for Suppressing Thermo&#8208;Mediated Tumor Relapse and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a temperature&#8208;sensitive ionic liquid consisting of lipoic acid and choline (LACH/PNA) as a multifunctional thermal ablation sensitizer to suppress tumor metastasis induced by incomplete microwave ablation. LACH/PNA disrupts tumor matrix and modulates cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts, thus facilitating its heat/mass transfer in tumors. Meanwhile, LACH/PNA demonstrates specific cytotoxicity on hepatoma cells and is further intensified by thermal treatment.








Abstract
Thermal ablation (TA) is widely used for clinical treatment of various cancers. However, TA often struggles to efficiently kill tumor cells without injuring adjacent normal tissues/cells, leading to thermo&#8208;mediated tumor relapse and metastasis, owing to the immunosuppressive microenvironment surrounding residual tumor cells. In this study, a temperature&#8208;sensitive ionic liquid composed of lipoic acid and choline (LACH/PNA) is developed as a multifunctional TA sensitizer to suppress tumor metastasis induced by incomplete microwave ablation. LACH/PNA exhibits a high diffusion coefficient by disrupting the tumor matrix and modulating cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts, thereby facilitating heat and mass transfer in tumors. LACH/PNA demonstrates greater cytotoxicity toward hepatoma cells than on normal hepatocytes with this effect further intensified by thermal treatment. These findings highlight LACH/PNA as a promising multifunctional sensitizer for clinical chemoablation&#8208;microwave ablation synergy.

         <title>Nonlocal Conduction in a Metawire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1D metawire composed of twisted copper wires is designed and realized. This metamaterial exhibits pronounced effects of nonlocal electric conduction according to Ohm's law. The current at one location not only depends on the electric field at that location but also on other locations. As a result, the resistance of the metawire oscillates as a function of its length.








Abstract
Ohm's law of electric conduction is local in the sense that the current density at one position only depends on the electric field at that same position. For a nonlocal medium, the current density at one position depends on the electric field at other positions within the medium as well. As a result of Ohm's law, doubling the length of a wire doubles its resistance. Here, electrically conducting nonlocal architectures are discussed theoretically and experimentally for which changing the length of the metawire rather leads to a complex oscillatory behavior versus wire length. This oscillatory behavior is connected to local currents inside of the metawire flowing in the opposite direction than the externally applied field. The theoretical and experimental results for electric conduction can directly be transferred to thermal conduction or particle diffusion and may enable remote sensing applications.

         <title>Engineered Living Memory Microspheroid&#8208;Based Archival File System for Random Accessible In Vivo DNA Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient storage and retrieval of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) data while maintaining scalability and stability remain challenges in the field of molecular data storage. This study introduces Engineered Living Memory Microspheroids (ELMMs), which combine genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) with matrix materials for DNA storage. The ELMM system improves random access and reduces data encapsulation time, offering scalable, closed&#8208;loop storage and reuse.








Abstract
Given its exceptional durability and high information density, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#160;has the potential to meet the escalating global demand for data storage if it can be stored efficiently and accessed randomly in exabyte&#8208;to&#8208;yottabyte&#8208;scale databases. Here, this work introduces the Engineered Living Memory Microspheroid (ELMM) as a novel material for DNA data storage, retrieval, and management. This work engineers a plasmid library and devises a random access strategy pairing plasmid function with DNA data in a key&#8208;value format. Each DNA segment is integrated with its corresponding plasmid, introduced into bacteria, and encapsulated within matrix material via droplet microfluidics within 5 min. ELMMs can be stored at room temperature following lyophilization and, upon rehydration, each type of ELMM exhibits specific functions expressed by the plasmids, allowing for physical differentiation based on these characteristics. This work demonstrates fluorescent expression as the plasmid function and employs fluorescence&#8208;based sorting access image files in a prototype database. By utilizing N optical channels, to retrieve 2N file types, each with a minimum of 10 copies. ELMM offers a digital&#8208;to&#8208;biological information solution, ensuring the preservation, access, replication, and management of files within large&#8208;scale DNA databases.

         <title>M&#246;bius Solvation Structure for Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, in a bold departure from convention, the Ouzo effect is pioneeringly utilized to design surfactant&#8208;free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE), creating the first application of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation in zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This approach enables dual regulation of both the solvent environment and the solvation structure, thereby enhancing battery performance.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have promising prospects in energy storage field, but the water molecules in aqueous electrolytes significantly compromise the stability of the anode and cathode interfaces and hinder the low&#8208;temperature performance. Herein, water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation composed of oil, water, and amphiphilic salt are first&#8208;ever pioneered, forming the surfactant&#8208;free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE). This water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius solvation structure, characterized by its distinct inner and outer layers and a polarity inversion feature, successfully connects the non&#8208;polar phase with the polar phase, eliminating the need for surfactants to reduce costs and system complexity. The amphiphilic anion of salt creates a polarity singularity and stabilizes the polarity&#8208;reversed encapsulation. The outer oil layer disrupts the cohesive polarity network of water and constructs a polarity&#8208;reversed cage to restrict water. A series of SFMEE combinations are investigated and then directly applied to ZIBs, confirming excellent universality and durability of this design. The Zn||NVO (NaV&#8323;O&#8328;&#183;1.5H&#8322;O) cells using SFMEE can stably cycle for 4000 cycles with a capacity of 125 mAh g&#8722;1 and 86.8% capacity retention. This discovery of M&#246;bius solvation structure unlock unprecedented levels of electrolyte design and illuminate the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

         <title>Organic Gradient Homojunction via D&#8208;A Engineering Enables Photoelectric/Photothermal Dual&#8208;Assisted Catalysis Toward Full Spectrum Light&#8208;Coupled Low&#8208;Temperature Seawater Batteries</title>

An organic gradient homojunction design via rational donor&#8211;acceptor engineering is proposed to establish a new class of full&#8208;spectrum responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode for solar&#8208;coupled seawater&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based metal&#8208;air flow batteries with improved solar utilization and device energy efficiency even at lower temperatures, by exploring photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;assisted bidirectional oxygen catalysis.








Abstract
Coupling solar into metal&#8208;air batteries represents an appealing paradigm for storing intermittent solar energy and boosting device energy efficiency. Current solar&#8208;coupled metal&#8208;air systems rely on UV or visible light harvesting and suffer from inferior charge separation ability and limited solar utilization. Additionally, sunlight action behavior/mechanism in some useful scenarios (seawater electrolytes, low&#8208;temperature) is underexplored. Herein, through gradient homojunction design via donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) engineering, it exploits a novel full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode (PGH) for sunlight&#8208;coupled seawater&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based Zn/Na&#8208;air batteries (Zn&#8208;SWAB/Na&#8208;SWAB) with boosted sunlight utilization and energy efficiency at lower temperatures. By stacking three pre&#8208;designed analogous [A1&#8208;D1]m&#8208;[A1&#8208;D2]n copolymers with gradient energy&#8208;levels and rich heterocycles, PGH integrates separate metal&#8208;free active sites for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER), efficient photothermal effect with full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;absorption, and superior photoelectric effect with high charge&#8208;separation efficiency. Thus, PGH under simulated&#8208;sunlight produces remarkably&#8208;enhanced photocurrent up to 3.2 and 21.4 times during ORR/OER in near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. This endows sunlight&#8208;coupled PGH&#8208;enabled Zn&#8208;SWAB and Na&#8208;SWAB with low voltage gaps of 0.08/0.25&#160;V at room temperature, and 0.21/0.43&#160;V at 0&#160;&#176;C &#8211; both of which surpass most reported room&#8208;temperature results. Their energy efficiencies (84.6%/86.8%) at 0&#160;&#176;C even approach their room&#8208;temperature counterparts (93.9%/92.3%). Mechanistic studies reveal photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;promoted bidirectional oxygen catalysis responsible for intriguing performance.

         <title>Lab&#8208;in&#8208;Cell: A Covalent Photosensitizer Reverses Hypoxia and Evokes Ferroptosis and Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent warhead alkynamide is incorporated into an aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer, developing a redox systems&#8208;targeting covalent photosensitizer MBTP&#8208;PA. It is aimed at disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system, alleviating hypoxia, and evoking ferroptosis&#8208; and pyroptosis&#8208;mediated immunotherapy by thiol&#8208;yne click reactions. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP&#8208;PA&#8208;NPs at the tumor led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects.








Abstract
Photodynamic immunotherapy presents a non&#8208;invasive strategy characterized by spatiotemporal control and minimal side effects to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). This approach significantly enhances the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens and damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. However, hypoxia and antioxidant defenses at tumor sites considerably diminish the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy. In this work, a covalent warhead, alkyneamide, is introduced into an AIE photosensitizer to develop a novel covalent photosensitizer, MBTP&#8208;PA, which targets redox systems and facilitates ferroptosis&#8208; and pyroptosis&#8208;mediated photodynamic immunotherapy by thiol&#8208;yne click reactions. The covalent photosensitizer interacts with intracellular thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione, disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system and alleviating hypoxia. This results in enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy compared to the non&#8208;covalent photosensitizer MBTP&#8208;A. Furthermore, in conjunction with PDT, this reaction therapy can activate ICD through ferroptosis and pyroptosis, thereby enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP&#8208;PA nanoparticles at the tumor site led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects. Therefore, this work not only integrates the thiol&#8208;yne click reactions into cellular systems, significantly enhancing the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy but also paves the way for developing novel photosensitizers.

         <title>Thermal Processing Creates Water&#8208;Stable PEDOT:PSS Films for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of using chemical cross&#8211;linkers, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films for bioelectronics become water&#8208;stable after a simple heat treatment. The heat treatment is compatible with a range of rigid and elastomeric substrates and films are stable in vivo for &gt;20 days. 2D and 3D PEDOT:PSS structures can be patterned by delivering heat with a focused femtosecond laser.









Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors have emerged as a key material for the development of bioelectronic devices due to their soft mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and high volumetric capacitance. In particular, PEDOT:PSS has become a choice material because it is highly conductive, easily processible, and commercially available. However, PEDOT:PSS is dispersible in water, leading to delamination of films when exposed to biological environments. For this reason, chemical cross&#8211;linking agents such as (3&#8208;glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS) are used to stabilize PEDOT:PSS films in water, but at the cost of decreased electrical performance. Here, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films become water&#8208;stable by simply baking at high temperatures (&gt;150 &#176;C) for a short time (&#8776; 2 min). It is shown that heat&#8208;treated PEDOT:PSS films are as stable as their chemically&#8208;cross&#8211;linked counterparts, with their performance maintained for &gt;20 days both in vitro and in vivo. The heat&#8208;treated films eliminate electrically insulating cross&#8211;linkers, resulting in a 3&#215; increase in volumetric capacitance. Applying thermal energy using a focused femtosecond laser enables direct patterning of 3D PEDOT:PSS microstructures. The thermal treatment method is compatible with a wide range of substrates and is readily substituted into existing workflows for manufacturing devices, enabling its rapid adoption in the field of bioelectronics.

         <title>Generating Self&#8208;Adjuvated Nanofiber Vaccines by Coating Bacterial Flagella with Antigens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coating bacterial flagella with antigens is used as a versatile platform for developing self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. The resulting flagellum&#8208;based subunit vaccines with appealing features in prolonging tumor retention, recruiting adequate immune cells, and promoting cellular uptake of antigens and subsequent activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells provide a unique paradigm for effective vaccination.








Abstract
Bacteria&#8208;based vaccines have received increasing attention given the ability to induce strong systemic immune responses. However, the application of bacteria as therapeutic agents inevitably suffers from infection&#8208;associated side effects due to the living characteristics. Here, the use of bacteria&#8208;derived flagella is described to construct self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. With the help of charge&#8208;reversal mediated by decoration with cationic polymers, the flagella can be coated with negatively charged antigens through electrostatic interaction. By virtue of the large aspect ratio, the resulting nanofiber vaccines show prolonged retention at the injection site and increased uptake by dendritic cells and macrophages. Thanks to the innate immunogenicity, self&#8208;adjuvated flagella robustly promote dendritic cell maturation and macrophage polarization, resulting in the elicitation of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell and B&#8208;cell immune responses. In ovalbumin&#8208;overexpressing melanoma&#8208;bearing mice, immunization with ovalbumin&#8208;carried vaccines not only exhibits a favorable tolerance, but also displays superior inhibition efficacies on tumor growth and metastasis separately under the therapeutic and prophylactic settings. The flexibility of this approach is further demonstrated for vaccine fabrication by coating with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike protein S1 subunit. Bacterial flagella&#8208;based self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber platform proposes a versatile strategy to develop various vaccines for disease prevention and treatment.

         <title>2D Metastable&#8208;Phase Hafnium Oxide Triggers Hydrogen Spillover for Boosting Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen spillover is a widespread interfacial phenomenon involving the migration of equivalent amounts of H atoms from metal to support. The design of the substrate is crucial for triggering hydrogen spillover. Metastable&#8208;phase hexagonal phase hafnium oxide substrate can trigger efficient hydrogen spillover after loading ruthenium, yet the same phenomenon is forbidden on the stable phase monoclinic phase hafnium oxide substrate.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H) manipulation plays a significantly important role in many important applications, in which the occurrence of hydrogen spillover generally shows substrate&#8208;dependent behavior. It therefore remains an open question about how to trigger the hydrogen spillover on the substrates that are generally hydrogen spillover forbidden. Here a new metastable&#8208;phase 2D edge&#8208;sharing oxide: six&#8208;hexagonal phase&#8208;hafnium oxide (Hex&#8208;HfO2, space group: P63mc (186)) with the coordination number of six is demonstrated, which serves as an ideal platform for activating efficient hydrogen spillover after loading Ru nanoclusters (Ru/Hex&#8208;HfO2). For a stark comparison, the hydrogen spillover is strongly forbidden when using stable monoclinic phase HfO2 (M&#8208;HfO2, space group: P21/c (14), coordination number: seven) as the substrate. When applied in an acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Ru/Hex&#8208;HfO2 exhibits a low overpotential of 8&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high Ru utilization activity of 14.37 A mgRu&#8722;1 at 30&#160;mV. Detailed mechanism reveals the positive H adsorption free energy on Hex&#8208;HfO2, indicating that H is more likely to spillover on Hex&#8208;HfO2. Furthermore, the strong interaction between Ru and Hex&#8208;HfO2 optimizes the desorption of hydrogen intermediate, thus facilitating the surface H spillover. The discovery provides new guidance for developing metastable&#8208;phase oxide substrates for advanced catalysis.

         <title>Friction Memory Ionogels With Hysteretic Sticky&#8208;Slippery Transition via Thermolocking the Metastable state</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the kinetic differences between the evolution of the condensed structure in the bulk and the adsorption of droplets on the surface, on&#8208;demand friction memory is achieved without persistent stimulus.








Abstract
Many biological organisms possess adaptive friction states and display hysteretic friction recovery, allowing them to achieve specific friction memory after environment change. However, current artificial materials have limitations in maintaining on&#8208;demand friction states upon withdrawal of external triggers due to their strong dependence on external stimulus. Here, thermally induced phase separation ionogels with friction memory are reported. The kinetic difference between the evolution of bulk condensed structure and the adsorption of surface droplets after removing external stimulus delayed the recovery of friction state transition from slippery to sticky, thus achieving responsive friction memory. In addition, the metastable intermediate state generated during phase separation could be locked through vitrification, resulting in three distinct friction states determined by the synergy of stiffness and surface properties, including sticky state (coefficient of friction of 1.8), medium state (0.3&#8211;0.5) and slippery state (0.03&#8211;0.07). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, smart devices with diverse surface friction performance are engineered to realize various functions, including recognition of thermal range for target objects, de&#8208;icing, and movement manipulation. These results provide new insights for expanding the applications of ionogels in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art soft robotics and haptic engineering, offering fresh perspectives for further development of these fields.

         <title>Giant and Anisotropic Enhancement of Spin&#8208;Charge Conversion in Graphene&#8208;Based Quantum System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New magnetic Fe/Graphene/Pt double Rashba interface displays record spin&#8208;charge current interconversion efficiency at room temperature. The effect, which is anisotropic along the &#915;&#8208;K and &#915;&#8208;M directions, arises from the Direct and Inverse Edelstein mechanism in this new quantum epitaxial heterostructure.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for efficient data storage and processing has fueled the search for novel memory devices. By exploiting the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion phenomena, spintronics promises faster and low power solutions alternative to conventional electronics. In this work, a remarkable 34&#8208;fold increase in spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge current conversion is demonstrated when incorporating a 2D epitaxial graphene monolayer between iron and platinum layers by exploring spin&#8208;pumping on&#8208;chip devices. Furthermore, it is found that the spin conversion is also anisotropic. This enhancement and anisotropy is attributed to the asymmetric Rashba contributions driven by an unbalanced spin accumulation at the differently hybridized top and bottom graphene interfaces, as highlighted by ad&#8208;hoc first&#8208;principles theory. The improvement in spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion as well as its anisotropy reveals the importance of interfaces in hybrid 2D&#8208;thin film systems, opening up new possibilities for engineering spin conversion in 2D materials, leading to potential advances in memory, logic applications, or unconventional&#160;computing.

         <title>Triazine&#8208;containing Covalent Organic Polymer&#8208;derived Grid&#8208;Like Multilocular Spheres for Aqueous Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grid&#8208;like multilocular sphere derived from a TCOP electrode with abundant redox active sites and a unique structure has been developed via a molecular twist&#8208;induced regulation strategy, resulting in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1). It enables the as&#8208;assembled supercapacitor with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 675 Wh kg&#8722;1 in KI&#8208;mixed H2SO4 electrolyte.








Abstract
Triazine&#8208;containing covalent organic polymers (TCOPs) with unique structures and physicochemical properties are of great potential in energy storage and conversion applications, yet how to finely tune the morphology, and the accessible active sites, and to enhance capacitive activity remains a challenge. Here, the grid&#8208;like multilocular spheres derived from TCOP with abundant redox active sites and unique structures are fabricated via a molecular twist&#8208;induced regulation strategy, of which the number and size of cavities can be finely modulated by changing the conformers of the twisted unit and the Ostwald ripening time. The unique structure of the as&#8208;fabricated TCOP results in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1) and enables the as&#8208;assembled supercapacitor with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 675&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in redox&#8208;active electrolyte (KI&#8208;mixed H2SO4), much better than all reported aqueous supercapacitors thus far. It is found that the high electro&#8208;activity is due to the synergistic effect of the enhanced accessibility of active sites and the enhanced interaction of the abundant active sites with the redox&#8208;active electrolytes. This approach may pave a new way to precise synthesis of COPs with tuned structure and properties for application&#8208;inspired cutting&#8208;edge electrochemical energy storage and beyond.

This study innovatively developed a dressing that can self&#8208;manipulate sodium ion gradient to achieve endogenic electrical stimulation of the wound in a non&#8208;invasive and passive manner, which can avoid the occurrence of side effects such as electrode occupancy, electrochemical, and thermal effects of exogenous electrical stimulation, and makes significant breakthroughs in wound repair and scar prevention.








Abstract
Endogenous electric field (EF) originating from differences in&#160;ionic gradients plays a decisive role in the wound healing process. Based on this understanding, a self&#8208;manipulating sodium ion gradient&#8208;based endogenic electrical stimulation dressing (smig&#8208;EESD) is developed to achieve passive, non&#8208;invasive, endogenic electrical stimulation of wounds, which avoids the side effects of electrode occupancy, electrochemical reactions, and thermal effects present in traditional exogenous electrical stimulation. smig&#8208;EESD reduced the potential at the center of the wound by specifically absorbing Na+ in the exudate, ultimately strengthening the wound endogenous EF. Importantly, smig&#8208;EESD converted the active transport dependent on Na+/K+&#8208;ATPase into passive diffusion by adsorbing extracellular matrix Na+, and the saved ATP consumption promoted tissue repair process. smig&#8208;EESD regulated innate and adaptive immune responses by upregulating the secretion of multiple cytokines, thereby suppressing injury&#8208;associated inflammatory responses and reducing scar formation. smig&#8208;EESD reveals an endogenic electrical stimulation strategy that is independent of electrodes and circuits, and provides new insights into the future development of electronic medicine.

         <title>Bionic Olfactory Neuron with In&#8208;Sensor Reservoir Computing for Intelligent Gas Recognition</title>

A material&#8208;device&#8208;algorithm co&#8208;design strategy integrates an OFET array with in&#8208;sensor RC and KNN algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs.








Abstract
Gas sensing and recognition are closely related to the sustainable development of human society, current electronic noses (e&#8208;noses) typically focus on detecting specific gases, with only a few capable of recognizing complex odor mixtures. Further, these sensors often struggle to distinguish between isomers and homologs, as these compounds usually have similar physical and chemical properties, yielding nearly identical sensor responses. Even the mammalian olfactory systems consisting of a large variety of receptor cells and efficient neuron networks sometimes fail in this task. The bottleneck stems from the inability to extract the fingerprints of these compounds and the inefficiency of signal processing. To address these limitations, a material&#8208;device&#8208;algorithm co&#8208;design strategy is proposed that integrates an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) array with in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing (RC) and the k&#8208;nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs&#8212;among the highest reported accuracies. This work provides a groundbreaking hardware solution for bionic olfactory neurons with edge artificial intelligence (AI) functions, surpassing traditional e&#8208;noses.

         <title>Restrictive Heterointerfacial Delamination in Flexible Perovskite Photovoltaics Using a Bifacial Linker</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional groups of potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K) are employed as a bifacial linker to improve adhesion and stability in flexible perovskite solar modules. BnBF3K enhances efficiency to 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) at an area of 12.80 cm2 with excellent mechanical flexibility, maintaining 96.56% of initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells offer significant potential for portable electronics due to their exceptional power density. However, the commercialization of these devices is hampered by challenges related to mechanical flexibility, primarily due to inadequate adhesion between the perovskite absorber layer and the flexible substrate. Herein, this delamination issue is addressed by employing a bifacial linker, potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K), to enhance adhesion at the SnO2/perovskite interface. This approach not only improves the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite devices but also reduces buried surface defects and optimizes energy level alignment. Consequently, a record efficiency of 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) is achieved for a flexible perovskite solar module with an area of 12.80&#160;cm2 and a high efficiency of 24.15% for a flexible perovskite solar cell. Furthermore, the flexible modules exhibit outstanding mechanical flexibility, retaining 96.56% of their initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles, demonstrating their suitability for various practical applications.

         <title>A PD&#8208;L1 siRNA&#8208;Loaded Boron Nanoparticle for Targeted Cancer Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PD&#8208;L1 siRNA&#8208;loaded boron nanoparticle (10B/siPD&#8208;L1) is developed to synergize boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) with immunotherapy. Utilizing 10B/siPD&#8208;L1, BNCT can precisely kill tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells. Moreover, 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 inhibits intracellular PD&#8208;L1 expression, thereby not only amplifying the BNCT&#8208;induced DNA damage but also maximizing T&#8208;cell activation, which significantly suppresses the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is regarded as a promising clinical treatment strategy, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects. One of the key reasons is that conventional radiotherapies inevitably damage intratumoral effector immune cells. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a precise radiotherapy that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells, by utilizing 10B agents and neutron irradiation. Therefore, combinational BNCT&#8208;immunotherapy holds promise for achieving more effective synergistic effects. Here it develops a 10B&#8208;containing polymer that self&#8208;assembled with PD&#8208;L1 siRNA to form 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 nanoparticles for combinational BNCT&#8208;immunotherapy. Unlike antibodies, PD&#8208;L1 siRNA can inhibit intracellular PD&#8208;L1 upregulated by BNCT, activating T&#8208;cell immunity while also suppressing DNA repair. This can enhance BNCT&#8208;induced DNA damage, promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further amplifying the antitumor immune effect. The results demonstrated that BNCT using 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 nanoparticles precisely killed tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells and induced a potent antitumor immune response, inhibiting distal and metastatic tumors.

         <title>2D Biomimetic Membranes Constructed by Charge Assembly and Hydrogen Bonding for Precise Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, 2D biomimetic membranes constructed via charge assembly and hydrogen bonding achieve precise ion separation with enhanced mechanical stability. Engineered bacteria act as functional spacers, maintaining selectivity while withstanding high pressures. The membranes exhibit near 100% UO22+ rejection and exceptional K/U and V/U selectivity, enabling sustainable uranium extraction from seawater.








Abstract
Designing well&#8208;ordered, multifunctional layered membranes with high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability remains a significant challenge. Here, a simple strategy is introduced that utilizes charge repulsion between graphene oxide (GO) and engineered bacteria to induce liquid crystal formation, enabling their layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembly on a polyethersulfone membrane. The interlayer pressure flattens the bacteria, removing interlayer water and forming a densely packed structure. This compression decreases the spacing between functional groups, leading to a robust hydrogen bonding network and a significant enhancement in mechanical properties (12.42 times tensile strength increase). Notably, the pressure preserves the activity of the super uranyl&#8208;binding protein of engineered bacteria, which selectively coordinates with uranyl (UO22+) through high&#8208;affinity coordination bonds, enabling recognition and sieving of target ions. The membrane demonstrates near 100% rejection of UO22+, K/U, and V/U selectivity of &#8776;140 and &#8776;40, respectively, while maintaining long&#8208;term stability. This strategy provides a versatile platform for the precise design of high&#8208;performance membranes, advancing the field of molecular transport in energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Rapid and Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of High&#8208;Crystalline Imide Covalent Organic Frameworks Accelerated by Self&#8208;Generated Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, rapid, scalable, and low&#8208;cost self&#8208;accelerated method to synthesize imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is developed. This synthetic method is performed under solvent&#8208;free and atmospheric pressure conditions. The in situ generated water during monomer condensation can significantly accelerate the reversible self&#8208;healing of disordered polymers to form highly crystalline imide COFs.








Abstract
Imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising materials in various fields due to their exceptional stability, large surface area, and high porosity. However, current synthesis methods of imide COFs typically involve complex vacuum operations, large amounts of solvents, and long reaction times at high temperatures, limiting their scalability for industrial production. Herein, a facile self&#8208;accelerated strategy is developed for rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale synthesis of eight imide COFs (SACOFs) under solvent&#8208;free, vacuum&#8208;free, and low&#8208;temperature conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the self&#8208;accelerated synthesis is driven by the self&#8208;generated water under atmospheric conditions, which accelerates the reversible self&#8208;healing of disordered polymers, ultimately leading to the rapid synthesis of highly crystalline COFs. Notably, the only additive required besides the COF monomers is o&#8208;substituted benzoic acid, a small amount of which is grafted onto the imide COFs, enabling their straightforward functionalization. Thiol&#8208;functionalized SACOFs are synthesized as supports for anchoring Pd nanoparticles. The as&#8208;prepared Pd@SACOFs exhibit high activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of substituted nitrobenzene due to the surface modulation of Pd by thiol groups. The self&#8208;accelerated synthetic strategy enables rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale production of imide COFs, potentially paving the way for their transition from laboratory research to commercial applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts of Potassium Lactate Oxidation for Hydrogen and Solid Potassium Acetate Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium lactate, produced from polylactic acid plastic waste, is oxidized to potassium acetate on an anode using Ni(Co)OOH as the electrocatalyst, while hydrogen is simultaneously generated at the cathode, through a highly efficient industrial&#8208;scale electrolysis system.








Abstract
With the increasing use of polylactic acid (PLA), more attention is turning to its post&#8208;treatment. Current methods such as natural decomposition, composting, and incineration are limited by significant carbon dioxide emissions and resource waste. Here, an efficient electrocatalytic conversion approach is presented to transform PLA waste into high&#8208;value chemicals, particularly potassium acetate (AA&#8208;K). By combining experimental and theoretical calculation, a high&#8208;performance catalyst Ni(Co)OOH is developed, which exhibits a current density of 403&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at 1.40&#160;V (vs RHE) with 96% Faraday efficiency for AA&#8208;K in the electrooxidation of potassium lactate (LA&#8208;K, the product of PLA degradation in KOH). Through in situ spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations, the structural regulation of the catalyst, and reaction pathways of the electrooxidation are elucidated. Further experiments demonstrate the superior catalytic performance of the Ni(Co)OOH catalyst in an industrial&#8208;scale tandem system. In 2 h of electrolysis, 320&#160;g of PLA waste produces 232 L of H&#8322;, yielding 1200&#160;g of AA&#8208;K with 97% purity after neutralization and drying. The system demonstrates high conversion efficiency (approaching 97%) for diverse real PLA waste forms, including powder, cups, fibers, and cloth. This research provides a scalable and sustainable approach for PLA waste upcycling.

         <title>Neural Network&#8208;Assisted End&#8208;to&#8208;End Design for Full Light Field Control of Meta&#8208;Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive system&#8208;level neural network&#8208;assisted end&#8208;to&#8208;end design framework of meta&#8208;optics for full light field control is presented. Performance enhancement over separated design is experimentally demonstrated in dual&#8208;polarization multi&#8208;wavelength holography. Functionality limitation breakthrough is experimentally demonstrated in orthogonal polarization multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;depth multiplexing holography. Application potential is demonstrated in non&#8208;orthogonal polarization across wavelength channels for polarized&#8208;spectral multi&#8208;information processing.








Abstract
Meta&#8208;optics, with unique light&#8208;matter interactions and extensive design space, underpins versatile and compact optical devices through flexible multi&#8208;parameter light field control. However, conventional designs struggle with the intricate interdependencies of nano&#8208;structural complex responses across wavelengths and polarizations at a system level, hindering high&#8208;performance full&#8208;light field control. Here, a neural network&#8208;assisted end&#8208;to&#8208;end design framework that facilitates global, gradient&#8208;based optimization of multifunctional meta&#8208;optics layouts for full light field control is proposed. Its superiority over separated design is showcased by utilizing the limited design space for multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;polarization holography with enhanced performance (e.g., &#8776;6 &#215; structural similarity index experimentally). By harnessing the dispersive full&#8208;parameter Jones matrix, orthogonal tri&#8208;polarization multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;depth holography is further demonstrated, breaking conventional channel limitations. To highlight its versatility, non&#8208;orthogonal polarizations (&gt;3) are showcased for arbitrary polarized&#8208;spectral multi&#8208;information processing applications in display, imaging, and computing. The comprehensive framework elevates light field control in meta&#8208;optics, delivering superior performance, enhanced functionality, and improved reliability, thereby paving the way for next&#8208;generation intelligent optical technologies.

         <title>Diluted Ternary Heterojunctions to Suppress Charge Recombination for Organic Solar Cells with 21% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diluted heterojunctions are employed to increase the structure order in the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer fabricated solar cells and polymeric diluent is found superior that the small molecular diluent, creating OSC having dual fibrils with significantly increased absorption and reduced charge recombination to realize an efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%).








Abstract
As an exitonic photovoltaic device, organic solar cells (OSCs) consist of electron donating and accepting components in their photoactive layer, in which the molecular interactions between donor and acceptor can significantly affect the nanoscale morphology as well as the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. In this work, by diluting electron donor with electron acceptor having opposite electrostatic potentials to promote the structural order via strengthened intermolecular interactions, this study shows that polymeric diluent is more effective due to its long&#8208;ranged conjugated backbone compared with small molecular diluent. The ternary heterojunction made of C5&#8208;16:L8&#8208;BO binary acceptors diluted with D18 shows the strongest structural order, benefiting from the strong interactions between L8&#8208;BO and C5&#8208;16. The enhanced structural order within the photoactive layer prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition of the diluted p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type heterojunctions contributes to enhanced light absorption, improved charge transport, and inhibited charge recombination. As the result, OSC based on D18 (PY&#8208;IT diluted)/L8&#8208;BO:C5&#8208;16 (D18 diluted) having donor and acceptor dual fibrils obtains an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%), which is one of the highest certified PCE up to date.

         <title>Stochastically Broken Inversion Symmetry of Van der Waals Topological Insulator for Nanoscale Physically Unclonable Functions</title>

         <dc:description>
vdW Janus topological insulator is presented with stochastic inversion asymmetry via penetrative single&#8208;step plasma sulfurization, which enables the large&#8208;scale synthesis, one&#8208;step process, and low&#8208;temperature condition with back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line process compatibility. Sulfur dominance and its corresponding spatial OOP domain distribution are spatially observed using piezoelectric force microscopy&#160;hysteresis mapping, cross&#8208;sectional transmission electron microscopy, top&#8208;view scanning electroc microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and force&#8208;distance curve mapping. This provides an extendable synthetic solution for stochastic and size&#8208;controllable challenge&#8208;response pairs generation for PUFs application, which can overcome the conventional limitations of encryption technology.








Abstract
Owing to the exotic state of quantum matter, topological insulators have emerged as a significant platform for new&#8208;generation functional devices. Among these topological insulators, tetradymites have received significant attention because of their van der Waals (vdW) structures and inversion symmetries. Although this inversion symmetry completely blocks exotic quantum phenomena, it should be broken down to facilitate versatile topological functionalities. Recently, a Janus structure is suggested for asymmetric out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice structures, terminating the heterogeneous atoms at two sides of the vdW structure. However, the synthesis of Janus structures has not been achieved commercially because of the imprecise control of the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth, high&#8208;temperature synthesis, and low yield. To overcome these limitations, plasma sulfurization of vdW topological insulators has been presented, enabling stochastic inversion asymmetry. To take practical advantage of the random lattice distortion, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) have been suggested as applications of vdW Janus topological insulators. The sulfur dominance is experimentally demonstrated via X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, hysteresis variation, cross&#8208;sectional transmission electron microscopy, and adhesion energy variation. In conclusion, it is envisioned that the vdW Janus topological insulators can provide an extendable encryption platform for randomized lattice distortion, offering on&#8208;demand stochastic inversion asymmetry via a single&#8208;step plasma sulfurization.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Cr3Te4/WS2/Fe3GeTe2/WTe2 Magnetic Memory with Field&#8208;Free Switching and Low Power Consumption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates novel magnetic tunnel junctions with low resistance&#8208;area product by integrating chemically vapor&#8208;deposited 2D Cr3Te4/WS2 heterostructures with 2D Fe3GeTe2 magnets. Leveraging spin&#8208;orbit torque to manipulate spins in Fe3GeTe2, the authors fabricate an energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory device. This breakthrough not only advances high&#8208;performance spintronics but also paves the way for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) magnetic memory technology has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable field&#8208;free switching of magnets with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). However, concerns regarding power consumption of SOT&#8208;memory are persisting. Here, this work proposes a method to construct magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by transferring chemically vapor&#8208;deposited two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Cr3Te4/WS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures onto 2D Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) magnet. The robustness and tunability of 2D magnets allow MTJs to exhibit non&#8208;volatility, multiple output states, and impressive cycling durability. MTJs with thin WS2 barriers (fewer than six layers) exhibit a linear tunneling effect,&#160;achieving a low resistance&#8208;area product (RA) of 15.5 k&#937;&#183;&#181;m2 using bilayer WS2, which facilitats low&#8208;power operation. Furthermore, the different 2D magnets display a significant anti&#8208;parallel window of up to 8 kOe. SOT&#8208;memory based on the typical MTJ demonstrates a low write consumption of 0.3 mJ and read consumption of 9.7 nJ, marking a significant advancement in 2D vdW SOT&#8208;memory. This research has pointed out a new direction for constructing low power consumption SOT&#8208;memory with PMA field&#8208;free switching.

         <title>Interfacial &#960;&#8208;Electron Cloud Extension and Charge Transfer Between Preferable Single&#8208;Crystalline Conjugated MOFs and Graphene for Ultrafast Pulse Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin&#8208;conjugated MOFs nanosheets with single&#8208;crystalline characteristics are prepared by surfactant&#8208;assisted solution synthesis strategy. The &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked MOF/graphene van der Waals heterostructure can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode&#8208;locking with femtosecond pulse duration and high&#8208;order harmonic mode&#8208;locking with GHz repetition frequency. This preferable stacking exhibits superior &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties.








Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted significant attention in various fields due to their outstanding characteristics. However, due to the strong interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, the preparation of high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline conjugated MOF structures continues to pose a significant challenge. The investigation of its nonlinear optical (NLO) property and application for ultrafast photonics is still rare. Herein, the ultrathin Cu3(HHTP)2 and Ni3(HHTP)2 (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanosheets (CuHHTPNs and NiHHTPNs) with single&#8208;crystalline characteristic are prepared by surfactant&#8208;assisted solution synthesis strategy. Moreover, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked CuHHTPNs(NiHHTPNs)/graphene van der Waals heterostructures (CuNsG&#8208;VHS and NiNsG&#8208;VHS) are achieved by ultrasound&#8208;assisted method. According to characterization analyses and theoretical simulations, this preferable stacking ultrathin van der Waals heterostructures exhibits superior &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties. Noticeably, the third&#8208;order NLO polarizability of CuNsG&#8208;VHS keeps in a relatively high level compared with the reported 2D saturable absorber materials in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Based on these outstanding properties, CuNsG&#8208;VHS can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode&#8208;locking with femtosecond pulse duration, and high&#8208;order harmonic mode&#8208;locking with GHz repetition frequency. These demonstrations provide a valuable strategy for the development of promising conjugated MOFs for ultrafast photonics and advanced optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Rhodamine B&#8208;Derived Low&#8208;Toxicity Full&#8208;Color Carbon Dots with Wide Tunable High&#8208;Stable Liquid&#8208;State Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color carbon dots (FCDs) with emission wavelengths ranging from 434 to 703&#160;nm are synthesized using Rhodamine B (RhB) as the sole precursor. The photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and gain performance of the FCDs are enhanced due to cross&#8208;linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Tunable liquid&#8208;state laser emissions in green, yellow, red, and NIR regions are achieved with lower laser thresholds compared to RhB, demonstrating superior laser stability. Additionally, these FCDs are validated as excellent laser sources. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirmed that FCDs exhibit significantly lower toxicity and superior staining effects compared to RhB.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) serve as a novel, non&#8208;toxic, cost&#8208;effective, and highly&#8208;stable solution&#8208;processable nanolaser material. However, compared to commonly used commercial laser dyes, CDs exhibit lower photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), radiation transition rates, and gain coefficients. Consequently, this leads to higher laser thresholds that significantly impede the expansion of practical applications for CDs. Therefore, enhancing the gain performance of CDs is crucial in guiding the design of CD gain materials and promoting their practical applications. Herein, Rhodamine B (RhB) is employed as a sole precursor for the synthesis of full&#8208;color CDs (FCDs) with vibrant blue, green, yellow, red, and NIR (denoted as B&#8208;CDs, G&#8208;CDs, Y&#8208;CDs, R&#8208;CDs, and NIR&#8208;CDs) fluorescence through cross&#8208;linking, polymerization, and carbonization processes. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra ranged from 434 to 703&#160;nm. Notably, the PLQYs and gain performance of FCDs are improved due to cross&#8208;linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Green, yellow, red, and NIR laser emission is achieved with lower laser thresholds and exhibited superior laser stabilities than RhB. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirm that FCDs possess significantly lower toxicity than RhB. This study not only validates the applicability of CEE in CDs for developing multicolor gain materials but also advances the practical application of miniaturized lasers based on CDs.

Herein, Rhodamine B (RhB) is employed as a sole precursor for the synthesis of full-color CDs (FCDs) with vibrant blue, green, yellow, red, and NIR (denoted as B-CDs, G-CDs, Y-CDs, R-CDs, and NIR-CDs) fluorescence through cross-linking, polymerization, and carbonization processes. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra ranged from 434 to 703&#160;nm. Notably, the PLQYs and gain performance of FCDs are improved due to cross-linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Green, yellow, red, and NIR laser emission is achieved with lower laser thresholds and exhibited superior laser stabilities than RhB. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirm that FCDs possess significantly lower toxicity than RhB. This study not only validates the applicability of CEE in CDs for developing multicolor gain materials but also advances the practical application of miniaturized lasers based on CDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Sensor Polarization Convolution Based on Ferroelectric&#8208;Reconfigurable Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric BiFeO3 nanowire photodiodes enable in&#8208;sensor polarization extraction through aligned nanowire&#8208;induced anisotropic photoresponse and reconfigurable photovoltaic effects. With two&#8208;order anisotropic ratio tunability, the devices perform polarization&#8208;based convolutions, boosting object recognition accuracy to 89.6% in adverse weather conditions. This innovation advances intelligent vision systems with efficient in&#8208;sensor polarization processing.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor computing can enhance the imaging system performance by putting part of the computations into the sensor. While substantial advancements have been made in latency, spectral range, and functionalities, the strategy for in&#8208;sensor light polarization computing has remained unexplored. Here, it is shown that ferroelectric&#8208;reconfigurable polarization&#8208;sensitive photodiodes (FPPDs) based on BiFeO3 nanowire arrays can perform in&#8208;sensor computations on polarization information. This innovation leverages the anisotropic photoresponse from the 1D structure of nanowires and the non&#8208;volatile reconfigurability of ferroelectrics. The devices show programmable anisotropic ratios as high as 5219, surpassing most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors and commercial polarization image sensors. Employing tunable photoresponse as kernel, FPPDs can perform convolutions to directly extract feature maps containing polarization information, which raises the recognition accuracy on road&#8208;scene objects under adverse weather up to 89.6%. The research highlights the potential of FPPDs as a highly efficient vision sensor and extends the boundaries of advanced intelligent imaging systems.

         <title>The Critical Role of Atomic&#8208;Scale Polarization in Transition Metal Oxides on Vanadium&#8208;Redox Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals for the first time the underlying mechanism of vacancies in TOMEs and uncovers the effect of atomic&#8208;scale polarization on the redox reaction mechanism through in situ Raman and operando ATR&#8208;SEIRAS. Further, the stability of cation/anion vacancies is explored in long&#8208;term cycling. The findings standardize the fundamentals governing the utility and evolution of vacancies, thereby opening new avenues for a variety of sustainable energy storage schemes.








Abstract
Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts (TMOEs) are poised to revive grid&#8208;scale all&#8208;vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) due to their low&#8208;cost and unique electronic properties, while often inescapably harboring surface vacancies. The role of local vacancy&#8208;induced physicochemical properties on vanadium&#8208;redox electrochemistry (VRE), encompassing kinetics, and stability, remains profoundly unveiled. Herein, for the first time, it is revealed that vacancies induce atomic&#8208;scale polarization in TMOEs and elucidate its mechanism in VRE. Attributable to local polarization, particularly by cation vacancy, the activated nearest&#8208;coordinated Mn sites prominently augment the adsorption competence of the V2+/V3+ couple and expedite its round&#8208;tripping by forming an intermediate *Mn&#8211;O&#8211;V bridge. It is also affirmed that the anion vacancies are vulnerable to microstructure reconfiguration by feeble hydroxyl adsorption and thus performance degradation over long&#8208;term cycling, in contrast to cation vacancies. Accordingly, the VRFB employing cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;functionalized electrode delivers an energy efficiency of 80.8% and a reliable 1000&#8208;cycle lifespan with a negligible decay of 0.57% per cycle at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outclassing others. The findings shed light on the fundamental rules governing the utility and evolution of vacancies in TMOEs, thereby moving a step closer toward their deployment in a wide range of sustainable energy storage schemes.

         <title>Regulating the Isomerization Geometry and Energy State of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometric isomerization strategy is reported to modulate the electron and energy states of metal&#8208;free COF&#8208;based catalysts via introducing bithiophene units featuring diverse substitutions. The asymmetric 2,3&#8208;substitution COFs with enhanced dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution show high electrocatalytic activity, with the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#946;&#8208;position) far from sulfur atoms emerging as active sites.








Abstract
Embedding isomer entities onto crystalline frameworks with precisely defined spatial distributions represents a promising approach to enhancing the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, accurately constructing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to regulate energy state effectively remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative geometric isomerization strategy aimed at minimizing the rotational barrier energy (&#916;E), average local ionization energy (ALIE), and Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) for ORR within COFs is proposed. Based on this strategy, isomeric Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#945; with 2,2&#8208;substitution, Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#946;&#946; with 3,3&#8208;substitution, and Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#946; with 2,3&#8208;substitution on the mainchain frameworks have been obtained. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption capabilities are finely tuned through isomer modification, yielding a precisely controllable chemical activity. Notably, Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#946; with lower &#916;E between thiophenes achieves remarkable performance, evidenced by a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.77 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing most reported metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. Combined with theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, it is revealed that the increased dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution caused by isomer endows pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#946;&#8208;position) far from sulfur atoms with efficient catalytic activity. This work has opened up a novel paradigm for the isomerization of COFs and underscores the pivotal role of charge regulation in facilitating efficient catalysis.

         <title>Etchless InSe Cavities Based on Bound States in the Continuum for Enhanced Exciton&#8208;Mediated Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An etchless bound&#8208;state&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum polymer cavity is designed on a 2D InSe flake, achieving an impressive photoluminescence enhancement of 218 times. The exciton&#8208;exciton scattering in InSe is intensively amplified on cavity, which is unobservable off&#8208;cavity. Second harmonic generation in InSe can also be significantly enhanced by 404 times. The etchless cavity concept can be extended to other nanostructures beyond grating.








Abstract
Recently, fervent research interest is sparked to indium selenide (&#947;&#8208;InSe) due to its dazzling optical and electronic properties. The direct bandgap in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range ensures efficient carrier recombination in InSe, promoting impressive competency for lavish NIR applications. Nevertheless, the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of InSe is significantly limited by out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OP) excitons, adverse to practical devices. Herein, a facile and effective solution is proposed by introducing photonic bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum (BIC) modes to enhance excitons in InSe through strengthened exciton&#8208;photon coupling. This cavity is constructed simply by patterning a polymer grating onto the InSe flake without an etching process, achieving an impressive PL enhancement of over 200 times. By adjusting the cavity resonance wavelength, it can selectively amplify the exciton emission or the exciton&#8208;exciton scattering process, which is not observable off&#8208;cavity at room temperature. Additionally, the second harmonic generation (SHG) process in InSe can also be largely enhanced by over 400 times on the cavity. Notably, the etchless cavity design can be further extended to other nanostructures beyond grating. This research presents a feasible and efficient approach to enhancing the optical performance of OP excitons, paving a prospective avenue for advanced linear and nonlinear photonic devices.

         <title>Mitochondrial Transplantation via Magnetically Responsive Artificial Cells Promotes Intracerebral Hemorrhage Recovery by Supporting Microglia Immunological Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) has been developed, demonstrating the loading of mitochondria and self&#8208;enclosure processes to ensure the protection of mitochondrial transport via the bloodstream. The treatment with ACs effectively transplanted mitochondria around the lesion, thereby improving neurological recovery by supporting microglia immunological homeostasis after intracerebral hemorrhage.








Abstract
The immune&#8208;inflammatory responses in the brain represent a key therapeutic target to ameliorate brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), where pro&#8208;inflammatory microglia and its mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Mitochondrial transplantation is a promising strategy to improve the cellular mitochondrial function and thus modulate their immune properties. However, the transplantation of naked mitochondria into the brain has been constrained by the peripheral clearance and the difficulty in achieving selective access to the brain. Here, a novel strategy for mitochondrial transplantation via intravenous injection of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) are proposed. ACs can protect the loaded mitochondria and selectively accumulate around the lesion under an external magnetic field (EMF). In this study, mitochondria released from ACs can effectively improve microglial mitochondrial function, attenuate their pro&#8208;inflammatory attributes, and elevate the proportion of immunosuppressive microglia. In this way, microglia immune homeostasis in the brain is reestablished, and inflammation is attenuated, ultimately promoting functional recovery. This study presents an effective approach to transplant mitochondria into the brain, offering a promising alternative to modulate the immune&#8208;inflammatory cascade in the brain following ICH.

&lt;p&gt;The immune-inflammatory responses in the brain represent a key therapeutic target to ameliorate brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), where pro-inflammatory microglia and its mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Mitochondrial transplantation is a promising strategy to improve the cellular mitochondrial function and thus modulate their immune properties. However, the transplantation of naked mitochondria into the brain has been constrained by the peripheral clearance and the difficulty in achieving selective access to the brain.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Boosted by Surface Hydroxyls&#8208;Modulated Hydrogen Migration over Nonreducible Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen spillover is considered to play a major role in ubiquitous technologies involving hydrogen. However, its application in Earth&#8208;abundant widely&#8208;used non&#8208;reducible oxides is severely limited by much shorter migration distances of atomic hydrogen compared to those in reducible oxides. This study presents a surface hydroxyl modulation strategy to enhance hydrogen migration over nonreducible oxides, promoting electrocatalytic hydrogenation for water purification.








Abstract
The migration of atomic hydrogen species over heterogeneous catalysts is deemed essential for hydrogenation reactions, a process closely related to the catalyst's functionalities. While surface hydroxyls&#8208;assisted hydrogen spillover is well documented on reducible oxide supports, its effect on widely&#8208;used nonreducible supports, especially in electrocatalytic reactions with water as the hydrogen source, remains a subject of debate. Herein, a nonreducible oxide&#8208;anchored copper single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu1/SiO2) is designed and uncover that the surface hydroxyls on SiO2 can serve as efficient transport channels for hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the activated hydrogen coverage on the catalyst and favoring the hydrogenation reaction. Using electrocatalytic dechlorination as a model reaction, the Cu1/SiO2 catalyst delivers hydrodechlorination activity 42 times greater than that of commercial Pd/C. An integrated experimental and theoretical investigation elucidates that surface hydroxyls facilitate the spillover of hydrogen intermediates formed at the Cu sites, boosting the coverage of active hydrogen on the surface of the Cu1/SiO2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of surface hydroxyls acting as transport channels for hydrogen&#8208;species to boost hydrogen spillover on nonreducible oxide supports and paves the way for designing advanced selective hydrogenation electrocatalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Gelatin Hydrogel Scaffold with Drug Loading Remodels the Inflammatory Microenvironment to Enhance Osteoporotic Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;strength gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength exceeding 10&#160;MPa is developed, combined with rapid photocross&#8208;linking capability. This hydrogel enables the fabrication of complex and precise scaffolds through 3D printing. When loaded with roxadustat, the scaffold facilitates sustained&#8208;release therapy, effectively remodeling inflammatory microenvironments. This approach presents a promising solution for the repair of osteoporotic bone defects.









Abstract
Osteoporosis is a widespread condition that induces an inflammatory microenvironment, limiting the effectiveness of conventional therapies and presenting significant challenges for bone defect repair. To address these issues, a high&#8208;strength gelatin hydrogel scaffold loaded with roxadustat is developed, specifically designed to remodel the inflammatory microenvironment and enhance osteoporotic bone regeneration. By incorporating minimal methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) into an o&#8208;nitrobenzyl functionalized gelatin (GelNB) matrix, a gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength of 10&#160;MPa is achieved, providing exceptional structural stability and enabling precise scaffold fabrication through digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. Validated through cell experiments and animal studies, the hydrogel scaffold supports cell adhesion and migration, offers excellent tissue compatibility, and is fully degradable, meeting the requirements of a therapeutic scaffold. Including roxadustat further enhances the scaffold's functionality by regulating the inflammatory microenvironment via hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) signaling, significantly improving bone defect repair in osteoporotic models. This drug&#8208;loaded scaffold effectively addresses inflammation&#8208;induced limitations and enhances the regenerative capacity of the affected area, paving the way for improved therapeutic outcomes in osteoporotic bone repair.

         <title>Unravelling the Atomic Structure of a Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Assembled from Ruthenium Metalloligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) are novel porous materials that exhibit the advantages of covalent and metal&#8208;organic frameworks. However, it is extremely difficult to resolve their atomic structure and better understand their structure&#8208;properties relation. This work utilizes a synergistic combination of advanced microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods to unravel the atomic mapping of a photoactive ruthenium&#8208;MCOF.








Abstract
Covalent and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs and MOFs) have shown great promise in light&#8208;driven processes mainly due to their ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;separation properties, as well as having access to a diverse range of photoactive metalloligands and organic linkers. However, both frameworks present individual drawbacks that can potentially be avoided by combining both systems (metal and covalent) to produce metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), exhibiting the advantages of both material types. Yet, due to their poor crystallinity, the understanding of the structure&#8208;properties relation of MCOFs remains unclear. Herein, we report photoactive linkers in the form of a [Ru(tpy)2]2+ (tpy: 2,2&#8242;,6,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine) complex which covalently binds to a luminescent pyrene core to yield a new, photoactive Schiff&#8208;base MCOF. The structure, thermal, electronic, and optical properties of this novel material have been exhaustively characterized by a wide range of microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods. This combined experimental and computational work represents a significant step toward the fundamental understanding of the photoactive units within the framework, their hierarchical arrangement and interactions with substrates, which is essential for the future design of efficient photocatalytic materials.

The fabricated chromium(III)&#8208;telluride&#8208;coated liquid metal droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, nonadhesion to surfaces, and cost&#8208;effective recyclability. Their functionality is demonstrated in magnetointeractive memory devices and wearable sensors for dynamic gesture recognition, broadening the potential applications of flexible electronics.








Abstract
Magnetic liquid metal droplets, featured by unique fluidity, metallic conductivity, and magnetic reactivity, are of growing significance for next&#8208;generation flexible electronics. Conventional fabrication routes, which typically incorporate magnetic nanoparticles into liquid metals, otherwise encounter the pitfall pertaining to surface adhesivity and corrosivity over device modules. Here, an innovative approach of synergizing liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials is presented, accordingly creating chromium(III)&#8208;telluride&#8208;coated liquid metal (CT&#8211;LM) droplets via a simple self&#8208;assembly process. The CT&#8211;LM droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, demonstrate nonadherence to various surfaces, and enable cost&#8208;effective recycling of components. The functionality of CT&#8211;LM droplets is validated through their use in magnetointeractive memory devices to enable sensing/storing 64 magnetic paths and in wearable sensors as the flexible vibrator for dynamic gesture recognition with machine learning assistance. This work opens new avenues for the functional droplet design and broadens the horizons of flexible electronics.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Nanoscintillators for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Photodynamic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators (BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG) is designed and engineered to enhance X&#8208;PDT for unresectable HCC treatment. Precise tumor localization capability of SRT and effective X&#8208;ray energy absorbing and transferring capability of BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG endowing BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG&#8208;mediated X&#8208;PDT approach with significant HCC therapeutic potential. Therefore, phosphorescent HOF&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT is an ideal alternative therapy for patients with unresectable HCC.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray induced photodynamic therapy (X&#8208;PDT) leverages penetrating X&#8208;ray to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for treating deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, conventional X&#8208;PDT typically relies on heavy metal inorganic scintillators and organic photosensitizers to produce 1O2, which presents challenges related to toxicity and energy conversion efficiency. In this study, highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent nanoscintillators based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) are designed and engineered, termed BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG, to enhance X&#8208;PDT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG functions simultaneously as both scintillator and photosensitizer, effectively absorbing and transferring X&#8208;ray energy to generate abundant 1O2. Both in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that internalized BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG efficiently produces significant quantities of 1O2 upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Additionally, X&#8208;ray exposure directly inflicts DNA damage, and the synergistic effects of these mechanisms result in pronounced cell death and substantial tumor growth inhibition, with a significant inhibition rate of up to 90.4% in vivo assessments. RNA sequencing analyses reveal that X&#8208;PDT induces apoptosis in Hepa1&#8208;6 cells while inhibiting cell proliferation, culminating in tumor cell death. Therefore, this work highlights the considerable potential of efficient phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT as a promising therapeutic approach for HCC, providing a highly effective alternative with negligible toxicity for patients with unresectable tumors.

         <title>Two Material Properties from One Wavelength&#8208;Orthogonal Photoresin Enabled by a Monochromatic Laser Integrated Stereolithographic Apparatus (Mono LISA)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single object with dual properties &#8211; degradable and non&#8208;degradable &#8211; is fabricated in a single print simply by switching the printing colors. The advanced multi&#8208;material printing is enabled by the combination of a fully wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photoresin and a monochromatic tunable laser printer, paving the way for precise multi&#8208;material differentiation within a single print.









Abstract
Multi&#8208;material printing has experienced critical advances in recent years, yet material property differentiation capabilities remain limited both with regard to the accessible properties &#8211; typically hard versus soft &#8211; and the achievable magnitude of differentiation. To enhance multi&#8208;material printing capabilities, precise photochemical control during 3D printing is essential. Wavelength&#8208;differentiation is a particularly intriguing concept yet challenging to implement. Notably, dual&#8208;wavelength printing to fabricate hard and soft sections within one object has emerged, where one curing process is insensitive to visible light, while UV irradiation inevitably activates the entire resin, limiting true spatio&#8208;temporal control of the material properties. Until now, pathway&#8208;independent wavelength&#8208;orthogonal printing has not been realized, where each wavelength exclusively triggers only one of two possible reactions, independent of the order in which the wavelengths are applied. Herein, a multi&#8208;wavelength printing technique is introduced employing a tunable laser to monochromatically deliver light to the printing platform loaded with a fully wavelength&#8208;orthogonal resin. Guided by photochemical action plots, two distinct wavelengths &#8211; each highly selective toward a specific photocycloaddtion reaction &#8211; are utilized to generate distinct networks within the photoresin. Ultimately, together with the printing technique, this orthogonally addressable photoresin allows fabricating multi&#8208;material objects with degradable and non&#8208;degradable properties, in a single fabrication step.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Silk&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Spatially Targeted Delivery and Osteochondral Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;gradient silk&#8208;based hydrogel is developed via an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven method to enhance osteochondral regeneration. By integrating biomechanical and biochemical gradients, the hydrogel mimics native tissue architecture, directing site&#8208;specific cell differentiation. Encapsulated TGF&#8208;&#946;1 nanocapsules ensure sustained release, promoting cartilage formation and subchondral bone remodeling, demonstrating its potential for regenerative medicine and targeted therapies.








Abstract
Contemporary clinical interventions for cartilage injuries focus on symptom management through pharmaceuticals and surgical procedures. Recent research has aimed at developing innovative scaffolds with biochemical elements, yet challenges like inadequate targeted delivery and reduced load&#8208;bearing capacity hinder their adoption. Inspired by the spatial gradients of biophysical and biochemical cues in native osteochondral tissues, a silk&#8208;based hydrogel that facilitates spontaneous dual&#8208;gradient formation, including mechanical gradients and growth factor gradients, for tissue regeneration, is presented. Driven by an electrical field, the hydrogel transitions from stiff to soft along the anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode direction, mimicking the anisotropic structure of natural tissues. Simultaneously, incorporated growth factors encapsulated by charged monomers migrate to the cathode region, creating another parallel gradient that enables their sustained release. This design maintains bioactivity and enhances programmable growth factor concentration in the defect environment. In a rabbit model with full&#8208;thickness osteochondral defects, the dual&#8208;gradient hydrogel demonstrates significant potential for promoting osteochondral regeneration, offering a promising tool for clinical translation.

         <dc:description>
Highly cycle&#8208;stable photo&#8208;assisted all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries are successfully designed and constructed based on computational screening of catalytic active fillers and mechanical reinforcement from natural lignocellulose fillers, combined with the coupling mechanism of light&#8208;driven and photoelectrochemical storage. These innovations enable the flexible photo&#8208;assisted pouch battery to achieve a high discharge capacity of 117 mAh g&#8722;1, while maintaining 89.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1 C.








Abstract
The advancement of photo&#8208;assisted rechargeable sodium&#8208;metal batteries with high energy efficiency, lightweight structure, and simplified design is crucial for the growing demand in portable electronics. However, addressing the intrinsic safety concerns of liquid electrolytes and the sluggish reaction kinetics in existing photoelectrochemical storage cathodes (PSCs) remains a significant challenge. In this work, functionalized light&#8208;driven composite solid electrolyte (CSE) fillers are systematically screened, and optimized PSC materials are employed to construct advanced photo&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal battery (PSSMB). To further enhance the mechanical properties and poly(ethylene oxide) compatibility of the CSE, natural lignocellulose is incorporated, enabling the fabrication of flexible PSSMBs. In situ tests and density functional theory calculations reveal that the light&#8208;driven electric field facilitated sodium salt dissociation, reduced interfacial resistance, and improved ionic conductivity (0.1 mS cm&#8722;1). Meanwhile, energy&#8208;level matching of the PSC maximized the utilization of photogenerated carriers, accelerating reaction kinetics and enhancing interface compatibility between the electrolyte and cathode. The resulting flexible pouch&#8208;type PSSMB demonstrates a remarkable discharge capacity of 117 mAh g&#8722;1 and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability, retaining 89.1% of its capacity and achieving an energy storage efficiency of 96.8% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This study highlights a versatile strategy for advancing safe, high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Highly cycle-stable photo-assisted all-solid-state sodium-metal batteries are successfully designed and constructed based on computational screening of catalytic active fillers and mechanical reinforcement from natural lignocellulose fillers, combined with the coupling mechanism of light-driven and photoelectrochemical storage. These innovations enable the flexible photo-assisted pouch battery to achieve a high discharge capacity of 117 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, while maintaining 89.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1 C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advancement of photo-assisted rechargeable sodium-metal batteries with high energy efficiency, lightweight structure, and simplified design is crucial for the growing demand in portable electronics. However, addressing the intrinsic safety concerns of liquid electrolytes and the sluggish reaction kinetics in existing photoelectrochemical storage cathodes (PSCs) remains a significant challenge. In this work, functionalized light-driven composite solid electrolyte (CSE) fillers are systematically screened, and optimized PSC materials are employed to construct advanced photo-assisted solid-state sodium-metal battery (PSSMB). To further enhance the mechanical properties and poly(ethylene oxide) compatibility of the CSE, natural lignocellulose is incorporated, enabling the fabrication of flexible PSSMBs. In situ tests and density functional theory calculations reveal that the light-driven electric field facilitated sodium salt dissociation, reduced interfacial resistance, and improved ionic conductivity (0.1 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Meanwhile, energy-level matching of the PSC maximized the utilization of photogenerated carriers, accelerating reaction kinetics and enhancing interface compatibility between the electrolyte and cathode. The resulting flexible pouch-type PSSMB demonstrates a remarkable discharge capacity of 117 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and outstanding long-term cycling stability, retaining 89.1% of its capacity and achieving an energy storage efficiency of 96.8% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This study highlights a versatile strategy for advancing safe, high-performance solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics. The implementation of valley&#8208;based devices remains challenging in practice. Utilizing the flexibility of phononic crystals in design and fabrication, the long&#8208;desired valley devices, such as filters, valves, and diverters for acoustic waves are reported. The designed devices may serve as a basis for developing advanced valley&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics and offered the prospect for new devices based on valleys. However, the implementation of valley&#8208;based devices remains challenging in practice. Here, by taking advantage of the flexibility of phononic crystals in design and fabrication, the realizations of valley devices, or filters, valves, and diverters for acoustic waves are reported. All the devices are configured as the structures of input and output ports bridged by channels. The phononic crystals serving as ports allow the propagation of both valley polarizations, whereas the phononic crystals serving as channels, as they are narrow, only allow the propagation of single polarizations. For valley filters that achieve valley&#8208;polarized currents, the bridge channel is simply a straight single phononic crystal, but for valley valves that can turn off the valley&#8208;polarized currents, the channel consists of two parts, allowing the propagation of opposite valley polarizations. The valley diverters have one input port, and two output ports, and thus a branched channel, and the three parts in the channel allow the propagation of the same valley polarizations, so that the energy flow can be partitioned. The results may serve as a basis for developing advanced acoustic valley devices.
