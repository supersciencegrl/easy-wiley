      <title>A Low&#8208;Swelling Polymeric Mixed Conductor Operating in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>
Although beneficial to ion transport, swelling can affect the performance and durability of organic mixed conductor devices. This communication presents a hydrophilic conjugated polymer, poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene], comparing its swelling properties to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art glycolated organic semiconductors for bioelectronics. Hydroxyl functionalization of poly(thiophene) backbone minimizes swelling while still allowing good ion uptake, resulting in robust organic electrochemical transistor operation in aqueous electrolytes.








Abstract
Organic mixed conductors find use in batteries, bioelectronics technologies, neuromorphic computing, and sensing. While great progress has been achieved, polymer&#8208;based mixed conductors frequently experience significant volumetric changes during ion uptake/rejection, i.e., during doping/de&#8208;doping and charging/discharging. Although ion dynamics may be enhanced in expanded networks, these volumetric changes can have undesirable consequences, e.g., negatively affecting hole/electron conduction and severely shortening device lifetime. Here, the authors present a new material poly[3&#8208;(6&#8208;hydroxy)hexylthiophene] (P3HHT) that is able to transport ions and electrons/holes, as tested in electrochemical absorption spectroscopy and organic electrochemical transistors, and that exhibits low swelling, attributed to the hydroxylated alkyl side&#8208;chain functionalization. P3HHT displays a thickness change upon passive swelling of only +2.5%, compared to +90% observed for the ubiquitous poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate, and +10 to +15% for polymers such as poly(2&#8208;(3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen]&#8208;5&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (p[g2T&#8208;TT]). Applying a bias pulse during swelling, this discrepancy becomes even more pronounced, with the thickness of P3HHT films changing by &lt;10%&#160;while that of p(g2T&#8208;TT) structures increases by +75 to +80%. Importantly, the initial P3HHT film thickness is essentially restored after de&#8208;doping while p(g2T&#8208;TT) remains substantially swollen. The authors, thus, expand the materials&#8208;design toolbox for the creation of low&#8208;swelling soft mixed conductors with tailored properties and applications in bioelectronics and beyond.

      <title>Transparent Hybrid Opals with Unexpected Strong Resonance&#8208;Enhanced Photothermal Energy Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Optical absorption, being absent in the pure polymer matrix and that with ordered particles, is remarkably amplified in a self&#8208;assembled polymer&#8208;tethered (brush) particles comprised of low contrast constituents. The amplification is shown to be caused by &#8220;photon slowdown&#8221; and to induce rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of materials even in the absence of &#8220;visible&#8221; absorption.








Abstract
Photothermal energy conversion is of fundamental importance to applications ranging from drug delivery to microfluidics and from ablation to fabrication. It typically originates from absorptive processes in materials that&#8212;when coupled with non&#8208;radiative dissipative processes&#8212;allow the conversion of radiative energy into heat. Microstructure design provides versatile strategies for controlling light&#8211;matter interactions. In particular, the deliberate engineering of the band structure in photonic materials is known to be an effective approach to amplify absorption in materials. However, photonic amplification is generally tied to high optical contrast materials which limit the applicability of the concept to metamaterials such as microfabricated metal&#8211;air hybrids. This contribution describes the first observation of pronounced amplification of absorption in low contrast opals formed by the self&#8208;assembly of polymer&#8208;tethered particles. The dependence of the amplification factor on the length scale and degree of order of materials as well as the angle of incidence reveal that it is related to the slow photon effect. A remarkable amplification factor of 16 is shown to facilitate the rapid &#8220;melting&#8221; of opal films even in the absence of &#8220;visible&#8221; absorption. The results point to novel opportunities for tailoring light&#8211;matter interactions in hybrid materials that can benefit the manipulation and fabrication of functional materials.

      <title>Ternary Ta2PdS6 Atomic Layers for an Ultrahigh Broadband Photoresponsive Phototransistor</title>
      <dc:description>
A new 2D material, atomic layer Ta2PdS6, is introduced to the 2D family, and exhibits excellent optoelectronic and electronic performances including an ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 1.42&#160;&#215; 106 A W&#8722;1, photoconductive gain of 2.7&#160;&#215; 106, electron mobility of 25 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, Ion/Ioff ratio of 106 and one&#8208;year air stability, making it a promising 2D material for nano&#8208;electronic and nano&#8208;optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
2D noble&#8208;transition&#8208;metal chalcogenides (NTMCs) are emerging as a promising class of optoelectronic materials due to ultrahigh air stability, large bandgap tunability, and high photoresponse. Here, a new set of 2D NTMC: Ta2PdS6 atomic layers is developed, displaying the excellent comprehensive optoelectronic performance with an ultrahigh photoresponsivity of 1.42&#160;&#215; 106 A W&#8722;1, detectivity of 7.1&#160;&#215; 1010 Jones and a high photoconductive gain of 2.7&#160;&#215; 106 under laser illumination at a wavelength of 633&#160;nm with a power of 0.025 W m&#8722;2, which is ascribed to a photogating effect via study of the device band profiles. Especially, few&#8208;layer Ta2PdS6 exhibits a good broadband photoresponse, ranging from 450&#160;nm in the ultraviolet region to 1450&#160;nm in the shortwave infrared (SIR) region. Moreover, this material also delivers an impressive electronic performance with electron mobility of &#8776;25 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1, Ion/Ioff ratio of 106, and a one&#8208;year air stability, which is better than those of most reported 2D materials. Our&#160;studies underscore Ta2PdS6 as a promising 2D material for nano&#8208;electronic and nano&#8208;optoelectronic applications.

      <title>Persistent Conjugated Backbone and Disordered Lamellar Packing Impart Polymers with Efficient n&#8208;Doping and High Conductivities</title>
      <dc:description>
Two conjugated polymers with rigid planar backbones, but with disordered crystalline structures, exhibit surprising structural tolerance to commonly used n&#8208;dopants. These properties allow both high concentrations and high mobility of the charge carriers to be realized simultaneously in n&#8208;doped polymers, resulting in excellent electrical conductivity of over 90 S cm&#8722;1 and thermoelectric performance up to 106 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable highly conductive polymers are of great interest in emerging electronic applications. For p&#8208;doped polymers, conductivities as high a nearly 105 S cm&#8722;1 have been reported. In the case of n&#8208;doped polymers, they often fall well short of the high values noted above, which might be achievable, if much higher charge&#8208;carrier mobilities determined could be realized in combination with high charge&#8208;carrier densities. This is in part due to inefficient doping and dopant ions disturbing the ordering of polymers, limiting efficient charge transport and ultimately the achievable conductivities. Here, n&#8208;doped polymers that achieve a high conductivity of more than 90 S cm&#8722;1 by a simple solution&#8208;based co&#8208;deposition method are reported. Two conjugated polymers with rigid planar backbones, but with disordered crystalline structures, exhibit surprising structural tolerance to, and excellent miscibility with, commonly used n&#8208;dopants. These properties allow both high concentrations and high mobility of the charge carriers to be realized simultaneously in n&#8208;doped polymers, resulting in excellent electrical conductivity and thermoelectric performance.

      <title>Elucidation of the Synergistic Effect of Dopants and Vacancies on Promoted Selectivity for CO2 Electroreduction to Formate</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel SnO2 nanosheet catalyst presents a possible synergistic effect of N dopants and oxygen vacancies on the activity and selectivity for CO2 electroreduction to formate. Low coordination Sn&#8211;N moieties with optimal N dopants and O vacancies are identified as active sites with intrinsically enhanced activity.








Abstract
Sn&#8208;based materials are identified as promising catalysts for the CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to formate (HCOO&#8722;). However, their insufficient selectivity and activity remain grand challenges. A new type of SnO2 nanosheet with simultaneous N dopants and oxygen vacancies (VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS) for promoting CO2 conversion to HCOO&#8722; is reported. Due to the likely synergistic effect of N dopant and VO, the VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS exhibits high catalytic selectivity featured by an HCOO&#8722; Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 83% at &#8722;0.9 V and an FE of &gt; 90% for all C1 products (HCOO&#8722; and CO) at a wide potential range from &#8722;0.9 to &#8722;1.2 V. Low coordination Sn&#8211;N moieties are the active sites with optimal electronic and geometric structures regulated by VO and N dopants. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the reaction free energy of HCOO* protonation is decreased on the VO&#8208;rich N&#8208;SnO2 NS, thus enhancing HCOO&#8722; selectivity. The weakened H* adsorption energy also inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction, a dominant side reaction during the CO2RR. Furthermore, using the catalyst as the cathode, a spontaneous Galvanic Zn&#8208;CO2 cell and a solar&#8208;powered electrolysis process successfully demonstrated the efficient HCOO&#8722; generation through CO2 conversion and storage.

      <title>Full Concentration Gradient&#8208;Tailored Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A precise elemental gradient design for practical lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) agglomerated spheres is developed, providing a unique tool for the optimization of voltage retention and electrochemical/thermal stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The effects of elemental gradient on the LLOs, especially from a mechanical/electrochemical stress point of view, have been quantitively elucidated for stability evaluation.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) are prospective cathode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but severe voltage decay and energy attenuation with cycling still hinder their practical applications. Herein, a series of full concentration gradient&#8208;tailored agglomerated&#8208;sphere LLOs are designed with linearly decreasing Mn and linearly increasing Ni and Co from the particle center to the surface. The gradient&#8208;tailored LLOs exhibit noticeably reduced voltage decay, enhanced rate performance, improved cycle stability, and thermal stability. Without any material modifications or electrolyte optimizations, the gradient&#8208;tailored LLO with medium&#8208;slope shows the best electrochemical performance, with a very low average voltage decay of 0.8&#160;mV per cycle as well as a capacity retention of 88.4% within 200 cycles at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1. These excellent findings are due to spinel structure suppression, electrochemical stress optimization, and Jahn&#8208;Teller effect inhibition. Further investigation shows that the gradient&#8208;tailored LLO reduces the thermal release percentage by as much as about 41% when the battery is charged to 4.4&#160;V. This study provides an effective method to suppress the voltage decay of LLOs for further practical utilization in LIBs and also puts forward a bulk&#8208;structure design strategy to prepare better electrode materials for different rechargeable batteries.

      <title>Tailored Mesoporous Inorganic Biomaterials: Assembly, Functionalization, and Drug Delivery Engineering</title>
      <dc:description>
Tailored mesoporous inorganic nanocarriers with abundant compositions and structures exhibit unprecedented drug&#8208;loading capacity and sustained responsive release behavior under various stimuli (e.g., pH, redox, temperature, magnetic field, and light), and exceptionally mesoporous structure plays an important role in the diffusion and transport of drug molecules, which will open a new door for drug therapy and new biological nanocarriers.








Abstract
Infectious or immune diseases have caused serious threat to human health due to their complexity and specificity, and emerging drug delivery systems (DDSs) have evolved into the most promising therapeutic strategy for drug&#8208;targeted therapy. Various mesoporous biomaterials are exploited and applied as efficient nanocarriers to loading drugs by virtue of their large surface area, high porosity, and prominent biocompatibility. Nanosized mesoporous nanocarriers show great potential in biomedical research, and it has become the research hotspot in the interdisciplinary field. Herein, recent progress and assembly mechanisms on mesoporous inorganic biomaterials (e.g., silica, carbon, metal oxide) are summarized systematically, and typical functionalization methods (i.e., hybridization, polymerization, and doping) for nanocarriers are also discussed in depth. Particularly, structure&#8211;activity relationship and the effect of physicochemical parameters of mesoporous biomaterials, including morphologies (e.g., hollow, core&#8211;shell), pore textures (e.g., pore size, pore volume), and surface features (e.g., roughness and hydrophilic/hydrophobic) in DDS application are overviewed and elucidated in detail. As one of the important development directions, advanced stimuli&#8208;responsive DDSs (e.g., pH, temperature, redox, ultrasound, light, magnetic field) are highlighted. Finally, the prospect of mesoporous biomaterials in disease therapeutics is stated, and it will open a new spring for the development of mesoporous nanocarriers.

&lt;p&gt;Tailored mesoporous inorganic nanocarriers with abundant compositions and structures exhibit unprecedented drug&#8208;loading capacity and sustained responsive release behavior under various stimuli (e.g., pH, redox, temperature, magnetic field, and light), and exceptionally mesoporous structure plays an important role in the diffusion and transport of drug molecules, which will open a new door for drug therapy and new biological nanocarriers.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infectious or immune diseases have caused serious threat to human health due to their complexity and specificity, and emerging drug delivery systems (DDSs) have evolved into the most promising therapeutic strategy for drug&#8208;targeted therapy. Various mesoporous biomaterials are exploited and applied as efficient nanocarriers to loading drugs by virtue of their large surface area, high porosity, and prominent biocompatibility. Nanosized mesoporous nanocarriers show great potential in biomedical research, and it has become the research hotspot in the interdisciplinary field. Herein, recent progress and assembly mechanisms on mesoporous inorganic biomaterials (e.g., silica, carbon, metal oxide) are summarized systematically, and typical functionalization methods (i.e., hybridization, polymerization, and doping) for nanocarriers are also discussed in depth. Particularly, structure&#8211;activity relationship and the effect of physicochemical parameters of mesoporous biomaterials, including morphologies (e.g., hollow, core&#8211;shell), pore textures (e.g., pore size, pore volume), and surface features (e.g., roughness and hydrophilic/hydrophobic) in DDS application are overviewed and elucidated in detail. As one of the important development directions, advanced stimuli&#8208;responsive DDSs (e.g., pH, temperature, redox, ultrasound, light, magnetic field) are highlighted. Finally, the prospect of mesoporous biomaterials in disease therapeutics is stated, and it will open a new spring for the development of mesoporous nanocarriers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recent Advances and Perspectives on Calcium&#8208;Ion Storage: Key Materials and Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Ca&#8208;ion based technologies are attractive for low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance energy storage, while their development is currently far from practical applications. An overview of the key electrode materials for Ca2+ storage and a comprehensive insight of promising optimization strategies such as multi&#8208;ion strategy are critical to promote further development of Ca2+ technologies.








Abstract
The urgent demand for cost&#8208;effective energy storage devices for large&#8208;scale applications has led to the development of several beyond&#8208;lithium energy storage systems (EESs). Among them, calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) are attractive due to abundant calcium resources, excellent volumetric and gravimetric capacities of Ca metal anode, and potential high energy density coming from the multivalent feature of Ca&#8208;ion. Therefore, the exploration of CIBs electrode materials and the construction of CIBs devices are gaining increasing research interest. Relevant publications cover a wide range of materials by both theoretical and experimental investigations, whereas the performances of rocking&#8208;chair CIBs have been unsatisfactory. Meanwhile, multi&#8208;ion strategies using more than one ion as the charge carrier have been demonstrated to be feasible and promising options in realizing room temperature CIBs. The summary and reflection of previous studies would provide useful information for future exploration and optimization. In this circumstance, this paper overviews the reported CIBs electrode materials, including both anode and cathode, and presents the latest progress of multi&#8208;ion strategies in CIBs. Fundamental challenges, potential solutions, and opportunities are accordingly proposed, mimicking other more mature EESs. This review may promote the development of electrode materials and accelerate the construction of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance CIBs.

      <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Ti3C2Tx MXene Antennas for Radio&#8208;Frequency Communication</title>
      <dc:description>
MXene microstrip patch antennas with ultrahigh&#8208;power radiation in a wide frequency range are fabricated by spray&#8208;coating. The radiation efficiency of a 5.5&#160;&#181;m thick MXene patch antenna reaches 99% at 16.4&#160;GHz, which is about the same as that of a 35&#160;&#181;m thick copper patch antenna. MXene outperforms all other materials evaluated for patch antennas to date.








Abstract
Highly integrated, flexible, and ultrathin wireless communication components are in significant demand due to the explosive growth of portable and wearable electronic devices in the fifth&#8208;generation (5G) network era, but only conventional metals meet the requirements for emerging radio&#8208;frequency (RF) devices so far. Here, it is reported on Ti3C2Tx MXene microstrip transmission lines with low&#8208;energy attenuation and patch antennas with high&#8208;power radiation at frequencies from 5.6 to 16.4&#160;GHz. The radiation efficiency of a 5.5&#160;&#181;m thick MXene patch antenna manufactured by spray&#8208;coating from aqueous solution reaches 99% at 16.4&#160;GHz, which is about the same as that of a standard 35&#160;&#181;m thick copper patch antenna at about 15% of its thickness and 7% of the copper weight. MXene outperforms all other materials evaluated for patch antennas to date. Moreover, it is demonstrated that an MXene patch antenna array with integrated feeding circuits on a conformal surface has comparable performance with that of a copper antenna array at 28&#160;GHz, which is a target frequency in practical 5G applications. The versatility of MXene antennas in wide frequency ranges coupled with the flexibility, scalability, and ease of solution processing makes MXene promising for integrated RF components in various flexible electronic devices.

      <title>Imaging Cellular Aerobic Glycolysis using Carbon Dots for Early Warning of Tumorigenesis</title>
      <dc:description>
The occurrence of aerobic glycolysis based on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)&#8208;induced enhancement of fluorescence emitted by nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots is revealed by a new strategy. This can be used to monitor the occurrence of tumorigenesis and provide an early warning of tumor formation with high accuracy and specificity.








Abstract
Early warning of tumor formation is crucial for the classification, treatment, and prognosis of tumor patients. Here, a new strategy is reported, aimed at realizing this goal based on imaging aerobic glycolysis processes using nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dots (N&#8208;CDs) as fluorescent probes. The intensity of the photoluminescence emitted by the N&#8208;CDs is specifically enhanced by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+, oxidized) in the physiological environment. The N&#8208;CDs allow a few (five to ten) abnormal cells in spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma models to be identified before the in situ development of tumor tissue. The N&#8208;CD probes can also distinguish tumor cells from normal cells and be used to evaluate their proliferation activity (with a specificity of up to 96.15% in 13 types of tumor cells and 90.90% in orthotopic xenograft models). The N&#8208;CDs are successfully used to monitor the invasion of tumor cells into neighboring tissues and body fluids in 49 clinical samples (with a sensitivity up to 79.31%). These included three vitreous body samples (from patients with retinoblastoma), 42 urine samples (22 patients clinically diagnosed with urothelium carcinoma and 20 healthy persons), and four hydrothorax samples (from patients with metastatic lesions).

      <title>Observation of Standing Spin Waves in a van der Waals Magnetic Material</title>
      <dc:description>
Standing spin&#8208;wave modes are reported in a van der Waals magnetic material. These modes travel along the CrCl3 sample thickness of 20 mm and are reflected at the boundaries. These spin waves can be useful for creating tunable van der Waals magnonic devices operating at GHz frequencies.








Abstract
Spin waves are studied for data storage, communication, and logic circuits in the field of spintronics based on their potential to substitute electrons. The recent discovery of magnetism in 2D systems such as monolayer CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6 has led to a renewed interest in such applications of magnetism in the 2D limit. Here, direct evidence of standing spin waves is presented along with the uniform precessional resonance modes in the van der Waals magnetic material, CrCl3. This is the first direct observation of standing spin&#8208;wave modes, set up along a thickness of 20&#160;mm, in a van der Waals material. Standing spin waves are detected in the vicinity of both branches, optical and acoustic, of the antiferromagnetic resonance. Magnon&#8211;magnon coupling and softening of resonance modes with temperature enable extraction of interlayer exchange field as a function of temperature.

      <title>Electrochemical Delamination of Ultralarge Few&#8208;Layer Black Phosphorus with a Hydrogen&#8208;Free Intercalation Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultralarge few&#8208;layer black&#8208;phosphorus single crystals are obtained with a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical exfoliation mechanism using CH3COOTBA intercalation. The largest size is up to 119 &#181;m with an average around at 77.6 &#177; 15.0 &#181;m. A high hole mobility of 76 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, and a broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850 nm with ultrahigh responsivity are achieved at 298 K.








Abstract
Due to strong interlayer interaction and ease of oxidation issues of black phosphorus (BP), the domain size of artificial synthesized few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FL&#8208;BP) crystals is often below 10&#160;&#181;m, which extremely limits its further applications in large&#8208;area thin&#8208;film devices and integrated circuits. Herein, a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical delamination strategy through weak Lewis acid intercalation enabled exfoliation is developed to produce ultralarge FL&#8208;BP single&#8208;crystalline domains with high quality. The interaction between the weak Lewis acid tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium acetate (CH3COOTBA) and P atoms promotes the average domain size of FL&#8208;BP crystal up to 77.6&#160;&#177; 15.0&#160;&#181;m and the largest domain size is found to be as large as 119&#160;&#181;m. The presence of H+ and H2O is found to sharply decrease the size of as&#8208;exfoliated FL&#8208;BP flakes. The electronic transport measurements show that the delaminated FL&#8208;BP crystals exhibit a high hole mobility of 76 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and an on/off ratio of 103 at 298 K. A broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850&#160;nm with ultrahigh responsivity is achieved. This work provides a scalable, simple, and low&#8208;cost approach for large&#8208;area BP films that meet industrial requirements for nanodevices applications.

&lt;p&gt;Due to strong interlayer interaction and ease of oxidation issues of black phosphorus (BP), the domain size of artificial synthesized few&#8208;layer black phosphorus (FL&#8208;BP) crystals is often below 10&#160;&#181;m, which extremely limits its further applications in large&#8208;area thin&#8208;film devices and integrated circuits. Herein, a hydrogen&#8208;free electrochemical delamination strategy through weak Lewis acid intercalation enabled exfoliation is developed to produce ultralarge FL&#8208;BP single&#8208;crystalline domains with high quality. The interaction between the weak Lewis acid tetra&#8208;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;butylammonium acetate (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOTBA) and P atoms promotes the average domain size of FL&#8208;BP crystal up to 77.6&#160;&#177; 15.0&#160;&#181;m and the largest domain size is found to be as large as 119&#160;&#181;m. The presence of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is found to sharply decrease the size of as&#8208;exfoliated FL&#8208;BP flakes. The electronic transport measurements show that the delaminated FL&#8208;BP crystals exhibit a high hole mobility of 76 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an on/off ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 298 K. A broadband photoresponse from 532 to 1850&#160;nm with ultrahigh responsivity is achieved. This work provides a scalable, simple, and low&#8208;cost approach for large&#8208;area BP films that meet industrial requirements for nanodevices applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide Driven by the Intrinsic Defects in the Carbon Plane of a Single Fe&#8211;N4 Site</title>
      <dc:description>
The outstanding electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction activity of the intrinsic defect in a carbon&#8208;based catalyst containing a single Fe&#8211;N4 site is highlighted. Benefiting from its immunity for the adsorbed intermediates, such as *CO, as well as the enhanced intrinsic activity after incorporating with the Fe&#8211;N4 site, the intrinsic defect acts as the real active center for carbon dioxide reduction and outperforms single Fe&#8211;N4 centers.








Abstract
Manipulating the in&#8208;plane defects of metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon catalysts to regulate the electroreduction reaction of CO2 (CO2RR) remains a challenging task. Here, it is demonstrated that the activity of the intrinsic carbon defects can be dramatically improved through coupling with single&#8208;atom Fe&#8211;N4 sites. The resulting catalyst delivers a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency of 90% and a CO partial current density of 33&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1 m KHCO3. The remarkable enhancements are maintained in concentrated electrolyte, endowing a rechargeable Zn&#8211;CO2 battery with a high CO selectivity of 86.5% at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Further analysis suggests that the intrinsic defect is the active sites for CO2RR, instead of the Fe&#8211;N4 center. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Fe&#8211;N4 coupled intrinsic defect exhibits a reduced energy barrier for CO2RR and suppresses the hydrogen evolution activity. The high intrinsic activity, coupled with fast electron&#8208;transfer capability and abundant exposed active sites, induces excellent electrocatalytic performance.

      <title>Plant Nanobionic Sensors for Arsenic Detection</title>
      <dc:description>
Exploiting the natural ability of plants to pre&#8208;concentrate and extract arsenite from the belowground environment, a living plant nanobionic sensor is engineered for non&#8208;destructive arsenite monitoring. By embedding near&#8208;infrared fluorescent nanosensors within the mesophyll, living plants are converted into environmental sensors for real&#8208;time arsenite detection. This demonstration opens new frontiers for plant&#8208;based sensors in environmental monitoring and food safety research.








Abstract
Arsenic is a highly toxic heavy&#8208;metal pollutant which poses a significant health risk to humans and other ecosystems. In this work, the natural ability of wild&#8208;type plants to pre&#8208;concentrate and extract arsenic from the belowground environment is exploited to engineer plant nanobionic sensors for real&#8208;time arsenic detection. Near&#8208;infrared fluorescent nanosensors are specifically designed for sensitive and selective detection of arsenite. These optical nanosensors are embedded in plant tissues to non&#8208;destructively access and monitor the internal dynamics of arsenic taken up by the plants via the roots. The integration of optical nanosensors with living plants enables the conversion of plants into self&#8208;powered autosamplers of arsenic from their environment. Arsenite detection is demonstrated with three different plant species as nanobionic sensors. Based on an experimentally validated kinetic model, the nanobionic sensor could detect 0.6 and 0.2 ppb levels of arsenic after 7 and 14 days respectively by exploiting the natural ability of Pteris cretica ferns to hyperaccumulate and tolerate exceptionally high level of arsenic. The sensor readout could also be interfaced with portable electronics at a standoff distance, potentially enabling applications in environmental monitoring and agronomic research.

      <title>Quasi&#8208;Epitaxial Growth of Magnetic Nanostructures on 4H&#8208;Au Nanoribbons</title>
      <dc:description>
Crystal&#8208;phase engineering of Co and Ni nanostructures is reported, which is realized by quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth on 4H&#8208;Au nanoribbons. Notably, a new phase of Co, namely 14H, is formed due to the generation of ordered misfit dislocations in the grown Co nanostructures. The as&#8208;prepared 14H&#8208;Co nanostructures are ferromagnetic at room temperature.








Abstract
Phase engineering of nanomaterials is an effective strategy to tune the physicochemical properties of nanomaterials for various promising applications. Herein, by using the 4H&#8208;Au nanoribbons as templates, four novel magnetic nanostructures, namely 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanobranches, 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanoribbons, 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;2H&#8208;Co nanoribbons, and 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;2H&#8208;Ni nanoribbons, are synthesized based on the quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth. Different from the conventional epitaxial growth of metal nanomaterials, the obtained Co and Ni nanostructures possess different crystal phases from the Au template. Due to the large lattice mismatch between Au and the grown metals (i.e., Co and Ni), ordered misfit dislocations are generated at the Co/Au and Ni/Au interfaces. Notably, a new super&#8208;structure of Co is formed, denoted as 14H. Both 4H&#8208;Au&#8202;@&#8202;14H&#8208;Co nanobranches and nanoribbons are ferromagnetic at room temperature, showing similar Curie temperature. However, their magnetic behaviors exhibit distinct temperature dependence, resulting from the competition between spin and volume fluctuations as well as the unique geometry. This work paves the way to the templated synthesis of nanomaterials with unconventional crystal phases for the exploration of phase&#8208;dependent properties.

      <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries with a Limited Lithium Metal Anode at Room Temperature using a Garnet&#8208;Based Electrolyte</title>
      <dc:description>
Owing to the stability between lithium metal and a garnet&#8208;type solid electrolyte, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are proved to possess longer cycling life than that of liquid&#8208;state LMBs under limited lithium anode condition. Moreover, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs with long cycling life using a limited lithium metal anode are achieved at room temperature through a hybrid solid&#8208;state electrolyte design.








Abstract
Metallic lithium (Li), considered as the ultimate anode, is expected to promise high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries. However, owing to the continuous Li consumption during the repeated Li plating/stripping cycling, excess amount of the Li metal anode is commonly utilized in lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs), leading to reduced energy density and increased cost. Here, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery (ASSLMB) based on a garnet&#8208;oxide solid electrolyte with an ultralow negative/positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P ratio) is reported. Compared with the counterpart using a liquid electrolyte at the same low N/P ratios, ASSLMBs show longer cycling life, which is attributed to the higher Coulombic efficiency maintained during cycling. The effect of the species of the interface layer on the cycling performance of ASSLMBs with low N/P ratio is also studied.

     alt="All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries with a Limited Lithium Metal Anode at Room Temperature using a Garnet&#8208;Based Electrolyte"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to the stability between lithium metal and a garnet&#8208;type solid electrolyte, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are proved to possess longer cycling life than that of liquid&#8208;state LMBs under limited lithium anode condition. Moreover, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs with long cycling life using a limited lithium metal anode are achieved at room temperature through a hybrid solid&#8208;state electrolyte design.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metallic lithium (Li), considered as the ultimate anode, is expected to promise high&#8208;energy rechargeable batteries. However, owing to the continuous Li consumption during the repeated Li plating/stripping cycling, excess amount of the Li metal anode is commonly utilized in lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs), leading to reduced energy density and increased cost. Here, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery (ASSLMB) based on a garnet&#8208;oxide solid electrolyte with an ultralow negative/positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P ratio) is reported. Compared with the counterpart using a liquid electrolyte at the same low N/P ratios, ASSLMBs show longer cycling life, which is attributed to the higher Coulombic efficiency maintained during cycling. The effect of the species of the interface layer on the cycling performance of ASSLMBs with low N/P ratio is also studied. Importantly, it is demonstrated that the ASSLMB using a limited Li metal anode paired with a LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathode (5.9 N/P ratio) delivers a stable long&#8208;term cycling performance at room temperature. Furthermore, it is revealed that enhanced specific energies for ASSLMBs with low N/P ratios can be further achieved by the use of a high&#8208;voltage or high mass&#8208;loading cathode. This study sheds light on the practical high&#8208;energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries under the constrained condition of a limited Li metal anode.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Solution&#8208;Processed All&#8208;Ceramic Plasmonic Metamaterials for Efficient Solar&#8211;Thermal Conversion over 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C</title>
      <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed large&#8208;area plasmonic metamaterial with all&#8208;ceramic components is demonstrated to achieve high solar absorption but low IR emission over 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C, leading to higher solar&#8211;thermal conversion efficiency than vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers. Accompanied by its great thermal stability (727&#160;&#176;C) and low cost (&lt;1.6&#160;USD&#160;m&#8722;2), the versatile metamaterial will benefit both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature solar&#8211;thermal systems.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;area solar&#8211;thermal absorbers with superior spectral selectivity and excellent thermal stability are vital for efficient and large&#8208;scale solar&#8211;thermal conversion applications, such as space heating, desalination, ice mitigation, photothermal catalysis, and concentrating solar power. Few state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art selective absorbers are qualified for both low&#8208; (&lt;200&#160;&#176;C) and high&#8208;temperature (&gt;600&#160;&#176;C) applications due to insufficient spectral selectivity or thermal stability over a wide temperature range. Here, a high&#8208;performance plasmonic metamaterial selective absorber is developed by facile solution&#8208;based processes via assembling an ultrathin (&#8776;120&#160;nm) titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticle film on a TiN mirror. Enabled by the synergetic in&#8208;plane plasmon and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonances, the all&#8208;ceramic plasmonic metamaterial simultaneously achieves high, full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption (95%), low mid&#8208;IR emission (3% at 100&#160;&#176;C), and excellent stability over a temperature range of 100&#8211;727&#160;&#176;C, even outperforming most vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers at their specific operating temperatures. The competitive performance of the solution&#8208;processed absorber is accompanied by a significant cost reduction compared with vacuum&#8208;deposited absorbers. All these merits render it a cost&#8208;effective, universal solution to offering high efficiency (89&#8211;93%) for both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature solar&#8211;thermal applications.

      <title>Lifshitz Transition and Non&#8208;Fermi Liquid Behavior in Highly Doped Semimetals</title>
      <dc:description>
A physical model to quantitatively explain the Lifshitz transition and non&#8208;Fermi liquid behavior in highly doped monoclinic Nb2Se3 is reported. Based on Hall and magnetoresistance measurements, the two&#8208;band Drude model, and first&#8208;principles calculations, the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity can be quantitatively determined by the chemical potential shift under the framework of Fermi liquid theory.








Abstract
The classical Fermi liquid theory and Drude model have provided fundamental ways to understand the resistivity of most metals. The violation of the classical theory, known as non&#8208;Fermi liquid (NFL) transport, appears in certain metals, including topological semimetals, but quantitative understanding of the NFL behavior has not yet been established. In particular, the determination of the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity, a sign of NFL behavior, remains a puzzling issue. Here, a physical model to quantitatively explain the Lifshitz transition and NFL behavior in highly doped (a carrier density of &#8776;1022 cm&#8722;3) monoclinic Nb2Se3 is reported. Hall and magnetoresistance measurements, the two&#8208;band Drude model, and first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate an apparent chemical potential shift by temperature in monoclinic Nb2Se3, which induces a Lifshitz transition and NFL behavior in the material. Accordingly, the non&#8208;quadratic temperature exponent in the resistivity can be quantitatively determined by the chemical potential shift under the framework of Fermi liquid theory. This model provides a new experimental insight for nontrivial transport with NFL behavior or sign inversion of Seebeck coefficients in emerging materials.

      <title>Mutually Reinforced Polymer&#8211;Graphene Bilayer Membranes for Energy&#8208;Efficient Acoustic Transduction</title>
      <dc:description>
To fabricate ultrahigh&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio, lightweight, and transparent conductive membranes, single&#8208;layer graphene is reinforced by high&#8208;performance polyetherimide to form a laminate bilayer. The bilayer is exceptionally strong, lightweight, transparent, and conductive and has a record&#8208;high aspect ratio of 1 &#215; 105. As an acoustic transducer in a prototype electrostatic speaker, the bilayer consumes 100 times less energy than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodynamic speakers.








Abstract
Graphene holds promise for thin, ultralightweight, and high&#8208;performance nanoelectromechanical transducers. However, graphene&#8208;only devices are limited in size due to fatigue and fracture of suspended graphene membranes. Here, a lightweight, flexible, transparent, and conductive bilayer composite of polyetherimide and single&#8208;layer graphene is prepared and suspended on the centimeter scale with an unprecedentedly high aspect ratio of 105. The coupling of the two components leads to mutual reinforcement and creates an ultrastrong membrane that supports 30&#160;000 times its own weight. Upon electromechanical actuation, the membrane pushes a massive amount of air and generates high&#8208;quality acoustic sound. The energy efficiency is &#8776;10&#8211;100&#160;times better than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodynamic speakers. The bilayer membrane's combined properties of electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, optical transparency, thermal stability, and chemical resistance will promote applications in electronics, mechanics, and optics.

      <title>Guest Encapsulation within Surface&#8208;Adsorbed Self&#8208;Assembled Cages</title>
      <dc:description>
The adsorption of two metal&#8211;organic coordination capsules on alumina is quantified and the cages are shown to retain their ability to bind and release a molecular cargo following immobilization. The adsorbed cages are then used to stabilize the reagents of a Diels&#8211;Alder reaction prior to their subsequent release and reaction.








Abstract
Coordination cages encapsulate a wide variety of guests in the solution state. This ability renders them useful for applications such as catalysis and the sequestration of precious materials. A simple and general method for the immobilization of coordination cages on alumina is reported. Cage loadings are quantified via adsorption isotherms and guest displacement assays demonstrate that the adsorbed cages retain the ability to encapsulate and separate guest and non&#8208;guest molecules. Finally, a system of two cages, adsorbed on to different regions of alumina, stabilizes and separates a pair of Diels&#8211;Alder reagents. The addition of a single competitive guest results in the controlled release of the reagents, thus triggering their reaction. This method of coordination cage immobilization on solid phases is envisaged to be applicable to the extensive library of reported cages, enabling new applications based upon selective solid&#8208;phase molecular encapsulation.

Abstract
Harvesting solar energy in the form of electricity from the photosynthesis of plants, algal cells, and bacteria has been researched as the most environment&#8208;friendly renewable energy technology in the last decade. The primary challenge has been the engineering of electrochemical interfacing with photosynthetic apparatuses, organelles, or whole cells. However, with the aid of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, there have been many advances, including enhanced photon absorption, increased generation of photosynthetic electrons (PEs), and more efficient transfer of PEs to electrodes. These advances have demonstrated the possibility for the technology to advance to a new level. In this article, the fundamentals of photosynthesis are introduced. How PE harvesting systems have improved concerning solar energy absorption, PE production, and PE collection by electrodes is discussed. The review focuses on how different kinds of nanomaterials are applied and function in interfacing with photosynthetic materials for enhanced PE harvesting. Finally, the review analyzes how the performance of PE harvesting and stand&#8208;alone systems have evolved so far and its future prospects.

      <dc:description>
Many active materials used in shape&#8208;morphing are capable of stretching or contracting along a director field. In article number 2004515, Beno&#238;t Roman and co&#8208;workers show that texturing this field in zigzag patterns provides an extended family of deformation, opening a larger parameter space for shape control. This concept can be applied to any anisotropically responsive material.

      <title>Cancer Immunotherapy: Biomineralized Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles Potentiate Safe and Efficient Tumor Microenvironment Reprogramming for Anticancer Therapy (Adv. Mater. 47/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2002085, Wei Wei, Guanghui Ma, and co&#8208;workers develop an outer membrane vesicle (OMV)&#8208;based platform for tumor immunotherapy. After demonstrating OMVs from Escherichia coli BL21 have a strong ability for reprogramming the tumor microenvironment (TME), calcium phosphate shells are employed to cover the OMV surface. Such a &#8220;shielding&#8221; strategy not only enables the safe use of the OMVs via intravenous injection, but also brings an additional functionality of neutralizing the acidic TME. Moreover, the outer shells can also be integrated with functional components to further enhance the therapeutic effect for highly intractable tumors.

      <title>Additive Manufacturing: Highly Tunable Thiol&#8208;Ene Photoresins for Volumetric Additive Manufacturing (Adv. Mater. 47/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) is an emerging approach for photopolymer&#8208;based 3D printing that produces complex 3D structures in a single step, rather than from layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly. In article number 2003376, Maxim Shusteff and co&#8208;workers adapt thiol&#8208;ene resins for VAM by incorporating a threshold response using a polymerization inhibitor. Due do the uniform thiol&#8208;ene network formation, a broad range of mechanical properties can be accessed.

&lt;p&gt;Volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) is an emerging approach for photopolymer&#8208;based 3D printing that produces complex 3D structures in a single step, rather than from layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202003376"&gt;2003376&lt;/a&gt;, Maxim Shusteff and co&#8208;workers adapt thiol&#8208;ene resins for VAM by incorporating a threshold response using a polymerization inhibitor. Due do the uniform thiol&#8208;ene network formation, a broad range of mechanical properties can be accessed.

      <title>Fullerene Desymmetrization as a Means to Achieve Single&#8208;Enantiomer Electron Acceptors with Maximized Chiroptical Responsiveness</title>
      <dc:description>
The isomeric complexity of a common organic fullerene electron acceptor is resolved, giving ten enantiomeric pairs across six bond types with different chiroptical response. Single&#8208;enantiomer fullerene transistor devices discriminate circularly polarized light with a fast light response and very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor (up to gph&#160;= 1.2&#160;&#177; 0.06).








Abstract
Solubilized fullerene derivatives have revolutionized the development of organic photovoltaic devices, acting as excellent electron acceptors. The addition of solubilizing addends to the fullerene cage results in a large number of isomers, which are generally employed as isomeric mixtures. Moreover, a significant number of these isomers are chiral, which further adds to the isomeric complexity. The opportunities presented by single&#8208;isomer, and particularly single&#8208;enantiomer, fullerenes in organic electronic materials and devices are poorly understood however. Here, ten pairs of enantiomers are separated from the 19 structural isomers of bis[60]phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester, using them to elucidate important chiroptical relationships and demonstrating their application to a circularly polarized light (CPL)&#8208;detecting device. Larger chiroptical responses are found, occurring through the inherent chirality of the fullerene. When used in a single&#8208;enantiomer organic field&#8208;effect transistor, the potential to discriminate CPL with a fast light response time and with a very high photocurrent dissymmetry factor (gph&#160;= 1.27 &#177; 0.06)&#160;is demonstrated. This study thus provides key strategies to design fullerenes with large chiroptical responses for use as chiral components of organic electronic devices. It is anticipated that this data will position chiral fullerenes as an exciting material class for the growing field of chiral electronic technologies.

      <title>High Color&#8208;Rendering Index and Stable White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes by Assembling Two Broadband Emissive Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons</title>
      <dc:description>
Stable and highly luminescent CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5 composites are synthesized through a one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating method. They exhibit white&#8208;light emission through self&#8208;trapped excitons, as well as cold/warm white&#8208;light tuning. By using the composites as a white&#8208;light emitter, electrically driven cold/warm tunable WLEDs with a record color&#8208;rendering index of 91.6 are successfully demonstrated, and a long half&#8208;lifetime of 238.5 min is achieved.








Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) are promising next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state light sources. However, the commercialization route for WLED production suffers from challenges in terms of insufficient color&#8208;rendering index (CRI), color instability, and incorporation of rare&#8208;earth elements. Herein, a new two&#8208;component strategy is developed by assembling two broadband emissive materials with self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) for high CRI and stable WLEDs. The strategy addresses effectively the challenging issues facing current WLEDs. Based on first&#8208;principles thermodynamic calculations, copper&#8208;based ternary halides composites, CsCu2I3@Cs3Cu2I5, are synthesized by a facile one&#8208;step solution approach. The composites exhibit an ideal white&#8208;light emission with a cold/warm white&#8208;light tuning and a robust stability against heat, ultraviolet light, and environmental oxygen/moisture. A series of cold/warm tunable WLEDs is demonstrated with a maximum luminance of 145&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and an external quantum efficiency of 0.15%, and a record high CRI of 91.6 is achieved, which is the highest value for lead&#8208;free WLEDs. Importantly, the fabricated device demonstrates an excellent operation stability in a continuous current mode, exhibiting a long half&#8208;lifetime of 238.5&#160;min. The results promise the use of the hybrids of STEs&#8208;derived broadband emissive materials for high&#8208;performance WLEDs.

      <title>A Wearable Nutrition Tracker</title>
      <dc:description>
A wearable nutrient tracker that allows monitoring of vitamin C in sweat, along with urine and blood, to assist tracking users&#8217; nutritional status is demonstrated. A longitudinal study is performed on two individuals to explore correlations of vitamin C concentrations in sweat and urine with blood. It has promising potential applications in nutritional assessment and dietary intervention.








Abstract
Nutrients are essential for the healthy development and proper maintenance of body functions in humans. For adequate nourishment, it is important to keep track of nutrients level in the body, apart from consuming sufficient nutrition that is in line with dietary guidelines. Sweat, which contains rich chemical information, is an attractive biofluid for routine non&#8208;invasive assessment of nutrient levels. Herein, a wearable sensor that can selectively measure vitamin C concentration in biofluids, including sweat, urine, and blood is developed. Detection through an electrochemical sensor modified with Au nanostructures, LiClO4&#8208;doped conductive polymer, and an enzymes&#8208;immobilized membrane is utilized to achieve wide detection linearity, high selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. The sensor allows monitoring of temporal changes in vitamin C levels. The effect of vitamin C intake on the sweat and urine profile is explored by monitoring concentration changes upon consuming different amounts of vitamin C. A longitudinal study of sweat's and urine's vitamin C correlation with blood is performed on two individuals. The results suggest that sweat and urine analysis can be a promising method to routinely monitor nutrition through the sweat sensor and that this sensor can facilitate applications such as nutritional screening and dietary intervention.

      <title>Manipulating the Solvation Structure of Nonflammable Electrolyte and Interface to Enable Unprecedented Stability of Graphite Anodes beyond 2 Years for Safe Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Nonflammable electrolytes show great advantages over conventional electrolytes in terms of both safety and performance, exhibiting high compatibility with graphite electrodes with the longest cycling performance (&gt;2 years). The electrolyte structure and derived F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase jointly contribute to the superlong cycling stability of graphite electrode, which highlights the importance of the electrolyte compatibility and the interface.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are attractive for low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale energy storage applications, in which graphite is one of the most promising anodes. However, the large size and the high activity of K+ ions and the highly catalytic surface of graphite largely prevent the development of safe and compatible electrolytes. Here, a nonflammable, moderate&#8208;concentration electrolyte is reported that is highly compatible with graphite anodes and that consists of fire&#8208;retardant trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (KFSI) in a salt/solvent molar ratio of 3:8. It shows unprecedented stability, as evidenced by its 74% capacity retention over 24 months of cycling (over 2000 cycles) at the 0.2 C current rate. Electrolyte structure and surface analyses show that this excellent cycling stability is due to the nearly 100% solvation of TMP molecules with K+ cations and the formation of FSI&#8722;&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which effectively suppresses the decomposition of the solvent molecules toward the graphite anode. Furthermore, excellent performance on high&#8208;mass loaded graphite electrodes and in a full cell with perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride cathode is demonstrated. This study highlights the importance of the compatibility of both electrolyte and the interface, and offers new opportunities to design the electrolyte&#8211;SEI nexus for safe and practical PIBs.

      <title>Layered PtSe2 for Sensing, Photonic, and (Opto&#8208;)Electronic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Layered PtSe2 holds great promise for industries benefiting from its exciting physical and chemical properties, high air&#8208;stability, and semiconductor&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible fabrication methods. An overview of the use of PtSe2 for applications in photonics, (opto&#8208;)electronics, and sensors is provided. Challenges associated with the synthesis and integration of PtSe2, and the outlook for industry adoption of this material, are discussed.








Abstract
Since the first experimental discovery of graphene 16 years ago, many other 2D layered nanomaterials have been reported. However, the majority of 2D nanostructures suffer from relatively complicated fabrication processes that have bottlenecked their development and their uptake by industry for practical applications. Here, the recent progress in sensing, photonic, and (opto&#8208;)electronic applications of PtSe2, a 2D layered material that is likely to be used in industries benefiting from its high air&#8208;stability and semiconductor&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible fabrication methods, is reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of a range of synthesis methods for PtSe2 are initially compared, followed by a discussion of its outstanding properties, and industrial and commercial advantages. Research focused on the broadband nonlinear photonic properties of PtSe2, as well as reports of its use as a saturable absorber in ultrafast lasers, are then reviewed. Additionally, the advances that have been achieved in a range of PtSe2&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, and sensors are summarized. Finally, a conclusion on these results along with the outlook for the future is presented.

&lt;p&gt;Layered PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; holds great promise for industries benefiting from its exciting physical and chemical properties, high air&#8208;stability, and semiconductor&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible fabrication methods. An overview of the use of PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for applications in photonics, (opto&#8208;)electronics, and sensors is provided. Challenges associated with the synthesis and integration of PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and the outlook for industry adoption of this material, are discussed.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the first experimental discovery of graphene 16 years ago, many other 2D layered nanomaterials have been reported. However, the majority of 2D nanostructures suffer from relatively complicated fabrication processes that have bottlenecked their development and their uptake by industry for practical applications. Here, the recent progress in sensing, photonic, and (opto&#8208;)electronic applications of PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a 2D layered material that is likely to be used in industries benefiting from its high air&#8208;stability and semiconductor&#8208;technology&#8208;compatible fabrication methods, is reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of a range of synthesis methods for PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are initially compared, followed by a discussion of its outstanding properties, and industrial and commercial advantages. Research focused on the broadband nonlinear photonic properties of PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as reports of its use as a saturable absorber in ultrafast lasers, are then reviewed. Additionally, the advances that have been achieved in a range of PtSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors, photodetectors, and sensors are summarized. Finally, a conclusion on these results along with the outlook for the future is presented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Indium Nitride at the 2D Limit</title>
      <dc:description>
A bilayer of InN is formed between graphene and SiC by an intercalation process. The coverage of the SiC surface is very high, above 90%. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements prove a bandgap value of 2&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;eV for the 2D InN.








Abstract
The properties of 2D InN are predicted to substantially differ from the bulk crystal. The predicted appealing properties relate to strong in&#8208; and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane excitons, high electron mobility, efficient strain engineering of their electronic and optical properties, and strong application potential in gas sensing. Until now, the realization of 2D InN remained elusive. In this work, the formation of 2D InN and measurements of its bandgap are reported. Bilayer InN is formed between graphene and SiC by an intercalation process in metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). The thickness uniformity of the intercalated structure is investigated by conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM) and the structural properties by atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The coverage of the SiC surface is very high, above 90%, and a major part of the intercalated structure is represented by two sub&#8208;layers of indium (In) bonded to nitrogen (N). Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements give a bandgap value of 2&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;eV for the 2D InN. The stabilization of 2D InN with a pragmatic wide bandgap and high lateral uniformity of intercalation is demonstrated.

      <title>MXenes for Rechargeable Batteries Beyond the Lithium&#8208;Ion</title>
      <dc:description>
MXene and MXene&#8208;based materials are promising for emerging battery technologies beyond lithium ion batteries (including alkali&#8208;ion storage, multivalent&#8208;ion storage, and metal batteries). High conductivity, compositional diversity, and rich surface terminations allow MXenes to play various roles in emerging batteries, including as electrodes, metal anode protective layers, sulfur hosts, separator interlayers, and conductive additives.








Abstract
Research on next&#8208;generation battery technologies (beyond Li&#8208;ion batteries, or LIBs) has been accelerating over the past few years. A key challenge for these emerging batteries has been the lack of suitable electrode materials, which severely limits their further developments. MXenes, a new class of 2D transition metal carbides, carbonitrides, and nitrides, are proposed as electrode materials for these emerging batteries due to several desirable attributes. These attributes include large and tunable interlayer spaces, excellent hydrophilicity, extraordinary conductivity, compositional diversity, and abundant surface chemistries, making MXenes promising not only as electrode materials but also as other components in the cells of emerging batteries. Herein, an overview and assessment of the utilization of MXenes in rechargeable batteries beyond LIBs, including alkali&#8208;ion (e.g., Na+, K+) storage, multivalent&#8208;ion (e.g., Mg2+, Zn2+, and Al3+) storage, and metal batteries are presented. In particular, the synthetic strategies and properties of MXenes that enable MXenes to play various roles as electrodes, metal anode protective layers, sulfur hosts, separator modification layers, and conductive additives in these emerging batteries are discussed. Moreover, a perspective on promising future research directions on MXenes and MXene&#8208;based materials, ranging from material design and processing, fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms, to device performance optimization strategies is provided.

      <title>Recent Advances in the Design and Sensing Applications of Hemin/Coordination Polymer&#8208;Based Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
By combining the properties of hemin and porous coordination polymers into novel nanocomposites, different types of sensors can be generated for testing the concentrations of different biological molecules. These biosensors are based on electrochemical, chemiluminescent, or colorimetric techniques, and have excellent detection limits and stability.








Abstract
The fabrication of biomimetic catalysts as substituents for enzymes is of critical interest in the field due to the problems associated with the extraction, purification, and storage of enzymes in sensing applications. Of these mimetics, hemin/coordination polymer&#8208;based nanocomposites, mainly hemin/metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF), have been developed for various biosensing applications because of the unique properties of each component, while trying to mimic the normal biological functions of heme within the protein milieu of enzymes. This critical review first discusses the different catalytic functions of heme in the body in the form of enzyme/protein structures. The properties of hemin dimerization are then elucidated with the supposed models of hemin oxidation. After that, the progress in the fabrication of hemin/MOF nanocomposites for the sensing of diverse biological molecules is discussed. Finally, the challenges in developing this type of composites are examined as well as possible proposals for future directions to enhance the sensing performance in this field further.

      <title>Tailored Graphene Micropatterns by Wafer&#8208;Scale Direct Transfer for Flexible Chemical Sensor Platform</title>
      <dc:description>
A strategy to micropattern 2D materials on large&#8208;scale flexible substrates using direct polymer curing transfer method is demonstrated. Graphene microchannels on polymer substrates exhibit ultrahigh effective self&#8208;heating under the applied bias voltage of less than 10&#160;V. Entirely flexible and transparent chemical sensor array based on graphene micropatterns successfully discriminate gas species under the self&#8208;activated state without external heating.








Abstract
2D materials, such as graphene, exhibit great potential as functional materials for numerous novel applications due to their excellent properties. The grafting of conventional micropatterning techniques on new types of electronic devices is required to fully utilize the unique nature of graphene. However, the conventional lithography and polymer&#8208;supported transfer methods often induce the contamination and damage of the graphene surface due to polymer residues and harsh wet&#8208;transfer conditions. Herein, a novel strategy to obtain micropatterned graphene on polymer substrates using a direct curing process is demonstrated. Employing this method, entirely flexible, transparent, well&#8208;defined self&#8208;activated graphene sensor arrays, capable of gas discrimination without external heating, are fabricated on 4 in. wafer&#8208;scale substrates. Finite element method simulations show the potential of this patterning technique to maximize the performance of the sensor devices when the active channels of the 2D material are suspended and nanoscaled. This study contributes considerably to the development of flexible functional electronic devices based on 2D materials.

      <dc:description>
The liquid&#8208;flowing graphene chip (LFGC) is a novel imaging platform enabling the atomic&#8208;scale observation of liquid&#8208;phase reactions in operando circumstances. Graphene viewing windows and anti&#8208;bulging SiNx supports provide a controllable liquid thickness and structural integrity under harsh experimental conditions. Using LFGC, both atomic&#8208;resolution imaging and molecular&#8208;level information for inorganic and biological samples can be acquired under liquid circulation.








Abstract
The recent advances in liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy represent tremendous potential in many different fields and exciting new opportunities. However, achieving both high&#8208;resolution imaging and operando capabilities remain a significant challenge. This work suggests a novel in situ imaging platform of liquid&#8208;flowing graphene chip TEM (LFGC&#8208;TEM) equipped with graphene viewing windows and a liquid exchange system. The LFGCs are robust under high&#8208;pressure gradients and rapid liquid circulation in ranges covering the experimental conditions accessible with conventional thick SiNx chips. LFGC&#8208;TEM provides atomic resolution for colloidal nanoparticles and molecular&#8208;level information limits for unstained wet biomolecules and cells that are comparable to the resolutions achievable with solid&#8208;phase and cryogenic TEM, respectively. This imaging platform can provide an opportunity for live imaging of biological phenomena that is not yet achieved using any current methods.

      <dc:description>
A stable Ca plating/stripping process for more than 1000 h is realized through a Na/Ca hybrid SEI strategy. This enables an ultralong life and high operation voltage, up to 4.5 V, for room&#8208;temperature Ca&#8211;metal batteries.








Abstract
Currently, the application of calcium metal anodes is challenged by rapidly degenerated plating/stripping electrochemistry without suitable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) capable of fast Ca2+ transport kinetics and superior ability to resist anion oxidation. Here, through in situ evolved Na/Ca hybrid SEIs, symmetrical Ca//Ca batteries readily remain stable for more than 1000 h deposition&#8211;dissolution cycles (versus less than 60 h for those with pure Ca SEIs under the same condition). Coupled with a specially designed freestanding lattice&#8208;expanded graphitic carbon fiber membrane and tailored operation voltages, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Ca&#8208;metal batteries reversibly run for almost 1900 cycles with &#8776;83% capacity retention and a high average discharge voltage of 3.16&#160;V. The good performance not only benefits from the stable SEIs at the Ca metal surface which affords free Ca2+ transports and prohibits out&#8208;of&#8208;control fluridation of Ca (forming CaF2 ion&#8208;/electron&#8208;insulating layer) but is also attributed to reversible relay insertion/extraction electrochemistry in the cathode. This work sheds new light on durable metal battery technology.

      <title>Compositional Fluctuations Locked by Athermal Transformation Yielding High Thermoelectric Performance in GeTe</title>
      <dc:description>
The interplay between phase decomposition and athermal phase transition is leveraged in a Ge&#8208;Sb&#8208;Te ternary system to enable exquisite microstructure features by strong composition fluctuations and coexistence of rhombohedral&#8208; and cubic GeTe. Specifically, alloying GeTe with Sb2Te3 significantly suppresses thermal conductivity while retaining eligible carrier concentration over a wide composition range, resulting in high zT values &gt; 2.6.








Abstract
Phase transition in thermoelectric (TE) material is a double&#8208;edged sword&#8212;it is undesired for device operation in applications, but the fluctuations near an electronic instability are favorable. Here, Sb doping is used to elicit a spontaneous composition fluctuation showing uphill diffusion in GeTe that is otherwise suspended by diffusionless athermal cubic&#8208;to&#8208;rhombohedral phase transition at around 700 K. The interplay between these two phase transitions yields exquisite composition fluctuations and a coexistence of cubic and rhombohedral phases in favor of exceptional figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit zT. Specifically, alloying GeTe by Sb2Te3 significantly suppresses the thermal conductivity while retaining eligible carrier concentration over a wide composition range, resulting in high zT values of &gt;2.6. These results not only attest to the efficacy of using phase transition in manipulating the microstructures of GeTe&#8208;based materials but also open up a new thermodynamic route to develop higher performance TE materials in general.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by Efficient Energy Transfer between Coupled Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Layers</title>
      <dc:description>
A bifunctional ligand of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) benzoic acid cation is incorporated into perovskite to simultaneously diminish the weak van der Waals gap and passivate the defects for efficient energy transfer and radiative recombination. Fabricated blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes show an external quantum efficiency of 10.11% and a long stability of 81.3 min, indicating that this is an effective approach for high device performance.








Abstract
While there has been extensive investigation into modulating quasi&#8208;2D perovskite compositions in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) for promoting their electroluminescence, very few reports have studied approaches involving enhancement of the energy transfer between quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers of the film, which plays very important role for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). In this work, a bifunctional ligand of 4&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl)benzoic acid (ABA) cation is strategically introduced into the perovskite to diminish the weak van der Waals gap between individual perovskite layers for promoting coupled quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers. In particular, the strengthened interaction between coupled quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers favors an efficient energy transfer in the perovskite films. The introduced ABA can also simultaneously passivate the perovskite defects by reducing metallic Pb for less nonradiative recombination loss. Benefiting from the advanced properties of ABA incorporated perovskites, highly efficient blue PeLEDs with external quantum efficiency of 10.11% and a very long operational stability of 81.3&#160;min, among the best performing blue quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs, are achieved. Consequently, this work contributes an effective approach for high&#8208;performance and stable blue PeLEDs toward practical applications.

      <title>Machine Learning Predictions of Block Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
      <dc:description>
Machine learning is used to analyze the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymer thin films. The neural networks predict the effect of process parameters on morphology and defectivity during solvent annealing, and a ridge regression model identifies the critical parameters that determine the quality of line/space patterns. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning to inform nanomanufacturing processes.








Abstract
Directed self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers is a key enabler for nanofabrication of devices with sub&#8208;10 nm feature sizes, allowing patterning far below the resolution limit of conventional photolithography. Among all the process steps involved in block copolymer self&#8208;assembly, solvent annealing plays a dominant role in determining the film morphology and pattern quality, yet the interplay of the multiple parameters during solvent annealing, including the initial thickness, swelling, time, and solvent ratio, makes it difficult to predict and control the resultant self&#8208;assembled pattern. Here, machine learning tools are applied to analyze the solvent annealing process and predict the effect of process parameters on morphology and defectivity. Two neural networks are constructed and trained, yielding accurate prediction of the final morphology in agreement with experimental data. A ridge regression model is constructed to identify the critical parameters that determine the quality of line/space patterns. These results illustrate the potential of machine learning to inform nanomanufacturing processes.

      <title>Self&#8208;Strengthening Adhesive Force Promotes Cell Mechanotransduction</title>
      <dc:description>
Benefiting from the spontaneous merocyanine&#8208;to&#8208;spiropyran isomerization, a coating displays dynamic self&#8208;strengthening of the interfacial adhesive force. Cells enable remodeling of the underlaying interfaces to meet their demand for adhesion when the ligand anchoring strength is weak. The subsequent self&#8208;strengthening process offers progressive force stimulation following the adaptation step to mediate cell behaviors and ultimately drive cell fate specification.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) undergoes dynamic remodeling and progressive stiffening during tissue regeneration and disease progression. However, most of the artificial ECMs and in vitro disease models are mechanically static. Here, a self&#8208;strengthening polymer coating mimicking the dynamic nature of native ECM is designed to study the cellular response to dynamic biophysical cues and promote cell mechanical sensitive response. Spiropyran (SP) is utilized as dynamic anchor group to regulate the strength of cell adhesive peptide ligands. Benefiting from spontaneous thermal merocyanine&#8208;to&#8208;spiropyran (MC&#8211;SP) isomerization, the resulting self&#8208;responsive coating displays dynamic self&#8208;strengthening of interfacial interactions. Comparing with the static and all of the previous dynamic artificial ECMs, cells on this self&#8208;responsive surface remodel the weakly bonded MC&#8208;based coatings to activate &#945;5&#946;1 integrin and Rac signaling in the early adhesion stage. The subsequent MC&#8208;to&#8208;SP conversion strengthens the ligand&#8211;integrin interaction to further activate &#945;v&#946;3 integrin and RhoA/ROCK signaling in the latter stage. This sequential process enhances cellular mechanotransduction as well as the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). It is worth emphasizing that the self&#8208;strengthening occurs spontaneously in the absence of any stimulus, making it especially useful for implanted scaffolds in regenerative medicine.

      <title>Unraveling the Nature of Excellent Potassium Storage in Small&#8208;Molecule Se@Peapod&#8208;Like N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanofibers</title>
      <dc:description>
Small&#8208;molecule Se embedded in freestanding N&#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers thin film is prepared as the cathode for K&#8211;Se batteries. The short&#8208;chain Se confined in the micropores is eventually transformed to K2Se by a two&#8208;step conversion reaction via an &#8220;all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8221; electrochemical process which hinders the generation of polyselenides and promotes complete conversion thus enhancing the utilization of Se.








Abstract
The potassium&#8211;selenium (K&#8211;Se) battery is considered as an alternative solution for stationary energy storage because of abundant resource of K. However, the detailed mechanism of the energy storage process is yet to be unraveled. Herein, the findings in probing the working mechanism of the K&#8208;ion storage in Se cathode are reported using both experimental and computational approaches. A flexible K&#8211;Se battery is prepared by employing the small&#8208;molecule Se embedded in freestanding N &#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers thin film (Se@NPCFs) as cathode. The reaction mechanisms are elucidated by identifying the existence of short&#8208;chain molecular Se encapsulated inside the microporous host, which transforms to K2Se by a two&#8208;step conversion reaction via an &#8220;all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8221; electrochemical process in the carbonate electrolyte system. Through the whole reaction, the generation of polyselenides (K2Sen, 3&#160;&#8804;&#160;n&#160;&#8804;&#160;8) is effectively suppressed by electrochemical reaction dominated by Se2 molecules, thus significantly enhancing the utilization of Se and effecting the voltage platform of the K&#8211;Se battery. This work offers a practical pathway to optimize the K&#8211;Se battery performance through structure engineering and manipulation of selenium chemistry for the formation of selective species and reveal its internal reaction mechanism in the carbonate electrolyte.

     alt="Unraveling the Nature of Excellent Potassium Storage in Small&#8208;Molecule Se@Peapod&#8208;Like N&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanofibers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small&#8208;molecule Se embedded in freestanding N&#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers thin film is prepared as the cathode for K&#8211;Se batteries. The short&#8208;chain Se confined in the micropores is eventually transformed to K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se by a two&#8208;step conversion reaction via an &#8220;all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8221; electrochemical process which hinders the generation of polyselenides and promotes complete conversion thus enhancing the utilization of Se.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potassium&#8211;selenium (K&#8211;Se) battery is considered as an alternative solution for stationary energy storage because of abundant resource of K. However, the detailed mechanism of the energy storage process is yet to be unraveled. Herein, the findings in probing the working mechanism of the K&#8208;ion storage in Se cathode are reported using both experimental and computational approaches. A flexible K&#8211;Se battery is prepared by employing the small&#8208;molecule Se embedded in freestanding N &#8208;doped porous carbon nanofibers thin film (Se@NPCFs) as cathode. The reaction mechanisms are elucidated by identifying the existence of short&#8208;chain molecular Se encapsulated inside the microporous host, which transforms to K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se by a two&#8208;step conversion reaction via an &#8220;all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8221; electrochemical process in the carbonate electrolyte system. Through the whole reaction, the generation of polyselenides (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, 3&#160;&#8804;&#160;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8804;&#160;8) is effectively suppressed by electrochemical reaction dominated by Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, thus significantly enhancing the utilization of Se and effecting the voltage platform of the K&#8211;Se battery. This work offers a practical pathway to optimize the K&#8211;Se battery performance through structure engineering and manipulation of selenium chemistry for the formation of selective species and reveal its internal reaction mechanism in the carbonate electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>High&#8208;Definition Single&#8208;Cell Printing: Cell&#8208;by&#8208;Cell Fabrication of Biological Structures</title>
      <dc:description>
Conventional bioprinting methods cannot reliably print single cells. A novel microfluidic bioprinting technology with a highly miniaturized cell sorter is presented to accurately print single cells. Through selective cell&#8208;by&#8208;cell printing, intricate cell patterns at single&#8208;cell resolution and uniform spheroids with defined composition and morphology are fabricated.








Abstract
Bioprinting is a powerful technology with the potential to transform medical device manufacturing, organ replacement, and the treatment of diseases and physiologic malformations. However, current bioprinters are unable to reliably print the fundamental unit of all living things, single cells. A high&#8208;definition single&#8208;cell printing, a novel microfluidic technology, is presented here that can accurately print single cells from a mixture of multiple candidates. The bioprinter employs a highly miniaturized microfluidic sorter to deterministically select single cells of interest for printing, achieving an accuracy of &#8776;10&#160;&#181;m and speed of &#8776;100&#160;Hz. This approach is demonstrated by fabricating intricate cell patterns with pre&#8208;defined features through selective single&#8208;cell printing. The approach is used to synthesize well&#8208;defined spheroids with controlled composition and morphology. The speed, accuracy, and flexibility of the approach will advance bioprinting to enable new studies in organoid science, tissue engineering, and spatially targeted cell therapies.

      <title>Fully Light&#8208;Controlled Memory and Neuromorphic Computation in Layered Black Phosphorus</title>
      <dc:description>
An all&#8208;optically tunable neuromorphic imaging element based on black phosphorus (BP) is demonstrated. Unusual wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent in BP is harnessed to optically program and erase visual memory elements. Concurrently, the same elements are capable of in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing in an array and optoelectronic machine learning for image recognition through artificial neural networks.








Abstract
Imprinting vision as memory is a core attribute of human cognitive learning. Fundamental to artificial intelligence systems are bioinspired neuromorphic vision components for the visible and invisible segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Realization of a single imaging unit with a combination of in&#8208;built memory and signal processing capability is imperative to deploy efficient brain&#8208;like vision systems. However, the lack of a platform that can be fully controlled by light without the need to apply alternating polarity electric signals has hampered this technological advance. Here, a neuromorphic imaging element based on a fully light&#8208;modulated 2D semiconductor in a simple reconfigurable phototransistor structure is presented. This standalone device exhibits inherent characteristics that enable neuromorphic image pre&#8208;processing and recognition. Fundamentally, the unique photoresponse induced by oxidation&#8208;related defects in 2D black phosphorus (BP) is exploited to achieve visual memory, wavelength&#8208;selective multibit programming, and erasing functions, which allow in&#8208;pixel image pre&#8208;processing. Furthermore, all&#8208;optically driven neuromorphic computation is demonstrated by machine learning to classify numbers and recognize images with an accuracy of over 90%. The devices provide a promising approach toward neurorobotics, human&#8211;machine interaction technologies, and scalable bionic systems with visual data storage/buffering and processing.

      <title>Microfluidics: IFlowPlate&#8212;A Customized 384&#8208;Well Plate for the Culture of Perfusable Vascularized Colon Organoids (Adv. Mater. 46/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Human stem&#8208;cell&#8208;derived organoids have provided new opportunities to model biological processes and recapitulate organ development. However, organoid systems lack perfusable vascular networks to deliver nutrients and drugs. In article number 2002974, Boyang Zhang and co&#8208;workers introduce IFlowPlate&#8212;a microfluidic system with an &#8220;open&#8208;well&#8221; design in a 384&#8208;well plate format that can be used to vascularize and intravascularly perfuse organoids. This image shows three independently perfused microvascular networks in an IFlowPlate.

      <title>Relationship between the Processing, Structure, and Properties of Microfibrillar Composites</title>
      <dc:description>
Microfibrillar composites (MFCs) are considered as a promising group of environmentally friendly fiber composites, which might replace the commercial glass&#8208; and carbon&#8208;fiber composites in the final applications. A comprehensive overview of the complex processing&#8211;structure&#8211;properties relationship for MFCs is presented. It is known that carefully developed microstructure is one of the most important requirements for achieving composites&#8217; good mechanical properties.








Abstract
The relationship between processing, morphology, and properties of polymeric materials has been the subject of numerous studies of academic and industrial research. Finding an answer to this question might result in guidelines on how to design polymeric materials. Microfibrillar composites (MFCs) are an interesting class of polymer&#8211;polymer composites. The advantage of the MFC concept lies in developing in situ microfibrils by which a perfect homogeneous distribution of the reinforcement in the matrix can be achieved. Their potentially excellent mechanical properties are strongly dependent on the aspect ratio of the fibrils, which is developed through a three&#8208;stage production process: melt blending, fibrillation, and isotropization. During melt blending, the polymers undergo different morphological changes, such as a breakup and coalescence of the droplets, which play a crucial role in defining the microstructure. During processing, various parameters may affect the morphology of the MFCs, which must be taken into account. Besides the processing parameters, the microstructure of the composite is dependent on the composition ratio of the blend and viscosity of the components, as well as the dispersion and distribution of the microfibrils. The objective here is to outline this importance and bring together an overview of the processing&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship for MFCs.

      <title>Thiophene&#8208;Bridged Donor&#8211;Acceptor sp2&#8208;Carbon&#8208;Linked 2D Conjugated Polymers as Photocathodes for Water Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A bithiophene&#8208;bridged D&#8211;A&#8208;based 2D sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugated polymer (2D CCP&#8208;Th) is synthesized via Knoevenagel polymerization. Benefiting from the robust sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugations and donor&#8211;acceptor structures, when employed as a photocathode for water reduction, 2D CCP&#8208;Th demonstrates a superb saturated photocurrent density (5.5 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#160;V and 7.9 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode).








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water reduction, converting solar energy into environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel, requires delicate design and synthesis of semiconductors with appropriate bandgaps, suitable energy levels of the frontier orbitals, and high intrinsic charge mobility. In this work, the synthesis of a novel bithiophene&#8208;bridged donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based 2D sp2&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugated polymer (2D CCP) is demonstrated. The Knoevenagel polymerization between the electron&#8208;accepting building block 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl) diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine (HATN&#8208;6CHO) and the first electron&#8208;donating linker 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;diyl)diacetonitrile (ThDAN) provides the 2D CCP&#8208;HATNThDAN (2D CCP&#8208;Th). Compared with the corresponding biphenyl&#8208;bridged 2D CCP&#8208;HATN&#8208;BDAN (2D CCP&#8208;BD), the bithiophene&#8208;based 2D CCP&#8208;Th exhibits a wide light&#8208;harvesting range (up to 674&#160;nm), a optical energy gap (2.04&#160;eV), and highest energy occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital distributions for facilitated charge transfer, which make 2D CCP&#8208;Th a promising candidate for PEC water reduction. As a result, 2D CCP&#8208;Th presents a superb H2&#8208;evolution photocurrent density up to &#8776;7.9 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is superior to the reported 2D covalent organic frameworks and most carbon nitride materials (0.09&#8211;6.0 &#181;A cm&#8722;2). Density functional theory calculations identify the thiophene units and cyano substituents at the vinylene linkage as active sites for the evolution of H2.

Benefiting from the robust sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugations and donor&#8211;acceptor structures, when employed as a photocathode for water reduction, 2D CCP&#8208;Th demonstrates a superb saturated photocurrent density (5.5 &#181;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.3&#160;V and 7.9 &#181;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode).


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water reduction, converting solar energy into environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel, requires delicate design and synthesis of semiconductors with appropriate bandgaps, suitable energy levels of the frontier orbitals, and high intrinsic charge mobility. In this work, the synthesis of a novel bithiophene&#8208;bridged donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based 2D sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8208;carbon&#8208;linked conjugated polymer (2D CCP) is demonstrated. The Knoevenagel polymerization between the electron&#8208;accepting building block 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl) diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine (HATN&#8208;6CHO) and the first electron&#8208;donating linker 2,2&#8242;&#8208;([2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene]&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;diyl)diacetonitrile (ThDAN) provides the 2D CCP&#8208;HATNThDAN (2D CCP&#8208;Th). Compared with the corresponding biphenyl&#8208;bridged 2D CCP&#8208;HATN&#8208;BDAN (2D CCP&#8208;BD), the bithiophene&#8208;based 2D CCP&#8208;Th exhibits a wide light&#8208;harvesting range (up to 674&#160;nm), a optical energy gap (2.04&#160;eV), and highest energy occupied molecular orbital&#8211;lowest unoccupied molecular orbital distributions for facilitated charge transfer, which make 2D CCP&#8208;Th a promising candidate for PEC water reduction. As a result, 2D CCP&#8208;Th presents a superb H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;evolution photocurrent density up to &#8776;7.9 &#181;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is superior to the reported 2D covalent organic frameworks and most carbon nitride materials (0.09&#8211;6.0 &#181;A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Density functional theory calculations identify the thiophene units and cyano substituents at the vinylene linkage as active sites for the evolution of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CANDYBOTS: A New Generation of 3D&#8208;Printed Sugar&#8208;Based Transient Small&#8208;Scale Robots</title>
      <dc:description>
Sugars are among the main sources of energy and structural building blocks for almost all forms of life. Because of their degradability and biocompatibility, sugars are compelling materials in transient devices and robotics. An additive manufacturing approach for the production of 3D sugar&#8208;based composites is introduced, which can pave the way for a new generation of transient small&#8208;scale devices.








Abstract
Sugars are ubiquitous in food, and are among the main sources of energy for almost all forms of life. Sugars can also form structural building blocks such as cellulose in plants. Because of their inherent degradability and biocompatibility characteristics, sugars are compelling materials for transient devices. Here, an additive manufacturing approach for the production of magnetic sugar&#8208;based composites is introduced. First, it is shown that sugar&#8208;based 3D architectures can be 3D printed by selective laser sintering. This method enables not only the caramelization chemistry but also the mechanical properties of the sugar architectures to be adjusted by varying the laser energy. It is also demonstrated that mixtures of sugar and magnetic particles can be processed as 3D composites. As a proof of concept, a sugar&#8208;based millimeter&#8208;scale helical swimmer, which is capable of corkscrew motion in a solution with a viscosity comparable to those of biological fluids, is fabricated. The millirobot quickly dissolves in water, while being manipulated through magnetic fields. The present fabrication method can pave the way to a new generation of transient sugar&#8208;based small&#8208;scale robots for minimally invasive procedures. Due to their rapid dissolution, sugars can be used as an intermediate step for transporting swarms of particles to specific target locations.

      <title>Shelf&#8208;Stable Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with High Operational Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) demonstrate high operational performance but poor shelf stability. This work reveals that both positive ageing and negative ageing of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art QLEDs are associated with in situ reactions induced by organic acids. The understanding leads to novel electron&#8208;transporting oxide bilayers to realize shelf&#8208;stable devices with high operational performance.








Abstract
Quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) promise a new generation of high&#8208;performance, large&#8208;area, and cost&#8208;effective electroluminescent devices for both display and solid&#8208;state lighting technologies. However, a positive ageing process is generally required to improve device performance for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art QLEDs. Here, it is revealed that the in situ reactions induced by organic acids in the commonly used encapsulation acrylic resin lead to positive ageing and, most importantly, the progression of in situ reactions inevitably results in negative ageing, i.e., deterioration of device performance after long&#8208;term shelf storage. In&#8208;depth mechanism studies focusing on the correlations between the in situ chemical reactions and the shelf&#8208;ageing behaviors of QLEDs inspire the design of an electron&#8208;transporting bilayer, which delivers both improved electrical conductivity and suppressed interfacial exciton quenching. This material innovation enables red QLEDs exhibiting neglectable changes of external quantum efficiency (&gt;20.0%) and ultralong operational lifetime (T95: 5500 h at 1000 nits) after storage for 180 days. This work provides design principles for oxide electron&#8208;transporting layers to realize shelf&#8208;stable and high&#8208;operational&#8208;performance QLEDs, representing a new starting point for both fundamental studies and practical applications.

      <title>A Suspended Silicon Single&#8208;Hole Transistor as an Extremely Scaled Gigahertz Nanoelectromechanical Beam Resonator</title>
      <dc:description>
A silicon single&#8208;hole transistor, a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation electronics, is suspended to function as a nanoelectromechanical resonator, demonstrating a record&#8208;high resonant frequency and large zero&#8208;point motion. The mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical signal transducing is dominated by the piezoresistive effect with a giant piezoresistive gauge factor strongly correlated to single&#8208;hole tunneling, providing great potential in interfacing charge carriers with mechanical vibrations.








Abstract
Suspended single&#8208;hole transistors (SHTs) can also serve as nanoelectromechanical resonators, providing an ideal platform for investigating interactions between mechanical vibrations and charge carriers. Demonstrating such a device in silicon (Si) is of particular interest, due to the strong piezoresistive effect of Si and potential applications in Si&#8208;based quantum computation. Here, a suspended Si SHT also acting as a nanoelectromechanical beam resonator is demonstrated. The resonant frequency and zero&#8208;point motion of the device are &#8776;3&#160;GHz and 0.2&#160;pm, respectively, reaching the best level among similar devices demonstrated with Si&#8208;containing materials. The mechanical vibration is transduced to electrical readout by the SHT. The signal transduction mechanism is dominated by the piezoresistive effect. A giant apparent effective piezoresistive gauge factor with strong correlation to single&#8208;hole tunneling is extracted in this device. The results show the great potential of the device in interfacing charge carriers with mechanical vibrations, as well as investigating potential quantum behavior of the vibration phonon mode.

      <title>Shape&#8208;Preserving Chemical Conversion of Architected Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
Shaping, sculpting, and forging customizable compounds into arbitrary forms has the potential to revolutionize technologies for advanced functional materials. Understanding ion&#8208;exchange reactions in nanocomposites enables shape&#8208;controlled microscopic architectures with a large diversity of metal chalcogenide compositions that are of interest for their electronic, catalytic, and magnetic properties.








Abstract
Forging customizable compounds into arbitrary shapes and structures has the potential to revolutionize functional materials, where independent control over shape and composition is essential. Current self&#8208;assembly strategies allow impressive levels of control over either shape or composition, but not both, as self&#8208;assembly inherently entangles shape and composition. Herein, independent control over shape and composition is achieved by chemical conversion reactions on nanocrystals, which are first self&#8208;assembled in nanocomposites with programmable microscopic shapes. The multiscale character of nanocomposites is crucial: nanocrystals (5&#8211;50&#160;nm) offer enhanced chemical reactivity, while the composite layout accommodates volume changes of the nanocrystals (&#8776;25%), which together leads to complete chemical conversion with full shape preservation. These reactions are surprisingly materials agnostic, allowing a large diversity of chemical pathways, and development of conversion pathways yielding a wide selection of shape&#8208;controlled transition metal chalcogenides (cadmium, manganese, iron, and nickel oxides and sulfides). Finally, the versatility and application potential of this strategy is demonstrated by assembling: 1) a scalable and highly reactive nickel catalyst for the dry reforming of butane, 2) an agile magnetic&#8208;controlled particle, and 3) an electron&#8208;beam&#8208;controlled reversible microactuator with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. Previously unimaginable customization of shape and composition is now achievable for assembling advanced functional components.

      <title>Recent Advances in Growth of Large&#8208;Sized 2D Single Crystals on Cu Substrates</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent advances in the growth and production of wafer&#8208;scale and single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on Cu substrates by chemical vapor deposition are presented. The features and roles of Cu in making 2D crystals are comprehensively demonstrated. The daunting quest for mass production of single&#8208;crystal 2D materials poses great potential in electronics and other applications.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;quality 2D materials have been an emerging and promising choice for use in modern chemistry and physics owing to their fascinating property profile. The past few years have witnessed inspiringly progressing development in controlled fabrication of large&#8208;sized and single&#8208;crystal 2D materials. Among those production methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has drawn the most attention because of its fine control over size and quality of 2D materials by modulating the growth conditions. Meanwhile, Cu has been widely accepted as the most popular catalyst due to its significant merit in growing monolayer 2D materials in the CVD process.

&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in the growth and production of wafer&#8208;scale and single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on Cu substrates by chemical vapor deposition are presented. The features and roles of Cu in making 2D crystals are comprehensively demonstrated. The daunting quest for mass production of single&#8208;crystal 2D materials poses great potential in electronics and other applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;quality 2D materials have been an emerging and promising choice for use in modern chemistry and physics owing to their fascinating property profile. The past few years have witnessed inspiringly progressing development in controlled fabrication of large&#8208;sized and single&#8208;crystal 2D materials. Among those production methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has drawn the most attention because of its fine control over size and quality of 2D materials by modulating the growth conditions. Meanwhile, Cu has been widely accepted as the most popular catalyst due to its significant merit in growing monolayer 2D materials in the CVD process. Herein, very recent advances in preparing large&#8208;sized 2D single crystals on Cu substrates by CVD are presented. First, the unique features of Cu will be given in terms of ultralow precursor solubility and feasible surface engineering. Then, scaled growth of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (&lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;BN) crystals on Cu substrates is demonstrated, wherein different kinds of Cu surfaces have been employed. Furthermore, the growth mechanism for the growth of 2D single crystals is exhibited, offering a guideline to elucidate the in&#8208;depth growth dynamics and kinetics. Finally, relevant issues for industrial&#8208;scale mass production of 2D single crystals are discussed and a promising future is expected.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coherent Electron Transport in Air&#8208;Stable, Printed Single&#8208;Crystal Organic Semiconductor and Application to Megahertz Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type organic semiconductor, PhC2&#8722;BQQDI, which can be used to form single&#8208;crystalline thin films by printing, is identified as a band&#8208;transport material by means of variable&#8208;temperature gated Hall effect measurements. The printed PhC2&#8722;BQQDI single crystal is also used to demonstrate a high&#8208;frequency transistor with a capability of 4.3&#160;MHz under ambient atmosphere.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have attracted growing attention for optoelectronic applications such as field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), and coherent (or band&#8208;like) carrier transport properties in OSC single crystals (SCs) have been of interest as they can lead to high carrier mobilities. Recently, such p&#8208;type OSC SCs compatible with a printing technology have been used to achieve high&#8208;speed FETs; therefore, developments of n&#8208;type counterparts may be promising for realizing high&#8208;speed complementary organic circuits. Herein, coherent electron transport properties in a printed SC of a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type OSC, PhC2&#8722;BQQDI, by means of variable&#8208;temperature gated Hall effect measurements and X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal diffraction analyses in conjunction with band structure calculations, are reported. Furthermore, the SC FET is tested for high&#8208;speed operations, which obtains a cutoff frequency of 4.3&#160;MHz at an operation voltage of 20&#160;V in air. Thus, PhC2&#8722;BQQDI is shown as a new candidate for practical applications of SC&#8208;based, organic complementary devices.

      <title>Random Polymerization Strategy Leads to a Family of Donor Polymers Enabling Well&#8208;Controlled Morphology and Multiple Cases of High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
To fine&#8208;tune the energy levels of polymer donors, a family of random polymers is synthesized, which shows favorable properties of aggregation and morphology. The performance of these polymers is less sensitive to their molecular weights compared with PM7. Thus, multiple cases of highly efficient nonfullerene organic solar cells are achieved with efficiencies between 16.0% and 17.1%.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance donor polymers is important for nonfullerene organic solar cells (NF&#8208;OSCs), as state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nonfullerene acceptors can only perform well if they are coupled with a matching donor with suitable energy levels. However, there are very limited choices of donor polymers for NF&#8208;OSCs, and the most commonly used ones are polymers named PM6 and PM7, which suffer from several problems. First, the performance of these polymers (particularly PM7) relies on precise control of their molecular weights. Also, their optimal morphology is extremely sensitive to any structural modification. In this work, a family of donor polymers is developed based on a random polymerization strategy. These polymers can achieve well&#8208;controlled morphology and high&#8208;performance with a variety of chemical structures and molecular weights. The polymer donors are D&#8211;A1&#8211;D&#8211;A2&#8208;type random copolymers in which the D and A1 units are monomers originating from PM6 or PM7, while the A2 unit comprises an electron&#8208;deficient core flanked by two thiophene rings with branched alkyl chains. Consequently, multiple cases of highly efficient NF&#8208;OSCs are achieved with efficiencies between 16.0% and 17.1%. As the electron&#8208;deficient cores can be changed to many other structural units, the strategy can easily expand the choices of high&#8208;performance donor polymers for NF&#8208;OSCs.

      <title>Achieving Ultrahigh Volumetric Energy Storage by Compressing Nitrogen and Sulfur Dual&#8208;Doped Carbon Nanocages via Capillarity</title>
      <dc:description>
Collapsed N,S dual&#8208;doped carbon nanocages are elaborately constructed, integrating high density, large ion&#8208;accessible surface area, and fast charge transfer. The synergism of these characteristics endows the optimized sample with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art volumetric performance in both aqueous and ionic&#8208;liquid electrolytes, especially the top&#8208;level stack&#8208;volumetric energy density of 75.3&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 in the ionic liquid.








Abstract
High volumetric performance is a challenging issue for carbon&#8208;based electrical double&#8208;layer capacitors (EDLCs). Herein, collapsed N,S dual&#8208;doped carbon nanocages (cNS&#8208;CNC) are constructed by simple capillary compression, which eliminates the surplus meso&#8208; and macropores, leading to a much increased density only at the slight expense of specific surface area. The N,S dual&#8208;doping induces strong polarity of the carbon surface, and thus much improves the wettability and charge transfer. The synergism of the high density, large ion&#8208;accessible surface area, and fast charge transfer leads to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art volumetric performance under the premise of high rate capability. At a current density of 50 A g&#8722;1, the optimized cNS&#8208;CNC delivers a high volumetric capacitance of 243 and 199 F cm&#8722;3 in KOH and EMIMBF4 electrolyte, with high energy density of 7.9 and 93.4&#160;Wh L&#8722;1, respectively. A top&#8208;level stack volumetric energy density of 75.3&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 (at power density of 0.7&#160;kW L&#8722;1) and a maximal stack volumetric power density of 112&#160;kW L&#8722;1 (at energy density of 18.8&#160;Wh L&#8722;1) are achieved in EMIMBF4, comparable to the lead&#8211;acid battery in energy density but better in power density with 2&#8211;3 orders. This study demonstrates an efficient strategy to design carbon&#8208;based materials for high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;performance EDLCs with wide practical applications.

      <title>Moisture&#8208;Enabled Electricity Generation: From Physics and Materials to Self&#8208;Powered Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Moisture exists everywhere on Earth and it contains a tremendous amount of energy that remains unexploited. The recent progress in moisture&#8208;enabled electricity generation in terms of the physics, materials, structures, and potential self&#8208;powered applications in healthcare, security, information storage, and artificial intelligence is explored.








Abstract
The exploration of the utilization of sustainable, green energy represents one way in which it is possible to ameliorate the growing threat of the global environmental issues and the crisis in energy. Moisture, which is ubiquitous on Earth, contains a vast reservoir of low&#8208;grade energy in the form of gaseous water molecules and water droplets. It has now been found that a number of functionalized materials can generate electricity directly from their interaction with moisture. This suggests that electrical energy can be harvested from atmospheric moisture and enables the creation of a new range of self&#8208;powered devices. Herein, the basic mechanisms of moisture&#8208;induced electricity generation are discussed, the recent advances in materials (including carbon nanoparticles, graphene materials, metal oxide nanomaterials, biofibers, and polymers) for harvesting electrical energy from moisture are summarized, and some strategies for improving energy conversion efficiency and output power in these devices are provided. The potential applications of moisture electrical generators in self&#8208;powered electronics, healthcare, security, information storage, artificial intelligence, and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;things are also discussed. Some remaining challenges are also considered, together with a number of suggestions for potential new developments of this emerging technology.

      <title>Defect Control for 12.5% Efficiency Cu2ZnSnSe4 Kesterite Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells by Engineering of Local Chemical Environment</title>
      <dc:description>
Kesterite Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin film solar cells with independently confirmed 12.5% total area efficiency have been demonstrated with a novel strategy to effectively control the formation of intrinsic defects and defect clusters in CZTSe by carefully engineering the local chemical environment (e.g., suitable local chemical composition, oxidation states of cations) during film growth.








Abstract
Kesterite&#8208;based Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 semiconductors are emerging as promising materials for low&#8208;cost, environment&#8208;benign, and high&#8208;efficiency thin&#8208;film photovoltaics. However, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 devices suffer from cation&#8208;disordering defects and defect clusters, which generally result in severe potential fluctuation, low minority carrier lifetime, and ultimately unsatisfactory performance. Herein, critical growth conditions are reported for obtaining high&#8208;quality Cu2ZnSnSe4 absorber layers with the formation of detrimental intrinsic defects largely suppressed. By controlling the oxidation states of cations and modifying the local chemical composition, the local chemical environment is essentially modified during the synthesis of kesterite phase, thereby effectively suppressing detrimental intrinsic defects and activating desirable shallow acceptor Cu vacancies. Consequently, a confirmed 12.5% efficiency is demonstrated with a high VOC of 491&#160;mV, which is the new record efficiency of pure&#8208;selenide Cu2ZnSnSe4 cells with lowest VOC deficit in the kesterite family by Eg/q&#8208;Voc. These encouraging results demonstrate an essential route to overcome the long&#8208;standing challenge of defect control in kesterite semiconductors, which may also be generally applicable to other multinary compound semiconductors.

      <title>New High Donor Electrolyte for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinone (DMI) is reported as a promising high donor electrolyte for Li&#8211;S batteries. DMI, in which polysulfides are highly soluble, allows cell operation under lean electrolyte conditions and diversifies reaction routes involving the sulfur radical. The addition of LiNO3 stabilizes the interface with the Li metal anode, achieving superior cyclability under lean electrolyte conditions of 5 &#956;Lelectrolyte mgsulfur&#8722;1.








Abstract
The unparalleled theoretical specific energy of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries has attracted considerable research interest from within the battery community. However, most of the long cycling results attained thus far relies on using a large amount of electrolyte in the cell, which adversely affects the specific energy of Li&#8211;S batteries. This shortcoming originates from the low solubility of polysulfides in the electrolyte. Here, 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinone (DMI) is reported as a new high donor electrolyte for Li&#8211;S batteries. The high solubility of polysulfides in DMI and its activation of a new reaction route, which engages the sulfur radical (S3&#8226;&#8722;), enables the efficient utilization of sulfur as reflected in the specific capacity of 1595&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under lean electrolyte conditions of 5 &#956;Lelectrolyte mgsulfur&#8722;1. Moreover, the addition of LiNO3 stabilizes the lithium metal interface, thereby elevating the cycling performance to one of the highest known for high donor electrolytes in Li&#8211;S cells. These engineered high donor electrolytes are expected to advance Li&#8211;S batteries to cover a wide range of practical applications, particularly by incorporating established strategies to realize the reversibility of lithium metal electrodes.

      <title>Topotactically Transformed Polygonal Mesopores on Ternary Layered Double Hydroxides Exposing Under&#8208;Coordinated Metal Centers for Accelerated Water Dissociation</title>
      <dc:description>
A unique metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;mediated topotactic transformation strategy is deployed to fabricate holey ternary layered double hydroxides, exposing polygonal mesopores with atomistic edge steps and lattice defects. The under&#8208;coordinated metal centers and Fe&#8208;modulated electronic states synergistically promote the kinetics of water dissociation in hydrogen evolution reaction, ultimately leading to superb overall water splitting performance.








Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been recognized as potent electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but are lacking in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities due to the sluggish kinetics of water dissociation in alkaline medium. Herein, aiming to simultaneously bolster the HER and OER kinetics, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) mediated topotactic transformation tactic is deployed to fabricate holey ternary CoFeNi LDHs on nickel foam, exposing polygonal mesopores with atomistic edge steps and lattice defects. The optimized catalyst requires only an external voltage of 1.49&#160;V to afford the water splitting current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 apart from the superb electrolytic stability, far surpassing the benchmark Pt/C||RuO2 couple. More importantly, mechanistic investigations utilizing advanced spectroscopies in conjunction with density function theory (DFT) understandings unravel while the synergetic effect among under&#8208;coordinated metal centers lowers the energy barrier of water dissociation, Fe&#8208;doping enables further modulating the d&#8208;band density of states (DOS) of Co and Ni in favor of intermediates binding, thereby promoting the intrinsic HER activity. Operando Raman studies reveal negligible structural change of the LDHs during the HER process, whereas for OER the active sites can quickly turn into oxyhydroxides in the presence of lattice defects and under&#8208;coordinated metal centers.

Abstract
Blood purification by adsorption of excessive biomolecules is vital for maintaining human health.

The particle possesses combinative porous structure with both surface and interior imprints for the specific recognition of small molecules and biomacromolecules. Additionally, the presence of the herringbone mixer largely improve the adsorption efficiency due to enhanced mixing. Moreover, the inverse opal framework of the particles give rise to optical sensing ability for self&#8208;reporting of the adsorption states. These features, together with its reusability, biosafety, and biocompatibility, make the platform highly promising for clinical blood purification and artificial kidney construction.

      <dc:description>
A hydrogel with topology&#8208;controlled hydration behavior is designed to tune the water evaporation behavior for highly efficient solar&#8208;driven wastewater treatment. The polystyrene sulfonate network generates activated water through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding with water molecules. The polyvinyl alcohol network restricts saturated water content for energy concentration. An evaporation rate of &#8776;3.9&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under one&#8208;sun irradiation is achieved.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation provides a promising method for sustainable freshwater production. However, high energy consumption of vapor generation fundamentally restricts practicality of solar&#8208;driven wastewater treatment. Here a facile strategy is reported to control the hydration of polymer network in hydrogels, where densely cross&#8208;linked polymers serving as a framework are functionalized by a highly hydratable polymeric network. The hydration of polymer chains generates a large amount of weakly bounded water molecules, facilitating the water evaporation. As a result, the hydrogel&#8208;based solar evaporator can extract water from a variety of contaminants such as salts, detergents, and heavy metal components using solar energy with long&#8208;term durability and stability. This work demonstrates an effective way to tune the interaction between water and materials at a molecular level, as well as an energy&#8208;efficient water treatment technology toward wastewater containing complex contaminants.

With this technique, single nanoparticles including quantum dots, polystyrene fluorescent nanobeads, and gold nanoparticles are successfully assembled into 2D arrays with high yields. Experimental and theoretical analyses show that the key for the high yields is the hot&#8208;probe&#8208;based template fabrication technique, which creates geometrical nanotraps and modifies their surface energy simultaneously. In addition to single nanoparticle patterning, further experiments demonstrate that this technique is also capable of building complex nanostructures, such as nanoparticle clusters with well&#8208;defined shapes and heterogeneously integrated nanostructures consisting of quantum dots and silver nanowires. It opens the door to many important applications.

      <title>Bio&#8208;Photonic Waveguides: Bio&#8208;Photonic Waveguide of a DNA&#8208;Hybrid Semiconductor Prismatic Hexagon (Adv. Mater. 45/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Successful use of optical waveguides is rare for a true remote sensing of biological objects. In article number 2005238, Dong Hyuk Park, Dong June Ahn, and co&#8208;workers report a waveguide hybrid&#8208;crystal of an organic semiconductor interfaced with nucleic acid molecules fabricated through a facile self&#8208;assembly method. This bio&#8208;hybrid 1D crystal responds to the extent of DNA&#8211;DNA interactions, and can discern, at the same time, a complementary target sequence at one end against a 1&#8208;mer mismatched case at the other end.

      <dc:description>
In article number 2003984, Yiyang Li, A. Alec Talin, and co&#8208;workers design a deterministic nonvolatile resistive memory cell without nanosized filaments. By using the statistical ensemble behavior of all point defects within the 3D bulk for information storage, they solve the challenge of stochastic switching that has plagued filament&#8208;based memristors. This provides a compelling artificial synapse for energy&#8208;efficient, neuromorphic computing.

      <title>Graphene: Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene via Self&#8208;Organization at the Macroscale (Adv. Mater. 45/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Graphene flakes, nucleated over a polycrystalline graphene film, are shown by Slava V. Rotkin, Mark H. R&#252;mmeli, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2002755 to rotate and synchronize their crystal orientation globally early on during growth. This process causes the flakes to adopt a variety of fractal like shapes. As the flakes continue to grow, they eventually merge to form large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal graphene.

      <dc:description>
Highly selective and cost&#8208;effective separation of light hydrocarbons is of vital importance for the petrochemical industry. In light of their tunable porosity and functionality, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise for the adsorptive separation of hydrocarbons with high similarity. Tailored MOFs with optimal pore size and shape can be achieved for the most efficient separation of light hydrocarbons through molecular sieving, as reviewed by Jing Li and co&#8208;workers in article number 2002603.

      <title>Photocatalysts: Steering Hollow Multishelled Structures in Photocatalysis: Optimizing Surface and Mass Transport (Adv. Mater. 44/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2002556, Shouhua Feng, Dan Wang, and co&#8208;workers give an overview of rational design to elevate the photocatalytic performance of hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) by surface and mass&#8208;transfer optimization. Enlarged effective surface areas and the boosted mass transport in HoMSs greatly favor the energy/mass transfer processes in photocatalysis. In addition, specific structural and compositional parameters affecting photocatalytic performance are described, along with proposed guidance for the development directions of HoMS photocatalysts.
