         <title>Stabilizing Single&#8208;Atomic Pt by Forming Pt&#8208;Fe Bond for Efficient Diboration of Alkynes</title>

Abstract
Precisely tailoring the oxidation state of single&#8208;atomic metal in heterogeneous catalysis is an efficient way to stabilize the single&#8208;atomic site and promote their activity, but realizing this approach remains to be a grand challenge to date. Herein, we report a class of stable single&#8208;atomic catalysts with well&#8208;tuned oxidation state of Pt by forming Pt&#8208;Fe atomic bond, which are supported by defective Fe2O3 nanosheets on reduced graphene oxide (PFARFNs). These as&#8208;synthesized materials could greatly enhance the catalytic activity, stability and selectivity for the diboration of alkynes. The PFARFNs exhibit high conversion of 99% at 100&#160;&#176;C with an outstanding turnover frequency (TOF) of 545 h&#8722;1, and a relatively high conversion of 58% at room temperature (25&#160;&#176;C) with a TOF of 310 h&#8722;1, which was hardly achieved before. Through both experimental and theoretical investigation, we demonstrate that the fast electron transfer from Fe to Pt in Fe&#8208;Pt&#8208;O atomic sites in PFARFNs can not only stabilize the single&#8208;atomic Pt, but also significantly improve their catalytic activity.

         <title>Boosting Photocatalytic Water Oxidation on Photocatalysts with Ferroelectric Single&#8208;domain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferroelectric materials are considered as the promising photocatalysts due to their efficient charge separation via polarization&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field. However, the polydomain structures hinder the spatial charge separation and transfer due to the cancellation of polarization vectors in the domains. Herein, taking BiFeO3 (BFO) as a prototype, single&#8208;domain BFO nanosheets with visible&#8208;light absorption are prepared, as evident by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), spatially resolved surface photovoltage spectroscopy (SRSPS), and photo&#8208;deposition experiments. The single&#8208;domain BFO nanosheets show nine times activity in photocatalytic water oxidation reaction under visible&#8208;light irradiation, compared with that of the polydomain BFO particles. With the asymmetric driving force for charge separation in a single domain, selective deposition of cocatalysts further enhances the photocatalytic activity of single&#8208;domain ferroelectric BFO nanosheets. These results demonstrate the role of single&#8208;domain structure in constructing the driving force of charge separation in ferroelectric photocatalysts. The fabrication of single&#8208;domain structures in ferroelectric photocatalysts to achieve enhanced photocatalytic activity offers a path to efficiently utilize the photogenerated charges in solar energy conversion.

         <title>Multifunctional 3D&#8208;Printed Pollen Grain&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Microrobots for On&#8208;Demand Anchoring and Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional hydrogel microrobot is created by different stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with pollen grain&#8208;inspired microstructures. The robot is capable of conducting temperature&#8208;responsive on&#8208;demand surface attachment, magnetic locomotion, and pH&#8208;responsive cargo delivery toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
While a majority of wireless microrobots have shown multi&#8208;responsiveness to implement complex biomedical functions, their functional executions are strongly dependent on the range of stimulus inputs, which curtails their functional diversity. Furthermore, their responsive functions are coupled to each other, which results in the overlap of the task operations. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed multifunctional microrobot inspired by pollen grains with three hydrogel components is demonstrated: iron platinum (FePt) nanoparticle&#8208;embedded pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA), poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM), and poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide acrylic acid (pNIPAM&#8208;AAc) structures. Each of these structures exhibits their respective targeted functions: responding to magnetic fields for torque&#8208;driven surface rolling and steering, exhibiting temperature responsiveness for on&#8208;demand surface attachment (anchoring), and pH&#8208;responsive cargo release. The versatile multifunctional pollen grain&#8208;inspired robots conceptualized here pave the way for various future medical microrobots to improve their projected performance and functional diversity.

         <title>Weakening Li+ De&#8208;solvation Barrier for Cryogenic Li&#8211;S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antecedent theoretical simulations decipher the correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ desolvation barrier in the electrolyte, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance kinetics of sulfur cathode effectively. This insight endows Li&#8211;S pouch cells with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0 &#176;C, demonstrating great&#160;potential for&#160;cryogenic&#160;Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;S batteries hold promise for pushing cell&#8208;level energy densities beyond 300&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 while operating at low temperatures (LTs, below 0&#160;&#176;C). However, the capacity release of existing Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs is still barely satisfactory, and there is almost no verification of the practicability of Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs in the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. Here, antecedent molecular dynamics (MDs) combined with density functional theory analysis are used to systematically investigate Li+ solvation structure in conventional Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs, which unprecedentedly reveals the positive correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ de&#8208;solvation barrier, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance the Li+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and thus improve the capacity performance of cryogenic Li&#8211;S batteries. These insights derived from theoretical simulations invested Li&#8211;S batteries with a 67.34% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared to their room temperature performance. In particular, an Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell using dilute electrolytes with a high sulfur loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte condition is fabricated, which delivers a discharge capacity of about 1000 mAh g&#8208;1 and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0&#160;&#176;C, offering a promising route toward a practical high&#8208;energy cryogenic Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Microribbon Scaffolds Induce Regenerative Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses in a Critical&#8208;Size Cranial Bone Defect Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane coating represents a biomimetic strategy for modifying the surface of biomaterials. Coating macroporous microribbon scaffolds with mesenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM) enhances cranial bone healing via immunomodulation. Primed MSCM&#8208;coating contains ligands that promote M&#966; polarization toward M2, induce Treg differentiation and TCD8+ apoptosis, and enhance MSC osteogenesis. MSCM coating synergizes with BMP&#8208;2 to further accelerate bone regeneration while suppressing inflammation.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;derived cell membranes have shown great promise in functionalizing nanoparticles to enhance biointerfacing functions for drug delivery applications. However, its potential for functionalizing macroporous scaffolds to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo remains unexplored. Engineering scaffolds with immunomodulatory functions represents an exciting strategy for tissue regeneration but is largely limited to soft tissues. Critical&#8208;sized bone defects cannot heal on their own, and the role of adaptive immune cells in scaffold&#8208;mediated healing of cranial bone defects remains largely unknown. Here, mensenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM)&#8208;coated microribbon (&#181;RB) scaffolds for treating critical size cranial bone defects via targeting immunomodulation are reported. Confocal imaging and proteomic analyses are used to confirm successful coating and characterize the compositions of cell membrane coating. It is demonstrated that MSCM coating promotes macrophage (M&#966;) polarization toward regenerative phenotype, induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and enhances regulatory T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. When combined with a low dosage of BMP&#8208;2, MSCM coating further accelerates bone regeneration and suppresses inflammation. These results establish cell membrane&#8208;coated microribbon scaffolds as a promising strategy for treating critical size bone defects via immunomodulation. The platform may be broadly used with different cell membranes and scaffolds to enhance regeneration of multiple tissue types.

However, its potential for functionalizing macroporous scaffolds to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo remains unexplored. Engineering scaffolds with immunomodulatory functions represents an exciting strategy for tissue regeneration but is largely limited to soft tissues. Critical-sized bone defects cannot heal on their own, and the role of adaptive immune cells in scaffold-mediated healing of cranial bone defects remains largely unknown. Here, mensenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM)-coated microribbon (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;RB) scaffolds for treating critical size cranial bone defects via targeting immunomodulation are reported. Confocal imaging and proteomic analyses are used to confirm successful coating and characterize the compositions of cell membrane coating. It is demonstrated that MSCM coating promotes macrophage (M&#966;) polarization toward regenerative phenotype, induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and enhances regulatory T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. When combined with a low dosage of BMP-2, MSCM coating further accelerates bone regeneration and suppresses inflammation. These results establish cell membrane-coated microribbon scaffolds as a promising strategy for treating critical size bone defects via immunomodulation. The platform may be broadly used with different cell membranes and scaffolds to enhance regeneration of multiple tissue types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyridinic Nitrogen Sites Dominated Coordinative Engineering of Subnanometric Pd Clusters for Efficient Alkynes&#8217; Semihydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyridinic nitrogen&#8208;site&#8208;dominated coordinative engineering of subnanometric Pd clusters is proposed for efficient alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. The obtained catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits excellent catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene semihydrogenation due to the abundant pyridinic nitrogen sites and interesting electron effects.








Abstract
Supported metal catalysts have played an important role in optimizing selective semihydrogenation of alkynes for fine chemicals. There into, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, as a type of promising support materials, have attracted extensive attentions. However, due to the general phenomenon of random doping for nitrogen species in the support, it is still atremendous challenge to finely identify which nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic property of alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. Herein, it is reported that uniform mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon spheres derived from mesoporous polypyrrole spheres are used as supports to immobilized subnanometric Pd clusters, which provide a particular platform to research the influence of nitrogen configurations on the alkynes&#8217; semihydrogenation. Comprehensive experimental results and density functional theory calculation indicate that pyridinic nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic behavior of Pd clusters. The high contents of pyridinic nitrogen sites offer abundant coordination sites, which greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining reaction step and makes Pd clusters own high catalytic activity. The electron effect between pyridinic nitrogen sites and Pd clusters makes the reaction highly selective. Additionally, the good mesostructures also promote the fast transport of substrate. Based on the above, catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits high catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene (C8H6) semihydrogenation.

         <title>Dual/Triple Template&#8208;Induced Evolved Emulsion for Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Carbon Nanoparticles from Concave to Convex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual/triple template&#8208;induced evolved emulsion strategy is developed for the precise construction of anisotropic mesoporous carbon nanoparticles. It not only endows the concave structure with adjustable size and meso&#8208;structure but also realizes the innovative transformation from concave to convex in a one&#8208;pot method. Moreover, the well&#8208;designed basin&#8208;concave and mountain&#8208;convex nanoparticles manifest excellent performance for improving drug release rate and enzyme catalytic efficiency.








Abstract
Anisotropic mesoporous carbon (AMC) nanoparticles with asymmetric external morphologies, topological internal structure, and superior performance of carbon species are attracting great attention because of their seductive features differentiating them from symmetric nanoparticles. However, a bewildering challenge but crucial desire remains to endow them with flexibly tunable morphology and pore structure. Herein, a dual/triple&#8208;templating evolved emulsion strategy for tunable fabrication of AMC nanoparticles with distinctive defined structure by interface&#8208;energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is first reported based on a brand&#8208;new mechanism. It describes the possible formation process of the concave&#8208;cavity structure and allows for manipulation of the longitudinal and lateral sizes systematically by adjusting emulsion polarity and sodium oleate dosage, respectively. Interestingly, the internal pore structure can be rearranged into radial channels and the external morphology can realize structural transformation from concave to convex by innovatively introducing the third template n&#8208;hexanol, which is unprecedented at nanoscale. Remarkably, due to the excellent properties of carbon species and unique structural characteristics, AMC nanoparticles not only demonstrate good biocompatibility but also exhibit splendid performance in improving the dissolution and release rates of insoluble drug and enhancing the enzyme catalytic efficiency. Generally, this approach provides new inspiration and insights for expanding exquisite anisotropic nanomaterials for many potential applications.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Detection of DNA Nanostructures Using a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;resolution analysis of biomolecules has brought unprecedented insights into fundamental biological processes and dramatically advanced biosensing. Notwithstanding the ongoing resolution revolution in electron microscopy and optical imaging, only a few methods are presently available for high&#8208;resolution analysis of unlabelled single molecules in their native states. Here, we demonstrate label&#8208;free electrical sensing of structured single molecules with a spatial resolution down to single&#8208;digit nanometres. Using a narrow solid&#8208;state nanopore, we detect the passage of a series of nanostructures attached to a freely translocating DNA molecule, resolving individual nanostructures placed as close as 6&#160;nm apart and with a surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface gap distance of only 2&#160;nm. We attribute such super&#8208;resolution ability to the nanostructure&#8208;induced enhancement of the electric field at the tip of the nanopore. Our work demonstrates a general approach to improving the resolution of single&#8208;molecule nanopore sensing and presents a critical advance towards label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution DNA sequence mapping and digital information storage independent of molecular motors.

         <title>Machine Learning Based Approach for Solving Atomic Structures of Nanomaterials Combining Pair Distribution Functions with Density Functional Theory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Determination of crystal structures of nanocrystalline or amorphous compounds is a great challenge in solid states chemistry and physics. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of X&#8208;Ray or neutron total scattering data has proven to be a key element in tackling this challenge. However, in most cases a reliable structural motif is needed as starting configuration for structure refinements. Here, we present an algorithm that is able to determine the crystal structure of an unknown compound by means of an on&#8208;the&#8208;fly trained machine learning model that combines density functional theory (DFT) calculations with comparison of calculated and measured PDFs for global optimization in an artificial landscape. Due to the nature of this landscape, even metastable configurations and stacking disorder can be determined.

         <title>Enhanced Spin Current in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8208;CuOx Bilayer with Top and Sideway Oxidization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Generation and manipulation of spin current are the cores of spintronic devices, which are intensely pursued. Heavy metals with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling are commonly used for the generation of spin current, but incompatible with the mass production of devices and the polarization of spin current is limited to be in&#8208;plane. Here, we show that the spin current with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization component could be generated and transmitted in Ni81Fe19/Cu&#8208;CuOx bilayer with sideway and top oxidizations. The charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin current conversion efficiency could be enhanced through the spin currents consisting of both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization (&#963;z) and in&#8208;plane polarization (&#963;y) induced by spin&#8208;vorticity coupling. Such a spin current is demonstrated to be closely related to the lateral oxidization gradient and could be controlled by changing the temperatures and times of annealing. Our finding provides a novel degree of freedom to produce and control the spin current in spintronic devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generation and manipulation of spin current are the cores of spintronic devices, which are intensely pursued. Heavy metals with strong spin-orbit coupling are commonly used for the generation of spin current, but incompatible with the mass production of devices and the polarization of spin current is limited to be in-plane. Here, we show that the spin current with strong out-of-plane polarization component could be generated and transmitted in Ni&lt;sub&gt;81&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu-CuO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; bilayer with sideway and top oxidizations. The charge-to-spin current conversion efficiency could be enhanced through the spin currents consisting of both out-of-plane polarization (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) and in-plane polarization (&lt;i&gt;&#963;&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) induced by spin-vorticity coupling. Such a spin current is demonstrated to be closely related to the lateral oxidization gradient and could be controlled by changing the temperatures and times of annealing. Our finding provides a novel degree of freedom to produce and control the spin current in spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rational Design of Polymethine Dyes with NIR&#8208;II Emission and High Photothermal Conversion Efficiency for Multimodal Imaging&#8208;Guided Photo&#8208;immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Phototheranostics have emerged and flourished as a promising pattern for cancer theranostics owing to their precise photoinduced diagnosis and therapeutic to meet the demands of precision medicine. The diagnosis information and therapeutic effect are directly determined by the fluorescence imaging ability and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of phototheranostic agents. Hence, how to balance the competitive radiative and nonradiative processes of phototheranostic agents is the key factor to evaluate the phototheranostic effect. Herein, we rationally designed molecules named ICRs with fluorescence emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm), exhibiting high photostability and high PCE. The optimized D&#8211;A interaction and reorganization energy of ICRs were considered to be the key factors for their high PCE. Noteworthily, ICR&#8208;Qu with stronger D&#8211;A interaction and large&#8208;sized conjugated unit encapsulated in nanoparticles exhibited high PCE (81.1%). Besides, ICR&#8208;QuNPs were used for fluorescence imaging (FLI), photoacoustic imaging (PAI), and photothermal imaging (PTI) to guide deep&#8208;tissue photonic hyperthermia, achieving precise removal and inhibition of breast cancer. Furthermore, combined with &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;1, ICR&#8208;QuNPs showed huge potential to be a facile and efficient tool for photo&#8208;immunotherapy. More importantly, this study not only reported an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; polymethine&#8208;based phototheranostic agent but also shed light on the exploration of versatile organic molecules for future practical applications.

         <title>Coordinatively Stiffen and Toughen Hydrogels with Adaptable Crystal&#8208;domain Cross&#8208;linking</title>

Abstract
Conventional hydrogels usually suffer from the inherent conflict between stiffness and toughness, severely hampering their applications as load&#8208;bearing materials. Herein, we reported an adaptable crystal&#8208;domain cross&#8208;linking design to overcome this inherent trade&#8208;off for hydrogels by taking full advantage of both deformation&#8208;resisting and energy&#8208;dissipating capacities of cross&#8208;linking points. Through solvent exchange to homogenize the polymer network, followed by salting out to foster crystallization, a class of sal&#8208;exogels with high number densities of uniform crystalline domains embedded in homogeneous networks was constructed. During the deformation, those adaptive crystalline domains initially survive to arrest deformation, while later disentangle gradually to efficiently dissipate energy, crucial to the realization of the desirable compatibility between stiffness and toughness. The resultant sal&#8208;exogel achieved coordinatively enhanced stiffness (52.3 &#177; 2.7&#160;MPa) and toughness (120.7 &#177; 11.7&#160;kJ/m2), reconciling the challenging trade&#8208;off between them. Our finding provides a practical and universal route to design stiff and tough hydrogels, and would have a profound impact on many applications requiring hydrogels with such combined mechanical properties.

         <title>High Durability of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C Single Atom Catalysts with Carbon Vacancies Towards Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted extensive interest to catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the development of SACs with high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability is a great challenge. In this work, we practically designed and synthesized carbon vacancy modified Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs (FeH&#8208;N&#8208;C) through microenvironment modulation, achieving high&#8208;efficient utilization of active sites and optimization of electronic structures. The FeH&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst exhibited a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91&#160;V and sufficient durability of 100,000 voltage cycles with 29&#160;mV E1/2 loss. Density functional theory calculations confirmed the vacancies around metal&#8208;N4 sites can reduce the adsorption free energy of OH*, and hinder the dissolution of metal centre, significantly enhancing the ORR kinetics and stability. Accordingly, FeH&#8208;N&#8208;C SACs presented a high&#8208;power density and long&#8208;term stability over 1200&#160;h in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries. This work will not only guide for developing highly active and stable SACs through rational modulation of metal&#8208;N4 sites, but also provide an insight into the optimization of the electronic structure to boost electro&#8208;catalytical performances.

         <title>Dense Arrays of Nanohelices: Raman Scattering from Achiral Molecules Reveals the Near&#8208;field Enhancements at Chiral Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Against the background of the current healthcare and climate emergencies, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is becoming a highly topical technique for identifying and fingerprinting molecules, e.g. within viruses, bacteria, drugs, and atmospheric aerosols. Crucial for SERS is the need for substrates with strong and reproducible enhancements of the Raman signal over large areas and with a low fabrication cost. Here, we investigate dense arrays of plasmonic nanohelices (&#8764;100 nm in length) that are of interest for many advanced nanophotonics applications, and we show that they present excellent SERS properties. As an illustration, we present two new ways to probe near&#8208;field enhancement generated with circular polarization at chiral metasurfaces, first using the Raman spectra of achiral molecules (crystal violet) and second using a single, element&#8208;specific, achiral molecular vibrational mode (i.e. a single Raman peak). The nanohelices can be fabricated over large areas at a low cost and they provide strong, robust and uniform Raman enhancement. We anticipate that these advanced materials will find broad applications in surface enhanced Raman spectroscopies and material science.

         <title>Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities in Oxide Semiconductor Devices: A Key Building Block for Applications Ranging from Display Backplanes to 3D Integrated Semiconductor Chips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamentals of oxide semiconductors are addressed, including a brief history, the function of the constituents and defects, transport mechanisms, and reliability issues. Furthermore, recent achievements of oxide semiconductor transistors are reviewed, and their potential for monolithic 3D integration are introduced. Finally, remaining questions and future directions of oxide semiconductor devices are discussed for next&#8208;generation electronics.








Abstract
As Si has faced physical limits on further scaling down, novel semiconducting materials such as 2D transition metal dichalcogenides and oxide semiconductors (OSs) have gained tremendous attention to continue the ever&#8208;demanding downscaling represented by Moore's law. Among them, OS is considered to be the most promising alternative material because it has intriguing features such as modest mobility, extremely low off&#8208;current, great uniformity, and low&#8208;temperature processibility with conventional complementary&#8208;metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor&#8208;compatible methods. In practice, OS has successfully replaced hydrogenated amorphous Si in high&#8208;end liquid crystal display devices and has now become a standard backplane electronic for organic light&#8208;emitting diode displays despite the short time since their invention in 2004. For OS to be implemented in next&#8208;generation electronics such as back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line transistor applications in monolithic 3D integration beyond the display applications, however, there is still much room for further study, such as high mobility, immune short&#8208;channel effects, low electrical contact properties, etc. This study reviews the brief history of OS and recent progress in device applications from a material science and device physics point of view. Simultaneously, remaining challenges and opportunities in OS for use in next&#8208;generation electronics are discussed.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Ionizable Iron Nanoadjuvant Augments STING Activation for Personalized Vaccination Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) is developed to potentiate cancer vaccination immunotherapy. PEIM nanoadjuvant is coassembled from acid&#8208;ionizable&#160;copolymers with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist. PEIM nanoadjuvant effectively delivers tumor antigens to lymph nodes, amplifies STING activation and type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production, and ultimately&#160;elicits antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell response to inhibit tumor growth.








Abstract
The critical challenge for cancer vaccine&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell immunity is the sustained activation of antigen cross&#8208;presentation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, it is first discovered that the clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), markedly augment the type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production profile of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist MSA&#8208;2 and achieve a 16&#8208;fold dosage&#8208;sparing effect in the human STING haplotype. Acid&#8208;ionizable copolymers are coassembled with IONPs and MSA&#8208;2 into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen cross&#8208;presentation to elicit a 55&#8208;fold greater frequency of antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.

         <title>A Pseudocapacitor Diode Based on Ion&#8208;Selective Surface Redox Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudocapacitor diode is proposed for the first time, which is constructed by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox mechanism of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous electrolyte KOH, thus successfully integrating the function of blocking the unidirectional current response of a diode into an aqueous pseudocapacitor with fast ion conduction capability.








Abstract
Supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is a novel device that integrates ion diode functionality into a conventional electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor and is expected to have great applications in emerging fields such as signal propagation, microcircuit rectification, logic operations, and neuromorphology. Here, a brand new pseudocapacitor diode is reported that has both high charge storage (50.2&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) and high rectification (the rectification ratio of 0.79 at 200&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) properties, which is realized by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox reaction of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, an application of the integrated device is demonstrated in the logic gate of circuit system to realize the logic operations of &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;. This work not only expands the types of CAPodes, but also provides a train of thought for constructing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Proton Pseudocapacitor with Ultra&#8208;High Mass Loading and Areal Energy Density for Fast Energy Storage at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The sluggish ionic transport in thick electrodes and freezing electrolytes has limited electrochemical energy storage devices in lots of harsh environments for practical applications. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed proton pseudocapacitor based on high&#8208;mass loading 3D&#8208;printed WO3 anodes, Prussian blue analogue cathodes, and anti&#8208;freezing electrolytes is developed, which can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance at low temperature. Benefiting from the cross&#8208;scale 3D electrode structure using a 3D printing direct ink writing technique, the 3D&#8208;printed cathode realizes an ultrahigh areal capacitance of 7.39 F cm&#8722;2 at a high areal mass loading of 23.51 mg cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the 3D&#8208;printed pseudocapacitor delivers an areal capacitance of 3.44 F cm&#8211;2 and excellent areal energy density (1.08 mWh cm&#8211;2). Owing to the fast ion kinetics in 3D electrodes and the high ionic conductivity of hybrid electrolyte, the 3D&#8208;printed supercapacitor delivers 61.04% of the room&#8208;temperature capacitance even at &#8722;60&#176;C. This work provides an effective strategy for the practical applications of energy storage devices with complex physical structure at extreme temperatures.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Ni&#8208;Cu Catalysts for pH&#8208;Universal CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
CO2 electroreduction is of great significance to reduce CO2 emissions and complete the carbon cycle. However, the unavoidable carbonate formation and low CO2 utilization efficiency in neutral or alkaline electrolytes hinder its application at commercial scale. The development of CO2 reduction under acidic conditions provides a promising strategy, but the inhibition of hydrogen evolution reaction is difficult. Herein, we report the first work to design in a Ni&#8208;Cu dual&#8208;atom catalyst supported on the hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon for pH&#8208;universal CO2 electroreduction to CO. The catalyst showed high CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;99% in acidic, neutral and alkaline electrolytes, and the partial current densities of CO reach 190 &#177; 11 mAcm&#8722;2, 225 &#177; 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 489 &#177; 14&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. In particular, the CO2 utilization efficiency under acidic conditions reaches 64.3%, which is twice higher than that of alkaline conditions. Detailed study indicates the existence of electronic interaction between Ni and Cu atoms. The Cu atoms pushes the Ni d band center further towards the Fermi level, and thereby accelerating the formation of *COOH. In addition, operando characterizations and density functional theory calculation were used to elucidate the possible reaction mechanism of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO under acidic and alkaline electrolytes.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Mott Insulator&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Phase Transition in Ultrathin Intermediate&#8208;Spin Ferromagnetic Perovskite Ruthenates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Light control of emergent quantum phenomena is a widely used external stimulus for quantum materials. Generally, perovskite strontium ruthenate SrRuO3 has an itinerant ferromagnetism with a low&#8208;spin state. However, the phase of intermediate&#8208;spin (IS) ferromagnetic metallic state has never been seen. Here, by means of ultraviolet light irradiation, we show the photocarrier doping induced Mott insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal phase transition in a few atomic layers of perovskite IS ferromagnetic SrRuO3&#8208;&#948;. This new metastable IS metallic phase can be reversibly regulated due to the convenient photocharge transfer from SrTiO3 substrates to SrRuO3&#8208;&#948; ultrathin films. Our dynamical mean&#8208;field theory calculations further verify such photoinduced electronic phase transformation owing to oxygen vacancies and orbital reconstruction. The optical manipulation of charge transfer finesse is an alternative pathway towards discovering novel metastable phases in strongly correlated systems and facilitates the potential light&#8208;controlled device applications in optoelectronics and spintronics.

Abstract
Nebulization is the most widely used respiratory delivery technique with non&#8208;invasive properties. However, nebulized drugs often fail to function due to the excretion and immune clearance of the respiratory system. Here, inspired by pollen in nature, novel shell&#8208;core aerosol particles (APs) capable of Brownian Motion were constructed for respiratory delivery. Drugs&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoparticles were prepared by emulsification to form the inner core, and the membranes of macrophages were extracted to form the outer shell. The optimized size and the shell&#8208;core structure endowed APs with Brownian Motion and atomization stability, thus enabling the APs to reach the bronchi and alveoli deeply for effective deposition. The camouflage of macrophage membranes equipped the APs with immune evasion. In vitro experiments proved that deferoxamine (DFO) loaded APs (DFO@APs) could promote the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. A hyperoxia&#8208;induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) model was constructed to validate the efficiency of DFO@APs. In BPD mice, DFO@APs could release DFO in the alveolar interstitium, thus promoting the reconstruction of microvasculature, ultimately inducing lung development for treating BPD. In conclusion, this study developed &#8220;pollen&#8221;&#8208;inspired shell&#8208;core aerosol particles capable of Brownian Motion, which provides a novel idea and theoretical basis for respiratory administration.

         <title>Rapid Identification and Monitoring of Multiple Bacterial Infections Using Printed Nanoarrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fast and accurate detection of microbial cells in clinical samples is highly valuable but remains a challenge. Here, a simple, culture&#8208;free diagnostic system is developed for direct detection of pathogenic bacteria in water, urine and serum samples using an optical colorimetric biosensor. It consists of printed nanoarrays chemically conjugated with specific antibodies that exhibits distinct color changes after capturing target pathogens. By utilizing the internal capillarity inside an evaporating droplet, target preconcentration is achieved within a few minutes to enable rapid identification and more efficient detection of bacterial pathogens. More importantly, the scattering signals of bacteria can be significantly amplified by the nanoarrays due to strong near&#8208;field localization, which supports a visualizable analysis of the growth, reproduction and cell activity of bacteria at the single&#8208;cell level. Finally, in addition to high selectivity, this nanoarray&#8208;based biosensor is also capable of accurate quantification and continuous monitoring of bacterial load on food over a broad linear range, with a detection limit of 10 CFU mL&#8722;1. This work provides an accessible and user&#8208;friendly tool for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of pathogens in many clinical and environmental applications, and possibly enables a breakthrough in early prevention and treatment.

         <title>Achieving Fast Charge Separation by Ferroelectric Ultrasonic Interfacial Engineering for Rapid Sonotherapy of Bacteria&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bacteria&#8208;infected osteomyelitis is life&#8208;threatening without effective therapeutic methods clinically. Here we report a rapid and effective therapeutic strategy to treat osteomyelitis through ferroelectric polarization interfacial engineering of BiFeO3/MXene (Ti3C2) triggered by ultrasound (US). Under US, the ferroelectric polarization induces the formation of piezoelectric field. US cavitation effect&#8208;induced sonoluminescence stimulates BiFeO3/Ti3C2 to produce photogenerated carriers. With synergistic action of polarization electric field and Schottky junction, BiFeO3/Ti3C2 accelerates the separation of electrons and holes and simultaneously inhibits the backflow of electrons, thus improving the utilization of polarized charges and photogenerated charges and consequently enhancing the yield of reactive oxygen species under US. As a result, 99.87 &#177; 0.05% of Staphylococcus aureus are efficiently killed in 20&#160;min with the assistance of ultrasonic heating. We propose the theory of ferroelectric ultrasonic interfacial engineering, which brings new insight for developing ferroelectric ultrasonic responsive materials used for the diagnosis and therapy of deep tissue infection and other acoustoelectric devices.

         <title>Revisiting Lithium&#8208; and Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage in Hard Carbon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The galvanostatic lithiation/sodiation voltage profiles of hard carbon anodes are simple, with a sloping drop followed by plateau. However, a precise understanding of the corresponding redox sites and storage mechanisms is still elusive, which hinders further development in commercial applications. In this study, a comprehensive comparison of the lithium&#8208; and sodium&#8208;ion storage behaviors of hard carbon is conducted, yielding the following key findings: 1) the sloping voltage section is presented by the lithium&#8208;ion intercalation in the graphitic lattices of hard carbons, whereas it mainly arises from the chemisorption of sodium&#8208;ions on their inner surfaces constituting closed pores, even if the graphitic lattices are unoccupied; 2) the redox sites for the plateau capacities are the same as those for the closed pores regardless of the alkali ions; 3) the sodiation plateau capacities are mostly determined by the volume of the available closed pore, whereas the lithiation plateau capacities are primarily affected by the intercalation propensity; and 4) the intercalation preference and the plateau capacity have an inverse correlation. These findings from extensive characterizations and theoretical investigations provide a relatively clear elucidation of the electrochemical footprint of hard carbon anodes in relation to the redox mechanisms and storage sites for lithium and sodium ions, thereby providing a more rational design strategy for constructing better hard carbon anodes.

         <title>Cooperative Electronic Structure Modulator of Fe Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for High Energy and Long Cycle Li&#8211;S Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of electron exchangeable binding sites comprising thiophene S and oxidized S, adjacent to Fe single atom electrocatalysts, improves Li2S redox kinetics by modulating d&#8208;orbital level of Fe single atom via electron exchange. These specially designed electrocatalysts enable realization of a 1 A h level Li&#8211;S pouch cell with high gravimetric energy density and long cycle stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy and long cycle lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) pouch cells are limited by the insufficient capacities and stabilities of their cathodes under practical electrolyte/sulfur (E/S), electrolyte/capacity (E/C), and negative/positive (N/P) ratios. Herein, an advanced cathode comprising highly active Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is reported to form 320.2&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 multistacked Li&#8211;S pouch cells with total capacity of &#8776;1 A h level, satisfying low E/S (3.0), E/C (2.8), and N/P (2.3) ratios and high sulfur loadings (8.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). The high&#8208;activity Fe SAC is designed by manipulating its local environments using electron&#8208;exchangeable binding (EEB) sites. Introducing EEB sites comprising two different types of S species, namely, thiophene&#8208;like&#8208;S (&#8211;S) and oxidized&#8208;S (&#8211;SO2), adjacent to Fe SACs promotes the kinetics of the Li2S redox reaction by providing additional binding sites and modulating the Fe d&#8208;orbital levels via electron exchange with Fe. The &#8211;S donates the electrons to the Fe SACs, whereas &#8211;SO2 withdraws electrons from the Fe SACs. Thus, the Fe d&#8208;orbital energy level can be modulated by the different &#8211;SO2/&#8211;S ratios of the EEB site, controlling the electron donating/withdrawing characteristics. This desirable electrocatalysis is maximized by the intimate contact of the Fe SACs with the S species, which are confined together in porous carbon.

Gold/aluminum micro&#8208;strips repeat along a specific direction and periodically form overlaps and gaps in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner like the patterns of a zebra. After compounding with semiconducting supramolecular nanowires, an output voltage of 140&#160;V can be achieved on a flexible substrate upon illumination.








Abstract
The mutual conversion between light and electricity lies at the heart of optoelectronic and photonic applications. Maximization of the photoelectric conversion is a long&#8208;term goal that can be pursued via the fabrication of devices with ad&#8208;hoc architectures. In this framework, it is of utter importance to harvest and transform light irradiation into high electric potential in&#160;specific area for driving functional dielectrics that respond to pure electric field. Here, a nano&#8208;fabrication technology has been devised featuring double self&#8208;alignment that is applied to construct zebra&#8208;like asymmetric heterojunction arrays. Such nanostructured composite, which covers a surface area of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;mm2 and contains 500 periodic repeating units, is capable of photo generating voltages as high as 140&#160;V on a flexible substrate. This approach represents a leap over the traditional functionalization process based on simply embedding materials into devices by demonstrating the disruptive potential of integrating oriented nanoscale device components into meta&#8208;material.

         <title>Ultrasensitive and Ultraprecise Pressure Sensors for Soft Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Highly sensitive soft pressure sensors have attracted tremendous attention in recent years due to their great promise in robotics, healthcare, smart wearables, etc. Although high sensitivities can be realized by existing sensing mechanisms, they usually cause large random errors owing to inhomogeneous sensing layers, thus considerably reducing the sensing precision for practical applications. Herein, we present a pure&#8208;polymer and field emission bilayer structure (PFEBS)&#8208;based transduction mechanism to successfully design an ultrasensitive and ultraprecise soft pressure sensor for the first time. This unique structure enables numerous tunnelling electrons generated by field emission to be transmitted through the homogeneous sensing layer, which undergoes uniform deformation under subtle pressures, simultaneously achieving a sensing precision with variation less than 1.62% and a sensitivity of 372.2 kPa&#8722;1. This study offers a new design strategy to develop next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible pressure sensors for soft systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Fabrication of Size&#8208;Controlled Pickering Emulsions, Colloidosomes and Air&#8208;Coated Particles via Clog&#8208;Free Jetting of Suspensions</title>

Abstract
Microcapsules with a liquid core and a solid shell composed of hydrophobic nanoparticles are broadly applied in food, pharmaceutics, and biotechnologies. For example, Pickering emulsions, colloidosomes, or antibubbles (droplets surrounded by air layers in water) enable the controlled release of active agents, biocompatibility, and contact&#8208;less liquid transportation. However, producing controlled nanoparticle&#8208;or polymer&#8208;laden hydrophobic shells at scale is highly challenging, since bulk methods are polydisperse and droplet&#8208;based methods such as microfluidic chips are prone to clogging and slow. Here we show clog&#8208;free coating of an aqueous jet with silica nanoparticle suspensions with concentrations up to 10% (w/v) as well as high concentrations of polymers (30% (w/v) poly(lactic acid)), enabling continuous generation of microcapsules at flow rates up to 4&#160;mL/min. Pickering emulsions were converted into capsules, providing hydrophobic shells consisting of nanoparticles for controlled release. As a highlight, we demonstrate the scalable fabrication of&#160;air&#8208;coated capsules (antibubbles) in the sub&#8208;mm range. The shell contains an air film that protects the liquid core for days yet enables ultrasound&#8208;induced release within 3 minutes. By enabling rapid fabrication of controlled Pickering emulsions, colloidosomes, antibubbles, and biodegradable capsules, jetting through a liquid layer (JetALL) provides a versatile platform for advanced applications in food, pharmacy, and life science.

         <title>Principles of Design and Synthesis of Metal Derivatives from MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Materials derived from metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have demonstrated exceptional structural variety and complexity and can be synthesized using low&#8208;cost scalable methods. Although the inherent instability and low electrical conductivity of MOFs are largely responsible for their low uptake for catalysis and energy storage, a superior alternative is MOF&#8208;derived metal&#8208;based derivatives (MDs) as these can retain the complex nanostructures of MOFs while exhibiting stability and electrical conductivities of several orders of magnitude higher. The present work comprehensively reviews MDs in terms of synthesis and their nanostructural design, including oxides, sulfides, phosphides, nitrides, carbides, transition metals, and other minor species. The focal point of the approach is the identification and rationalization of the design parameters that lead to the generation of optimal compositions, structures, nanostructures, and resultant performance parameters. The aim of this approach is to provide an inclusive platform for the strategies to design and process these materials for specific applications. This work is complemented by detailed figures that both summarize the design and processing approaches that have been reported and indicate potential trajectories for development. The work is also supported by comprehensive and up&#8208;to&#8208;date tabular coverage of the reported studies.

         <title>Realizing Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Bactericidal Capability through the Phonon&#8211;Electron Coupling Effect Using Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalytic Planar Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D catalytic planar defects have been rationally designed and engineered for reversing the ultrasonic silence of Ti3C2, dramatically realizing the highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal therapy. It is unveiled that the electron's origin, electron transfer, and the visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by ultrasound are attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect.








Abstract
Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such 0D defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. Herein, 2D catalytic planar defects are designed within Ti3C2&#160;sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti3+ species (Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+)) can yield surface&#8208;bound O due to the effective activation of O2, thus resulting in a substantial amount of 1O2&#160;generation and the 99.72%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. It is discovered that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene in electron transfer through the phonon drag effect&#8212;a coupling effect between surface electrons and US&#8208;triggered phonons&#8212;that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O2&#160;activation energy from 1.65&#160;to 0.06&#160;eV. This design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D. Moreover, it is revealed that the electron origin, electron transfer, and visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by US can be attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect. After coating with neutrophil membrane (NM) proteins, the NM&#8208;Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+) sheets further demonstrate a 6&#8208;log10&#160;reduction in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus burden in the infected bony tissue.

         <title>Stretchable Electrodes Based on Over&#8208;layered Liquid Metal Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid metals are attractive materials for stretchable electronics owing to their high electrical conductivity and near&#8208;zero Young's modulus. However, the high surface tension of liquid metals makes it difficult to form films. We propose a novel stretchable film based on an over&#8208;layered liquid&#8208;metal network. An intentionally oxidized interfacial layer helps to construct uninterrupted indium and gallium nanoclusters and produces additional electrical pathways between the two metal networks under mechanical deformation. The films exhibited gigantic negative piezoresistivity (G&#8208;NPR), which decreased the resistance up to 85% during the first 50% stretching. This G&#8208;NPR property was due to the rupture of the metal oxides, which allowed the formation of liquid eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn) and the connection of the over&#8208;layered networks to build new electrical paths. Our electrodes exhibiting G&#8208;NPR can be complementarily combined with conventional electrodes to amplify their performance or achieve some unique operations.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid metals are attractive materials for stretchable electronics owing to their high electrical conductivity and near-zero Young's modulus. However, the high surface tension of liquid metals makes it difficult to form films. We propose a novel stretchable film based on an over-layered liquid-metal network. An intentionally oxidized interfacial layer helps to construct uninterrupted indium and gallium nanoclusters and produces additional electrical pathways between the two metal networks under mechanical deformation. The films exhibited gigantic negative piezoresistivity (G-NPR), which decreased the resistance up to 85% during the first 50% stretching. This G-NPR property was due to the rupture of the metal oxides, which allowed the formation of liquid eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) and the connection of the over-layered networks to build new electrical paths. Our electrodes exhibiting G-NPR can be complementarily combined with conventional electrodes to amplify their performance or achieve some unique operations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>On the Road to the Frontiers of Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries: A Review and Outlook of Graphene Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Graphene has long been recognized as a potential anode for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The past decade has witnessed the rapid advancement of graphene anodes, and considerable breakthroughs have been achieved so far. In this review, we aim to provide a research roadmap of graphene anodes towards practical LIBs. We start with the Li storage mechanism of graphene and then comprehensively summarize the approaches to improve its electrochemical performances. Firstly, morphologically engineered graphene anodes with porous, spheric, ribboned, defective and holey structures display improved capacity and rate performance owing to their high accessible surface area, interconnected diffusion channels and sufficient active sites. While surface&#8208;modified graphene anodes with less aggregation, fast electrons/ions transportation, and optimal solid electrolyte interphase are discussed, demonstrating the close connection between the surface structure and electrochemical activity of graphene. Secondly, graphene derivatives anodes prepared by heteroatom doping and covalent functionalization are outlined, which show great advantages in boosting the Li storage performances because of the additionally introduced defect/active sites for further Li accommodation. Furthermore, binder&#8208;free and free&#8208;standing graphene electrodes exhibiting great prospects for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and flexible LIBs are presented. Finally, the remaining challenges and future opportunities of practically available graphene anodes for advanced LIBs are highlighted.

         <title>Triple threshold transitions and strong polariton interaction in 2D layered Metal&#8208;Organic Framework microplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature interaction between light&#8208;matter hybrid particles such as exciton&#8208;polaritons under extremely low&#8208;pump plays a crucial role in future coherent quantum light sources. However, the practical and scalable realization of coherent quantum light sources operating under low&#8208;pump remains a challenge because of the insufficient polariton interaction strength. Here, at room temperature, we demonstrate a very large polariton interaction strength, g &#8776; 128&#8197; &#177; 21&#8197;&#956;eV&#956;m2 realized in a 2D nano&#8208;layered Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF). As a result, a polariton lasing at an extremely&#8208;low pump fluence of P1 &#8776; 0.01&#8197; &#177; 0.0015&#8197;&#8197;&#956;Jcm&#8722;2 (first threshold) was observed. Interestingly, as pump fluencies increase to P2 &#8776; 0.031&#8197; &#177; 0.003&#8197;&#8197;&#956;Jcm&#8722;2&#8197;(second threshold), a spontaneous transition to a polariton breakdown region occurred, which was not reported before. Finally, an ordinary photon lasing occurred at P3 &#8776; 0.11&#8197; &#177; 0.077&#8197;&#8197;&#956;Jcm&#8722;2 (third threshold), or above. Our experiments and statistical model reveal new insights on the transition mechanisms characterized by three distinct optical regions. This work introduces MOF as a new type of quantum material, with their naturally formed polariton cavities, as a cost&#8208;effective and scalable solution to build micro&#8208;scale coherent quantum light sources and polaritonic devices.

         <title>21.15%&#8208;Efficiency and Stable &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by an Acyloin Ligand</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) is a promising light&#8208;absorbing material for constructing perovskite solar cells (PSCs) owing to its favorable bandgap and thermal tolerance. However, the high density of defects in the CsPbI3 film not only act as recombination centers, but also facilitate ion migration, leading to lower PCE and inferior stability compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid PSC counterpart. Theoretical analyses suggest that suppression defects in CsPbI3 film is helpful for improving the device performance. Herein, we demonstrate the stable and efficient &#947;&#8208;CsPbI3 PSCs by developing acyloin ligand (1,2&#8208;Di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethane&#8208;1,2&#8208;dione (DED)) as phase stabilizer and defects passivator. The experiment and calculation results confirm that carbonyl and thienyl in DED can synergistically interact with CsPbI3 by forming chelate to effectively passivate Pb&#8208;related defects and further suppress the ion migration. Consequently, DED treated CsPbI3 PSCs yield a champion PCE of 21.15%, which is one of the highest PCE among all the reported CsPbI3 PSCs to date. In addition, the unencapsulated DED&#8208;CsPbI3 PSCs can retain 94.9% of its initial PCE when stored under ambient atmospheric conditions for 1000&#160;h and 92.8% of its initial PCE under constant illumination for 250&#160;h.

         <title>Biosystem&#8208;Inspired Engineering of Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities have shown great potential to become surrogates of natural enzymes in many fields by virtue of their advantages of high catalytic stability, ease of functionalization, and low cost. However, due to the lack of predictable descriptors, most of the nanozymes reported in the past were obtained mainly through trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategies, and the catalytic efficiency, substrate specificity, as well as practical application effect under physiological conditions, are far inferior to that of natural enzymes. To optimize the catalytic efficacies and functions of nanozymes in biomedical settings, recent studies have introduced biosystem&#8208;inspired strategies into nanozyme design. In this review, recent advances in the engineering of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes by leveraging the refined catalytic structure of natural enzymes, simulating the behavior changes of natural enzymes in the catalytic process, and mimicking the specific biological processes or living organisms, are introduced. Furthermore, the currently involved biomedical applications of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes are summarized. More importantly, the current opportunities and challenges of the design and application of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes are discussed. It is hoped that the studies of nanozymes based on bioinspired strategies will be beneficial for constructing the new generation of nanozymes and broadening their biomedical applications.

         <title>Electrically Switchable Polarization in Bi2O2Se Ferroelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atomically two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered ferroelectric semiconductors, in which the polarization switching process occurs within the channel material itself, offer a new material platform that could drive electronic components towards structural simplification and high&#8208;density integration. Here, a room&#8208;temperature 2D layered ferroelectric semiconductor, bismuth oxychalcogenides (Bi2O2Se), is investigated with a thickness down to 7.3&#160;nm (&#8764;12 layers) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) of 4.4 &#177; 0.1 pm V&#8722;1. The random orientations and electrically&#8208;dependent polarization of the dipoles in Bi2O2Se are separately uncovered owing to the structural symmetry&#8208;breaking at room temperature. Specifically, the interplay between ferroelectricity and semiconducting characteristics of Bi2O2Se is explored on device&#8208;level operation, revealing the hysteresis behaviors and memory windows formation. Leveraging the ferroelectric polarization originating from Bi2O2Se, the fabricated device exhibits &#8220;smart&#8221; photoresponse tunability and excellent electronic characteristics, e.g., a high on/off current ratio &gt;&#160;104 and a large memory window to the sweeping range of 47% at VGS = &#177;5&#160;V. These results demonstrate the synergistic combination of ferroelectricity with semiconducting characteristics in Bi2O2Se, laying the foundation for integrating sensing, logic and memory functions into a single material system that could overcome the bottlenecks in von Neumann architecture.

Leveraging the ferroelectric polarization originating from Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se, the fabricated device exhibits &#8220;smart&#8221; photoresponse tunability and excellent electronic characteristics, e.g., a high on/off current ratio &amp;gt;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and a large memory window to the sweeping range of 47% at V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; = &#177;5&#160;V. These results demonstrate the synergistic combination of ferroelectricity with semiconducting characteristics in Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se, laying the foundation for integrating sensing, logic and memory functions into a single material system that could overcome the bottlenecks in von Neumann architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Convective Thermal Metamaterials: Exploring High&#8208;Efficiency, Directional, and Wave&#8208;Like Heat Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Convective thermal metamaterials are artificial structures where convection dominates in the thermal process. Due to the field coupling between velocity and temperature, convection provides a new knob for controlling heat transfer beyond pure conduction, thus allowing active and robust thermal modulations. With the introduced convective effects, the original parabolic Fourier heat equation for pure conduction could be transformed hyperbolic. Therefore, the hybrid diffusive system can be interpreted in a wave&#8208;like fashion, reviving many wave phenomena in dissipative diffusion. Here, we review recent advancements in convective thermal metamaterials and classify the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art discoveries into the following four aspects, enhancing heat transfer, porous&#8208;media&#8208;based thermal effects, nonreciprocal heat transfer, and non&#8208;Hermitian phenomena. Finally, we cast a prospect on convective thermal metamaterials from two aspects. One is to utilize the convective parameter space to explore topological thermal effects. The other is to further broaden the convective parameter space with spatiotemporal modulation and multi&#8208;physical effects.

         <title>Intrinsic Optical Properties and Emerging Applications of Gold Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The collective oscillation of free electrons at the nanoscale surface of gold nanostructures is closely modulated by tuning the size, shape/morphology, phase, composition, hybridization, assembly, and nanopatterning, along with the surroundings of the plasmonic surface located at a dielectric interface with air, liquid, and solid. This review first introduces the physical origin of the intrinsic optical properties of gold nanostructures and further summarizes stimuli&#8208;responsive changes in optical properties, metal&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced optical signals, luminescence spectral shaping, chiroptical response, and photogenerated hot carriers. The current success in the landscape of nanoscience and nanotechnology mainly originates from the abundant optical properties of gold nanostructures in the thermodynamically stable face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase. It has been further extended by crystal phase engineering to prepare thermodynamically unfavorable phases (e.g., kinetically stable) and heterophases to modulate their intriguing phase&#8208;dependent optical properties. A broad range of promising applications, including but not limited to full&#8208;color displays, solar energy harvesting, photochemical reactions, optical sensing, and microscopic/biomedical imaging, have fostered parallel research on the multitude of physical effects occurring in gold nanostructures.

         <title>Hydrogel Nanoarchitectonics of a Flexible and Self&#8208;adhesive Electrode for Long&#8208;term Wireless Electroencephalogram Recording and High&#8208;accuracy Sustained Attention Evaluation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hydrogels are ideal building blocks to fabricate the next generation of electrodes for acquiring high&#8208;quality physiological electrical signals, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG). However, collection of EEG signals still suffers from electrode deformation, sweating, extensive body motion and vibration, and environmental interference. Herein, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) are selected to prepare a hydrogel network with tissue&#8208;like modulus and excellent flexibility. Additionally, polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs), obtained by PDA peroxidation, are integrated into the hydrogel to endow them with higher transparency, higher self&#8208;adhesion, and lower impedance. Consequently, a multichannel and wirelessly operated hydrogel electrode can establish a conformal and stable interface with tissue and illustrate high channel uniformity, low interfacial contact impedance, low power noise, long&#8208;term stability, and a tolerance to sweat and motion. Furthermore, the hydrogel electrode shows the unprecedented ability to classify the recorded high&#8208;quality prefrontal electroencephalography (EEG) signals into seven&#8208;category sustained attention with high accuracy (91.5%), having great potential applications in the assessment of human consciousness, and in multifunctional diagnoses.

         <title>Reconfigurable Optoelectronic Synaptic Transistor with Stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 Nanocrystals for Visuomorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Reconfigurable phototransistor memory attracts considerable attention for adaptive visuomorphic computing, with high&#8208;efficient sensing, memory and processing functions integrated onto a single device. However, developing reconfigurable phototransistor memory remains a challenge due to the lack of all&#8208;optically controlled transition between short&#8208;term plasticity (STP) and long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP). Herein, an air&#8208;stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystal (PNC)&#8208;based phototransistor memory is designed capable of broadband photo responses. Benefitting from the different electron capture ability of Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 PNCs to 650 and 405&#160;nm light, artificial synapse and non&#8208;volatile memory can be created on&#8208;demand and quickly reconfigured within a single device for specific purposes. Owing to the optically reconfigurable and wavelength&#8208;aware operation between STP and LTP modes, the integrated blue feature extraction and target recognition can be demonstrated in a homogeneous neuromorphic vision sensor array. This work suggests a new way in developing perovskite optoelectronic transistors for highly efficient in&#8208;sensor computing.

         <title>Direct Observation of Oxygen Atoms Taking Tetrahedral Interstitial Sites in Medium&#8208;Entropy Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Solutions</title>

Abstract
Interstitial solutes, such as carbon in steels, are effective solid&#8208;solution hardening agents. These alloying elements are believed to occupy the octahedral interstices in body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (bcc) metals. Using deep&#8208;sub&#8208;angstrom resolution electron ptychography, here we provide the first experimental evidence to directly observe individual oxygen atoms, and discern in which interstitial sites they are located, in a concentrated bcc solid solution &#8212; the (TiNbZr)86O12C1N1 medium&#8208;entropy alloy (MEA). In addition to oxygen interstitials residing in octahedral sites, we show the first unambiguous evidence of a switch in preference to the unusual tetrahedral sites at high oxygen concentrations. This shift away from octahedral occupancy is explained as resulting from the extra cost of strain energy when the requisite displacement of the host atoms is deterred in the presence of nearby octahedral interstitials.

         <title>3D Printing a Low&#8208;cost Miniature Accommodating Optical Microscope</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This decade had witnessed the tremendous progress in miniaturizing optical imaging systems. Despite the advancements in 3D printing optical lenses at increasingly smaller dimensions, challenges remain in precisely manufacturing the dimensionally compatible optomechanical components and assembling them into a functional imaging system. To tackle this issue, here we report the use of 3D printing to enable digitalized optomechanical components manufacturing, part&#8208;count&#8208;reduction design, and the inclusion of passive alignment features, all for the ease of system assembly. We 3D printed the key optomechanical components of a penny&#8208;sized accommodating optical microscope in 50 minutes at a significantly reduced unit cost near $4. By actuating a built&#8208;in voice&#8208;coil&#8208;motor, we validated its accommodating capability to focus on specimens located at different distances, and further utilized a focus stacking function to greatly extended depth&#8208;of&#8208;field. The microscope can be readily customized and rapidly manufactured to respond to task&#8208;specific needs in form&#8208;factor and optical characteristics.

         <title>Non&#8208;Destructive Low&#8208;Temperature Contacts to MoS2 Nanoribbon and Nanotube Quantum Dots</title>

Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide nanoribbons and nanotubes are quasi&#8208;one dimensional semiconductors with strong spin&#8208;orbit interaction, a nanomaterial highly promising for quantum electronic applications. Here, we demonstrate that a bismuth semimetal layer between the contact metal and this nanomaterial strongly improves the properties of the contacts. Two&#8208;point resistances on the order of 100&#160;k&#937; are observed at room temperature. At cryogenic temperature, Coulomb blockade is visible. The resulting stability diagrams indicate a marked absence of trap states at the contacts and the corresponding disorder, compared to previous devices which use low&#8208;work function metals as contacts. Single level quantum transport is observed at temperatures below 100&#160;mK. Graphical Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide nanoribbons and nanotubes grown from vapour phase are a low defect density nanomaterial highly promising for quantum electronic applications. Devices integrating them with bismuth&#8208;based contacts show strongly reduced contact resistances and a marked absence of trap states at cryogenic temperatures. This allows for quantum dot Coulomb blockade measurements. Single level quantum transport is observed at temperatures below 100mK.

         <title>Graphene spin valve for spin logic devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An alternative to charge&#8208;based electronics identifies the spin degree of freedom for information communication and processing. The long spin diffusion length in graphene at room temperature demonstrates its ability for highly scalable spintronics. The development of graphene spin valve (SV) has inspired spin devices in graphene including spin field&#8208;effect transistors and spin majority logic gates. A comprehensive picture of spin transport in graphene SVs is required for further development of spin logic. This Review examines the advances in graphene SVs and their role in the development of spin logic devices. We discuss different transport and scattering mechanisms in charge and spin. Furthermore, we compare the on/off switching energy between graphene SVs and charge&#8208;based FETs to highlight their prospect for low&#8208;power devices. We finally outline the challenges and perspectives that need to be addressed for the future development of spin logic devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanocrystalline Structures from Freestanding Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scientific exploration of nanomaterials has led to massive growth in understanding and applications of quantum materials at the nanoscale. A route for fabrication of nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality utilizing self&#8208;assembly of freestanding membranes transferred on appropriate substrates is presented. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry after self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
The exploration of crystalline nanostructures enhances the understanding of quantum phenomena occurring in spatially confined quantum matter and may lead to functional materials with unforeseen applications. A novel route to fabricating nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality is presented. This is achieved by utilizing a self&#8208;assembly process of ultrathin membranes composed of the desired oxide. The thermally induced self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystalline structures is driven by dewetting the oxide membranes once they are lifted off and transferred onto sapphire surfaces. In three successive steps, the process provides nanovoids, nanowires, and nanocrystals. Regardless of substrate orientation, the nanostructures are highly anisotropic in shape due to material retraction favoring low&#8208;index crystalline lattice directions of the membranes. The orientation of the nanostructures is provided precisely by the crystal lattice of the transferred membrane. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry, both maintained all the way down to the well&#8208;developed crystalline facets. The demonstrated self&#8208;assembly process holds the potential to improve the understanding of surface diffusion phenomena at the interface of materials, which is important for advancing epitaxial growth technology and paves the way to fabricating crystalline nanostructures by the transfer and self&#8208;assembly of membranes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained Programmable Hygroelectronic Interfaces for Humidity&#8208;Regulated Hierarchical Information Encryption and Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG) technology opens up new possibilities for humidity&#8208;responsive materials, devices, and interdisciplinary opportunities in fields like information security. Here, hygroelectronic information interfaces, which are based on an MEG structure with a hygroionic energy&#8208;conversion route, are put forward for humidity&#8208;regulated hierarchical information encryption and display.








Abstract
The emerging moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG) technology opens up new possibilities for humidity&#8208;responsive materials, devices, and interdisciplinary opportunities in fields like information security. However, such potential remains untapped. Here, an original MEG structure with a hygroionic energy&#8208;conversion route by selective coating of ionic hygroscopic hydrogels on a carbon black surface is reported. The hygroionic route features a process in which the scavenged energy is stored in the electrical double layers formed at the interfaces between the ionic hydrogel and the carbon nanoparticles. The resultant electrical field developed across the hydrogel&#8208;coated wet carbon and the rest of the dry carbon area is thus durably lasted. Based on this unique structure, hygroelectronic information interfaces (HEII) for humidity&#8208;regulated information encryption and display&#160;are put forward by devising hydrogel patterns on a carbon platform. Further by tuning the hygroscopicity of the ionic hydrogels and incorporating encoding methods (e.g., Morse code), it is demonstrated that the HEII platform is programmable to carry different information in certain humidity ranges. Unlike those conventional anti&#8208;counterfeiting methods that optically reveal the hidden information once the required stimulus is provided, the new HEII serves as a hierarchical solution for high&#8208;security encryption and display.

         <title>Dual Topology of Dirac Electron Transport and Photo&#8208;galvanic Effect in Low&#8208;dimensional Topological Insulator Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Dual topological insulators, simultaneously protected by time&#8208;reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, open great opportunities to explore different symmetry&#8208;protected metallic surface states. However, the conventional dual topological states located on different facets hinders integration into planar opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic devices. Here, we construct dual topological superlattices (TSLs) Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N with limited stacking layer number N. Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron emission spectra of the TSLs identify the coexistence and adjustion of dual topological surface states on Bi2Se3 facet. The existence and tunability of spin&#8208;polarized dual&#8208;topological bands with N on Bi2Se3 facet result in an unconventionally weak antilocalization effect (WAL) with variable WAL coefficient &#945;&#8197;(maximum close to 3/2) from quantum transport experiments. Most importantly, we identify the spin&#8208;polarized surface electrons from dual topological bands exhibit circularly and linearly polarized photo&#8208;galvanic effect (CPGE and LPGE). We anticipate that the stacked dual&#8208;topology and stacking layer number controlled bands evolution provide a platform for realizing intrinsic CPGE and LPGE. Our results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.

Abstract
Piezoelectric materials play a key role in applications, while there are physically open questions. The physical origin of piezoelectricity is understood as the sum of contributions from intrinsic effects on lattice dynamics and those from extrinsic effects on ferroic&#8208;domain dynamics, but there is an incomplete understanding that all but intrinsic effects are classified as extrinsic effects. Therefore, the accurate classification of extrinsic effects is important to understand the physical origin of piezoelectricity. BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 are considered promising alternative lead&#8208;based materials. In this work, we utilize high&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction to measure the response of BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 piezoelectrics and intrinsic/extrinsic contribution to electric fields. It is found to crystal structure and intrinsic/extrinsic contribution using the analysis involving structure refinement with various structural model and micromechanics&#8208;based calculations that Bi3+ ion disordering at A&#8208;site in BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 system are important for realization of piezoelectricity and nano&#8208;domains. Here, we have suggested that the extrinsic effect on the rearrangement of nano&#8208;domains. The nano&#8208;domains, which is formed by locally distorted structure around A&#8208;site by Bi ion disordering, can significantly deform the material in BiFeO3&#8722;BaTiO3 system, which contributes to the piezoelectric actuation mechanism apart from the extrinsic effect on ferroic&#8208;domain dynamics. Bi ion disordering plays an important role in realizing piezoelectricity and nano&#8208;domains and can provide essential material design clues to develop next&#8208;generation Bi&#8208;based lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramics using the control of disordered direction or off&#8208;centering displacement.

         <title>Thermoresponsive Electrolytes for Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Exploring advanced strategies in alleviating the thermal runaway of LMBs is critically essential. Herein, a novel electrolyte system with thermoresponsive characteristics is designed to largely enhance the thermal safety of 1.0 Ah LMBs. Specifically, vinyl carbonate (VC) with azodiisobutyronitrile is introduced as a thermoresponsive solvent to boost the thermal stability of both the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and electrolyte. Firstly, abundant poly(VC) is formed in SEI with thermoresponsive electrolyte, which is more thermally stable against lithium hexafluorophosphate compared to the inorganic components widely acquired in routine electrolyte. This increases the critical temperature for thermal safety (the beginning temperature of obvious self&#8208;heating) from 71.5 to 137.4&#160;&#176;C. The remained VC solvents can be polymerized into poly(VC) as the battery temperature abnormally increases. The poly(VC) can not only afford as a barrier to prevent the direct contact between electrodes, but also immobilize the free liquid solvents, thereby reducing the exothermic reactions between electrodes and electrolytes. Consequently, the internal&#8208;short&#8208;circuit temperature and &#8220;ignition point&#8221; temperature (the starting temperature of thermal runaway) of LMBs are largely increased from 126.3 and 100.3&#160;&#176;C to 176.5 and 203.6&#160;&#176;C. This work provides novel insights for pursuing thermally stable LMBs with the addition of various thermoresponsive solvents in commercial electrolytes.

         <title>Formation and Applications in Electronic Devices of Lattice&#8208;Aligned Gallium Oxynitride Nanolayer on Gallium Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Gallium nitride (GaN), a promising alternative semiconductor to Si, is widely used in photoelectronic and electronic technologies. However, the vulnerability of the GaN surface is a critical restriction that hinders the development of GaN&#8208;based devices, especially in terms of device stability and reliability. In this study, this challenge was&#160;overcome by converting the GaN surface into a gallium oxynitride (GaON) epitaxial nanolayer through an in&#8208;situ two&#8208;step &#8220;oxidation&#8211;reconfiguration&#8221; process. The O plasma treatment overcomes the chemical inertness of the GaN surface, and sequential thermal annealing manipulates the kinetic&#8211;thermodynamic reaction pathways to create a metastable GaON nanolayer with a wurtzite lattice. The GaN&#8208;derived GaON nanolayer is a tailored structure for surface reinforcement and possesses several advantages, including a wide bandgap, high thermodynamic stability, and large valence band offset with a GaN substrate. These physical properties can be further leveraged to enhance the performance of GaN&#8208;based devices in various applications, such as power systems, complementary logic integrated circuits, photoelectrochemical water splitting, and ultraviolet photoelectric&#160;conversion.

         <title>Arming Ru with Oxygen Vacancy Enriched RuO2 Sub&#8208;nanometer Skin Activates Superior Bifunctionality for pH&#8208;Universal Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Water electrolysis has been expected to assimilate the renewable yet intermediate energy&#8208;derived electricity for green H2 production. However, current benchmark anodic catalysts of Ir/Ru&#8208;based compounds severely suffer from poor dissolution resistance. Herein, we propose an effective modification strategy by arming a sub&#8208;nanometer RuO2 skin with abundant oxygen vacancy to the interconnected Ru clusters/carbon hybrid microsheet (denoted as Ru@V&#8208;RuO2/C HMS), which can not only inherit the high HER activity of Ru, but more importantly, activate the superior activity towards OER in both acid and alkaline conditions. Outstandingly, it can achieve an ultralow overpotential of 176/201&#160;mV for OER and 46/6&#160;mV for HER to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline solution, respectively. Inspiringly, the overall water splitting can be driven with an ultrasmall cell voltage of 1.467/1.437&#160;V for 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4/1.0&#160;M KOH, respectively. Density functional theory calculations disclose that armoring the oxygen vacancy enriched RuO2 exoskeleton can cooperatively alter the interfacial electronic structure and make the adsorption behavior of hydrogen and oxygen intermediates much close to the ideal level, thus simultaneously speeding up the hydrogen evolution kinetics and decreasing the energy barrier of oxygen release.

         <title>Modular Approach to Creating Functionalized Surface Arrays of Molecular Qubits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The quest for developing quantum technologies is driven by the promise of exponentially faster computations, ultra&#8208;high performance sensing and achieving thorough understanding of many&#8208;particle quantum systems. Molecular spins are excellent qubit candidates because they feature long coherence times, are widely tunable through chemical synthesis and can be interfaced with other quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits. A present challenge for molecular spin qubits is their integration in quantum devices, which requires arranging them in thin films or monolayers on surfaces. However, clear proof of the survival of quantum properties of molecular qubits on surfaces has not been reported so far. Furthermore, little is known about the change in spin dynamics of molecular qubits going from the bulk to monolayers. Here, we report a versatile bottom&#8208;up method to arrange molecular qubits as functional groups of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on surfaces, combining molecular self&#8208;organization and click chemistry. Coherence times of up to 13 &#956;s demonstrate that qubit properties are maintained or even enhanced in the monolayer.

Abstract
Artificial neuronal devices are critical building blocks of neuromorphic computing systems and currently the subject of intense research motivated by application needs from new computing technology and more realistic brain emulation. Researchers have proposed a range of device concepts that can mimic neuronal dynamics and functions. Although the switching physics and device structures of these artificial neurons are largely different, their behaviors can be described by several neuron models in a more unified manner. In this paper, the reports of artificial neuronal devices based on emerging volatile switching materials are reviewed from the perspective of the demonstrated neuron models, with a focus on the neuronal functions implemented in these devices and the exploitation of these functions for computational and sensing applications. Furthermore, the neuroscience inspirations and engineering methods to enrich the neuronal dynamics that remain to be implemented in artificial neuronal devices and networks towards realizing the full functionalities of biological neurons are discussed.

         <title>Polymer Solar Cells with Active Layer Thickness Compatible with Scalable Fabrication Processes: A Meta&#8208;Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active layers with high thickness are needed for the manufacture of organic solar devices using roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll&#8208;compatible deposition techniques. On the other hand, high thickness values disfavor charge transport and, consequently, efficiency. Identifying the best compromise between thin and thick layers is essential to bring the organic photovoltaics technology to the market.








Abstract
Organic photovoltaics (OPV) has been considered for a long time a promising emerging solar technology. Currently, however, market shares of OPV are practically non&#8208;existent. A detailed meta&#8208;analysis of the literature published until mid&#8208;2021 is presented, focusing on one of the remaining issues that need to be addressed to translate the recent remarkable progress, obtained in devices&#8217; performance at lab&#8208;scale level, into the requirements able to boost the manufacturing&#8208;scale production. Namely, the active layer's thickness is referred to, which, together with device efficiency and stability, represents one of the biggest challenges of this technological research field. Papers describing solar cells containing non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) binary and ternary blends, as well as NFA plus fullerene acceptor (FA) ternary blends are reviewed. The common ground of all analyzed devices is their high&#8208;thickness active layers, compatible with large&#8208;area deposition techniques. By defining a new figure of merit to discuss the OPV thickness (thickness tolerance, TT), it is found that this parameter is not affected by the chemical family's nature of the active blend components. On the other hand, the analysis suggests that there are promising strategies to improve the TT, which are discussed in the conclusion section.

         <title>HACS: Helical Auxetic Yarn Capacitive Strain Sensors with Sensitivity Beyond the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capacitive strain sensors are theoretically limited in their sensitivity. In this work, stretchable and flexible strain sensors are fabricated using a helical auxetic yarn structure providing access to auxetic character in the fiber form. The helical auxetic capacitive sensors (HACS) are able to access sensitivity beyond the theoretical limit, determined to be because of an engulfment phenomenon that occurs as a result of the materials employed and the auxetic character.








Abstract
The development of flexible strain sensors over the past decade has focused on accessing high strain percentages and high sensitivity (i.e., gauge factors). Strain sensors that employ capacitance as the electrical signal to correlate to strain are typically restricted in sensitivity because of the Poisson effect. By employing auxetic structures, the limits of sensitivity for capacitive sensors have been exceeded, which has improved the competitiveness of this modality of sensing. In this work, the first employment of helical auxetic yarns as capacitive sensors is presented. It is found that the response of the helical auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (termed as HACS) is dependent on the two main fabrication variables&#8212;the ratio of diameters and the helical wrapping length. Depending on these variables, sensors that respond to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitance values can be obtained. A greater auxetic character results in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains&#8212;a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far is obtained. A mechanism of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally is proposed.

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Switching Based on Sub&#8208;Bandgap Photo&#8208;Activation of Charge Trapping in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controllable optical properties are crucial for the application of light&#8208;emitting materials in optical devices. In this work, controllable photoluminescence in metal halide perovskite crystals was realized via photoactivation of their defects. We found that under continuous excitation, the photoluminescence intensity of a CH3NH3PbBr3 crystal can be fully controlled by sub&#8208;bandgap energy photon illumination. Such optically controllable emission behavior is rather general as it was observed also in CsPbBr3 and other perovskite materials. We assign the switching mechanism to reversible light&#8208;induced activation/deactivation of nonradiative recombination centers, the presence of which relates to an excess of Pb during perovskite synthesis. Given the success of perovskites in photovoltaics and optoelectronics, we believe that the discovery of green luminescence controlled by red illumination will extend the application scope of perovskites toward optical devices and intelligent control.

         <title>Macrocycle&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Macrocycles with well&#8208;defined cavities and the ability to undergo supramolecular interactions are classical materials that have played an essential role in materials science. However, one of the most substantial barriers limiting the utilization of macrocycles is their aggregation, which blocks the active regions. Among many attempted strategies to prevent such aggregation, installing macrocycles into covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which are porous and stable reticular networks, has emerged as an ideal solution. The resulting macrocycle&#8208;based COFs (M&#8208;COFs) preserve the macrocycles&#8217; unique activities, enabling applications in various fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, adsorption/separation, optoelectronics, phototherapy, and structural design of forming single&#8208;layered or mechanically interlocked COFs. The resulting properties are unmatchable by any combination of macrocycles with other substrates, opening a new chapter in advanced materials. This review focuses on the latest progress in the concepts, synthesis, properties, and applications of M&#8208;COFs, and presents an in&#8208;depth outlook on the challenges and opportunities in this emerging field.

         <title>Atomic Aerogel Materials (or single atom aerogels): an Interesting New Paradigm in Materials Science and Catalysis Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The concept of &#8220;single atom catalysis&#8221; was first proposed by Zhang, Li and Liu in 2011. The single atom catalysts (SACs) have a very high catalytic activity and greatly improved atom utilization ratio. At present, SACs have become the frontier and advanced functional materials in the field of catalysis. Aerogels are highly porous materials with extremely low density and extremely high porosity. These pores play a key role in determining their properties such as surface reactivity and mechanical stability. The allied paradigm products of SACs and aerogels can fully reflect their structural advantages and lead to new enhancement effects. Herein, we propose a general concept of &#8220;atomic aerogel materials&#8221; (AAMs) (or single atom aerogels (SAAs)) to describe this interesting single atom new paradigm in both material and catalysis fields. Based on the basic units of &#8220;gel&#8221;, the AAMs can be divided into two categories: carrier&#8208;level AAMs (with micron, nano, or sub&#8208;nano meter pore structures) and atomic&#8208;level AAMs (with atomic&#8208;defective or oxygen&#8208;bridged sub&#8208;nano pore structures). The basic unit of the former (i.e., single&#8208;atom&#8208;functionalized aerogels) is the carrier materials in nano structures, and the latter (i.e., single&#8208;atom&#8208;built aerogels) is the single metal atoms in atomic structures. The atomic&#8208;defective or oxygen&#8208;bridged AAMs would be important future development directions in versatile heterogeneous catalytic or non&#8208;catalytic fields. The designing proposals, latent challenges, and coping strategies of this new &#8220;atomic&#8208;nano system&#8221; in&#160;practical applications&#160;are pointed out as&#160;well.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Enhanced Microwave Attenuation in Titanate Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), which incorporate multiple&#8208;principal cations into single&#8208;phase crystals and interact with diverse metal ions, extend the border for available compositions and unprecedented properties. Herein, w e report on a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;stabilized (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2La0.2Pb0.2)TiO3 perovskite, and the effective absorption bandwidth (90% absorption) improved almost two times than that of BaTiO3. The results demonstrate that the regulation of entropy configuration can yield significant grain boundary, oxygen defects, and ultra&#8208;dense distorted lattice. These characteristics give rise to strong interfacial and defect&#8208;induced polarizations, thus synergistically contributing to the dielectric attenuation performance. Moreover, the large strains derived from the strong lattice distortions in high&#8208;entropy perovskite offer varied transport for electron carriers. The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;enhanced positive/negative charges accumulation around grain boundaries and strain&#8208;concentrated location, quantitatively validated by electron holography, results in unusual dielectric polarization loss. This study opens up an effective avenue for designing strong microwave absorption materials to satisfy the increasingly demanding requirements of advanced and integrated electronics. O ur work also offers a paradigm for improving other interesting properties for HEOs through entropy engineering.

&lt;p&gt;High-entropy oxides (HEOs), which incorporate multiple-principal cations into single-phase crystals and interact with diverse metal ions, extend the border for available compositions and unprecedented properties. Herein, w e report on a high-entropy-stabilized (Ca&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ba&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;)TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite, and the effective absorption bandwidth (90% absorption) improved almost two times than that of BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The results demonstrate that the regulation of entropy configuration can yield significant grain boundary, oxygen defects, and ultra-dense distorted lattice. These characteristics give rise to strong interfacial and defect-induced polarizations, thus synergistically contributing to the dielectric attenuation performance. Moreover, the large strains derived from the strong lattice distortions in high-entropy perovskite offer varied transport for electron carriers. The high-entropy-enhanced positive/negative charges accumulation around grain boundaries and strain-concentrated location, quantitatively validated by electron holography, results in unusual dielectric polarization loss. This study opens up an effective avenue for designing strong microwave absorption materials to satisfy the increasingly demanding requirements of advanced and integrated electronics. O ur work also offers a paradigm for improving other interesting properties for HEOs through entropy engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Perspiring Soft Robotics Skin Constituted by Dynamic Polarity&#8208;Switching Porous Liquid Crystal Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Secretion of functional fluids is essential for affecting surface properties, such as lubrication, and transporting biochemical elements in ecosystems[2]. The existing synthetic polymer membranes that mimic human skin functions are primarily limited to secreting, either apolar or polar, liquid[4]. However, the development of membranes that grant exchange liquid with different polarities with the capability to subsequently eject it again remains a grand challenge. This process is fundamentally prohibited by the mismatch of the polarity between the carrier polymer and the loaded liquid. To conquer this physical limitation, we report an innovative strategy to dynamically switch the polarity of the porous membrane skin, thereby empowering exchange apolar liquid with polar liquid and vice versa. Our approach incorporates a benzoic acid derivative into the original apolar polymer network. The benzoic acid dimerizes and forms hydrogen bonds, which supports the processing procedure and molecular alignment, but can be broken into the ionic state when subjected to alkaline treatment, changing the polarity of the polymer membrane. Consequently, the apolar liquid can be replaced with a more polar one. This polar liquid is ejected upon safe&#8208;dose UV illumination from the polymer membrane. Reabsorption may occur on demand by illumination of visible light or, when left in contact with the membrane, spontaneously in the dark. Based on this, the consumed membrane is replenished with the same or different exchanging liquid. The membrane's ability to secrete, uptake, and exchange versatile liquids, even at two extremes of the spectrum, broadens the application fields of the membrane ranging from lubrication, anti&#8208;icing, to drug delivery. We envision that the polarity&#8208;switching active membrane skins will open up an avenue for, among others, soft robotics[6], lithium&#8208;ion batteries[7], environment&#8208;interactive surfaces[8], and biomedical science and technology[9
].

         <title>Membrane Protein Modification Modulates Big and Small Extracellular Vesicle Biodistribution and Tumorigenic Potential in Breast Cancers in vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by cells to mediate intercellular communication under pathological and physiological conditions. While small EVs (sEVs; &lt;100&#8211;200&#160;nm, exosomes) are intensely investigated, the properties and functions of medium and large EVs (big EVs [bEVs]; &gt;200&#160;nm, microvesicles) are less well explored. Here, we identify bEVs and sEVs as distinct EV populations, and determine that bEVs are released in a greater bEV:sEV ratio in the aggressive human triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. PalmGRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)&#8208;based EV reporter, reveals dose&#8208;dependent EV biodistribution at non&#8208;lethal and physiological EV dosages, as compared to lipophilic fluorescent dyes. Remarkably, the bEVs and sEVs exhibit unique biodistribution profiles, et individually promote in vivo tumor growth in a syngeneic immunocompetent TNBC breast tumor murine model. The bEVs and sEVs share mass spectrometry (MS)&#8208;identified tumor progression&#8208;associated EV surface membrane proteins (tpEVSurfMEMs), which include SLC29A1, CD9 and CD44. tpEVSurfMEM depletion attenuates EV lung organotropism, alters biodistribution, and reduces protumorigenic potential. This study identifies distinct in vivo property and function of bEVs and sEVs in breast cancer, which suggest the significant role of bEVs in diseases, diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

         <title>S Species&#8208;Evoked High&#8208;valence Ni2+&#948; of the Evolved &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 Electrode for Selective Oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural</title>

Abstract
This work reports an efficient NiSx&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrode for the selective oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) with excellent electrocatalytic HMF selectivity (99.4%), conversion (97.7%) and Faraday efficiency (98.3%). The decoration of NiSx would evoke high&#8208;valent Ni2+&#948; species in the reconstructed &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrode, which are the real active species for HMFOR. The generated NiSx/Ni(OH)O modulated the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process of HMFOR, where the electrocatalytically generated Ni(OH)O can effectively trap the protons from the CHO&#8208; end in HMF to realize electron transfer. The OER competes with the HMFOR when NiSx/Ni(OH)O continues to accumulate to generate the NiSx/NiOx(OH)y intermediate. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results verify that the adsorption energy of HMF can be optimized through the increased NiSx composition for more efficient capture of protons and electrons in the HMFOR.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organohydrogel Artificial Muscle with Compartmentalized Anisotropic Actuation Under Microdomain Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organohydrogel actuator achieving the combination of high speed, high actuation strength, and large material size is proposed. The water is confined in hydrophobic microdomains in organohydrogel, thus realizing a compartmentalization actuation mode similar to muscle. This strategy can break through the limitations that originated from the traditional solvent diffusion actuation mechanism, inspiring gel actuator design.








Abstract
Current hydrogel actuators mostly suffer from weak actuation strength and low responsive speed owing to their solvent diffusion&#8208;induced volume change mechanism. Here a skeletal muscle&#8208;inspired organohydrogel actuator is reported in which solvents are confined in hydrophobic microdomains. Organohydrogel actuator is driven by compartmentalized directional network deformation instead of volume change, avoiding the limitations that originate from solvent diffusion. Organohydrogel actuator has an actuation frequency of 0.11&#160;Hz, 110 times that of traditional solvent diffusion&#8208;driven hydrogel actuators (&lt;10&#8722;3&#160;Hz), and can lift more than 85 times their own weight. This design achieves the combination of high responsive speed, high actuation strength, and large material size, proposing a strategy to fabricate hydrogel actuators comparable with skeletal muscle performance.

         <title>Microscale Combinatorial Libraries for the Discovery of High&#8208;Entropy Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale combinatorial libraries are introduced as a new method for exploration of polyelemental material systems. Composition gradients of quinary material systems are produced and characterized for crystal properties and electrocatalytic activity. The small dimensions of microscale combinatorial libraries enable efficient screening of thousands of compositions. Highly active electrocatalysts are identified in the systems Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt and Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt.








Abstract
Polyelemental material systems, specifically high&#8208;entropy alloys, promise unprecedented properties. Due to almost unlimited combinatorial possibilities, their exploration and exploitation is hard. This challenge is addressed by co&#8208;sputtering combined with shadow masking to produce a multitude of microscale combinatorial libraries in one deposition process. These thin&#8208;film composition spreads on the microscale cover unprecedented compositional ranges of high&#8208;entropy alloy systems and enable high&#8208;throughput characterization of thousands of compositions for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions using nanoscale scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. The exemplary exploration of the composition space of two high&#8208;entropy alloy systems provides electrocatalytic activity maps for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution as well as oxygen reduction reactions. Activity optima in the system Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt are identified, and active noble&#8208;metal lean compositions in the system Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt are discovered. This illustrates that the proposed microlibraries are a holistic discovery platform to master the multidimensionality challenge of polyelemental systems.

&lt;p&gt;Polyelemental material systems, specifically high-entropy alloys, promise unprecedented properties. Due to almost unlimited combinatorial possibilities, their exploration and exploitation is hard. This challenge is addressed by co-sputtering combined with shadow masking to produce a multitude of microscale combinatorial libraries in one deposition process. These thin-film composition spreads on the microscale cover unprecedented compositional ranges of high-entropy alloy systems and enable high-throughput characterization of thousands of compositions for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions using nanoscale scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. The exemplary exploration of the composition space of two high-entropy alloy systems provides electrocatalytic activity maps for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution as well as oxygen reduction reactions. Activity optima in the system Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt are identified, and active noble-metal lean compositions in the system Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt are discovered. This illustrates that the proposed microlibraries are a holistic discovery platform to master the multidimensionality challenge of polyelemental systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cation Composition Engineering of Hybrid Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Self&#8208;Healing Electronics Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthesis cesium/formamidinium (Cs/FA) mixed&#8208;cation perovskite nanocrystals possess high structural and optoelectronic properties for integration in self&#8208;healing polymer composites. Entropic&#8208;driven self&#8208;healing not only enhances white backlight display performance, but also sustains the working performance of a shattered&#8211;repaired glass substrate laser, thereby representing potentially major advances in optoelectronics and photonics applications.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskite nanocrystal (HPNC) with high crystallinity, color purity, and tunable optical bandgap offers a practical pathway toward next&#8208;generation&#160;displays. Herein, a two&#8208;step modified hot&#8208;injection combined with cation compositional engineering and surface treatment to synthesize high&#8208;purity cesium/formamidinium lead bromide HPNCs(Cs1&#8208;xFAxPbBr3) is presented. The optimized Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) exhibit uniform luminescence of 3500&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a prominent current efficiency of 21.5&#160;cd A&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP) integrated with white LED backlight and laser prototypes exhibited 4 h autonomous self&#8208;healing through the synergistic effect of weak reversible imine bonds and stronger H&#8208;bonds. First, the SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;initial and SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;cut possess high long&#8208;term stability and dramatically suppressed lead leakage as low as 0.6&#160;ppm along with a low leakage rate of 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 and 3.36 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 even over 6 months in water. Second, the Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 HPNCs and SHP&#8208;induced shattered&#8211;repaired perovskite glass substrate show the lowest lasing threshold values of 1.24 and 8.58 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides an integrative and in&#8208;depth approach to exploiting SHP with intrinsic and entropic self&#8208;healing capabilities combined with HPNCs to develop robust and reliable soft&#8208;electronic backlight and laser applications.

         <title>Control of Molecular Orbital Ordering Using a van der Waals Monolayer Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling and tuning the orbital ordering in a single molecule using a monolayer ferroelectric substrate is realized. This is achieved by adsorbing transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc) molecules on a ferroelectric monolayer SnTe. The orbital order is probed using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, and it is demonstrated that it can be controllably changed by switching the polarization direction of the underlying ferroelectric monolayer.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials provide a promising platform for the electrical control of quantum states. In particular, due to their 2D nature, they are suitable for influencing the quantum states of deposited molecules via the proximity effect. Here, electrically controllable molecular states in phthalocyanine molecules adsorbed on monolayer ferroelectric material SnTe are reported. The strain and ferroelectric order in SnTe are found to create a transition between two distinct orbital orders in the adsorbed phthalocyanine molecules. By controlling the polarization of the ferroelectric domain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it is successfully demonstrated that orbital order can be manipulated electrically. The results show how ferroelastic coupling in 2D systems allows for control of molecular states, providing a starting point for ferroelectrically switchable molecular orbital ordering and ultimately, electrical control of molecular&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Reconstruction of Conductive Filaments in HfOx&#8208;Based Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive filaments (CFs) with different morphologies after forming, set, and reset operations are clearly revealed in HfOx&#8208;based memristors by the 3D reconstruction of c&#8208;AFM technique. Multiple conductive filaments are successfully observed in the devices with three different resistive states. The rupture location of CFs after reset is also observed clearly.








Abstract
HfOx&#8208;based memristor has been studied extensively as one of the most promising memories for the excellent nonvolatile data storage and computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory capabilities. However, the resistive switching mechanism, relying on the formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs) during device operations, is still under debate. In this work, the CFs with different morphologies after different operations&#8212;forming, set, and reset&#8212;are clearly revealed for the first time by 3D reconstruction of conductive atomic force microscopy (c&#8208;AFM) images. Intriguingly, multiple CFs are successfully observed in HfOx&#8208;based memristor devices with three different resistive states. CFs after forming, set, and reset exhibit the typical morphologies of hourglass, inverted&#8208;cone, and short&#8208;cone, respectively. The rupture location of CFs after the reset operation is also observed clearly. These findings reveal the microscopic behaviors underlying the resistive switching, which could pave the road to design and optimize oxide&#8208;based memristors for both memory and computing applications.

         <title>A New Class of Cluster&#8211;Matrix Nanocomposite Made of Fully Miscible Components</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prospect for creating highly metastable nanocomposite materials made from fully miscible alloy systems, like Ni&#8211;Cu, is opened. The cluster ion beam deposition technique allows stabilization of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters in a Cu&#8208;matrix with varying macroscopic concentration. Consequently, unique magnetic and magnetotransport properties are evident as a function of cluster concentration and enthalpy&#8208;driven cluster dissolution.








Abstract
Nanocomposite materials, consisting of two or more phases, at least one of which has a nanoscale dimension, play a distinctive role in materials science because of the multiple possibilities for tailoring their structural properties and, consequently, their functionalities. In addition to the challenges of controlling the size, size distribution, and volume fraction of nanometer phases, thermodynamic stability conditions limit the choice of constituent materials. This study goes beyond this limitation by showing the possibility of achieving nanocomposites from a bimetallic system, which exhibits complete miscibility under equilibrium conditions. A series of nanocomposite samples with different compositions are synthesized by the co&#8208;deposition of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters and a flux of Cu&#8208;atoms using a novel cluster ion beam deposition system. The retention of the metastable nanostructure is ascertained from atom probe tomography (APT), magnetometry, and magnetotransport studies. APT confirms the presence of nanoscale regions with &#8776;100 at% Ni. Magnetometry and magnetotransport studies reveal superparamagnetic behavior and magnetoresistance stemming from the single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic Ni&#8208;clusters embedded in the Cu&#8208;matrix. Essentially, the magnetic properties of the nanocomposites can be tailored by the precise control of the Ni concentration. The initial results offer a promising direction for future research on nanocomposites consisting of fully miscible elements.

         <title>Elastomers grow into actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It is common knowledge that when an elastomer (rubber) is stretched, its length will maintain if its two ends are fixed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is common knowledge that when an elastomer (rubber) is stretched, its length will maintain if its two ends are fixed. Here, we serendipitously find that an elastomer slowly elongated further to achieve buckling under such conditions, whose final length is much longer than the pre-stretched length. This allows to design untethered autonomous synthetic material-based soft robots that do not need any other chemical or electrical energy sources or external stimuli after the pre-strain is installed. Once the growth starts, the elongation continues to proceed even when the applied force is removed. Moreover, the elastomer after growing eventually forms a robust soft actuator which can be reshaped for different purposes. Few synthetic materials can grow like this so far. Our investigation shows that the material has an uncommon liquid crystal phase. Contrary to normal liquid crystals, it becomes birefringent only at high temperatures. The formation and the reshaping of the resulting soft actuators relate to a usually unnoticed reversible reaction. The work is promised to promote further understanding of dynamic covalent chemistry and liquid crystal elastomers, as well as to foster new designs and high-impact applications of bio-inspired sustainable soft actuators in areas other than soft robots.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Assisted Compressed Flux Growth: A Universal and High&#8208;Yield Method for Dimension&#8208;Controlled Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single crystals possess the most perfect and stable morphology, and represent the intrinsic and upper limits of performance when integrated into various application scenarios. However, for a large portion of the newly emerging low&#8208;dimensional and molecular materials, the mass production of crystals with a desirable shape is still challenging. Here, we provide a universal and high&#8208;yield method to grow functional single crystals with controlled dimensions that could be directly integrated into a device. By utilizing a polymeric flux in combination with a compressed growth space, numerous materials can be grown into size&#8208;controllable single crystalline flakes, with millions produced in one batch. This scalable growth method shows promise for the large&#8208;scale integration of micro&#8208;single crystals as functional components, as exemplified by the construction of a 5&#8208;inch field effect transistor array.

         <title>Electrochemical replication and transfer for low&#8208;cost, sub&#8208;100&#160;nm patterning of materials on flexible substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;resolution patterns on flexible substrates is an essential step in the development of flexible electronics, However, the patterning process on flexible substrates often requires expensive equipment and tedious lithographic processing. We report here an bottom&#8208;up patterning technique, termed electrochemical replication and transfer (ERT), which fabricates multi&#8208;scale patterns of a wide variety of materials by selective electrodeposition of target materials on a pre&#8208;defined template, and subsequent transfer of the electrodeposited materials to a flexible substrate, while leaving the undamaged template for reuse for over 100 times. The additive and parallel patterning attribute of ERT allows the fabrication of multi&#8208;scale patterns with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many cm simultaneously, which overcomes the tradeoff between resolution and throughput of conventional patterning techniques. ERT is suitable for fabricating a wide variety of materials including metals, semiconductors, metal oxides, and polymers into arbitrary shapes on flexible substrates at a very low cost.

         <title>3D Printing of Self&#8208;assembling Nanofibrous Multidomain Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
3D printing has become one of the primary fabrication strategies used in biomedical research. Recent efforts have focused on the 3D printing of hydrogels to create structures that better replicate the mechanical properties of biological tissues. These pose a unique challenge, as soft materials are difficult to pattern in three dimensions with high fidelity. Currently, a small number of biologically derived polymers that form hydrogels are frequently reused for 3D printing applications. Thus, there exists a need for novel hydrogels with desirable biological properties that can be used as 3D printable inks. In this work, we establish the printability of Multidomain Peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides that form a nanofibrous hydrogel at low concentrations. MDPs with different charge functionalities are optimized as distinct inks and are used to create complex three&#8208;dimensional structures, including multi&#8208;MDP prints. Additionally, printed MDP constructs are used to demonstrate charge&#8208;dependent differences in cellular behavior in vitro. This work presents the first time that self&#8208;assembling peptides have been used to print layered structures with overhangs and internal porosity. Overall, MDPs are a promising new class of 3D printable inks that are uniquely peptide&#8208;based and rely solely on supramolecular mechanisms for assembly.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Dielectrophoretic Microparticle Manipulation Platform Based on a Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered DEP microparticle manipulation platform based on a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is proposed, which performs high&#8208;efficiency cell separation. This work provides an ideal scheme for improving the portability of microfluidic chips and is beneficial to the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.








Abstract
Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems aim to integrate laboratory operations on a miniaturized device with broad application prospects in the field of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing. However, bulky peripheral power resources, such as high&#8208;voltage supplies, function generators, and amplifiers, hamper the commercialization of the system. In this work, a portable, self&#8208;powered microparticle manipulation platform based on triboelectrically driven dielectrophoresis (DEP) is reported. A rotary freestanding triboelectric nanogenerator (RF&#8208;TENG) and rectifier/filter circuit supply a high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current signal to form a non&#8208;uniform electric field within the microchannel, realizing controllable actuation of the microparticles through DEP. The operating mechanism of this platform and the control performance of the moving particles are systematically studied and analyzed. Randomly distributed particles converge in a row after passing through the serpentine channel and various particles are separated owing to the different DEP forces. Ultimately, the high&#8208;efficiency separation of live and dead yeast cells is achieved using this platform. RF&#8208;TENG as the power source for lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip exhibits better safety and portability than traditional high&#8208;voltage power sources. This study presents a promising solution for the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip.

         <title>&#8220;Enzyme&#8208;Like&#8221; Spatially Fixed Polyhydroxyl Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Hydrochromic Molecular Switching for Naked Eye Detection of ppm Level Humidity</title>

         <dc:description>
An &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy for ultralow humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) is proposed, which activates hydrochromic molecular switching by constructing a spatially&#8208;fixed polyhydroxyl microenvironment. As a result, recyclable naked eye recognition of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm humidity is achieved first. This UHSP provides a more economical, environmental friendly and convenient choice for ultralow humidity monitoring required by high&#8208;tech manufacturing such as chips, solar cells, etc.








Abstract
The detection and monitoring of ultralow humidity (&lt;100&#160;ppm) are critical in many important industries, such as high&#8208;tech manufacturing, scientific research, and aerospace. However, the development of ppm level humidity sensors with portability, low cost, and ease of regeneration remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy is proposed to address this problem by employing suitable molecular&#8208;level humidity&#8208;sensitive units and chemically constructing a multilevel spatial synergistic sensitization microenvironment around it. The as&#8208;prepared ultralow humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) achieved a naked eye recognition humidity of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm. UHSP not only is simple to prepare, handy and low&#8208;cost, but can also be simply and efficiently regenerated as well as recycled many times by skillfully utilizing the &#8220;unconventional sublimation&#8221; and &#8220;lime slaked&#8221; of calcium oxide. The molecular reaction mechanisms involved in the humidity response and regeneration of UHSP have been demonstrated in detail. UHSP can provide a promising new method for ultralow humidity detection in the form of portable kits or sirens. The demonstrated &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy can bring unlimited ideas and implications to the design and development of sensors with tunable response thresholds, particularly high sensitivity.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Change Perovskite Microlaser with Tunable Polarization Vortex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subwavelength&#8208;thin perovskite metasurface supporting multiple bound states in the continuum is used to realize a tunable polarization&#8208;vortex laser. The structural phase&#8208;change properties of the perovskite induce bistable dynamic switching of the topological charges as a function of temperature.








Abstract
Metasurfaces supporting optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) are emerging as simple and compact optical cavities to realize polarization&#8208;vortex lasers. The winding of the polarization around the singularity defines topological charges which are generally set by the cavity design and cannot be altered without changing geometrical parameters. Here, a subwavelength&#8208;thin phase&#8208;change halide perovskite BIC metasurface functioning as a tunable polarization vortex microlaser is demonstrated. Upon the perovskite structural phase transitions, both its refractive index and gain vary substantially, inducing reversible and bistable switching between distinct polarization vortexes underpinned by opposite topological charges. Dynamic tuning and switching of the resulting vector beams may find use in microscopy imaging, particle trapping and manipulation, and optical data storage.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Controllable Syntheses and Property Modulations from 2D Ferromagnetic Fe5Se8 to Metallic Fe3Se4 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the composition&#8208;controllable syntheses of 2D non&#8208;layered iron selenide nanosheets (25% Fe&#8208;intercalated triclinic Fe5Se8 and 50% Fe&#8208;intercalated monoclinic Fe3Se4), via a robust chemical vapor deposition strategy is presented. Intriguingly, it has been revealed that the 2D Fe5Se8 exhibits intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic property, and the ultrathin Fe3Se4 presents a novel metallic feature.








Abstract
Exploring new&#8208;type 2D magnetic materials with high magnetic transition temperature and robust air stability has attracted wide attention for developing innovative spintronic devices. Recently, intercalation of native metal atoms into the van der Waals gaps of 2D layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been developed to form 2D non&#8208;layered magnetic TMDs, while only succeeded in limited systems (e.g., Cr2S3, Cr5Te8). Herein, composition&#8208;controllable syntheses of 2D non&#8208;layered iron selenide nanosheets (25% Fe&#8208;intercalated triclinic Fe5Se8 and 50% Fe&#8208;intercalated monoclinic Fe3Se4) are firstly reported, via a robust chemical vapor deposition strategy. Specifically, the 2D Fe5Se8 exhibits intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic property, which is explained by the change of electron spin states from layered 1T'&#8208;FeSe2 to non&#8208;layered Fe&#8208;intercalated Fe5Se8 based on density functional theory calculations. In contrast, the ultrathin Fe3Se4 presents novel metallic features comparable with that of metallic TMDs. This work hereby sheds light on the composition&#8208;controllable synthesis and fundamental property exploration of 2D self&#8208;intercalation induced novel TMDs compounds, by propelling their application explorations in nanoelectronics and spintronics&#8208;related fields.

         <title>An Effective Sneak&#8208;Path Solution Based on a Transient&#8208;Relaxation Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy in which&#160;the transient relaxation in a type of dynamic selector made from unipolar volatile memristors is harnessed to effectively address&#160;the sneak&#8208;path problem in memristor arrays is demonstrated.








Abstract
An efficient strategy for addressing individual devices is required to unveil the full potential of memristors for high&#8208;density memory and computing applications. Existing strategies using two&#8208;terminal selectors that are preferable for compact integration have trade&#8208;offs in reduced generality or functional window. A strategy that applies to broad memristors and maintains their full&#8208;range functional window is proposed. This strategy uses a type of unipolar switch featuring a transient relaxation or retention as the selector. The unidirectional current flow in the switch suppresses the sneak&#8208;path current, whereas the transient&#8208;relaxation window is exploited for bidirectional programming. A unipolar volatile memristor with ultralow switching voltage (e.g., &lt;100&#160;mV), constructed from a protein nanowire dielectric harvested from Geobacter sulfurreducens, is specifically employed as the example switch to highlight the advantages and scalability in the strategy for array integration.

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption via Charge Transfer at the Semiconductor&#8211;Metal Heterointerface&#160;for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The RhP2/Rh heterointerface induces electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which effectively increases the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakens the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2. The interfacial electron transfer can activate the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2, effectively promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics.








Abstract
Designing and synthesizing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is important for realizing the hydrogen economy. Tuning the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts is essential to achieve optimal HER activity, and interfacial engineering is an effective strategy to induce electron transfer in a heterostructure interface to optimize HER kinetics. In this study, ultrafine RhP2/Rh nanoparticles are synthesized with a well&#8208;defined semiconductor&#8211;metal heterointerface embedded in N,P co&#8208;doped graphene (RhP2/Rh@NPG) via a one&#8208;step pyrolysis. RhP2/Rh@NPG exhibits outstanding HER performances under all pH conditions. Electrochemical characterization and first principles density functional theory calculations reveal that the RhP2/Rh heterointerface induces electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which increases the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakens the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2, thereby accelerating the HER kinetics. Moreover, the interfacial electron transfer activates the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2 in neutral and alkaline environments, thereby promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster HER kinetics.

         <title>Hybrid Block Copolymer/Perovskite Heterointerfaces for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid block copolymer/perovskite heterointerfaces strategy is developed for the first time by introducing a novel and functional block copolymer PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6, and consequently, such an architecture enhances light harvesting, promotes charge transfer and prevents moisture invasion, delivering a champion efficiency over 24% together with enhanced stability.








Abstract
Solution processable semiconductors like organics and emerging lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are ideal candidates for photovoltaics combining high performance and flexibility with reduced manufacturing cost.

&lt;p&gt;A hybrid block copolymer/perovskite heterointerfaces strategy is developed for the first time by introducing a novel and functional block copolymer PBDB-T-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PTY6, and consequently, such an architecture enhances light harvesting, promotes charge transfer and prevents moisture invasion, delivering a champion efficiency over 24% together with enhanced stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution processable semiconductors like organics and emerging lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are ideal candidates for photovoltaics combining high performance and flexibility with reduced manufacturing cost. Moreover, the study of hybrid semiconductors would lead to advanced structures and deep understanding that will propel this field even further. Herein, a novel device architecture involving block copolymer/perovskite hybrid bulk heterointerfaces is investigated, such a modification could enhance light absorption, create an energy level cascade, and provides a thin hydrophobic layer, thus enabling enhanced carrier generation, promoting energy transfer and preventing moisture invasion, respectively. The resulting hybrid block copolymer/perovskite solar cell exhibits a champion efficiency of 24.07% for 0.0725&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-sized devices and 21.44% for 1&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-sized devices, respectively, together with enhanced stability, which is among the highest reports of organic/perovskite hybrid devices. More importantly, this approach has been effectively extended to other LHPs with different chemical compositions like MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which may shed light on the design of highly efficient block copolymer/perovskite hybrid materials and architectures that would overcome current limitations for realistic application exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks for Solar Desalination with Directional Salt Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8722;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;engineered 3D evaporators are constructed by alternately arranging superhydrophilic and superhydrophobic sponges secured with hydrophilic threads. The MPN coatings endow the sponges with photothermal properties and selective wettability, enabling the efficient, long&#8208;term, and sustained desalination of high&#8208;salinity brine for both indoor and outdoor field operations.








Abstract
Solar desalination is one of the most promising strategies to address the global freshwater shortage crisis. However, the residual salt accumulated on the top surface of solar evaporators severely reduces light absorption and steam evaporation efficiency, thus impeding the further industrialization of this technology. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;engineered 3D evaporator composed of photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges and side&#8208;twining hydrophilic threads for efficient desalination with directional salt crystallization and zero liquid discharge is reported. The MPN coatings afford the engineering of alternating photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges with high heating efficiency and defined vapor escape channels, while the side&#8208;twining threads induce site&#8208;selective salt crystallization. The 3D evaporator exhibits a high and stable indoor desalination rate (&#8776;2.3&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) of concentrated seawater (20&#160;wt%) under simulated sun irradiation for over 21 days without the need for salt crystallization inhibitors. This direct desalination is also achieved in outdoor field operations with a production rate of clean water up to &#8776;1.82&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 from concentrated seawater (10&#160;wt%). Together with the high affinity and multiple functions of MPNs, this work is expected to facilitate the rational design of solar desalination devices and boost the research translation of MPN materials in broader applications.

         <title>Role of Bicontinuous Structure in Elastomeric Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

The structure&#8211;property&#8211;electrochemical performance relationship of the elastomeric electrolyte system is established to demonstrate the importance of balancing Li&#8208;ion transport and mechanical properties for achieving high energy Li metal batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are garnering attention as a next&#8208;generation battery technology that can surpass conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries in terms of energy density and operational safety under the condition that the issue of uncontrolled Li dendrite is resolved. In this study, various plastic crystal&#8208;embedded elastomer electrolytes (PCEEs) are investigated with different phase&#8208;separated structures, prepared by systematically adjusting the volume ratio of the phases, to elucidate the structure&#8208;property&#8208;electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE in the LMBs. At an optimal volume ratio of elastomer phase to plastic&#8208;crystal phase (i.e., 1:1), bicontinuous&#8208;structured PCEE, consisting of efficient ion&#8208;conducting, plastic&#8208;crystal pathways with long&#8208;range connectivity within a crosslinked elastomer matrix, exhibits exceptionally high ionic conductivity (&#8776;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1) at 20 &#176;C and excellent mechanical resilience (elongation at break &#8776; 300%). A full cell featuring this optimized PCEE, a 35&#160;&#181;m thick Li anode, and a high loading LiNi0.83Mn0.06Co0.11O2 (NMC&#8208;83) cathode delivers a high energy density of 437&#160;Wh kganode+cathode+electrolyte&#8722;1. The established structure&#8211;property&#8211;electrochemical performance relationship of the PCEE for solid&#8208;state LMBs is expected to inform the development of the elastomeric electrolytes for various electrochemical energy systems.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymer Coordinated Single Co Site Nanofibers for Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Cathodes in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A liquid processable COP&#8208;based material is directly used in fuel cell devices via a pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The nanofibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a hierarchical porous texture and the full dispersion of the atomic Co active sites. Resultingly, both the power density and durability are significantly improved compared with the traditional conventional spraying methods.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;cobalt&#8208;atom electrocatalysts, particularly ones derived from high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis of cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), have emerged as a new frontier in the design of oxygen reduction cathodes in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) due to their enhanced durability and smaller Fenton effects related to the degradation of membranes and ionomers compared with emphasized iron&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, pyrolysis techniques lead to obscure active&#8208;site configurations, undesirably defined porosity and morphology, and fewer exposed active sites. Herein, a highly stable cross&#8208;linked nanofiber electrode is directly prepared by electrospinning using a liquid processability cobalt&#8208;based covalent organic polymer (Co&#8208;COP) obtained via pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The resultant fibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a uniform hierarchical porous texture and a full dispersion of atomic Co active sites on the catalyst surface. Focused ion beam&#8208;field emission scanning electron microscopy and computational fluid dynamics experiments confirm that the relative diffusion coefficient is enhanced by 3.5 times, which can provide an efficient route both for reactants to enter the active sites, and drain away the produced water efficiently. Resultingly, the peak power density of the integrated Co&#8208;COP nanofiber electrode is remarkably enhanced by 1.72 times along with significantly higher durability compared with conventional spraying methods. Notably, this nanofabrication technique also maintains excellent scalability and uniformity.

         <title>Nanoscale TEM Imaging of Hydrogel Network Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct observation of the nanoscale polymer network of hydrogels is essential in understanding its properties. Herein, for the first time, a novel staining and structure fixation method is developed for transmission electron microscopy&#160;observation to visualize the hydrogel network architecture in its unperturbed conformation. The revealed molecular structures provide important insights for the friction, adhesion, and fracture of hydrogels.








Abstract
In this work, the authors succeed in direct visualization of the network structure of synthetic hydrogels with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by developing a novel staining and network fixation method. Such a direct visualization is not carried out because sample preparation and obtaining sufficient contrast are challenging for these soft materials. TEM images reveal robust heterogeneous network architectures at mesh size scale and defects at micro&#8208;scale. TEM images also reveal the presence of abundant dangling chains on the surface of the hydrogel network. The real space structural information provides a comprehensive perspective that links bulk properties with a nanoscale network structure, including fracture, adhesion, sliding friction, and lubrication. The presented method has the potential to advance the field.

TEM images reveal robust heterogeneous network architectures at mesh size scale and defects at micro-scale. TEM images also reveal the presence of abundant dangling chains on the surface of the hydrogel network. The real space structural information provides a comprehensive perspective that links bulk properties with a nanoscale network structure, including fracture, adhesion, sliding friction, and lubrication. The presented method has the potential to advance the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emergent, Non&#8208;Aging, Extendable, and Rechargeable Exchange Bias in 2D Fe3GeTe2 Homostructures Induced by Moderate Pressuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon moderate pressuring, Fe3GeTe2 as a prototypical layered magnet transits into a ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coexisting state, and the homostructure with an atomically smooth interface exhibits unprecedented exchange bias (ExB) without gradual aging before collapsing via avalanching. The very existence of the non&#8208;aging nature further allows achieving, striking and technologically significant extendability and rechargeability of the ExB.








Abstract
As a crucial concept in magnetism and spintronics, exchange bias (ExB) measures the asymmetry in the hysteresis loop of a pinned ferromagnet (FM)/antiferromagnet (AFM) interface. Previous studies are mainly focused on FM/AFM heterostructures composed of conventional bulk materials, whose complex interfaces prohibit precise control and full understanding of the phenomenon. Here, the enabling power of 2D magnets is exploited to demonstrate the emergence, non&#8208;aging, extendability, and rechargeability of ExB in van der Waals Fe3GeTe2 homostructures, upon moderate pressuring. The emergence of the ExB is attributed to a local stress&#8208;induced FM&#8208;to&#8208;AFM transition, as validated using first&#8208;principles calculations, and confirmed in magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect and second harmonic generation measurements. It is also observed that, negligible ExB aging before the training effect suddenly takes place through avalanching, pronounced delay of the avalanche via timed pressure repetition (extendability), ExB recovery in the post&#8208;training sample upon refreshed pressuring (rechargeability), and demonstrate its versatile tunability. These striking findings offer unprecedented insights into the underlying principles of ExB and its training, with immense technological applications in sight.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tunable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Metatransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. The &#8220;metatransistor&#8221; shows an 8&#8208;fold enhancement of the electroluminescence compared to the unpatterned device. The combination of pixelated metasurfaces in the active area and electrically switchable recombination zone enables dynamic tunability of the electroluminescence polarization.








Abstract
Emerging immersive visual communication technologies require light sources with complex functionality for dynamic control of polarization, directivity, wavefront, spectrum, and intensity of light. Currently, this is mostly achieved by free space bulk optic elements, limiting the adoption of these technologies. Flat optics based on artificially structured metasurfaces that operate at the sub&#8208;wavelength scale are a viable solution, however, their integration into electrically driven devices remains challenging. Here, a radically new approach to monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. It is shown that nanogratings directly structured on top of the transistor channel yield an 8&#8208;fold increase of electroluminescence intensity and dynamic tunability of polarization. This new light&#8208;emitting metatransistor device concept opens unlimited opportunities for light management strategies based on metasurface design and integration.

         <title>Merging the Interfaces of Different Shape&#8208;Shifting Polymers Using Hybrid Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid exchange reactions (among ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8211;ester, and oxime&#8211;ester linkages) enable stable seamless bonding of covalently cross&#8208;linked networks made by different chemistry, as well as to produce new materials by cross&#8208;fusion. Distinctive multimaterial 3D shape&#8208;shifting structures are demonstrated since this strategy facilitates flexible design in morphology and integration of diverse properties in a monolithic recyclable and potentially healable system.








Abstract
Sophisticated shape&#8208;shifting structures and integration of advanced functions often call for different&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based polymers (such as epoxy and polyurethane) in a unified system. However, permanent cross&#8208;links pose crucial obstacles to be seamless. Here, merging interfaces via hybrid exchange reactions among different dynamic covalent bonds (including ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8211;ester, and oxime&#8211;ester linkages) is proposed, breaking the long&#8208;lasting restriction that these widely used bonds only undergo self&#8208;exchange reactions. Model compound studies are conducted to verify that hybrid exchange reactions occur. As demonstrations, different liquid crystal elastomers are tenaciously joined into coherent assemblies, with the desired biomimetic structures (e.g., flying fish containing stiff and flexible parts) and rare deformation modes (e.g., flower blooming upon both heating and cooling). Besides connecting polymers, hybrid exchange reactions also facilitate the creation of new materials through cross&#8208;fusion of different polymers. In addition to the polymers used in this work, hybrid exchange reactions can be adapted to other polymers based on similar mechanisms and beyond. Besides shape&#8208;shifting&#8208;related areas (e.g., soft robots, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices), it may also foster innovation in other fields involving general polymers, as well as promote deeper understanding of dynamic covalent chemistry.

         <title>When Chirophotonic Film Meets Wrinkles: Viewing Angle Independent Corrugated Photonic Crystal Paper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D stripe and 2D wavy wrinkled photonic crystal paper are fabricated by shear coating on the wrinkled interpenetrating network rubber substrate to reflect the same color regardless of viewing angle. The wrinkled photonic crystal paper can be applied as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting film and wide&#8208;angle monochromatic light reflector.








Abstract
Light manipulation strategies of nature have fascinated humans for centuries. In particular, structural colors are of considerable interest due to their ability to control the interaction between light and matter. Here, wrinkled photonic crystal papers (PCPs) are fabricated to demonstrate the consistent reflection of colors regardless of viewing angles. The nanoscale molecular self&#8208;assembly of a cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) with a microscale corrugated surface is combined. Fully polymerizable CLC paints are uniaxially coated onto a wrinkled interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) substrate. Photopolymerization of the helicoidal nanostructures results in a flexible and free&#8208;standing PCP. The facile method of fabricating the wrinkled PCPs provides a scalable route for the development of novel chirophotonic materials with precisely controlled helical pitch and curvature dimensions. The reflection notch position of the flat PCP shifts to a lower wavelength when the viewing angle increased, while the selective reflection wavelength of wrinkled PCP is remained consistent regardless of viewing angles. The optical reflection of the 1D stripe&#8208;wrinkled PCP is dependent on the wrinkle direction. PCPs with different corrugated directions can be patterned to reduce the angular&#8208;dependent optical reflection of wrinkles. Furthermore, 2D wavy&#8208;wrinkled PCP is successfully developed that exhibit directionally independent reflection of color.

         <title>Regulation of Polymer Configurations Enables Green Solvent&#8208;Processed Large&#8208;Area Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells With Breakthrough Performance and High Efficiency Stretchability Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regulation of the configurations of the non&#8208;conjugated polymer acceptors enables green solvent&#8208;processed large&#8208;area binary all&#8208;polymer solar cells to achieve record efficiency and robustness. This study not only provides a series of reliable novel conductive materials with excellent performance for flexible wearable solar cells but also elucidates a concept to evaluate the comprehensive performance of organic solar cells.








Abstract
With the great potential of the all&#8208;polymer solar cells for large&#8208;area wearable devices, both large&#8208;area device efficiency and mechanical flexibility are very critical but attract limited attention. In this work, from the perspective of the polymer configurations, two types of terpolymer acceptors PYTX&#8208;A and PYTX&#8208;B (X&#160;= Cl or H) are developed. The configuration difference caused by the replacement of non&#8208;conjugated units results in distinct photovoltaic performance and mechanical flexibility. Benefiting from a good match between the intrinsically slow film&#8208;forming of the active materials and the technically slow film&#8208;forming of the blade&#8208;coating process, the toluene&#8208;processed large&#8208;area (1.21 cm2) binary device achieves a record efficiency of 14.70%. More importantly, a new parameter of efficiency stretchability factor (ESF) is proposed for the first time to comprehensively evaluate the overall device performance. PM6:PYTCl&#8208;A and PM6:PYTCl&#8208;B yield significantly higher ESF than PM6:PY&#8208;IT. Further blending with non&#8208;conjugated polymer donor PM6&#8208;A, the best ESF of 3.12% is achieved for PM6&#8208;A:PYTCl&#8208;A, which is among the highest comprehensive performances.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Infrared Lasers Featuring Sub&#8208;Single&#8208;Exciton Threshold and Very High Gain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heavily doped PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed&#8208;shell colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) lead to short&#8208;wave infrared lasers with sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton pump threshold. These CQDs exhibit strong suppression of Auger recombination thanks to their compositional grading at the core/shell interface. Besides, they offer record high modal gain coefficient as well as long optical gain lifetime.








Abstract
The use of colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) as a gain medium in infrared laser devices has been underpinned by the need for high pumping intensities, very short gain lifetimes, and low gain coefficients. Here, PbS/PbSSe core/alloyed&#8208;shell CQDs are employed as an infrared gain medium that results in highly suppressed Auger recombination with a lifetime of 485&#160;ps, lowering the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold down to 300&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2, and showing a record high net modal gain coefficient of 2180&#160;cm&#8722;1. By doping these engineered core/shell CQDs up to nearly filling the first excited state, a significant reduction of optical gain threshold is demonstrated, measured by transient absorption, to an average&#8208;exciton population&#8208;per&#8208;dot &#12296;Nth&#12297;g of 0.45&#160;due to bleaching of the ground state absorption. This in turn have led to a fivefold reduction in ASE threshold at &#12296;Nth&#12297;ASE&#160;=&#160;0.70&#160;excitons&#8208;per&#8208;dot, associated with a gain lifetime of 280&#160;ps. Finally, these heterostructured QDs are used to achieve near&#8208;infrared lasing at 1670&#160;nm at a pump fluences corresponding to sub&#8208;single&#8208;exciton&#8208;per&#8208;dot threshold (&#12296;Nth&#12297;Las&#160;=&#160;0.87). This work brings infrared CQD lasing thresholds on par to their visible counterparts, and paves the way toward solution&#8208;processed infrared laser diodes.

         <title>Tissue&#8208;Mimetic Supramolecular Polymer Networks for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integration of non&#8208;covalent cross&#8208;links and conducting polymers enables access to an electrically conductive supramolecular polymer network (E&#8208;SPN) exhibiting tissue&#8208;mimetic softness and stretchablity. The resultant material allows for fabrication of intrinsically&#8208;stretchable, stand&#8208;alone bioelectrodes, capable of comfortably and accurately measuring electromyography signals in real time. This research will offer a step toward the design and construction of next&#8208;generation, skin&#8208;like bioelectronics.








Abstract
Addressing the mechanical mismatch between biological tissue and traditional electronic materials remains a major challenge in bioelectronics. While rigidity of such materials limits biocompatibility, supramolecular polymer networks can harmoniously interface with biological tissues as they are soft, wet, and stretchable. Here, an electrically conductive supramolecular polymer network that simultaneously exhibits both electronic and ionic conductivity while maintaining tissue&#8208;mimetic mechanical properties, providing an ideal electronic interface with the human body, is introduced. Rational design of an ultrahigh affinity host&#8211;guest ternary complex led to binding affinities (&gt;1013&#160;M&#8208;2) of over an order of magnitude greater than previous reports. Embedding these complexes as dynamic cross&#8208;links, coupled with in situ synthesis of a conducting polymer, resulted in electrically conductive supramolecular polymer networks with tissue&#8208;mimetic Young's moduli (&lt;5&#160;kPa), high stretchability (&gt;500%), rapid self&#8208;recovery and high water content (&gt;84%). Achieving such properties enabled fabrication of intrinsically&#8208;stretchable stand&#8208;alone bioelectrodes, capable of accurately monitoring electromyography signals, free from any rigid&#160;materials.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Site Cathode with a Record High Sulfur Mass Loading for High&#8208;Performance Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site cathode is developed by wreathing monolayered MoS2 and Mo1 on sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks for high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The constructed atomic level MoS2&#8208;Mo1 with delocalized electron effects facilitates substantial charge transfer and a completely reversible reaction between S and Na, thus alleviating the shuttle effect.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries possess high potential for grid&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the issues arising from the low S mass loading and poor cycling stability caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfides seriously limit their operating capacity and cycling capability. Herein, sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks supporting atomically dispersed 2H&#8208;MoS2 and Mo1 (S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF) with a record high sulfur mass loading of 80.9&#160;wt.% are synthesized as an integrated dual active sites cathode for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. Impressively, the as&#8208;prepared S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF display unprecedented cyclic stability with a high initial capacity of 1017&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and a low&#8208;capacity fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 1000&#160;cycles. Experimental and computational results including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that atomic&#8208;level Mo in this integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site forms a delocalized electron system, which could improve the reactivity of sulfur and reaction reversibility of S and Na, greatly alleviating the shuttle effect. The findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;site cathodes, but also deepen the understanding of their enhancement mechanisms at an atomic level.

A material is showcased that combines light harvesting, photoinduced free&#8208;electron generation, and long&#8208;lived electron storage over several weeks. This phenomenon arises from the geometry&#8208;constraining confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8211;organic framework. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for dark photocatalysis and light&#8208;driven multicycle recharging is demonstrated, highlighting a candidate material toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.








Abstract
Materials enabling solar energy conversion and long&#8208;term storage for readily available electrical and chemical energy are key for off&#8208;grid energy distribution. Herein, the specific confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) unlocks a unique electron accumulating property under visible&#8208;light irradiation. About 15&#160;C gMOF&#8722;1 of electric charges can be concentrated and stored for over four weeks without loss. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for electrochemical reactions and H2 evolution catalysis is shown and light&#8208;driven recharging can be conducted for &gt;10 cycles with &#8776;90% of the initial charging capacity retained. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations link electron trapping to MOF&#8208;induced geometry constraints as well as the coordination environment of the Re&#8208;center, highlighting the key role of MOF confinement on molecular guests. This study serves as the seminal report on 3D porous colloids achieving photoaccumulation of long&#8208;lived electrons, unlocking dark photocatalysis, and a path toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.

         <title>Ultrathin Hydrogel Films toward Breathable Skin&#8208;Integrated Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin hydrogel films are fabricated by a facile cold&#8208;lamination method and demonstrated as the skin&#8211;electronics interface. The hydrogels comply with glyphic lines and subtle minutiae on the skin surface, allowing unimpeded transepidermal water loss and breathing of the skin underneath. Multitype organic thin&#8208;film (opto)electronics can attach to the skin interfaced with the ultrathin hydrogel, realizing seamless integration and long&#8208;term applications.








Abstract
On&#8208;skin electronics that offer revolutionary capabilities in personalized diagnosis, therapeutics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces require seamless integration between the skin and electronics. A common question remains whether an ideal interface can be introduced to directly bridge thin&#8208;film electronics with the soft skin, allowing the skin to breathe freely and the skin&#8208;integrated electronics to function stably. Here, an ever&#8208;thinnest hydrogel is reported that is compliant to the glyphic lines and subtle minutiae on the skin without forming air gaps, produced by a facile cold&#8208;lamination method. The hydrogels exhibit high water&#8208;vapor permeability, allowing nearly unimpeded transepidermal water loss and free breathing of the skin underneath. Hydrogel&#8208;interfaced flexible (opto)electronics without causing skin irritation or accelerated device performance deterioration are demonstrated. The long&#8208;term applicability is recorded for over one week. With combined features of extreme mechanical compliance, high permeability, and biocompatibility, the ultrathin hydrogel interface promotes the general applicability of skin&#8208;integrated electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Microdomain Interlocking Polymer Electrolytes for Advanced All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Battery Chemistries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational concept of high&#8208;entropy microdomain interlocking all&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is designed by introducing newly polymerized multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide. The tailor&#8208;made electrolyte shows advanced mechanical, electrochemical, and thermodynamic performances, stably enabling all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal symmetrical cell cycles over 4000&#160;h.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (ASPEs) with excellent processivity are considered one of the most forward&#8208;looking materials for large&#8208;scale industrialization. However, the contradiction between improving the mechanical strength and accelerating the ionic migration of ASPEs has always been difficult to reconcile. Herein, a rational concept is raised of high&#8208;entropy microdomain interlocking ASPEs (HEMI&#8208;ASPEs), inspired by entropic elasticity well&#8208;known in polymer and biochemical sciences, by introducing newly designed multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide for the first time. The tailor&#8208;made HEMI&#8208;ASPEs possess multifunctional polymer chains, which induce themselves to assemble into micro&#8208; and nanoscale dynamic interlocking networks with high topological structure entropy. HEMI&#8208;ASPEs achieve excellent toughness, considerable ionic conductivity, an appreciable lithium transference number (0.63), and desirable thermal stability (Td&#160;&gt; 400&#160;&#176;C) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The Li|HEMI&#8208;ASPE&#8208;Li|Li symmetrical cell shows a stable Li plating/stripping performance over 4000&#160;h, and a LiFePO4|HEMI&#8208;ASPE&#8208;Li|Li full cell exhibits a high capacity retention (&#8776;96%) after 300 cycles. This work contributes an innovative design concept introducing high&#8208;entropy supramolecular dynamic networks for ASPEs.

         <title>Extremely Suppressed Energetic Disorder in a Chemically Doped Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is discovered that the energetic disorder inevitably arising in chemically doped conjugated polymers (CPs) can be suppressed close to the theoretical limit. Even after the incorporation of significant amount of dopant, the distribution of states for intramolecular sites is maintained as narrow because of the high planarity of the CP backbone chains, resulting in excellent charge&#8208;transport properties.








Abstract
Chemical doping can be used to tune the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers (CPs), extending their applications as conducting materials. Unfortunately, chemically doped CP films containing excess dopants exhibit an increase in energetic disorder upon structural alteration, and Coulomb interactions between charge carriers and dopants also affect such disorder. The increase in energetic disorder leads to a broadening of the density of states, which consequently impedes efficient charge transport in chemically doped CPs. However, the molecular origins that are inherently resistant to such incidental increase of energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs have not been sufficiently explored. Here, it is discovered that energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs can be suppressed to a level close to the theoretical limit. Indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDTBT) doped with triethyloxonium hexachloroantimonate (OA) exhibits disorder&#8208;free charge&#8208;transport characteristics and band&#8208;like transport behavior with astonishing carrier mobility as a result of reinforced 1D intramolecular transport. Molecular structure of IDTBT provides a capability to lower the energetic disorder that generally arises from the inclusion of heterogeneous dopants. The results suggest the possibilities of implementing disorder&#8208;free CPs that exhibit excellent charge transport characteristics in the chemically doped state and satisfy a prerequisite for their availability in the industry.

         <title>Chiral Seeded Growth of Gold Nanorods Into Fourfold Twisted Nanoparticles with Plasmonic Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fourfold twisted Au nanorods can be prepared via chiral seeded growth, using cysteine as a chiral inducer. A high dissymmetry factor is obtained and electromagnetic simulations show chiral plasmon modes with largely asymmetric near&#8208;field enhancement. The mechanism involved in chiral growth is related with cysteine&#8208;induced enantioselective development of chiral facets.








Abstract
A robust and reproducible methodology to prepare stable inorganic nanoparticles with chiral morphology may hold the key to the practical utilization of these materials. An optimized chiral growth method to prepare fourfold twisted gold nanorods is described herein, where the amino acid cysteine is used as a dissymmetry inducer. Four tilted ridges are found to develop on the surface of single&#8208;crystal nanorods upon repeated reduction of HAuCl4, in the presence of cysteine as the chiral inducer and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. From detailed electron microscopy analysis of the crystallographic structures, it is proposed that the dissymmetry results from the development of chiral facets in the form of protrusions (tilted ridges) on the initial nanorods, eventually leading to a twisted shape. The role of cysteine is attributed to assisting enantioselective facet evolution, which is supported by density functional theory simulations of the surface energies, modified upon adsorption of the chiral molecule. The development of R&#8208;type and S&#8208;type chiral structures (small facets, terraces, or kinks) would thus be non&#8208;equal, removing the mirror symmetry of the Au NR and in turn resulting in a markedly chiral morphology with high plasmonic optical activity.

         <title>Impact&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels by Harnessing 2D Hierarchical Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired hydrogels with lobster&#8208;underbelly&#8208;like properties are reported. By engineering the hierarchical structures, synthetic hydrogel materials can be enabled with the lobster&#8208;underbelly&#8208;like combinational properties, including high ballistic resistance, toughness, strength, water content, and superior softness.








Abstract
With the strengthening capacity through harnessing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale structural hierarchy, synthetic hydrogels hold tremendous promise as a low&#8208;cost and abundant material for applications demanding unprecedented mechanical robustness. However, integrating high impact resistance and high water content, yet superior softness, in a single hydrogel material still remains a grand challenge. Here, a simple, yet effective, strategy involving bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting and compression&#8208;annealing is reported, leading to a hierarchically structured hydrogel material. Rational engineering of the distinct 2D&#160;lamellar structures, well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline domains and robust interfacial interaction among the lamellae, synergistically contributes to a record&#8208;high ballistic energy absorption capability (i.e., 2.1 kJ m&#8722;1), without sacrificing their high water content (i.e., 85 wt%) and superior softness. Together with its low&#8208;cost and extraordinary energy dissipation capacity, the hydrogel materials present a durable alternative to conventional hydrogel materials for armor&#8208;like protection&#160;circumstances.

         <title>Ultrastrong, Thermally Stable, and Food&#8208;Safe&#160;Seaweed&#8208;Based Structural Material for Tableware</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A food&#8208;safe sargassum cellulose nanofiber (SCNF) is extracted through an efficient and low energy consuming way. Then, by assembling the SCNF into a dense bulk material, a strong structural material can be prepared. It possesses good machinability, which can be processed into tableware with better overall performance than that of commercial tableware, showing great application potential in the tableware field.








Abstract
Widely used disposable plastic tableware is usually buried or directly discharged into the natural environment after using, which poses potential threats to the natural environment and human health. To solve this problem, nondegradable plastic tableware needs to be replaced by tableware composed of biodegradable structural materials with both food safety and the excellent mechanical and thermal properties. Here, a food&#8208;safe sargassum cellulose nanofiber (SCNF) is extracted from common seaweed in an efficient and low energy consuming way under mild reaction conditions. Then, by assembling the SCNF into a dense bulk material, a strong sargassum cellulose nanofiber structural material (SCNSM) with high strength (283&#160;MPa) and high thermal stability (&gt;160&#160;&#176;C) can be prepared. The SCNSM also possesses good machinability, which can be processed into tableware with different shapes, e.g., knives and forks. The overall performance of the SCNSM&#8208;based tableware is better than commercial plastic, wood&#8208;based, and poly(lactic acid) tableware, which shows great application potential in the tableware field.

         <title>Tolerogenic Nanovaccine for Prevention and Treatment of Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tolerogenic nanovaccine is constructed to deliver a self&#8208;antigen and dexamethasone on an abatacept&#8208;modified polydopamine nanoparticle. In experimental&#8208;autoimmune encephalomyelitis model mice, preimmunization of the nanovaccine completely blocks the development of clinical symptoms. Immunization after the self&#8208;antigen injection ameliorates the symptoms of autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The concept of tolerogenic nanovaccine can be applied to other autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Herein, a tolerogenic nanovaccine is developed and tested on an animal model of multiple sclerosis. The nanovaccine is constructed to deliver the self&#8208;antigen, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide, and dexamethasone on an abatacept&#8208;modified polydopamine core nanoparticle (AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG). AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG can target dendritic cells and undergo endocytosis followed by trafficking to lysosomes. AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG blocks the interaction between CD80/CD86 and CD28 in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and T cells, leading to decreased interferon gamma secretion. The subcutaneous administration of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG to mice yields significant biodistribution to lymph nodes and, in experimental&#8208;autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model mice, increases the integrity of the myelin basic sheath and minimizes the infiltration of immune cells. EAE mice are treated with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before or after injection of the autoantigen, MOG. Preimmunization of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before the injection of MOG completely blocks the development of clinical symptoms. Early treatment with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG at three days after injection of MOG also completely blocks the development of symptoms. Notably, treatment of EAE symptom&#8208;developed mice with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG significantly alleviates the symptoms, indicating that the nanovaccine has therapeutic effects. Although AbaLDPN is used for MOG peptide delivery in the EAE model, the concept of AbaLDPN can be widely applied for the prevention and alleviation of other autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Tailoring Poly(Styrene&#8208;co&#8208;maleic anhydride) Networks for All&#8208;Polymer Dielectrics Exhibiting Ultrahigh Energy Density and Charge&#8211;Discharge Efficiency at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh discharged energy densities at elevated temperatures are achieved in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymer dielectrics by tailoring polymer networks at the molecular level. This work provides new insights into the polymer structures that control electrical conduction at high&#8208;temperatures and high&#8208;fields, which will propel the development of scalable capacitive dielectrics for harsh&#8208;environment applications.








Abstract
Polymer film capacitors have been widely used in electronics and electrical power systems due to their advantages of high power densities, fast charge&#8211;discharge speed, and great stability. However, the exponential increase of electrical conduction with temperature and applied electric field substantially degrades the capacitive performance of dielectric polymers at elevated temperatures. Here, the first example of controlling the energy level of charge traps in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymers by tailoring molecular structures that significantly inhibit high&#8208;field high&#8208;temperature conduction loss, which largely differs from current approaches based on the introduction of inorganic fillers, is reported. The polymer network with optimized crosslinking structures exhibits an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 7.02&#8201;J&#8201;cm&#8722;3 with charge/discharge efficiencies of &gt;90% at 150&#160;&#176;C, far outperforming current dielectric polymers and composites. The charge&#8208;trapping effects in different crosslinked structures, as the origins of the marked improvements in the high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, are comprehensively investigated experimentally and confirmed computationally. Moreover, excellent cyclability and self&#8208;healing features are demonstrated in the polymer film capacitors. This work offers a promising pathway of molecular structure design to scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer dielectrics capable of operating under harsh environments.

         <title>Ultrathin Cellulose Nanofiber Assisted Ambient&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Dried, Ultralight, Mechanically Robust, Multifunctional MXene Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing the renewable, ultrathin, large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cellulose nanofiber (CNF) as a cross&#8208;linker, the large&#8208;area, ultralight yet robust MXene&#8208;based aerogels with multifunctionality are prepared through the simple, energy&#8208;efficient, and scalable ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;dried approach. The synergies of the MXene, CNF, and abundant pores efficiently improve the EMI shielding performance, dye adsorption, photothermal conversion, and absorption of viscous crude oil.








Abstract
Ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;dried (APD) preparation of transition metal carbide/nitrides (MXene) aerogels is highly desirable yet remains highly challenging. Here, ultrathin, high&#8208;strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight&#8208;ratio, renewable cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are efficiently utilized to assist in the APD preparation of ultralight yet robust, highly conductive, large&#8208;area MXene&#8208;based aerogels via a facile, energy&#8208;efficient, eco&#8208;friendly, and scalable freezing&#8208;exchanging&#8208;drying approach. The strong interactions of large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CNF and MXene as well as the biomimetic nacre&#8208;like microstructure induce high mechanical strength and stability to avoid the structure collapse of aerogels in the APD process. Abundant functional groups of CNFs facilitate the chemical crosslinking of MXene&#8208;based aerogels, significantly improving the hydrophobicity, water resistance, and even oxidation stability. The ultrathin, 1D nature of the CNF renders the minimal MXenes&#8217; interlayered gaps and numerous heterogeneous interfaces, yielding the excellent conductivity and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance of aerogels. The synergies of the MXene, CNF, and abundant pores efficiently improve the EMI shielding performance, photothermal conversion, and absorption of viscous crude oil. This work shows great promises of the APD, multifunctional MXene&#8208;based aerogels in electromagnetic protection or compatibility, thermal therapy, and oil&#8208;water separation applications.

         <title>A Hemispherical Image Sensor Array Fabricated with Organic Photomemory Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors develop a photolithographic process to prepare a hemispherical image sensor array using one organic thin film photomemory transistor per pixel. Their organic thin&#8208;film photomemory transistors can achieve linear photoresponse, along with the best responsivity for similar dark currents among all the reported hemispherical image sensor arrays to date.








Abstract
Hemispherical image sensors simplify lens designs, reduce optical aberrations, and improve image resolution for compact wide&#8208;field&#8208;of&#8208;view cameras. To achieve hemispherical image sensors, organic materials are promising candidates due to the following advantages: tunability of optoelectronic/spectral response and low&#8208;temperature low&#8208;cost processes. Here, a photolithographic process is developed to prepare a hemispherical image sensor array using organic thin film photomemory transistors with a density of 308 pixels per square centimeter. This design includes only one photomemory transistor as a single active pixel, in contrast to the conventional pixel architecture, consisting of select/readout/reset transistors and a photodiode. The organic photomemory transistor, comprising light&#8208;sensitive organic semiconductor and charge&#8208;trapping dielectric, is able to achieve a linear photoresponse (light intensity range, from 1 to 50&#160;W m&#8722;2), along with a responsivity as high as 1.6 A W&#8722;1 (wavelength = 465&#160;nm) for a dark current of 0.24 A m&#8722;2 (drain voltage =&#160;&#8722;1.5&#160;V). These observed values represent the best responsivity for similar dark currents among all the reported hemispherical image sensor arrays to date. A transfer method was&#160;further developed that does not damage organic materials for hemispherical organic photomemory transistor arrays. These developed techniques are scalable and are amenable for other high&#8208;resolution 3D organic semiconductor devices.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Skyrmions and Large Topological Hall Effect in Chromium Telluride Engineered by Self&#8208;Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic skyrmions and large topological Hall effect are demonstrated in chromium telluride. The Curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy in Cr1+xTe2 can be controlled by the self&#8208;intercalate concentration x. In Cr1.53Te2, which has a Curie temperature of 295&#160;K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8776;106&#160;n&#937;&#160;cm are observed.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature magnetic skyrmion materials exhibiting robust topological Hall effect (THE) are crucial for novel nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, such skyrmion&#8208;hosting materials are rare in nature. In this study, a self&#8208;intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Cr1+xTe2 with a layered crystal structure that hosts room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and exhibits large THE is reported. By tuning the self&#8208;intercalate concentration, a monotonic control of Curie temperature from 169 to 333&#160;K and a magnetic anisotropy transition from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane to the in&#8208;plane configuration are achieved. Based on the intercalation engineering, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions are successfully created in Cr1.53Te2 with a Curie temperature of 295&#160;K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Remarkably, a skyrmion&#8208;induced topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8776;106&#160;n&#937; cm is observed at 290&#160;K. Moreover, a sign reversal of THE is also found at low temperatures, which can be ascribed to other topological spin textures having an opposite topological charge to that of the skyrmions. Therefore, chromium telluride can be a new paradigm of the skyrmion material family with promising prospects for future device applications.

         <title>Pt Single Atoms on CrN Nanoparticles Deliver Outstanding Activity and CO Tolerance in the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with novel and small&#8208;sized CrN nanoparticles as potential support is successfully prepared by atomic layer deposition method and exhibit superior activity and CO&#8208;tolerance toward hydrogen oxidation reaction, which is of great significance for the full utilization of low&#8208;cost H2 with impurity CO in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane fuel cells is currently hampered by high cost of commercial Pt catalysts and their susceptibility to poisoning by CO impurities in H2 feed. In this context, the development of CO&#8208;tolerant electrocatalysts with high Pt atom utilization efficiency for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is of critical importance. Herein, Pt single atoms are successfully immobilized on chromium nitride nanoparticles by atomic layer deposition method, denoted as Pt SACs/CrN. Electrochemical tests establish Pt SACs/CrN to be a very efficient HOR catalyst, with a mass activity that is 5.7 times higher than commercial PtRu/C. Strikingly, the excellent performance of Pt SACs/CrN is maintained after introducing 1000&#160;ppm of CO in H2 feed. The excellent CO&#8208;tolerance of Pt SACs/CrN is related to weaker CO adsorption on Pt single atoms. This work provides guidelines for the design and construction of active and CO&#8208;tolerant catalysts for HOR.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Crowding Effect Mimicking Cold&#8208;Resistant Plants to Stabilize the Zinc Anode with Wider Service Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular crowding electrolyte is developed for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Betaine in the electrolyte can regulate the solvation sheath of Zn2+ and adsorb on the Zn anode to guide the dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Zn2+. A high concentration of betaine breaks the H&#8208;bond between H2O, which keeps the Zn anode stable in a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 to 60 &#176;C.








Abstract
Growth of dendrites, the low plating/stripping efficiency of Zn anodes, and the high freezing point of aqueous electrolytes hinder the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a zwitterionic osmolyte&#8208;based molecular crowding electrolyte is presented, by adding betaine (Bet, a by&#8208;product from beet plant) to the aqueous electrolyte, to solve the abovementioned problems. Substantive verification tests, density functional theory calculations, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations consistently reveal that side reactions and growth of Zn dendrites are restrained because Bet can break Zn2+ solvation and regulate oriented 2D Zn2+ deposition. The Bet/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables superior reversibility in a Zn&#8211;Cu half&#8208;cell to achieve a high Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.9% for 900 cycles (&#8776;1800 h), and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping in Zn&#8211;Zn cells for 4235 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a high concentration of Bet lowers the freezing point of the electrolyte to &#8722;92 &#176;C via the molecular&#8208;crowding effect, which ensures the stable operation of the aqueous batteries at &#8722;30 &#176;C. This innovative concept of such a molecular crowding electrolyte will inject new vitality into the development of multifunctional aqueous electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;A molecular crowding electrolyte is developed for aqueous Zn-ion batteries. Betaine in the electrolyte can regulate the solvation sheath of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and adsorb on the Zn anode to guide the dendrite-free deposition of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. A high concentration of betaine breaks the H-bond between H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which keeps the Zn anode stable in a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 to 60 &#176;C.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mesoporous PdN Alloy Nanocubes for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous PdN alloy nanocubes are reported as the highly active and selective electrocatalyst for electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate to recyclable ammonia (NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3). The remarkable performance results from combined synergies of mesoporous structure and PdN alloy, which facilitate the adsorption and reactivity of NO3&#8722; and enhance the retention time of electrocatalyzing NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 through an eight&#8208;electron transfer pathway.








Abstract
Developing highly active and selective electrocatalysts for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) is very important for synthesizing recyclable ammonia (NH3) in an economic and environmentally friendly manner. Despite some encouraging progress, their activity and selectivity have been remarkably slower than expected. In this manuscript, mesoporous palladium&#8208;nonmetal (meso&#8208;PdX) nanocubes (NCs) are reported as a new series of highly efficient electrocatalysts for selective nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) electrocatalysis to NH3. The samples feature uniformly alloyed compositions and highly penetrated mesopores with abundant highly active sites and optimized electronic structures. The best meso&#8208;PdN NCs hold an outstanding NITRR activity and selectivity with a remarkable NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 96.1% and a yield rate of 3760&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1, suppressing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, meso&#8208;PdN NCs are electrocatalytically stable, retaining well the activity and selectivity of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis for more than 20 cycles. Detailed mechanism studies ascribe the superior performance to combined compositional and structural synergies of meso&#8208;PdN NCs that not only promote the adsorption (reactivity) of NO3&#8722; and the desorption of NH3 but also increase the retention time of key intermediates for the deeper NITRR electrocatalysis to NH3 through an eight&#8208;electron pathway.

         <title>Bifacial Dye Membranes: Ultrathin and Free&#8208;Standing although not Being Covalently Bound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of template layers for extension of Langmuir&#8208;Blodgett and related techniques to utilize water&#8208;soluble dyes for the synthesis of quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional molecular layers at the water&#8208;air interface is . Bilayers and intercalated layers stable enough to span 25 &#181;m &#215; 25 &#181;m meshes, although not covalently bonded, are demonstrated. Scalable fabrication of these broadly absorbing pi&#8208;conjugated films is realized via a modified roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process.








Abstract
Layers of aligned dyes are key to photo&#8208;driven charge separation in dye sensitized solar cells, but cannot be exploited as rectifying membranes in photocatalysis to separate half&#8208;cells because they are not sufficiently stable. While impressive work on the fabrication of stable noncovalent membranes has been recently demonstrated, these membranes are inherently suffering from non&#8208;uniform orientation of the constituting dyes. To stabilize layers made from uniformly assembled and aligned dyes, they can be covalently cross&#8208;linked via functional groups or via chromophores at the expense of their optical properties. Here stable membranes from established dyes are reported that do not need to be elaborately functionalized nor do their chromophores need to be destroyed. These membranes are free&#8208;standing, although being only non&#8208;covalently linked. To enable uniform dye&#8208;alignment, Langmuir layers made from linear, water&#8208;insoluble dyes are used. That water&#8208;soluble charge transfer dyes adsorb onto and intercalate into the Langmuir layer from the aqueous subphase, thus yielding free&#8208;standing, molecularly thin membranes are demonstrated. The developed bifacial layers consist almost entirely of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units and thus can conduct charges and can be further engineered for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.

Chiral Nanoparticles
In article number 2208299, Bing Ni, Sara Bals, Luis M. Liz&#8208;Marz&#225;n, and co&#8208;workers show how plasmonic optical activity in chiral nanoparticles can be tuned and optimized through the chiral morphological details. Twisted gold nanorods evolve through removal of mirror symmetry during dissymmetric seeded growth. Both experimental and theoretical analysis indicates that the underlying mechanism relates to cysteine&#8208;induced enantioselective development of chiral facets. The resulting 4&#8208;fold twisted structure leads to high dissymmetry factors.

Long live the electron! Solar&#8208;energy conversion and long&#8208;term storage for on&#8208;demand electrical and chemical energy are crucial toward decentralized energy distribution. In article number 2207280, Julien Warnan and co&#8208;workers show how a hybrid material from a metal&#8211;organic framework and molecular rhenium complex enables light&#8208;driven accumulation of long&#8208;lived electrons. Full charge storage over several weeks is achieved as well as on&#8208;demand &#8220;dark photocatalysis&#8221; for decoupled hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Smart Eutectic Gallium&#8211;Indium: From Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article gives a comprehensive overview of the unique properties and wide applications of liquid metal eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn). The working principles for the EGaIn&#8208;based devices are illustrated and the developments of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are summarized. The main challenges for the development of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are analyzed and the potential applications of EGaIn in the new fields are prospected.








Abstract
Eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn), a liquid metal with a melting point close to or below room temperature, has attracted extensive attention in recent years due to its excellent properties such as fluidity, high conductivity, thermal conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healing capability, biocompatibility, and recyclability. These features of EGaIn can be adjusted by changing the experimental condition, and various composite materials with extended properties can be further obtained by mixing EGaIn with other materials. In this review, not only the are unique properties of EGaIn introduced, but also the working principles for the EGaIn&#8208;based devices are illustrated and the developments of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are summarized. The applications of EGaIn in various fields, such as flexible electronics (sensors, antennas, electronic circuits), molecular electronics (molecular memory, opto&#8208;electronic switches, or reconfigurable junctions), energy catalysis (heat management, motors, generators, batteries), biomedical science (drug delivery, tumor therapy, bioimaging and neural interfaces) are reviewed. Finally, a critical discussion of the main challenges for the development of EGaIn&#8208;based techniques are discussed, and the potential applications in new fields are prospected.

These features of EGaIn can be adjusted by changing the experimental condition, and various composite materials with extended properties can be further obtained by mixing EGaIn with other materials. In this review, not only the are unique properties of EGaIn introduced, but also the working principles for the EGaIn-based devices are illustrated and the developments of EGaIn-related techniques are summarized. The applications of EGaIn in various fields, such as flexible electronics (sensors, antennas, electronic circuits), molecular electronics (molecular memory, opto-electronic switches, or reconfigurable junctions), energy catalysis (heat management, motors, generators, batteries), biomedical science (drug delivery, tumor therapy, bioimaging and neural interfaces) are reviewed. Finally, a critical discussion of the main challenges for the development of EGaIn-based techniques are discussed, and the potential applications in new fields are prospected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Progress in Developing a LiOH&#8208;Based Reversible Nonaqueous Lithium&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous lithium&#8211;air batteries is reviewed, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction/evolution reactions during cell operation. Many fundamental questions remain unanswered on the identities of the reaction intermediates, locations of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, and the effect of CO2&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, which all warrant further investigation.








Abstract
The realization of practical nonaqueous lithium&#8211;air batteries (LABs) calls for novel strategies to address their numerous theoretical and technical challenges. LiOH formation/decomposition has recently been proposed as a promising alternative route to cycling LABs via Li2O2. Herein, the progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous LABs is reviewed. Various catalytic systems, either soluble or solid&#8208;state, that can activate a LiOH&#8208;based electrochemistry are compared in detail, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in nonaqueous media.&#160;We&#160;identify the key factors that can switch the cell chemistry between Li2O2&#160;and LiOH and highlight the debate around these routes, as well as rationalize potential causes for these opposing opinions. The identities of the reaction intermediates, activity of redox mediators and additives, location of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, as well as the effect of CO2&#160;on the LiOH electrochemistry, all play a critical role in altering the relative rates of a series of interconnected reactions and all warrant further investigation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 1, January 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research progress and prospects of tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials in biomedical field are analyzed by bibliometrics. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year/country/institute/referenced source/research hotspots are recognized. Next, to provide a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in biomedical fields (including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation). Finally, prospects and challenges are discussed.








Abstract
Tungsten&#8208;based nanomaterials (TNMs) with diverse nanostructures and unique physicochemical properties have been widely applied in the biomedical field. Although various reviews have described the application of TNMs in specific biomedical fields, there are still no comprehensive studies that summarize and analyze research trends of the field as a whole. To identify and further promote the development of biomedical TNMs, a bibliometric analysis method is used to analyze all relevant literature on this topic. First, general bibliometric distributions of the dataset by year, country, institute, referenced source, and research hotspots are recognized. Next, a comprehensive review of the subjectively recognized research hotspots in various biomedical fields, including biological sensing, anticancer treatments, antibacterials, and toxicity evaluation, is provided. Finally, the prospects and challenges of TNMs are discussed to provide a new perspective for further promoting their development in biomedical research.

Abstract
Thermoelectric technology provides a promising solution to sustainable energy utilization and scalable power supply. Recently, Ag2Q&#8208;based (Q&#160;=&#160;S, Se, Te) silver chalcogenides have come forth as potential thermoelectric materials that are endowed with complex crystal structures, high carrier mobility coupled with low lattice thermal conductivity, and even exceptional plasticity. This review presents the latest advances in this material family, from binary compounds to ternary and quaternary alloys, covering the understanding of multi&#8208;scale structures and peculiar properties, the optimization of thermoelectric performance, and the rational design of new materials. The &#8220;composition&#8208;phase structure&#8208;thermoelectric/mechanical properties&#8221; correlation is emphasized. Flexible and hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric prototypes based on Ag2Q materials are also demonstrated. Several key problems and challenges are put forward concerning further understanding and optimization of Ag2Q&#8208;based thermoelectric chalcogenides.

         <title>Heterogeneous Structure Omnidirectional Strain Sensor Arrays with Cognitively&#8208;Learned Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mechanically stretchable strain sensors have gained tremendous attentions in bio&#8208;inspired skin sensation systems and artificially intelligent tactile sensors. However, high&#8208;accuracy detection of both strain intensity and direction with simple device/array structures is still insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose an omnidirectional strain perception platform utilizing a stretchable strain sensor array with triangular&#8208;sensor&#8208;assembly (three sensors tilted by 45 &#176;) coupled with machine learning&#8208;based neural network classification algorithm. The strain sensor, which is constructed with strain&#8208;insensitive electrode regions and strain&#8208;sensitive channel region, can minimize the undesirable electrical intrusion from the electrodes by strain, leading to a heterogeneous surface structure for more reliable strain sensing characteristics. The strain sensor exhibited decent sensitivity with gauge factor of &#8764;8, a moderate sensing range (0 &#8764; 35%), and relatively good reliability (3,000 stretching cycles). More importantly, by employing a multiclass&#8208;multioutput behavior&#8208;learned cognition algorithm, the stretchable sensor array with triangular&#8208;sensor&#8208;assembly exhibited highly accurate recognition of both direction and intensity of an arbitrary strain by interpretating the correlated signals from the three&#8208;unit sensors. The omnidirectional strain perception platform with neural network algorithm exhibited overall strain intensity and direction accuracy around 98&#177;2% over a strain range of 0 &#8764; 30% in various surface stimuli environments.

         <title>Printing on Particles: Combining Two&#8208;Photon Nanolithography and Capillary Assembly to Fabricate Multi&#8208;Material Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Additive manufacturing at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale has seen a recent upsurge to suit an increasing demand for more elaborate structures. However, the integration and precise placement of multiple distinct materials at small scales remain a challenge. To this end, we&#160;combine here capillarity&#8208;assisted particle assembly (CAPA) and two&#8208;photon polymerization direct laser writing (2PP&#8208;DLW) to realize a new class of multi&#8208;material microstructures. We&#160;use 2PP&#8208;DLW both to fabricate 3D templates to guide the CAPA of soft&#8208; and hard colloids, and to link well&#8208;defined arrangements of functional micro&#8208;particle arrays produced by CAPA, a process we&#160;term &#8220;printing on particles&#8221;. The printing process is based on automated particle recognition algorithms and enables the user to connect colloids into one&#8208;, two&#8208;, and three&#8208;dimensional tailored structures, via rigid, soft or responsive polymer links. Once printed and developed, the structures can be easily harvested and re&#8208;dispersed in water. We&#160;report particle clusters and lattices of varying symmetry and composition, and fabricate thermo&#8208;responsive micro&#8208;actuators and magnetically&#8208;driven &#8220;micro&#8208;machines&#8221;, which can efficiently move, capture and release DNA&#8208;coated particles in solution. The flexibility of our&#160;method allows the combination of a wide range of functional materials into complex structures, which we&#160;envisage will boost the realization of new systems and devices for a broad range of fields, including microrobotics, micromanipulation and metamaterials.

The printing process is based on automated particle recognition algorithms and enables the user to connect colloids into one-, two-, and three-dimensional tailored structures, via rigid, soft or responsive polymer links. Once printed and developed, the structures can be easily harvested and re-dispersed in water. We&#160;report particle clusters and lattices of varying symmetry and composition, and fabricate thermo-responsive micro-actuators and magnetically-driven &#8220;micro-machines&#8221;, which can efficiently move, capture and release DNA-coated particles in solution. The flexibility of our&#160;method allows the combination of a wide range of functional materials into complex structures, which we&#160;envisage will boost the realization of new systems and devices for a broad range of fields, including microrobotics, micromanipulation and metamaterials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;promoted co&#8208;production of dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2 over defective Zn3In2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
One of the most sustainable and promising approaches for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in a low&#8208;cost and environment friendly way is photosynthesis, which, however, suffers from poor carrier utilization and low H2O2 productivity. The addition of proton donors such as isopropanol or ethanol can increase H2O2 production, which, unfortunately, will inevitably elevates the entire cost while wastes the oxidizing power of holes (h+). Herein, the tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) is employed as a distinctive proton donor for the thermodynamically feasible and selective semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction to highly valuable dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs), and meanwhile, to couple with and promote H2O2 generation in one photoredox reaction under the photocatalysis by dual&#8208;functional Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst. To our surprise, the suitably defective Zn3In2S6 offers an excellent and near&#8208;stoichiometric co&#8208;production performance of H2O2 and DHIQs at unprecedentedly high rates of 66.4 and 62.1&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under visible light (&#955; &#8805; 400&#160;nm), respectively, which outperforms all the previous reports as far as we can find even though sacrificial agents were employed in those reports. Additionally, photocatalytic redox reaction mechanism demonstrate that H2O2 can be generated through multiple pathways, highlighting the synergistic effect among ROS (&#183;O2&#8722; and 1O2), h+ and proton donor, which has been ignored in previous studies.

         <title>Nanocomposite Engineering of a High&#8208;capacity Partially Ordered Cathode for Li&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Understanding the local cation order in the crystal structure and its correlation with electrochemical performances has advanced the development of high&#8208;energy Mn&#8208;rich cathode materials for Li&#8208;ion batteries, notably Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered cathodes (LMR, e.g., Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2) that are considered as nanocomposite layered materials with C2/m Li2MnO3&#8208;type medium&#8208;range order (MRO). Moreover, the Li&#8208;transport rate in high&#8208;capacity Mn&#8208;based disordered rock&#8208;salt (DRX) cathodes (e.g., Li1.2Mn0.4Ti0.4O2) was found to be influenced by the short&#8208;range order (SRO) of cations, underlining the importance of engineering the local cation order in designing high&#8208;energy materials. Herein, we reveal the nanocomposite, heterogeneous nature (like MRO found in LMR) of ultrahigh&#8208;capacity partially ordered cathodes (e.g., Li1.68Mn1.6O3.7F0.3) made of distinct domains of spinel&#8208;, DRX&#8208; and layered&#8208;like phases, contrary to conventional single&#8208;phase DRX cathodes. This multi&#8208;scale understanding of ordering informs engineering the nanocomposite material via Ti doping, altering the intra&#8208;particle characteristics to increase the content of the rock&#8208;salt phase and heterogeneity within a particle. This strategy markedly improves the reversibility of both Mn&#8208; and O&#8208;redox processes to enhance the cycling stability of the partially ordered DRX cathodes (nearly &#8764;30% improvement of capacity retention). Our work sheds light on the importance of nanocomposite engineering to develop ultrahigh&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost Li&#8208;ion cathode materials.

         <title>Y&#8208;type Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptors with Outer Branched Side Chains and Inner Cyclohexane Side Chains for 19.36% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can increase the open circuit voltage (Voc) and thus the photovoltaic performance of the current top performing polymer solar cells (PSCs). One of the viable routes is demonstrated by the successful Y6 derivative of L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains at the outer side. This will introduce steric hindrance and reduce intermolecular aggregation, thus open up the bandgap and rise the LUMO energy level. To take further advantages of the steric hindrance influence on optoelectronic properties of Y6 derivatives, two Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors of BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F and BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4Cl were designed and synthesized by adopting outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains. An outstanding Voc of 0.937&#160;V was achieved in the D18:BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F binary blend devices along with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.52%. With the addition of BTP&#8208;eC9 to extend the absorption spectral coverage, a remarkable PCE of 19.36% was realized finally in the related ternary blend devices, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;junction PSCs at present. Our results illustrated the great potential of cyclohexane side chains in constructing high performance non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and their PSCs.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Fullerene Bisadducts Enable High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four fullerene bisadduct regioisomers on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Benefiting from the favorable molecular packing, energy level alignment, and interfacial interaction, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based devices yield a champion efficiency of 14.58% with a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are attracting intense research interest due to their excellent optoelectric properties and eco&#8208;friendly features. To further improve the device performance, developing new fullerene derivatives as electron transporter layers (ETLs) is highly demanded. Four well&#8208;defined regioisomers (trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e) of diethylmalonate&#8208;C60 bisadduct (DCBA) are isolated and well characterized. The well&#8208;defined molecular structure enables us to investigate the real structure&#8208;dependent effects on photovoltaic performance. It is found that the chemical structures of the regioisomers not only affect their energy levels, but also lead to significant differences in their molecular packings and interfacial contacts. As a result, the devices with trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e as ETLs yield efficiencies of 11.69%, 14.58%, 12.59%, and 10.55%, respectively, which are higher than that of the as&#8208;prepared DCBA&#8208;based (10.28%) device. Notably, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing TPSCs.

         <title>Highly Stretchable and Biocompatible Wrinkled Nanoclay&#8208;Composite Hydrogel With Enhanced Sensing Capability for Precise Detection of Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bioinspired nanoclay&#8208;composite wrinkled hydrogel sensor is developed with excellent mechanical and biocompatible properties and high and reliable sensing capacity due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the wrinkle micropattern and nanoclay&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating crosslinked network. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this hydrogel sensor can accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs, showing promise for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological heart tissue.








Abstract
It is challenging to balance high biocompability with good mechanical&#8211;electrical sensing performance, especially when triggering inflammatory stress response after in vivo implantation. Herein, a bioinspired wrinkle&#8208;reinforced adaptive nanoclay&#8208;interlocked soft strain&#8208;sensor based on a highly stretchable and elastic ionic&#8208;conductive hydrogel is reported. This novel nanoclay&#8208;composite hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile properties and high sensing capacity with steady and reliable sensing performance due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the nanoclay crosslinked and nano&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating network. The incorporation of amphiphilic ions provides the hydrogel with significant protein resistance, reducing its non&#8208;specific adsorption to proteins upon implantation, improving its biosafety as an implanted device, and maintaining the authenticity of the sensing results. Based on the revealed sensing enhanced mechanism based on hierarchical ordered structures as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, this hydrogel sensor is demonstrated to be able to&#160;accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs and may become a novel strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological changes in heart disease.

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked Hole Conductor Enables Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.9% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine is developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV.








Abstract
Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA and high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, a simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (MCz&#8208;VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The resulting polymer CL&#8208;MCz offers high energy ordering and improved electrical conductivity, as well as appropriate energy&#8208;level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL&#8208;MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non&#8208;PTAA&#8208;based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibit competitive shelf&#8208;life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 h, reflecting high promises of CL&#8208;MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross&#8208;linking approach in preparing low&#8208;cost, stable, and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.

Highly efficient and stable single&#8208;stack hybrid white organic light&#8208;emitting diode (WOLED) devices are developed using two emissive layers, one with amber colored phosphorescent molecular aggregate emission from the Pd (II) complex, Pd(II) 7&#8208;(3&#8208;(pyridine&#8208;2&#8208;yl&#8208;&#954;N)phenoxy&#8208;&#954;C)(benzo&#8208;&#954;C)([c]benzo[4,5]imidazo&#8208;&#954;N)[1,2&#8208;a][1,5]naphthyridine, Pd3O8&#8208;Py5, and the other with blue fluorescence emission. An optimized device structure achieved high color stability under various current densities, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 45.5%, a power efficiency of 97.4 Lm W&#8722;1, and an estimated LT95 (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of 50,744 hours at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Compatible Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells promise power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. The conformal deposition of perovskites on industrially feasible textured silicon solar cells allows for both lowered manufacturing costs and a higher matched photocurrent density, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandems using front&#8208;side flat or mildly textured silicon. However, the inferior crystal quality of perovskite films grown on fully&#8208;textured silicon compromises the photovoltaic performance. Here, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is developed to control the crystallization process of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films, which enables improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, and conformal deposition on industrially textured silicon. This strategy allows the fabrication of 28.6%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells (certified 27.9%, 1 cm2). This approach is compatible with the scalable fabrication of tandems on industrially textured silicon, demonstrating an efficiency of 25.1% for an aperture area of 16 cm2. The anion&#8208;engineered additive significantly improves the operating stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, and the encapsulated tandem solar cells retain over 80% of their initial performance following 2,000 hours of operation under full 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Pd&#8208;PdO Nanodomains on Amorphous Ru Metallene Oxide for High&#8208;Performance Multifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Developing highly efficient multifunctional electrocatalysts is crucial for pursuing sustainable energy future but remains a great challenge. Herein, a facile synthetic strategy is used to confine atomically thin Pd&#8208;PdO nanodomains to amorphous Ru metallene oxide (RuO2). The as&#8208;synthesized electrocatalyst (Pd2RuOx&#8208;0.5h) exhibits excellent catalytic activity toward the pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (&#951;10 = 14 mV in 1 m KOH, &#951;10 = 12 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4 and &#951;10 = 22 mV in 1 m PBS), alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (&#951;10 = 225 mV) and overall water splitting (E10 = 1.49 V) with high mass activity and operational stability. Further reduction endows the material (Pd2RuOx&#8208;2h) with a promising alkaline oxygen reduction activity, evidenced by high halfway potential, four&#8208;electron selectivity, and excellent poison tolerance. The enhanced catalytic activity is attributed to the rational integration of favorable nanostructures, including (1) the atomically thin nanosheet morphology, (2) the coexisting amorphous and defective crystalline phases, and (3) the multi&#8208;component heterostructural features. These structural factors effectively regulate the material's electronic configuration and the adsorption of intermediates at the active sites for favorable reaction energetics.

         <title>Electron Conductive and Transparent Hydrogels for Recording Brain Neural Signals and Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to break the current bottleneck of implantable materials, which demonstrate a suit of desirable performances including matched modulus, good transparency, and high conductivity. The hydrogel electrode is successfully utilized for optogenetic neuromodulation and simultaneously recording the brain's neural signals, establishing the correlation between brain neural signals and corresponding limb behavior.








Abstract
Recording brain neural signals and optogenetic neuromodulations open&#160;frontiers in decoding brain neural information and neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Conventional implantable probes suffer from modulus mismatch with biological tissues and an irreconcilable tradeoff between transparency and electron conductivity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to address these tradeoffs, which generates conductive and transparent hydrogels with polypyrrole&#8208;decorated microgels as cross&#8208;linkers. The optical transparency of the electrodes can be attributed to the special structures that allow light waves to bypass the microgel particles and minimize their interaction. Demonstrated by probing the hippocampus of rat brains, the biomimetic electrode shows a prolonged capacity for simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and recording of brain neural signals. More importantly, an intriguing brain&#8211;machine interaction is realized, which involves signal input to the brain, brain neural signal generation, and controlling limb behaviors. This breakthrough work represents a significant scientific advancement toward decoding brain neural information and developing neurodegenerative disease therapies.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled Nonreciprocal Self&#8208;Oscillators for Fluidic Transportation and Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;sustained motions are widely reported in stimuli&#8208;responsive material systems. Here, a cilia&#8208;like&#160;soft actuator that can perform self&#8208;sustained oscillation under water, with programmable nonreciprocal strokes, is demonstrated. The self&#8208;oscillators can realize microfluidic pumping, translocation of a micro&#8208;object, and coupling between two non&#8208;equilibrium material pieces through fluidic interaction in an autonomous manner.








Abstract
Light&#8208;fueled self&#8208;oscillators based on soft actuating materials have triggered novel designs for small&#8208;scale robotic constructs that self&#8208;sustain their motion at non&#8208;equilibrium states and possess bioinspired autonomy and adaptive functions. However, the motions of most self&#8208;oscillators are reciprocal, which hinders their use in sophisticated biomimetic functions such as fluidic transportation. Here, an optically powered soft material strip that can perform nonreciprocal, cilia&#8208;like,&#160;self&#8208;sustained oscillation under water is reported. The actuator is made of planar&#8208;aligned liquid crystal elastomer responding to visible light. Two laser beams from orthogonal directions allow for piecewise control over the strip deformation, enabling two self&#8208;shadowing effects coupled in one single material to yield nonreciprocal strokes. The nonreciprocity, stroke pattern and handedness are connected to the fluidic pumping efficiency, which can be controlled by the excitation conditions. Autonomous microfluidic pumping in clockwise and anticlockwise directions, translocation of a micro&#8208;object by liquid propulsion, and coupling between two oscillating strips through liquid medium interaction are demonstrated. The results offer new concepts for non&#8208;equilibrium soft actuators that can perform bio&#8208;like functions under water.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic antimony bromide hybrid containing semiconducting organic cation is developed for the first time, with which electrically driven red light emitting diodes (LEDs) are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2 cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) are routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide bandgap organic cations. Here, the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;), is reported. By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation is developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Unusual Spectrally Reproducible and High Q&#8208;Factor Random Lasing in Polycrystalline Tin Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly spectrally reproducible multimode random lasing is observed in thin polycrystalline films of tin iodide perovskite that cannot be explained by a strong mode localization. The observed spectral reproducibility can be due to the strong inhomogeneous broadening of photoluminescence spectra measured in tin&#8208;based perovskites on the basis of a comparison with an analogous Pb&#8208;based counterpart.








Abstract
An unusual spectrally reproducible near&#8208;IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q&#8208;factor as high as &#8776;104 with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn&#8208;based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.

         <title>Triplet Fusion Upconversion for Photocuring 3D Printed Particle&#8208;Reinforced Composite Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High energy photons (&#955;&lt;400&#160;nm) are frequently used to initiate free radical polymerizations to form polymer networks, but are only effective for transparent objects. This phenomenon poses a major challenge to additive manufacturing of particle&#8208;reinforced composite networks since deep light penetration of short&#8208;wavelength photons limits the homogeneous modification of physicochemical and mechanical properties. Herein, we employ the unconventional, yet versatile multiexciton process of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) for curing opaque hydrogel composites created by direct&#8208;ink&#8208;write (DIW) 3D printing. TTA&#8208;UC converts low&#8208;energy red light (&#955;max = 660&#160;nm) for deep penetration into higher&#8208;energy blue light to initiate free radical polymerizations within opaque objects. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, hydrogels containing up to 15 wt% TiO2 filler particles and doped with TTA&#8208;UC chromophores were readily cured with red light, while composites without the chromophores and TiO2 loadings as little as 1&#8211;2 wt% remained uncured. Importantly, this method has wide potential to modify the chemical and mechanical properties of complex DIW 3D printed composite polymer networks.

As proof-of-principle, hydrogels containing up to 15 wt% TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; filler particles and doped with TTA-UC chromophores were readily cured with red light, while composites without the chromophores and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; loadings as little as 1&#8211;2 wt% remained uncured. Importantly, this method has wide potential to modify the chemical and mechanical properties of complex DIW 3D printed composite polymer networks.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Observation of Multi&#8208;Directional Energy Transfer in a Hybrid Plasmonic&#8211;Excitonic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast charge and energy exchange across the interface of a hybrid plasmonic heterostructure are explored with momentum resolved electron spectroscopy and diffraction. The results identify a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal, driven by a non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction. Non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy backflow.








Abstract
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light&#8211;matter interaction, and a non&#8208;plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application&#8208;relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal&#8208;to&#8208;substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on WSe2 with time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge&#8208;carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub&#8208;bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;modelling.

         <title>Initiating Reversible Aqueous Copper&#8211;Tellurium Conversion Reaction with High Volumetric Capacity through Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8211;tellurium conversion reaction with high volumetric capacity of 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3 and long discharge plateau are investigated. The thermodynamic&#8211;kinetic asymmetries of the Cu&#8211;Te multiphase&#8208;conversion and oxidation&#8208;failure mechanisms are systematically revealed. The developed precise electrolyte engineering overcomes inherent oxidative distress and extends the cycling life of the battery by about three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Pursuing conversion&#8208;type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode due to its intrinsic attractive electronic conductivity and high theoretical volumetric capacity yet still to be explored. Herein, the kinetically/thermodynamically co&#8208;dominat copper&#8211;tellurium (Cu&#8211;Te) alloying phase&#8208;conversion process and corresponding oxidation failure mechanism of tellurium are investigated using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and comprehensive ex situ characterization techniques. By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive antioxidant addition) is implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu&#8211;Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8776;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 of which lifespan thousand&#8208;fold longer than Cu&#8211;Te conversion using CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte. This work paves a significant avenue for expanding high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type cathodes toward energetic aqueous multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas&#8208;Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent gas diffusion electrodes are developed via the F&#8208;doped SnO2 coating of SiO2 fused fiber felts. These highly porous and conductive substrates are amenable to the disposition of various semiconductors and are employed herein to demonstrate photoelectrode membrane assemblies for solar&#8208;driven H2 production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance and thus limit the development of gas&#8208;phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein, the simple and scalable preparation of F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) coated SiO2 interconnected fiber felt substrates is reported. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the resulting substrates have porosity of 90%, roughness factor of 15.8, and Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100 nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gives sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and loss of incident light of 41% at illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating), and liquid&#8208;phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates is confirmed. Finally, gas phase H2 production is demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.

         <title>Bioengineering of High Cell Density Tissues with Hierarchical Vascular Networks for Ex Vivo Whole Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is shown to fabricate an in vitro model of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues. The supply of oxygen and nutrition is extremely significant for such tissues. Therefore, a hierarchical vascular network containing capillaries and an artificial channel for perfusion are formed.








Abstract
The development of tissue&#8208;like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and organoids has contributed to progress in regenerative medicine. Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top&#8208;down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

         <title>Optically Excited Lasing in a Cavity&#8208;Based, High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Quantum Dot Electroluminescent Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;function colloidal quantum dot (QD) devices that operate as a high&#8208;current density light emitting diode and an optically excited laser are demonstrated. The device structure has been optimized to reduce optical losses and allow for efficient wave&#8208;guiding within the active QD layer. This demonstration represents an important milestone toward the practical implementation of a colloidal QD laser diode.








Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials can benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunications, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by rapid nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation at high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here&#160;we&#160;resolve some of these challenges and demonstrate optically excited lasing from fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Vertical Electrochemical Transistors for Printed Multi&#8208;Valued Logic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of high&#8208;speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical&#8208;tuning of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox&#8208;based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high&#8208;functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi&#8208;valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual&#8208;channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual&#8208;ion&#8208;penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very&#8208;high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V are demonstrated.

         <title>Fast and Durable Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at the Electron&#8208;Deficient Ruthenium&#8211;Ruthenium Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure is designed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively. The Ru domains are electron deficient and show substantially improved inoxidizability. The results highlight the significance of establishing robust and multifunctional heterointerfaces toward fast alkaline HOR and beyond.








Abstract
The slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics under alkaline conditions remain a critical challenge for the practical application of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are designed with abundant active Ru&#8211;RuO2 interface domains as efficient electrocatalysts for the HOR in alkaline media. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains at Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively, endowing the well&#8208;defined Ru(100)/RuO2(200) interface as the preferential region for fast alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. More importantly, the metallic Ru domains become electron deficient due to the strong interaction with RuO2 domains and show substantially improved inoxidizability, which is vital to maintain durable HOR electrocatalytic activity. The optimal Ru/RuO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits impressive alkaline HOR activity with an exchange current density of 8.86&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and decent durability. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure can be attributed to the robust and multifunctional Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces endowed by the unique metal&#8211;metal oxide domains.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the drawbacks of current nanozyme catalytic therapy, a novel Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom/Cer nanoagent with asymmetric electron distribution is developed, which can improve the efficiency of multienzyme&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions through a substrate&#8208;recyclable manner, thereby disrupting the intracellular redox and energy metabolism homeostasis to achieve efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#63743;N5 SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single&#8208;atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#63743;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#63743;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can also generate O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&#63743;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

         <title>Unraveling the Plasma Protein Corona by Ultrasonic Cavitation Augments Active&#8208;Transporting of Liposome in Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transcytosis&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly and protein&#8208;corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size&#8208;transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.








Abstract
Ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis&#8208;targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer&#8208;targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient&#8208;derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis&#8208;targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Portable Nanowire Array Gas Sensor for Dynamic NO2 Monitoring at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative self&#8208;powered room&#8208;temperature nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensor based on an indium phosphide homojunction nanowire array is presented. The proof&#8208;to&#8208;concept sensor structure, with high sensitivity, stability, and selectivity, is demonstrated. It is integrated to&#160;a USB interface for on&#8208;field vehicle&#8208;exhaust measurement. This work promises a new family of self&#8208;powered sensors made of III&#8211;V compound semiconductor nanostructures, for future mega&#8208;scale Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things systems.








Abstract
The fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven an increasing consumer demand for self&#8208;powered gas sensors for real&#8208;time data collection and autonomous responses in industries such as environmental monitoring, workplace safety, smart cities, and personal healthcare. Despite intensive research and rapid progress in the field, most reported self&#8208;powered devices, specifically NO2 sensors for air pollution monitoring, have limited sensitivity, selectivity, and scalability. Here, a novel photovoltaic self&#8208;powered NO2 sensor is demonstrated based on axial p&#8211;i&#8211;n homojunction InP nanowire (NW) arrays, that overcome these limitations. The optimized innovative InP NW array device is designed by numerical simulation for insights into sensing mechanisms and performance enhancement. Without a power source, this InP NW sensor achieves an 84% sensing response to 1&#160;ppm NO2 and records a limit of detection down to the sub&#8208;ppb level, with little dependence on the incident light intensity, even under &lt;5% of 1 sun illumination. Based on this great environmental fidelity, the sensor is integrated into a commercial microchip interface to evaluate its performance in the context of dynamic environmental monitoring of motor vehicle exhaust. The results show that compound semiconductor nanowires can form promising self&#8208;powered sensing platforms suitable for future mega&#8208;scale IoT systems.

         <title>Tuning the Color of Photonic Glass Pigments by Thermal Annealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal annealing of porous bottlebrush block copolymer microparticles enables their coloration to be tuned from blue through to red, without significant loss of structural fidelity. This process is driven by both a temperature&#8208;induced softening of the polymer matrix and the absence of microphase separation. Applying thermal annealing as a post&#8208;process enables the production of thermochromic patterned hydrogels.








Abstract
Thermal or solvent annealing is commonly employed to enhance phase separation and remove defects in block copolymer (BCP) films, leading to well&#8208;resolved nanostructures. Annealing is of particular importance for photonic BCP materials, where large, well&#8208;ordered lamellar domains are required to generate strong reflections at visible wavelengths. However, such strategies have not been considered for porous BCP systems, such as inverse photonic glasses, where the structure (and thus the optical response) is no longer defined solely by the chemical compatibility of the blocks, but by the size and arrangement of voids within the BCP matrix. In this study, a demonstration of how the concept of &#8220;thermal annealing&#8221; can be applied to bottlebrush block copolymer (BBCP) microparticles with a photonic glass architecture is presented, enabling their coloration to be tuned from blue to red. By comparing biocompatible BBCPs with similar composition, but different thermal behavior, it is shown that this process is driven by both a temperature&#8208;induced softening of the BBCP matrix (i.e., polymer mobility) and the absence of microphase separation (enabling diffusion&#8208;induced swelling of the pores). Last, this concept is applied toward the production of a thermochromic patterned hydrogel, exemplifying the potential of such responsive biocompatible photonic&#8208;glass pigments toward smart labeling or anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small clusters in the early growth steps of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors (denoted as preMOFs) with good processibility. Then, the removal of solvents and modulators will trigger the crosslinking of preMOFs and lead to the formation of continuous MOF films.








Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, it is difficult to grow most MOFs spontaneously or process them into films. Here, a convenient strategy is demonstrated for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells Enabled by Optimized Fibril Network Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation morphology featuring more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance can be attained. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.2% (certified value of 17.7%) with excellent mechanical properties in all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells is demonstrated.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF with a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) is introduced to enable highly efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high&#8208;Mw PBDB&#8208;TF as a third component into the PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all&#8208;polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Induced Micrometer&#8208;Scale Charge&#8208;Carrier Diffusion in Organic Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mobility fullerene liquid crystal is introduced into the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) to provide a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport, reduce energetic disorder and trap density via enhancing crystallization, and then realize micrometer&#8208;scale charge&#8208;carrier diffusion, leading to the impressive power conversion efficiencies of 15.23% for OSCs with the thickness approaching 500 nm.








Abstract
The short charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length (LD) (100&#8211;300&#160;nm) in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) impedes the further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially for thick&#8208;film (&gt;400&#160;nm) devices matching with industrial solution processing. Here a facile method is developed to efficiently increase LD and then improve PCEs of OSCs via introducing a fullerene liquid crystal, F1, into the active layer. F1 combines the inherent high electron mobility of fullerene and strong self&#8208;assembly capacity of liquid crystal, providing a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport&#160;and reducing energetic disorder and trap density in BHJ film via enhancing crystallization. Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility (&gt;10&#8722;2 cm&#8722;2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record LD of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuInxGa(1&#8722;x)Se2 (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer&#8208;scale LD, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.

&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) (100&#8211;300&#160;nm) in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) impedes the further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially for thick-film (&amp;gt;400&#160;nm) devices matching with industrial solution processing. Here a facile method is developed to efficiently increase &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; and then improve PCEs of OSCs via introducing a fullerene liquid crystal, F1, into the active layer. F1 combines the inherent high electron mobility of fullerene and strong self-assembly capacity of liquid crystal, providing a fast channel for charge-carrier transport&#160;and reducing energetic disorder and trap density in BHJ film via enhancing crystallization. Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge-carrier mobility (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and prolonged charge-carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuIn&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;(1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;)&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer-scale &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh Reversibility Enabled by the Closest Packing Crystallography for Sustainable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is reported to construct dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates, which epitaxially match the closest packed facets of metals. The closest packed facets of metal anodes aligned horizontally with substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability. Consequently, the metal anodes display high reversibility and outstanding performance.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing annual electricity generated from sustainable and intermittent energy such as wind and solar power requires cost effective and reliable electrochemical energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent metal anodes such as Zn, Al, and Fe, taking advantage of large&#8208;scale production and affordable cost, have emerged as promising candidates. However, the uncontrollable dendrite&#8208;like metal deposition on regular substrate caused by disordered metal crystallization usually leads to premature failure of batteries and even safety concerns when the dendrite bridges the electrodes. Here it is reported that a series of metal anodes (Zn, Co, Al, Ni, and Fe) with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) can achieve dendrite&#8208;free and epitaxial deposition on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates enabled by the closest packing crystallography. Moreover, the closest packed facets are aligned horizontally with the substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability even at an unprecedented current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full cells under a practical anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio of 2.3 show a cycling life span of over 800 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of &gt;&#160;99.9%. The universal approach of regulating metal electrodeposition in this work is expected to boost the development of emerging sustainable energy storage/conversion devices.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Bandgap Reduction of GaN&#8211;ZnO Solid&#8208;Solution Thin Films Fabricated by Nanolamination of Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition is employed to fabricate (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x homogenous solid&#8208;solution films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 by varying the cycle ratios. The density functional theory calculations using a superlattice model are performed to evaluate and validate the reduction of bandgaps that results in enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to fabricate GaN&#8211;ZnO homogenous solid&#8208;solution thin films because it offers more precise control of the stoichiometry. By varying the ALD cycle ratios of GaN:ZnO from 5:10 to 10:5, the (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 are obtained. The formation of solid solution is explained based on the atomic stacking and preferred orientation of the layers of GaN and ZnO. However, the growth rates of GaN and ZnO during the lamination process are different from those of pure GaN and ZnO films. It is found that GaN grows faster on ZnO, whereas ZnO grows slower on GaN. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using a superlattice model for GaN and ZnO laminated layers fabricated by ALD to understand the difference of density of states (DOS) and evaluate the bandgaps for various atomic configurations in the solid&#8208;solution films. The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid&#8208;solution films.

         <title>3D Cold&#8208;Trap Environment Printing for Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing technology (3DCEP) is proposed in this work to fabricate a MXene/Zn&#8208;P aerogel anode with highly aligned arrangement. Benefitting from unique high lattice matching and physical confinement effects inside the electrode, it can effectively inhibit the Zn dendrite growth and Zn&#8208;P corrosion in electrolytes. Finally, a 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full cell with long cyclic life can be realized.








Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are always regarded as ideal anode candidates for zinc ion batteries owing to their low cost and ease of processing. However, the intrinsic negative properties of Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes such as easy corrosion and uncontrolled dendrite growth have limited their further applications. Herein, a novel 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed to achieve the MXene and Zn&#8208;P (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P) anode with highly ordered arrangement. Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within the&#160;3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode during Zn plating&#8211;stripping. Consequently, the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;9.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3 DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF), the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1600 cycles. This study brings an inspired universal pathway to rapidly fabricate a reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in a cold environment for micro&#8208;zinc storage systems.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A goal in graphene synthesis is to establish routes for preparing graphene materials from liquids instead of conventional solid or gaseous sources. This work reports the production of graphene materials with tunable composition directly from liquid precursor. A fundamentally new graphene 3D&#8208;printing system is further developed for constructing 3D graphene materials with high structural integrity unachievable by traditional printing strategy.








Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation. The liquid precursor allows for easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantage of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene can be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8776;15 wt.%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes is demonstrated via a selective in situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the high structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects show an electrical conductivity of 4380 S&#160;m&#8722;1 and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components.

         <title>Collective Behaviors of Active Matter Learning from Natural Taxes Across Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological and synthetic agents perform collective taxes based on the local taxis between neighbors and global taxis toward various stimuli. Microorganisms and microrobots perform collective taxes in forms of one&#8208;way transformation, reversible generation, high&#8208;order system, and hierarchical system. Synthetic or biohybrid collectives conduct on&#8208;demand functionalities in environmental and biomedical engineering toward clinical trials owing to the efficiency, robustness, and adaptivity.








Abstract
Taxis orientation is common in microorganisms, and it provides feasible strategies to operate active colloids as small&#8208;scale robots. Collective taxes involve numerous units that collectively perform taxis motion, whereby the collective cooperation between individuals enables the group to perform efficiently, adaptively, and robustly. Hence, analyzing and designing collectives is crucial for developing and advancing microswarm toward practical or clinical applications. In this review, natural taxis behaviors are categorized and synthetic microrobotic collectives are discussed as bio&#8208;inspired realizations, aiming at closing the gap between taxis strategies of living creatures and those of functional active microswarms. As collective behaviors emerge within a group, the global taxis to external stimuli guides the group to conduct overall tasks, whereas the local taxis between individuals induces synchronization and global patterns. By encoding the local orientations and programming the global stimuli, various paradigms can be introduced for coordinating and controlling such collective microrobots, from the viewpoints of fundamental science and practical applications. Therefore, by discussing the key points and difficulties associated with collective taxes of different paradigms, this review potentially offers insights into mimicking natural collective behaviors and constructing intelligent microrobotic systems for on&#8208;demand control and preassigned&#160;tasks.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Control of Nonlinear Light Polarization in MoS2 via PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Thin Films and Free&#8208;Standing Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric domain patterning enabled approach is developed to achieve nanoscale reconfigurable modulation of the amplitude and polarization of SHG light in MoS2 interfaced with PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films and membranes. The light polarization exhibits threefold symmetry at polar domains and twofold symmetry at domain walls. This study opens up new opportunities for developing smart nano&#8208;photonics and optical computing systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinear optical responses, while nanoscale control of the amplitude, polar orientation, and phase of the nonlinear light in TMDCs remains challenging. In this work, by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films and free&#8208;standing PZT membranes, the amplitude and polarization of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal are modulated via ferroelectric domain patterning, which demonstrates that PZT membranes can lead to in&#8208;operando programming of nonlinear light polarization. The interfacial coupling of the MoS2 polar axis with either the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar domains of PZT or the in&#8208;plane polarization of domain walls tailors the SHG light polarization into different patterns with distinct symmetries, which are modeled via nonlinear electromagnetic theory. This study provides a new material platform that enables reconfigurable design of light polarization at the nanoscale, paving the path for developing novel optical information processing, smart light modulators, and integrated photonic circuits.

         <title>Multimorphic Materials: Spatially Tailoring Mechanical Properties via Selective Initiation of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two disparate polymer networks are created simultaneously using non&#8208;interacting chemical reactions and light as a stimulus. Upon turning the light on, the polymers want to phase&#8208;separate like oil and water, but the process is hindered as they interlock. Thus, the degree and location of phase separation, and in&#8208;turn mechanical properties, can be precisely controlled by the &#8220;flick of a switch&#8221;.








Abstract
Access to multimaterial polymers with spatially localized properties and robust interfaces is anticipated to enable new capabilities in soft robotics, such as smooth actuation for advanced medical and manufacturing technologies. Here, orthogonal initiation is used to create interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with spatial control over morphology and mechanical properties. Base catalyzes the formation of a stiff and strong polyurethane, while blue LEDs initiate the formation of a soft and elastic polyacrylate. IPN morphology is controlled by when the LED is turned &#8220;on&#8221;, with large phase separation occurring for short time delays (&#8776;1&#8211;2 min) and a mixed morphology for longer time delays (&gt;5&#160;min), which is supported by dynamic mechanical analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Through tailoring morphology, tensile moduli and fracture toughness can be tuned across &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a simple spring model is used to explain the observed mechanical behavior. Photopatterning produces &#8220;multimorphic&#8221; materials, where morphology is spatially localized with fine precision (&lt;100&#160;&#181;m), while maintaining a uniform chemical composition throughout to mitigate interfacial failure. As a final demonstration, the fabrication of hinges represents a possible use case for multimorphic materials in soft robotics.

         <title>Physical Origin of Negative Differential Resistance in V3O5 and Its Application as a Solid&#8208;State Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique properties of V3O5 and its application as a functional oxide layer in volatile memristive switching devices are reported, with a particular focus on the devlopment of oxide&#8208;based relaxation oscillators as artificial neurons in hardware&#8208;based neural networks. 








Abstract
Oxides that exhibit an insulator&#8211;metal transition can be used to fabricate energy&#8208;efficient relaxation oscillators for use in hardware&#8208;based neural networks but there are very few oxides with transition temperatures above room temperature. Here the structural, electrical, and thermal properties of V3O5 thin films and their application as the functional oxide in metal/oxide/metal relaxation oscillators are reported. The V3O5 devices show electroforming&#8208;free volatile threshold switching and negative differential resistance (NDR) with stable (&lt;3% variation) cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle operation. The physical mechanisms underpinning these characteristics are investigated using a combination of electrical measurements, in situ thermal imaging, and device modeling. This shows that conduction is confined to a narrow filamentary path due to self&#8208;confinement of the current distribution and that the NDR response is initiated at temperatures well below the insulator&#8211;metal transition temperature where it is dominated by the temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity of the insulating phase. Finally, the dynamics of individual and coupled V3O5&#8208;based relaxation oscillators is reported, showing that capacitively coupled devices exhibit rich non&#8208;linear dynamics, including frequency and phase synchronization. These results establish V3O5 as a new functional material for volatile threshold switching and advance the development of robust solid&#8208;state neurons for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Next&#8208;Generation Photonics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has attracted great interest motivated by fascinating properties in the fields of quantum optics, electronics, and optoelectronics. The most recent discoveries of structural, optical, and electrical properties of h&#8208;BN and advancements in emerging photonic and electronic applications are reviewed.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), an insulating 2D layered material, has recently attracted tremendous interest motivated by the extraordinary properties it shows across the fields of optoelectronics, quantum optics, and electronics, being exotic material platforms for various applications. At an early stage of h&#8208;BN research, it is&#160;explored as an ideal substrate and insulating layers for other 2D materials due to its atomically flat surface that is free of dangling bonds and charged impurities, and its high thermal conductivity. Recent discoveries of structural and optical properties of h&#8208;BN have expanded potential applications into emerging electronics and photonics fields. h&#8208;BN shows a very efficient deep&#8208;ultraviolet band&#8208;edge emission despite its indirect&#8208;bandgap nature, as well as stable room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;photon emission over a wide wavelength range, showing a great potential for next&#8208;generation photonics. In addition, h&#8208;BN is extensively being adopted as active media for low&#8208;energy electronics, including nonvolatile resistive switching memory, radio&#8208;frequency devices, and low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant materials for next&#8208;generation electronics.

Recent discoveries of structural and optical properties of h-BN have expanded potential applications into emerging electronics and photonics fields. h-BN shows a very efficient deep-ultraviolet band-edge emission despite its indirect-bandgap nature, as well as stable room-temperature single-photon emission over a wide wavelength range, showing a great potential for next-generation photonics. In addition, h-BN is extensively being adopted as active media for low-energy electronics, including nonvolatile resistive switching memory, radio-frequency devices, and low-dielectric-constant materials for next-generation electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Thermomechanically Reprogrammable Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magneto&#8208;thermomechanical tool is constructed and demonstrated, which enables a single material system to transform with untethered, reversible, low&#8208;powered reprogrammable deformations, and shape locking via the application of magneto&#8208;thermomechanically triggered prestress on a shape&#8208;memory polymer and structural instability with asymmetric magnetic torque.








Abstract
Future active metamaterials for reconfigurable structural applications require fast, untethered, reversible, and reprogrammable (multimodal) transformability with shape locking. Magnetic control has a superior advantage for fast and remotely controlled deployment; however, a significant drawback is needed to maintain the magnetic force to hold the transformation, limiting its use in structural applications. The shape&#8208;locking property of shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) can resolve this issue. However, the intrinsic irreversibility of SMPs may limit their reconfigurability as active metamaterials. Moreover, to date, reprogrammable methods have required high power with laser and arc welding proving to be energy&#8208;inefficient control methods. In this work, a magneto&#8208;thermomechanical tool is constructed and demonstrated, which enables a single material system to transform with untethered, reversible, low&#8208;powered reprogrammable deformations, and shape locking via the application of magneto&#8208;thermomechanically triggered prestress on the SMP and structural instability with asymmetric magnetic torque. The mutual assistance of two physics concepts&#8212;magnetic control combined with the thermomechanical behavior of SMPs&#160;is demonstrated, without requiring new materials synthesis and high&#8208;power energy for reprogramming. This approach can open a new path of active metamaterials, flexible yet stiff soft robots, multimodal morphing structures, and mechanical computing devices where it can be designed in reversible and reprogrammable ways.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically introduces the achievements on computational biomaterials in biomedical applications, summarizes the computational simulation in revealing internal physicochemical mechanism behind the biomaterial, and offers an outlook on the computatinal biomaterials in nanoenabled amalgamation of chemistry, material science, biology, computational and medicine based on the reports of computational biomaterials&#8208;involved disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapies and other biomimetic biomaterials.








Abstract
With the flourishing development of material simulation methods (quantum chemistry methods, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, phase field, etc.), extensive adoption of computing technologies (high&#8208;throughput, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.), and the invention of high&#8208;performance computing equipment, computational simulation tools have sparked the fundamental mechanism&#8208;level explorations to predict the diverse physicochemical properties and biological effects of biomaterials and investigate their enormous application potential for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Herein, the term &#8220;computational biomaterials&#8221; is proposed and the computational methods currently used to explore the inherent properties of biomaterials, such as optical, magnetic, electronic, and acoustic properties, and the elucidation of corresponding biological behaviors/effects in the biomedical field are summarized/discussed. The theoretical calculation of the physiochemical properties/biological performance of biomaterials applied in disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapeutics, and specific paradigms such as biomimetic biomaterials is discussed. Additionally, the biosafety evaluation applications of theoretical simulations of biomaterials are presented. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of such computational simulations for biomaterials development are clarified. It is anticipated that these simulations would offer various methodologies for facilitating the development and future clinical translations/utilization of versatile biomaterials.

         <title>Engineering the Electronic Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Iron Sites with Boosted Oxygen Bifunctional Activity for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst on a mesoporous NC material by engineering the electronic structures of the metal sites is reported. This catalyst achieves remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction&#160;and oxygen evolution reaction, and demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the optimized electronic structure of Fe1N4O1 moieties contributes to excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries typically require efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts to support oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). However, sluggish kinetics and mass transportation challenges must be addressed if the performance of these catalysts is to be enhanced. Herein, a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprising atomically dispersed iron atoms supported on a mesoporous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Fe SAs/NC) with accessible metal sites and optimized electronic metal&#8211;support interactions is developed. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the engineered electronic structures of the metal active sites can regulate the charge distribution of Fe centers to optimize the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The Fe SAs/NC containing Fe1N4O1 sites achieves remarkable ORR activity over the entire pH range, with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.93, 0.83, and 0.75&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. In addition, it demonstrates a promising low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline conditions. The zinc&#8211;air battery assembled with Fe SAs/NC exhibits superior performance than that of Pt/C+RuO2 counterpart in terms of peak power density, specific capacity, and cycling stability. These findings demonstrate the importance of the electronic structure engineering of metal sites in directing catalytic activity.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enables Exceptional Cyclability in Pouch&#8208;Type Full Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode, which consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with rich oxygen stable {001} planes. The resultant cathode effectively homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain and greatly inhibits the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen loss during de&#8208;/lilthiation, leading to superior electrochemical performances at various rates and operating temperatures.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in situ co&#8208;precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super&#8208;dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C with much better retention at 55 &#176;C and 5 C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. In a pouch&#8208;type full cell, it exhibits exceptionally long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1 C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5 C after 2000 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater to the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.

         <title>Approaching Bulk Mobility in PbSe Colloidal Quantum Dots 3D Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dot superlattices hold promise to combine tunable optical properties with electrical transport comparable to bulk semiconductors. In this work, it is demonstrated that the self&#8208;assembly of highly ordered 3D superlattices made from PbSe colloidal quantum dots achieves record electron mobilities up to 278 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, the highest for these systems and for any self&#8208;assembled solid of quantum&#8208;confined objects.








Abstract
3D superlattices made of colloidal quantum dots are a promising candidate for the next generation of optoelectronic devices as they are expected to exhibit a unique combination of tunable optical properties and coherent electrical transport through minibands. While most of the previous work was&#160;performed on 2D arrays, the control over the formation of these systems is lacking, where limited long&#8208;range order and energetical disorder have so far hindered the potential of these metamaterials, giving rise to disappointing transport properties. Here, it is reported that nanoscale&#8208;level controlled ordering of colloidal quantum dots in 3D and over large areas allows the achievement of outstanding transport properties. The measured electron mobilities are the highest ever reported for a self&#8208;assembled solid of fully quantum&#8208;confined objects. This ultimately demonstrates that optoelectronic metamaterials with highly tunable optical properties (in this case in the short&#8208;wavelength infrared spectral range) and charge mobilities approaching that of bulk semiconductor can be obtained.

     alt="Approaching Bulk Mobility in PbSe Colloidal Quantum Dots 3D Superlattices"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloidal quantum dot superlattices hold promise to combine tunable optical properties with electrical transport comparable to bulk semiconductors. In this work, it is demonstrated that the self-assembly of highly ordered 3D superlattices made from PbSe colloidal quantum dots achieves record electron mobilities up to 278 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the highest for these systems and for any self-assembled solid of quantum-confined objects.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D superlattices made of colloidal quantum dots are a promising candidate for the next generation of optoelectronic devices as they are expected to exhibit a unique combination of tunable optical properties and coherent electrical transport through minibands. While most of the previous work was&#160;performed on 2D arrays, the control over the formation of these systems is lacking, where limited long-range order and energetical disorder have so far hindered the potential of these metamaterials, giving rise to disappointing transport properties. Here, it is reported that nanoscale-level controlled ordering of colloidal quantum dots in 3D and over large areas allows the achievement of outstanding transport properties. The measured electron mobilities are the highest ever reported for a self-assembled solid of fully quantum-confined objects. This ultimately demonstrates that optoelectronic metamaterials with highly tunable optical properties (in this case in the short-wavelength infrared spectral range) and charge mobilities approaching that of bulk semiconductor can be obtained. This finding paves the way toward a new generation of optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Vanadium Catalyst Boosting Reaction Kinetics of Polysulfides in Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;life room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are realized by the development of a single atom vanadium anchored on 3D nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix (3D&#8208;PNCV) as an ideal host in RT Na&#8211;S chemistry. Such host possesses the advantages of the abundant micro/mesoporous, highly reactive V single atom, which can restrain the polysulfides dissolution and in time catalyze the conversion of polysulfide into solid discharged products.








Abstract
The practical application of the room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries is hindered by the insulated sulfur, the severe shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides, and insufficient polysulfide conversion. Herein, on the basis of first principles calculations, single&#8208;atom vanadium anchored on a 3D&#160;nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix (denoted as 3D&#8208;PNCV) is designed and fabricated to enhance sulfur reactivity, and adsorption and catalytic conversion performance of sodium polysulfide. The 3D&#8208;PNCV host with abundant and active V sites, hierarchical porous structure, high electrical conductivity, and strong chemical adsorption/conversion ability of V&#8211;N bonding can immobilize the polysulfides and promote reversibly catalytic conversion of polysulfides toward Na2S. Therefore, as&#8208;fabricated RT Na&#8211;S batteries can achieve a high reversible capacity (445&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 over 800 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and excellent rate capability (224&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1). The electrocatalysis mechanism of sodium polysulfides is further experimentally and theoretically revealed, which provides a new strategy to develop the highly stable RT Na&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmion Transistor Gated with Voltage&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor is presented using spatially uniform voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic anisotropy. A gate operation can control the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion. Utilizing the gate&#8208;controlled skyrmion motion technique, the authors expect various skyrmion logic devices to be demonstrated in the future.








Abstract
The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally, is introduced. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area can be maintained. The findings will open a new route toward the design and realization of skyrmion&#8208;based spintronic devices in the near future.

         <title>A Continuous Gradient Colloidal Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled extraction emulsion process (CrEEP) allows the synthesis of monodisperse latex particles with a continuous size gradient. Subsequent self&#8208;assembly into a photonic glass results in a thin film with a continuous photonic gradient and structural colors ranging over the full visible spectrum. This concept is shown to improve the broadband reflectance of such a mesostructure compared to a non&#8208;gradient&#160;mixture.








Abstract
Colloidal crystals and glasses manipulate light propagation depending on their chemical composition, particle morphology, and mesoscopic structure. This light&#8211;matter interaction has been intensely investigated, but a knowledge gap remains for mesostructures comprising a continuous property gradient of the constituting particles. Here, a general synthetic approach to bottom&#8208;up fabrication of continuous size gradient colloidal ensembles is introduced. First, the technique synthesizes a dispersion with a specifically designed gradual particle size distribution. Second, self&#8208;assembly of this dispersion yields a photonic colloidal glass with a continuous size gradient from top to bottom. Local and bulk characterization methods are used to highlight the significant potential of this mesostructure, resulting in vivid structural colors along, and in superior light scattering across the gradient. The process describes a general pathway to mesoscopic gradients. It can expectedly be transferred to a variety of other particle&#8208;based systems where continuous gradients will provide novel physical insights and&#160;functionalities.
