         <title>Printable Epsilon&#8208;Type Structure Transistor Arrays with Highly Reliable Physical Unclonable Functions</title>

Abstract
Printed electronics promises to drive the future data&#8208;intensive technologies, with its potential to fabricate novel devices over large&#8208;area with low cost on non&#8208;traditional substrates. In these emerging technologies, there exists a large digital information flow, which requires secure communication and authentication. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) offer a promising built&#8208;in hardware&#8208;security system comparable to biometrical data, which can be constructed by device&#8208;specific intrinsic variations in the additive manufacturing process of active devices. However, printed PUFs typically exploit the inherent variation in layer thickness and roughness of active devices. The current in the devices with enough significant changes to increase the robustness to external environment noise is still a challenge. Here, we demonstrated printable epsilon&#8208;type structure ITO transistor arrays to construct high&#8208;reliability PUFs by modifying the coffee&#8208;ring structure. The epsilon&#8208;type structure improves the printing scalability, film quality, and device reliability. Furthermore, the print&#8208;induced uncertainty along the channel thickness and length can lead to changes in the carrier concentration. Notably, the randomly distributed printing droplets in a small area significantly increase this uncertainty. As a result, the PUFs exhibit near&#8208;ideal uniformity, uniqueness, randomness, and reliability. Additionally, the PUFs are resilient against machine learning&#8208;based attacks with a prediction accuracy of only 55% without post&#8208;processing.

         <title>Deciphering Adverse Detrapped Hole Transfer in Hot&#8208;electron Photoelectric Conversion at Infrared Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hot&#8208;carrier devices are promising alternatives for enabling pathbreaking photoelectric conversion. However, existing hot&#8208;carrier devices suffer from low efficiencies, particularly in the infrared region, and ambiguous physical mechanisms. We discover the competitive interfacial transfer mechanisms of detrapped holes and hot electrons in hot&#8208;carrier devices. Through photocurrent polarity research and optical&#8208;pump THz&#8208;probe (OPTP) spectroscopy, we verify that detrapped hole transfer (DHT) and hot electron transfer (HET) dominate the low&#8208; and high&#8208;density excitation responses, respectively. The photocurrent ratio assigned to DHT and HET increases from 6.6% to over 1133.3% as the illumination intensity decreases. DHT induces severe degeneration of the external quantum efficiency (EQE), especially at low illumination intensities. The EQE of a hot&#8208;electron device can theoretically increase by over 2 orders of magnitude at 10&#160;mW/cm2 through DHT elimination. The OPTP results show that competitive transfer arises from the carrier oscillation type and carrier density&#8208;related Coulomb screening. The screening intensity determines the excitation weight and hot&#8208;electron cooling scenes and thereby the transfer dynamics.

         <title>Tuning of Polar Domain Boundaries in Nonpolar Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Domain boundaries with macroscopic polarity are discovered in a nonpolar PbZrO3&#8208;based single crystal. They can be preferentially created and erased by applying a small stress. The polarity can be enhanced or switched with a small electric field. Atomistic&#8208;structural analysis reveals that the polar domains boundaries are formed by a combination of &#8593;&#8593;&#8595;&#8208;like ferrielectric structures.








Abstract
Domain boundaries in ferroic materials are found to have various physical properties not observed in the surrounding domains. Such differences can be enhanced and bring promising functionalities when centrosymmetric nonpolar materials encounter polar domain boundaries. In this work, a tunable polar domain boundary is discovered in an antiferroelectric single crystal. Under a small stress or electric field, the density, volume, and polarity of the boundaries are successfully controlled.

         <title>Amorphous MoOx with high oxophilicity interfaced with PtMo alloy nanoparticles boosts anti&#8208;CO hydrogen electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Advancing electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation/evolution reaction (HOR/HER) is essential for anion exchange membrane&#8208;based devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline HOR are suffering from low intrinsic activities and severe CO poisoning due to challenge of simultaneously optimizing surface adsorptions towards different adsorbates. Herein, we overcome this challenge by tuning atomic MoOx layer with high oxophilicity onto PtMo nanoparticles with the optimized Had, OHad and COad adsorptions for boosting anti&#8208;CO poisoning hydrogen cycle electrocatalysis in alkaline media. For alkaline HOR, this catalyst exhibits a high kinetic and an exchange current density of 3.19&#160;mA &#956;gPt&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mV versus RHE and 0.83&#160;mA cmPt&#8722;2, 10.3 and 3.8&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. For alkaline HER, it achieves an unprecedented overpotential of 37&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies show that the orchestrated electronic and oxophilic regulation of PtMo/MoOx interface nanoparticles simultaneously optimize Had and OHad adsorption for boosting alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis, whereas reactive oxygen from amorphous MoOx atomic layer lowers the CO oxidation reaction barrier, leading to superior anti&#8208;poisoning ability even at 100&#160;ppm CO.

         <title>Optimizing the Fermi Level of 3D Current Collector with Ni3S2/Ni3P Heterostructure for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable sodium metal batteries (RSMBs) with high energy density and low cost are attracting extensive attention as promising energy storage technologies. However, the poor cyclability and safety issues caused by unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure and dendrite issues limit their practical application. Herein, we theoretically predict that constructing the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure with high work function can lower the Fermi energy level, and therefore effectively suppressing continuous electrolyte decomposition derived from the electron tunneling effect after long&#8208;term sodiation process. Furthermore, we experimentally fabricate the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure on 3D porous nickel foam (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF) as advanced Na anode current collector. The seamless Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructurenot only offers abundant active sites to induce uniform Na+ deposition and enhance ion transport kinetics, but facilitates the formation of stable SEI for dendrite&#8208;free sodium anode, which are confirmed by Cryo&#8208;TEM tests and in situ spectroscopy characterization. As a result, the Na composite anode (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF@Na) delivers stable plating/stripping process of 5000 hours and high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 2500 cycles. More impressively, the assembled sodium ion full cell displays ultralong cycle life of 10000 cycles at 20 C. Our strategy on stabilizing the sodium metal anode gives fundamental insight into the potential construction of advanced RSMBs.

         <title>B&#8208;N Bond Embedded Triplet Terpolymers with Small Singlet&#8208;Triplet Energy Gaps for Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination and Improving Blend Morphology in Organic Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Suppressing the photon energy loss (Eloss), especially the non&#8208;radiative loss, is of importance to further improve the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, typical &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors possess a large singlet&#8722;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), leading to a lower triplet state than charge transfer state and contributing to a non&#8208;radiative loss channel of photocurrent by triplet state. Herein, a series of triplet polymer donors were developed by introducing a BNIDT block into the PM6 polymer backbone. The high electron affinity of BNIDT and the opposite resonance effect of B&#8208;N bond in BNIDT resulted in the lowered highest occupies molecular orbital (HOMO) and the largely reduced &#916;EST. Moreover, the morphology of the active blends was also optimized by fine&#8208;tuning the BNIDT content. Therefore, the non&#8208;radiative recombination via the terminal triplet loss channels and morphology traps was effectively suppressed. The PNB&#8208;3 (with 3% BNIDT):L8&#8208;BO device exhibited both small &#916;EST and optimized morphology, favoring the more efficient charge transfer and transport. Finally, the simultaneously enhanced Voc of 0.907&#160;V, Jsc of 26.59&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and FF of 78.86% contributed to a champion PCE of 19.02%. Therefore, introducing B&#8208;N bond into the benchmark polymers is a possible avenue toward higher&#8208;performance of OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Suppressing the photon energy loss (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Role of Magnetic Defects in Tuning Ground States of Magnetic Topological Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Magnetic defects play an important, but poorly understood, role in magnetic topological insulators (TIs). For example, topological surface transport and bulk magnetic properties are controlled by magnetic defects in Bi2Se3&#8208;based dilute ferromagnetic (FM) TIs and MnBi2Te4 (MBT)&#8208;based antiferromagnetic (AFM) TIs. Despite its nascent ferromagnetism, our&#160;inelastic neutron scattering data show that a fraction of the Mn defects in Sb2Te3 form strong AFM dimer singlets within a quintuple block. The AFM superexchange coupling occurs via Mn&#8208;Te&#8208;Mn linear bonds and is identical to the AFM coupling between antisite defects and the FM Mn layer in MBT, establishing common interactions in the two materials classes. We&#160;also find that the FM correlations in (Sb1 &#8722; xMnx)2Te3 are likely driven by magnetic defects in adjacent quintuple blocks across the van der Waals gap. In addition to providing answers to long&#8208;standing questions about the evolution of FM order in dilute TI, these results also show that the evolution of global magnetic order from AFM to FM in Sb&#8208;substituted MBT is controlled by defect engineering of the intrablock and interblock&#160;coupling.

         <title>25.24%&#8208;Efficiency FACsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Intermolecular Esterification Reaction of DL&#8208;Carnitine Hydrochloride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Judicious tailoring the interface between SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite buried surface plays a pivotal role in obtaining highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a DL&#8208;Carnitine hydrochloride (DL) is incorporated into perovskite/SnO2 interface to suppress defect&#8208;states density. A DL&#8208;dimer is obtained at interface by an intermolecular esterification reaction. For the SnO2 film, the Cl&#8722; in DL&#8208;dimer can passivate oxygen vacancies (Vo) through electrostatic coupling, while N in DL&#8208;dimer can coordinate with the Sn4+ to passivate Sn&#8208;related defects. For the perovskite film, the DL&#8208;dimer can passivate FA+ defects via hydrogen bond and Pb&#8208;related defects more efficiently than DL monomer. Upon the DL&#8208;dimer modification, the interfacial defects are effectively passivated and the quality of the resultant perovskite film is improved. As a result, the DL&#8208;treated device achieves a gratifying open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.20&#160;V and a champion PCE of 25.24%, which is a record value among all the reported FACsPbI3 PSCs. In addition, the unencapsulated devices exhibit a charming stability, sustaining 99.20% and 90.00% of their initial PCEs after aging in air for 1200&#160;h and continuously operating at the maximum power point (MPP) tracking for 500&#160;h, respectively.

         <title>Higher&#8208;order Topological States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unlike conventional topological materials that carry topological states at their boundaries, higher&#8208;order topological materials are able to support topological states at boundaries of boundaries, such as corners and hinges. While band topology has been recently extended into thermal diffusion for thermal metamaterials, its realization is limited to a one&#8208;dimensional (1D) thermal lattice, lacking access to the higher&#8208;order topology. In this work, we report on the experimental realization of a higher&#8208;order thermal topological insulator in a generalized two&#8208;dimensional (2D) diffusion lattice. The topological corner states for thermal diffusion are observed in the bandgap of diffusion rate of the bulk, as a consequence of the anti&#8208;Hermitian nature of the diffusion Hamiltonian. The topological protection of these thermal corner states is demonstrated with the stability of their diffusion profile in the presence of amorphous deformation. Our work constitutes the first realization of higher&#8208;order topology in a purely diffusive systems, and opens the door for future thermal management with topological protection beyond 1D geometries.

         <title>A Thrombin&#8208;Activated Peptide&#8208;Templated Nanozyme for Remedying Ischemic Stroke Via Thrombolytic and Neuroprotective Actions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the most common causes of disability and death. Thrombolysis and neuroprotection are two current major therapeutic strategies to overcome the ischemic and reperfusion damages. Here, we have designed a novel peptide&#8208;templated MnO2 nanozyme (PNzyme/MnO2) that integrates the thrombolytic activity of the functional peptides with the ROS scavenging ability of the nanozyme. Through the self&#8208;assembled polypeptides that contains multiple functional motifs, the novel peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme is able to bind fibrin in the thrombus, cross blood brain barrier, and finally accumulate in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switch&#8208;on&#8221; by the action of thrombin. In mice and rat IS models, the PNzyme/MnO2 prolonged blood circulation time and exhibited strong thrombolytic action, and reduced the ischemic damages in brain tissues. Moreover, this peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme also effectively inhibited the activation of astrocytes and the secretion of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. These data indicated that rationally designed PNzyme/MnO2 nanozyme exerts both thrombolytic and neuroprotective actions. Giving its long half&#8208;life in the blood and ability to target brain thrombi, the biocompatible nanozyme may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to improve the efficacy and prevent secondary thrombosis during the treatment of IS.

Abstract
The large and rapidly growing family of 2D early transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes) raises significant interest in the materials science and chemistry of materials communities. Discovered a little more than a decade ago, MXenes have already demonstrated outstanding potential in various applications ranging from energy storage to biology and medicine. The past two years have witnessed increased experimental and theoretical efforts toward studying MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties when used as lubricant additives, reinforcement phases in composites, or solid lubricant coatings. Although research on the understanding of the friction and wear performance of MXenes under dry and lubricated conditions is still in its early stages, it has experienced rapid growth due to the excellent mechanical properties and chemical reactivities offered by MXenes that make them adaptable to being combined with other materials, thus boosting their tribological performance. In this perspective, the most promising results in the area of MXene tribology are summarized, future important problems to be pursued further are outlined, and methodological recommendations&#160;that could be useful for experts as well as newcomers to MXenes research, in particular, to the emerging area of MXene tribology, are provided.

         <title>Chemical Tuning Meets 2D Molecular Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical tuning including lithiation control and solvent coordination can significantly modify magnetic interaction in molecule&#8208;based magnets for high&#8208;temperature magnetic order and large coercivity. Through those technical routes and processing, 2D molecule&#8208;based magnets with an applicable magnetic performance of ferrites are demonstrated. The considerable energy product evidences its worth for obtaining practical molecule&#8208;based magnets.








Abstract
2D magnets provoke a surge of interest in large anisotropy in reduced dimensions and are promising for next&#8208;generation information technology where dynamic magnetic tuning is essential. Until recently, the crucial metal&#8208;organic magnet Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF with considerable high coercivity and high&#8208;temperature magnetic order opens up a new platform to control magnetism in metal&#8208;organic materials at room temperature. Here, an in&#8211;situ chemical tuning route is reported to realize the controllable transformation of low&#8208;temperature magnetic order into room&#8208;temperature hard magnetism in Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF. The chemical tuning via electrochemical lithiation and solvation/desolvation exhibits continuously variable magnetic features from cryogenic magnetism to the room&#8208;temperature optimum performance of coercivity (Hc) of 8500&#160;Oe and energy product of 0.6 MGOe. Such chemically flexible tunability of room&#8208;temperature magnetism is ascribed to the different degrees of lithiation and solvation that modify the stoichiometry and Cr&#8208;pyrazine coordination framework. Furthermore, the additively manufactured hybrid magnets show air stability and electromagnetic induction, providing potential applications. The findings here suggest chemical tuning as a universal approach to control the anisotropy and magnetism of 2D hybrid magnets at room temperature, promising for data storage, magnetic refrigeration, and spintronics.

         <title>Manipulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Kinetics of Lithium&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes in Halide All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode theoretically enables all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with high energy density owing to its high capacity. However, the low electronic conductivity and highly reactive lattice oxygen impede its application. By introducing conductive additives in electrodes and modifying the surface chemistry of LLO, high&#8208;efficiency electronic networks and stable LLO/electrolyte interfaces can be obtained, thus boosting the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Employing lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) as the cathode of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) is highly desired for realizing high energy density. However, the poor kinetics of LLO, caused by its low electronic conductivity and significant oxygen&#8208;redox&#8208;induced structural degradation, has impeded its application in ASSBs. Here, the charge transfer kinetics of LLO is enhanced by constructing high&#8208;efficiency electron transport networks within solid&#8208;state electrodes, which considerably minimizes electron transfer resistance. In addition, an infusion&#8208;plus&#8208;coating strategy is introduced to stabilize the lattice oxygen of LLO, successfully suppressing the interfacial oxidation of solid electrolyte (Li3InCl6) and structural degradation of LLO. As a result, LLO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit a high discharge capacity of 230.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability over 400 cycles. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the kinetics of LLO in solid&#8208;state electrodes, and affords a practically feasible strategy to obtain high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSBs.

         <title>Direct Visualization of Magnetic Correlations in Frustrated Spinel ZnFe2O4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystal diffuse neutron scattering data on the frustrated magnet ZnFe2O4 are used to calculate the 3D magnetic difference pair distribution function, which provide a model&#8208;free reconstruction of the local magnetic correlations. Analysis of the correlation intensities gives insight into the possible underlying exchange mechanisms and a preferred spin&#8208;cluster model.








Abstract
Magnetic materials with the spinel structure (A2+B3+2O4) form the core of numerous magnetic devices, and ZnFe2O4 constitutes a peculiar example where the nature of the magnetism is still unresolved. Susceptibility measurements revealed a cusp around Tc&#160;= 13 K resembling an antiferromagnetic transition, despite the positive Curie&#8211;Weiss temperature determined to be &#920;CW&#160;= 102.8(1) K. Bifurcation of field&#8208;cooled and zero&#8208;field&#8208;cooled data below Tc in conjunction with a frequency dependence of the peak position and a non&#8208;zero imaginary component below Tc shows it is in fact associated with a spin&#8208;glass transition. Highly structured magnetic diffuse neutron scattering from single crystals develops between 50&#160;K and 25&#160;K revealing the presence of magnetic disorder which is correlated in nature. Here, the 3D&#8208;m&#916;PDF method is used to visualize the local magnetic ordering preferences, and ferromagnetic nearest&#8208;neighbor and antiferromagnetic third nearest&#8208;neighbor correlations are shown to be dominant. Their temperature dependence is extraordinary with some flipping in sign and a strongly varying correlation length. The correlations can be explained by orbital interaction mechanisms for the magnetic pathways and a preferred spin cluster. This study demonstrates the power of the 3D&#8208;m&#916;PDF method in visualizing complex quantum phenomena thereby providing a way to obtain an atomic&#8208;scale understanding of magnetic frustration.

         <title>Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via Improved Sequential Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) via the two&#8208;step sequential deposition show advantages of easy fabrication and decent performance repeatability. Whereas, it is still challenging to implement this technique in the inverted PSCs. Here, an improved sequential two&#8208;step method for inverted PSCs is demonstrated by a binary modulation system and a champion efficiency of 23.4% is realized with remarkable device stability.








Abstract
Inverted&#8208;structure metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attractive advantages like low&#8208;temperature processability and outstanding device stability. The two&#8208;step sequential deposition method shows the benefits of easy fabrication and decent performance repeatability. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to achieve high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs with similar or equal power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) compared to the regular&#8208;structure counterparts via this deposition method. Here, an improved two&#8208;step sequential deposition technique is demonstrated via treating the bottom organic hole&#8208;selective layer with the binary modulation system composed of a polyelectrolyte and an ammonium salt. Such improved sequential deposition method leads to the spontaneous refinement of up and buried interfaces for the perovskite films, contributing to high film quality with significantly reduced defect density and better charge transportation. As a result, the optimized PSCs show a large enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage by 100&#160;mV and a dramatic lift in the PCE from 18.1% to 23.4%, delivering the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances for inverted PSCs. Moreover, good operational and thermal stability is achieved upon the improved inverted PSCs. This innovative strategy helps gain a deeper insight into the perovskite crystal growth and defect modulation in the inverted PSCs based on the two&#8208;step sequential deposition method.

Here, an improved sequential two-step method for inverted PSCs is demonstrated by a binary modulation system and a champion efficiency of 23.4% is realized with remarkable device stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inverted-structure metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attractive advantages like low-temperature processability and outstanding device stability. The two-step sequential deposition method shows the benefits of easy fabrication and decent performance repeatability. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to achieve high-performance inverted PSCs with similar or equal power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) compared to the regular-structure counterparts via this deposition method. Here, an improved two-step sequential deposition technique is demonstrated via treating the bottom organic hole-selective layer with the binary modulation system composed of a polyelectrolyte and an ammonium salt. Such improved sequential deposition method leads to the spontaneous refinement of up and buried interfaces for the perovskite films, contributing to high film quality with significantly reduced defect density and better charge transportation. As a result, the optimized PSCs show a large enhancement in the open-circuit voltage by 100&#160;mV and a dramatic lift in the PCE from 18.1% to 23.4%, delivering the current state-of-the-art performances for inverted PSCs. Moreover, good operational and thermal stability is achieved upon the improved inverted PSCs. This innovative strategy helps gain a deeper insight into the perovskite crystal growth and defect modulation in the inverted PSCs based on the two-step sequential deposition method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A MgFe&#8208;LDH Nanosheet&#8208;Incorporated Smart Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel with Controllable Growth Factor Releasing Capability for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart injectable thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel composed of bone morphogenetic protein 2&#8208;functionalized MgFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide&#160;nanosheets and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB&#8208;loaded chitosan/silk fibroin hydrogel is designed and constructed to achieve the sequential release of dual growth factors and sustained release of bioactive Mg2+/Fe3+ ions for highly efficient bone regeneration.








Abstract
Although growth factor (GF)&#8208;loaded hydrogels have been explored as promising materials in repairing bone defects, it still remains challenging to construct smart hydrogels with excellent gelation/mechanical properties as well as controllable GF releasing capability. Herein, the incorporation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP&#8208;2)&#8208;functionalized MgFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets into chitosan/silk fibroin (CS) hydrogels loaded with platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB (PDGF&#8208;BB) to construct a smart injectable thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel (denoted as CSP&#8208;LB), which can achieve a burst release of PDGF&#8208;BB and a sustained release of BMP&#8208;2, for highly efficient bone regeneration is reported. The incorporation of MgFe&#8208;LDH in CS hydrogel not only shortens the gelation time and decreases sol&#8211;gel transition temperature, but also enhances the mechanical property of the hydrogel. Because of the sequential release of dual&#8208;GFs and sustained release of bioactive Mg2+/Fe3+ ions, the in vitro experiments prove that the CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel exhibits excellent angiogenic and osteogenic properties compared with the CS hydrogel. In vivo experiments further prove that the CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel can significantly enhance bone regeneration with higher bone volume and mineral density than that of the CS hydrogel. This smart thermo&#8208;sensitive CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel possesses excellent gelation capability and angiogenic and osteogenic properties, thus providing a promising minimally invasive solution for bone defect treatment.

         <title>Ultrahigh Strain&#8208;Insensitive Integrated Hybrid Electronics Using Highly Stretchable Bilayer Liquid Metal Based Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive hybrid integrated electronics constructed by a self&#8208;formed amphiphilic bilayer highly stretchable conductor is reported based on liquid metal composite and peeling strategy. The amphiphilic bilayer conductor can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics, anchor well with substrates, and shows ultrahigh conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healability, and interconnect functions. The unique materials hold the potential for strain&#8208;resilient integrated bioelectronics and wearables.








Abstract
Human&#8208;interfaced electronic systems require strain&#8208;resilient circuits. However, present integrated stretchable electronics easily suffer from electrical deterioration and face challenges in forming robust multilayered soft&#8208;rigid hybrid configurations. Here, a bilayer liquid&#8208;solid conductor (b&#8208;LSC) with amphiphilic properties is introduced to reliably interface with both rigid electronics and elastomeric substrates. The top liquid metal can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics at a resistance 30% lower than the traditional tin&#8208;soldered rigid interface. The bottom polar composite comprising liquid metal particles and polymers can not only reliably interface with elastomers but also help the b&#8208;LSC heal after breakage. The b&#8208;LSC can be scalably fabricated by printing and subsequent peeling strategies, showing ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive conductivity (maximum 22&#160;532&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), extreme stretchability (2260%), and negligible resistance change under ultra&#8208;high strain (0.34 times increase under 1000% strain). It can act as stretchable vertical interconnect access for connecting multilayered layouts and can be scalably and universally fabricated on various substrates with a resolution of &#8776;200&#160;&#181;m. It is demonstrated that it can construct stretchable sensor arrays, multi&#8208;layered stretchable displays, highly integrated haptic user&#8208;interactive optoelectric E&#8208;skins, visualized heaters, robot touch sensing systems, and wireless powering for wearable electronics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Electronics for Prognostic Monitoring of Methylated Circulating Tumor DNAs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable device with self&#8208;healing electronics is developed for highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective analysis of methylated ctDNAs from transdermal extracted interstitial fluid (ISF), which is demonstrated as a skin patch device for monitoring the disease indicative biomarker. Especially, the device is featured with a flexible construction and remains electrically functional significant structural defects are induced by bending or distortion from everyday usage.








Abstract
Methylated circulating DNAs (ctDNAs) have recently been reported as a promising biomarker for early cancer diagnostics, but limited tools are currently available for continuous and dynamic profiling of ctDNAs and their methylation levels, especially when such assays need to be conducted in point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) scenarios. Here, a self&#8208;healing bioelectronic patch (iMethy) is developed that combines transdermal interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and field effect transistor&#8208;based (FET&#8208;based) biosensing for dynamic monitoring of methylated ctDNAs as a prognostic approach for cancer risk management. The projection micro&#8208;stereolithography&#8208;based 3D patterning of an Eutectic Gallium&#8208;Indium (EGaIn) circuit with an unprecedented 10&#160;&#181;m resolution enables the construction of self&#8208;healing EGaIn microfluidic circuits that remain conductive under 100% strain and self&#8208;healing under severe destruction. In combination with continuous transdermal ISF sampling of methylated ctDNAs, iMethy can detect ctDNAs as low as 10&#8722;16&#160;m in cellular models and is capable of phenotypic analysis of tumor growth in rodent animals. As the first demonstration of a wearable device for real&#8208;time in vivo analysis of disease&#8208;indicative biomarkers, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study well demonstrated the potential of the iMethy platform for cancer risk management based on dynamic transdermal surveillance of methylated ctDNAs via a painless and self&#8208;administrable procedure.

         <title>Unlock the Potassium Storage Behavior of Single&#8208;Phased Tungsten Selenide Nanorods via Large Cation Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, in/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations are performed to investigate the role of tunnel cations in governing the charge storage performances of electrodes by focusing on K&#8208;ions in layer&#8208;structured WSe2. It clearly reveals that the pre&#8208;intercalated K&#8208;ions inside interlayers of WSe2 increases the electronic conductivity, and improves K&#8208;ion diffusivity, having fast kinetics response during the K&#8208;ion (de)insertion.








Abstract
Metal chalcogenide anodes with a layered structure have been regarded as potential K&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy density for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, their development is impeded by the slow K&#8208;ion transport kinetics and poor structural stability. In this work, the energy&#8208;storage behavior is investigated first and decisively associated them with the capacity&#8208;degradation of the promising layer&#8208;structured WSe2 from an integrated chemical and physical point of view. Then, a single&#8208;phased WSe2 with pre&#8208;intercalated high K content (SP&#8208;KxWSe2) is designed to overcome the capacity&#8208;degradation issue fundamentally. Theoretical calculations clarify the beneficial effect of K&#8208;ions inside the interlayer of WSe2 on boosting its electrochemical performance, including increasing the electronic conductivity, promoting the K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and improving the structural stability. The novel design enables the K&#8208;ions pre&#8208;intercalated WSe2 anode material to exhibit a high reversible specific capacity of 211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 and superior cycling stability (89.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). Especially, the K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor, assembled from the anode of SP&#8208;KxWSe2 and the cathode of porous activated carbon, delivers superior energy&#8208;density up to 175&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, high power&#8208;density as well as exceptional cycling stability.

In this work, the energy-storage behavior is investigated first and decisively associated them with the capacity-degradation of the promising layer-structured WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from an integrated chemical and physical point of view. Then, a single-phased WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with pre-intercalated high K content (SP-K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is designed to overcome the capacity-degradation issue fundamentally. Theoretical calculations clarify the beneficial effect of K-ions inside the interlayer of WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on boosting its electrochemical performance, including increasing the electronic conductivity, promoting the K-ion diffusivity, and improving the structural stability. The novel design enables the K-ions pre-intercalated WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; anode material to exhibit a high reversible specific capacity of 211 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and superior cycling stability (89.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Especially, the K-ion hybrid capacitor, assembled from the anode of SP-K&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the cathode of porous activated carbon, delivers superior energy-density up to 175&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, high power-density as well as exceptional cycling stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zn&#8208;Doped P&#8208;Type InAs Nanocrystal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;synthesis doping of InAs nanocrystals with Zn enables the fabrication of heavy metal free, RoHS compliant nanocrystal&#8208;based field effect transistors, which exhibit either n&#8208; or p&#8208;type characteristics. Advanced structural characterization of the doped nanocrystals highlights the importance of Zn dopant chemistry on the doping efficiency. This study sets the stage for future development of nanocrystals&#8208;based opto&#8208;electronics applications.








Abstract
Doped heavy metal&#8208;free III&#8211;V semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) are of great interest both from the fundamental aspects of doping in highly confined structures, and from the applicative side of utilizing such building blocks in the fabrication of p&#8211;n homojunction devices. InAs nanocrystals (NCs), that are of particular relevance for short&#8208;wave IR detection and emission applications, manifest heavy n&#8208;type character poising a challenge for their transition to p&#8208;type behavior. The p&#8208;type doping of InAs NCs is presented with Zn &#8211; enabling control over the charge carrier type in InAs QDs field effect transistors. The post&#8208;synthesis doping reaction mechanism is studied for Zn precursors with varying reactivity. Successful p&#8208;type doping is achieved by the more reactive precursor, diethylzinc. Substitutional doping by Zn2+ replacing In3+ is established by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis. Furthermore, enhanced near infrared&#160;photoluminescence is observed due to surface passivation by Zn as indicated from elemental mapping utilizing high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy corroborated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy study. The demonstrated ability to control the carrier type, along with the improved emission characteristics, paves the way towards fabrication of optoelectronic devices active in the short&#8208;wave infrared region utilizing heavy&#8208;metal free nanocrystal building blocks.

         <title>Precisely Constructed Metal Sulfides with Localized Single&#8208;Atom Rhodium for Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Activation and Direct Methanol Coupling to Ethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst composed of alternately lined wurtzite and zinc&#8208;blende segments in one dimension and single&#8208;atom Rh selectively located on the wurtzite segment demonstrates record&#8208;breaking performances for the selective conversion of methanol to ethylene glycol via preferential C&#8722;H activation. The regularly lined heterojunctions facilitate the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers, and the single&#8208;atom Rh catalyzes methanol adsorption and activation.








Abstract
Although there are many studies on photocatalytic environmental remediation, hydrogen evolution, and chemical transformations, less success has been achieved for the synthesis of industrially important and largely demanded bulk chemicals using semiconductor photocatalysis, which holds great potential to drive unique chemical reactions that are difficult to implement by the conventional heterogeneous catalysis. The performance of semiconductors used for photochemical synthesis is, however, usually unsatisfactory due to limited efficiencies in light harvesting, charge&#8208;carrier separation, and surface reactions. The precise construction of heterogeneous photocatalysts to facilitate these processes is an attractive but challenging goal. Here, single&#8208;atom rhodium&#8208;doped metal sulfide nanorods composed of alternately stacked wurtzite/zinc&#8208;blende segments are successfully designed and fabricated, which demonstrate record&#8208;breaking efficiencies for visible light&#8208;driven preferential activation of C&#8722;H bond in methanol to form ethylene glycol (EG), a key bulk chemical used for the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer. The wurtzite/zinc&#8208;blende heterojunctions lined regularly in one dimension accelerate the charge&#8208;carrier separation and migration. Single&#8208;atom rhodium selectively deposited onto the wurtzite segment with photogenerated holes accumulated facilitates methanol adsorption and C&#8722;H activation. The present work paves the way to harnessing photocatalysis for bulk chemical synthesis with structure&#8208;defined semiconductors.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Induced Defects Liberate the Latent Reversible Capacity of Lithium Titanate Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic defects in quenched lithium titanate anodes enable reversible extraction of Li ions that are unextractable in pristine state, thus facilitating these native Li ions to participate in electrochemical cycling, which leads to a sustained capacity of 202 mAh g&#8722;1 in the 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;V range with excellent rate capability and cycling stability.








Abstract
Interest in defect engineering for lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) materials is sparked by its ability to tailor electrical conductivity and introduce extra active sites for electrochemical reactions. However, harvesting excessive intrinsic defects in the bulk of the electrodes rather than near their surface remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, a versatile strategy of quenching is demonstrated, which is exercised in lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12, LTO), a renowned anode for LIBs, to achieve off&#8208;stoichiometry in the interior region. In situ synchrotron analysis and atomic&#8208;resolution microscopy reveal the enriched oxygen vacancies and cation redistribution after ice&#8208;water quenching, which can facilitate the native unextractable Li ions to participate in reversible cycling. The fabricated LTO anode delivers a sustained capacity of 202 mAh g&#8722;1 in the 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;V range with excellent rate capability and overcomes the poor cycling stability seen in conventional defective electrodes. The feasibility of tuning the degree of structural defectiveness via quenching agents is also proven, which can open up an intriguing avenue of research to harness the intrinsic defects for improving the energy density of rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Partially Nitrided Ni Nanoclusters Achieve Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO at Ultralow Overpotential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes supported partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters catalyst achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2RR to CO, and reaches CO Faraday efficiency &#8805; 99.0% at overpotential of only 166&#160;mV, much lower than of the isolated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst, with the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9%.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising strategy to lower CO2 emission while producing value&#8208;added chemicals. A great challenge facing CO2RR is how to improve energy efficiency by reducing overpotentials. Herein, partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters (NiNx) immobilized on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) for CO2RR are reported, which achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9% with CO Faraday efficiency &gt;99.0% to date. Interestingly, NiNx/NCNT affords a CO generation rate of 43.0&#160;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at a low potential of &#8722;0.572&#160;V (vs RHE). DFT calculations reveal that the NiNx nanoclusters favor *COOH formation with lower Gibbs free energy than isolated Ni single&#8208;atom, hence lowering CO2RR overpotential. As NiNx/NCNT is applied to a membrane electrode assembly system coupled with oxygen evolution reaction, a cell voltage of only 2.13&#160;V is required to reach 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with total energy efficiency of 62.2%.

         <title>Low&#8208;Voltage Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Transistor Amplifiers for Ultrasensitive Electrophysiological Signal Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is developed to fabricate intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors (ISOTFTs) with low operating voltage below 5 V, 100% strain tolerance, and excellent operational stability. Further, the transistor amplifier shows a high gain of 90 V V&#8722;1 and ultrasensitive detection for human electro&#8208;oculogram signals.








Abstract
Stretchability is a prerequisite for electronic skin devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable thin&#8208;film transistors do not possess sufficiently low operating voltages and good stability, significantly limiting their use in real&#8208;world biomedical applications. Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is proposed to form a hybrid polymer dielectric with 620% tensile strain and large&#8208;area film uniformity (&gt;A4 paper size). Using the hybrid polymer dielectrics, the prepared intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors demonstrate a low operating voltage below 5&#160;V, 100% strain tolerance, and excellent operational stability, as well as a high on&#8208;current/off&#8208;current ratio of 105 and a steep subthreshold slope of 500&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. Based on this device technology, an amplifier with a high gain of 90&#160;V V&#8722;1 among the highest values of reported stretchable transistors is realized. This amplifier is at the first time applied to detect human electrophysical signals with an output signal amplitude of over 0.2&#160;V, which even outperforms other types of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic amplifiers for human electrophysiology monitoring. This stretchable device technology sufficiently meets the safety and portability requirements of wearable biomedical applications, opening a new opportunity to e&#8208;skin with signal control and amplification capabilities.

         <title>Shape Morphing Directed by Spatially Encoded, Dually Responsive Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Micro&#8208;Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape morphing from nonresponsive elastomer films can be preprogrammed by spatially embedding anisotropic shape&#8208;changing micro&#8208;actuators with certain orientations and height distributions, offering a robust pathway to simultaneously control in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane bending. This work will broaden the material palette for shape&#8208;morphing&#8208;based applications such as soft robotics, smart wearables, displays, and sensors.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with intrinsic molecular anisotropy can be programmed to morph shapes under external stimuli. However, it is difficult to program the position and orientation of individual mesogenic units separately and locally, whether in&#8208;plane or out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, since each mesogen is linked to adjacent ones through the covalently bonded polymer chains. Here, dually responsive, spindle&#8208;shaped micro&#8208;actuators are synthesized from LCE composites, which can reorient under a magnetic field and change the shape upon heating. When the discrete micro&#8208;actuators are embedded in a conventional and nonresponsive elastomer with programmed height distribution and in&#8208;plane orientation in local regions, robust and complex shape morphing induced by the cooperative actuations of the locally distributed micro&#8208;actuators, which corroborates with finite element analysis, are shown. The spatial encoding of discrete micro&#8208;actuators in a nonresponsive matrix allows to decouple the actuators and the matrix, broadening the material palette to program local and global responses to stimuli for applications including soft robotics, smart wearables, and sensors.

         <title>Embedded 3D Printing of Multimaterial Polymer Lattices via Graph&#8208;Based Print Path Planning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graph theory&#8208;based algorithm, termed Automated Eulerian Route Optimization (AERO), is developed to automate the embedded 3D printing of periodic and stochastic lattices with hundreds of struts. This integrated method is used to construct multi&#8208;material polymer lattices with tailored mechanical properties.








Abstract
Recent advances in computational design and 3D printing enable the fabrication of polymer lattices with high strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio and tailored mechanics. To date, 3D lattices composed of monolithic materials have primarily been constructed due to limitations associated with most commercial 3D printing platforms. Here, freeform fabrication of multi&#8208;material polymer lattices via embedded three&#8208;dimensional (EMB3D) printing is demonstrated. An algorithm is developed first that generates print paths for each target lattice based on graph theory. The effects of ink rheology on filamentary printing and the effects of the print path on resultant mechanical properties are then investigated. By co&#8208;printing multiple materials with different mechanical properties, a broad range of periodic and stochastic lattices with tailored mechanical responses can be realized opening new avenues for constructing architected matter.

         <title>Elucidating the Origins of High Preferential Crystal Orientation in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation process to form quasi&#8208;2D&#160;perovskites is thermodynamically controlled using the methylammonium chloride additive to achieve films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without degradation. Combining microscopic, macroscopic, and spectrographic observations, the thermodynamics enabling preferential crystal growth are inferred.








Abstract
Incorporating large organic cations to form&#160;2D&#160;and mixed 2D/3D structures significantly increases the stability of perovskite solar cells. However, due to their low electron mobility, aligning the organic sheets to ensure unimpeded charge transport is critical to rival the high performances of pure 3D systems. While additives such as methylammonium chloride (MACl) can enable this preferential orientation, so far, no complete description exists explaining how they influence the nucleation process to grow highly aligned crystals. Here, by investigating the initial stages of the crystallization, as well as partially and fully formed perovskites grown using MACl, the origins underlying this favorable alignment are inferred. This mechanism is studied by employing 3&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells. Upon assisting the crystallization with MACl, films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding moisture levels of 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without significant changes in the crystal structure are achieved. Finally, by combining macroscopic, microscopic, and spectroscopic studies, the nucleation process leading to highly oriented perovskite films is elucidated. Understanding this mechanism will aid in the rational design of future additives to achieve more defect tolerant and stable perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Merging Passivation in Synthesis Enabling the Lowest Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss for PbS Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive lead sulfide colloidal quantum dot (PbS CQD) inks. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc)) of 0.71&#160;V and efficiency of 13.3%, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells.








Abstract
The high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss arising from insufficient surface passivation is the main factor that limits the efficiency of current lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots (PbS CQDs) solar cell. Here, synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive PbS CQD inks by introducing multifunctional ligands to well coordinate the complicated CQDs surface with the thermodynamically optimal configuration.

&lt;p&gt;Synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive lead sulfide colloidal quantum dot (PbS CQD) inks. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading a high open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc)&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.71&#160;V and efficiency of 13.3%, which results in the lowest &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) loss arising from insufficient surface passivation is the main factor that limits the efficiency of current lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots (PbS CQDs) solar cell. Here, synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive PbS CQD inks by introducing multifunctional ligands to well coordinate the complicated CQDs surface with the thermodynamically optimal configuration. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading to an order lower surface trap density and beneficial doping behavior compared to the control sample. The obtained CQD inks show the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24% for all photovoltaic PbS CQD inks, which is more than twice the reported average PLQY value of &#8776;10%. As a result, a high &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.71&#160;V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3% is achieved, which results in the lowest &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells with PCE &amp;gt;10%, comparable to that of perovskite solar cells. This work provides valuable insights into the future CQDs passivation strategies and also demonstrates the great potential for the direct-synthesis protocol of PbS CQDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Gate Programmable van der Waals Metal&#8208;Ferroelectric&#8208;Semiconductor Vertical Heterojunction Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prototypical gate&#8208;programmable memory that seamlessly integrates the functionality of both ferroelectric memristor and metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS&#8208;FET), in a vertical fashion is demonstrated. Its memristive characteristics can be quenched (enabled), by setting the Fermi level of MoS2 inside (outside) of its band gap via a top gate, yielding a gate programmable non&#8208;volatile memory for multi&#8208;bit data storage and more.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity, one of the keys to realize non&#8208;volatile memories owing to the remanent electric polarization, is an emerging phenomenon in the 2D limit. Yet the demonstrations of van der Waals (vdW) memories using 2D ferroelectric materials as an ingredient are very limited. Especially, gate&#8208;tunable ferroelectric vdW memristive device, which holds promises in future multi&#8208;bit data storage applications, remains challenging. Here, a gate&#8208;programmable multi&#8208;state memory is shown by vertically assembling graphite, CuInP2S6, and MoS2 layers into a metal(M)&#8208;ferroelectric(FE)&#8208;semiconductor(S) architecture. The resulted devices seamlessly integrate the functionality of both FE&#8208;memristor (with ON&#8211;OFF ratios exceeding 105 and long&#8208;term retention) and metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS&#8208;FET). Thus, it yields a prototype of gate tunable giant electroresistance with multi&#8208;levelled ON&#8208;states in the FE&#8208;memristor in the vertical vdW assembly. First&#8208;principles calculations further reveal that such behaviors originate from the specific band alignment between the FE&#8208;S interface. Our&#160;findings pave the way for the engineering of ferroelectricity&#8208;mediated memories in future implementations of 2D&#160;nanoelectronics.

         <title>Conversion of Classical Light Emission from a Nanoparticle&#8208;Strained WSe2 Monolayer into Quantum Light Emission via Electron Beam Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectrally overlapping mid&#8208;gap emitters from deterministically positioned, nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers are converted into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched emitters using electron beam irradiation. The localized emission before and after irradiation are compared as a function of strain magnitude to assign the spectral transformation to the suppression of weakly coupled mid&#8208;gap state&#8208;strain pairs through strongly coupled mid&#8208;gap state&#8208;strain pairs introduced through electron beam irradiation.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state single photon emitters (SPEs) within atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted interest as scalable quantum light sources for quantum photonic technologies. Among TMDs, WSe2 monolayers (MLs) are promising for the deterministic fabrication and engineering of SPEs using local strain fields. The ability to reliably produce isolatable SPEs in WSe2 is currently impeded by the presence of numerous spectrally overlapping states that occur at strained locations. Here nanoparticle (NP) arrays with precisely defined positions and sizes are employed to deterministically create strain fields in WSe2 MLs, thus enabling the systematic investigation and control of SPE formation. Using this platform, electron beam irradiation at NP&#8208;strained locations transforms spectrally overlapped sub&#8208;bandgap emission states into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched quantum emitters. The dependence of the emission spectra of WSe2 MLs as a function of strain magnitude and exposure time to electron beam irradiation is quantified and provides insight into the mechanism for SPE production. Excitons selectively funnel through strongly coupled sub&#8208;bandgap states introduced by electron beam irradiation, which suppresses spectrally overlapping emission pathways and leads to measurable anti&#8208;bunched behavior. The findings provide a strategy to generate isolatable SPEs in 2D materials with a well&#8208;defined energy range.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Agglomeration of Single&#8208;Atom Platinum in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single atoms (SAs) supported on TiO2 surfaces form clusters and undergo reduction (by photogenerated electrons) to a metallic state over the course of a photocatalytic reaction. Although this process affects &gt;90% of the loaded Pt SAs, Pt SA&#8208;TiO2 photocatalysts show stable H2 production. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations suggest Pt SA interaction with H adatom as a destabilizing factor.








Abstract
With recent advances in the field of single&#8208;atoms (SAs) used in photocatalysis, an unprecedented performance of atomically dispersed co&#8208;catalysts has been achieved. However, the stability and agglomeration of SA co&#8208;catalysts on the semiconductor surface may represent a critical issue in potential applications. Here, the photoinduced destabilization of Pt SAs on the benchmark photocatalyst, TiO2, is described. In aqueous solutions within illumination timescales ranging from few minutes to several hours, light&#8208;induced agglomeration of Pt SAs to ensembles (dimers, multimers) and finally nanoparticles takes place. The kinetics critically depends on the presence of sacrificial hole scavengers and the used light intensity. Density&#8208;functional theory&#160;calculations attribute the light induced destabilization of the SA Pt species to binding of surface&#8208;coordinated Pt with solution&#8208;hydrogen (adsorbed H atoms), which consequently weakens the Pt SA bonding to the TiO2 surface. Despite the gradual aggregation of Pt SAs into surface clusters and their overall reduction to metallic state, which involves &gt;90% of Pt SAs, the overall photocatalytic H2 evolution remains virtually unaffected.

         <title>Targeting Theranostics of Atherosclerosis by Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform via Photoacoustic Imaging and Three&#8208;In&#8208;One Integrated Lipid Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic nanoplatform PLCDP@PMH is constructed with atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsiveness, which indicates a plaque&#8208;specific photoacoustic diagnosis and a three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic strategy of integrated lipid management via reducing lipid uptake, enhancing lipid efflux, and actuating lipid removal. PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the diagnosis of early&#8208;stage plaques, the inhibition of atherosclerosis progression, and the reversal of formed lesions.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis, as a life&#8208;threatening cardiovascular disease with chronic inflammation and abnormal lipid enrichment, is often difficult to treat timely due to the lack of obvious symptoms. In this work, a theranostic nanoplatform is constructed for the noninvasive in vivo diagnosis, plaque&#8208;formation inhibition, and the lesion reversal of atherosclerosis. A three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic complex is constructed and packaged along with a polymeric photoacoustic probe into nanoparticles named as PLCDP@PMH, which indicates an atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsive degradation. The photoacoustic probe suggests a lesion&#8208;specific imaging on atherosclerotic mice with an accurate and distinct recognition of plaques. At the same time, the three&#8208;in&#8208;one complex performs an integrated lipid management through the inhibition of macrophages M1&#8208;polarization, liver X receptor (LXR)&#8208;mediated up&#8208;regulation of ATP&#8208;binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1) and the cyclodextrin&#8208;assisted lipid dissolution, which lead to the reduced lipid uptake, enhanced lipid efflux, and actuated lipid removal. The in vivo evaluations reveal that PLCDP@PMH can suppress the lesion progression and further reverse the formed plaques under a diet without high fat. Hence, PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the theranostics of early&#8208;stage atherosclerosis and delivers an impressive potential on the reversal of formed atherosclerotic lesions.

&lt;p&gt;A theranostic nanoplatform PLCDP@PMH is constructed with atherosclerosis-targeting accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual-responsiveness, which indicates a plaque-specific photoacoustic diagnosis and a three-in-one therapeutic strategy of integrated lipid management via reducing lipid uptake, enhancing lipid efflux, and actuating lipid removal. PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the diagnosis of early-stage plaques, the inhibition of atherosclerosis progression, and the reversal of formed lesions.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atherosclerosis, as a life-threatening cardiovascular disease with chronic inflammation and abnormal lipid enrichment, is often difficult to treat timely due to the lack of obvious symptoms. In this work, a theranostic nanoplatform is constructed for the noninvasive in vivo diagnosis, plaque-formation inhibition, and the lesion reversal of atherosclerosis. A three-in-one therapeutic complex is constructed and packaged along with a polymeric photoacoustic probe into nanoparticles named as PLCDP@PMH, which indicates an atherosclerosis-targeting accumulation and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual-responsive degradation. The photoacoustic probe suggests a lesion-specific imaging on atherosclerotic mice with an accurate and distinct recognition of plaques. At the same time, the three-in-one complex performs an integrated lipid management through the inhibition of macrophages M1-polarization, liver X receptor (LXR)-mediated up-regulation of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1) and the cyclodextrin-assisted lipid dissolution, which lead to the reduced lipid uptake, enhanced lipid efflux, and actuated lipid removal. The in vivo evaluations reveal that PLCDP@PMH can suppress the lesion progression and further reverse the formed plaques under a diet without high fat. Hence, PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the theranostics of early-stage atherosclerosis and delivers an impressive potential on the reversal of formed atherosclerotic lesions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating the Site Density of Mo Single Atoms to Catch Adventitious O Atoms for Efficient H2O2 Oxidation with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo single atoms (SAs) on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) catch the adventitious O atoms in air, forming the O coordination around SAs. The site density of O&#8208;Covered Mo&#8208;SAs can be modulated by the dopants of carbon source with different structures and amounts. Such O coordination of Mo&#8208;SAs endows RPCN surface with the enrich electrons under irradiation, promoting the advanced oxidation process with photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition.








Abstract
Coordination environment and site density have great impacts on the catalytic performance for single atoms (SAs). Herein, the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) is modulated via a local carbonization strategy to controllably catch adventitious O atoms from open environment. The addition of melamine derivants with hydrocarbyl chains induces local carbonization during RPCN pyrolysis. These local carbonization regions bring abundant graphitic N3C to anchor Mo&#8208;SAs, and most of Mo&#8208;SAs catch the O atoms in air, forming the O2&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;N3 coordination. The dopants of carbon source with different structures and amounts can modulate the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs, therefore controlling the amounts of coordinated O atoms. Furthermore, coordinated O atoms around Mo&#8208;SAs construct the catalytic environment with Lewis base and gather photo&#8208;generated electrons under light. Such O&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;SAs endow RPCN materials (Mo&#8208;RPCN) with a strong ability for hydrogen abstraction, leading to the 99.51% ratio (28.8&#160;mmol&#160;min&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1) rate for thioanisole conversion with H2O2 assisted advance oxidation technology. This work brings a new sight on the coordinated atoms dominant oxidation process.

         <title>Carbon Nanocage with Maximum Utilization of Atomically Dispersed Iron as Efficient Oxygen Electroreduction Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical meso&#8208;/microporous N/S co&#8208;doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 is prepared via nano&#8208;emulsion induced polymerization self&#8208;assembly method, and employed as efficient oxygen electroreduction nanoreactor. The significance of well&#8208;developed nanostructure and porosity toward maximizing utilization of active sites and ensuring fast mass transfer is addressed for highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalyst by systematical experiments and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology.








Abstract
As key parameters of electrocatalysts, the density and utilization of active sites determine the electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction. Unfortunately, prevalent oxygen electrocatalysts fail to maximize the utilization of active sites due to inappropriate nanostructural design. Herein, a nano&#8208;emulsion induced polymerization self&#8208;assembly strategy is employed to prepare hierarchical meso&#8208;/microporous N/S co&#8208;doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 (denoted as Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC). In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology reveals the density of available active sites for Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC reach to 3.57&#160;&#215;&#160;1014 sites cm&#8722;2, representing more than threefold improvement compared to micropore&#8208;dominant Micro&#8208;FeNSC counterpart (1.07&#160;&#215;&#160;1014 sites cm&#8722;2). Additionally, the turnover frequency of Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC is also improved to 0.69 from 0.50 e&#8722; site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for Micro&#8208;FeNSC. These properties motivate Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC as efficient oxygen electroreduction electrocatalyst, in terms of outstanding half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V), remarkable kinetic mass specific activity (68.65 A g&#8722;1), and excellent robustness. The assembled Zn&#8211;air batteries with Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC deliver high peak power density (264.34&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), large specific capacity (814.09&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), and long cycle life (&gt;200&#160;h). This work sheds lights on quantifying active site density and the significance of maximum utilization of active sites for rational design of advanced catalysts.

         <title>Impermeable Atomic Layer Deposition for Sputtering Buffer Layer in Efficient Semi&#8208;Transparent and Tandem Solar Cells via Activating Unreactive Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic layer deposition (ALD) growth mode on the commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM is activated from island growth to layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mode by introducing reaction sites. As a result, the excellent stability, efficient semi&#8208;transparent device, and perovskite/silicon tandem device with reaction sites are available.








Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) turns out to be particularly attractive technology for the sputtering buffer layer when preparing the semi&#8208;transparent (ST) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and the tandem solar cells. ALD process turns to be island growth when the substrate is unreactive with the ALD reactants, resulting in the pin&#8208;hole layer, which causes an adverse effect on anti&#8208;sputtering. Here, p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PSCs with ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer are conducted. The commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PVK solar cell is an unreactive substrate that prevents the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth for the ALD SnOx. PCBM layer is activated by introducing reaction sites to form impermeable ALD layers. By introducing reaction sites/ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer, the authors succeed to fabricate ST&#8208;PSCs and perovskite/silicon (double&#8208;side polished) tandem solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.25% and 23.31%, respectively. Besides, the unencapsulated device with reaction sites maintains more than 99% of the initial PCE after aging over 5100 h. This work opens a promising avenue to prepare impermeable layer for stable PSCs, ST&#8208;PSCs, tandem solar cells, and the related scale&#8208;up solar cells.

         <title>Strategic Synthesis of 2D and&#160;3D Conducting Polymers and Derived Nanocomposites</title>

A strategic synthesis technique based on a bicontinuous microemulsion system is developed to design nanostructures of conducting polymers including 2D, 3D, and nanocomposites with tailored electrical properties and morphologies.








Abstract
In recent decades, there has been a great deal of interest in conducting polymers due to their broad applications. At the same time, various synthetic techniques have been developed to produce various nanostructures of the conducting polymers with their fascinating properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, there has been a great deal of interest in conducting polymers due to their broad applications. At the same time, various synthetic techniques have been developed to produce various nanostructures of the conducting polymers with their fascinating properties. However, the techniques for the manufacture of 2D nanosheets are either complex or expensive. No comprehensive approach for constructing 2D and 3D materials or their composites has been documented. Herein, a simple and scalable synthetic protocol is reported for the design of 2D, 3D, and related conducting polymer nanocomposites by interface manipulation in a bicontinuous microemulsion system.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix Secretion Mechanically Reinforces Interlocking Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a bioinspired interlocking interface produced by electrostatic flocking. Such an interface can sustain cell growth, and the perpendicularly aligned flocked fibers can mitigate cell death caused by compression. In addition, the secreted extracellular matrix from seeded cells significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the interface.








Abstract
Drawing inspiration for biomaterials from biological systems has led to many biomedical innovations. One notable bioinspired device, Velcro, consists of two substrates with interlocking ability. Generating reversibly interlocking biomaterials is an area of investigation, as such devices can allow for modular tissue engineering, reversibly interlocking biomaterial interfaces, or friction&#8208;based coupling devices. Here, a biaxially interlocking interface generated using electrostatic flocking is reported. Two electrostatically flocked substrates are mechanically and reversibly interlocked with the ability to resist shearing and compression forces. An initial high&#8208;throughput screen of polyamide flock fibers with varying diameters and fiber lengths is conducted to elucidate the roles of different fiber parameters on scaffold mechanical properties. After determining the most desirable parameters via weight scoring, polylactic acid (PLA) fibers are used to emulate the ideal scaffold for in vitro use. PLA flocked scaffolds are populated with osteoblasts and interlocked. Interlocked flocked scaffolds improved cell survivorship under mechanical compression and sustained cell viability and proliferation. Additionally, the compression and shearing resistance of cell&#8208;seeded interlocking interfaces increased with increasing extracellular matrix deposition. The introduction of extracellular matrix&#8208;reinforced interlocking interfaces may serve as binders for modular tissue engineering, act as scaffolds for engineering tissue interfaces, or enable friction&#8208;based couplers for biomedical applications.

         <title>Intrinsic Charge Polarization in Bi19S27Cl3 Nanorods Promotes Selective C&#63743;C Coupling Reaction during Photoreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of intrinsic charge polarization has been efficiently exploited for the C&#63743;C coupling reaction. The selected catalyst, Bi19S27Cl3&#160;has three suitably arranged Bi centers with asymmetric charge distribution. The charge polarized Bi centers facilitate the formation of COCOH* intermediate which has been realized as the crucial step for synthesizing ethanol from CO2.








Abstract
Obtaining multi&#8208;carbon products via CO2&#160;photoreduction is a major catalytic challenge involving multielectron&#8208;mediated C&#63743;C bond formation. Complex design of multicomponent interfaces that are exploited to achieve this chemical transformation, often leads to untraceable deleterious changes in the interfacial chemical environment affecting CO2&#160;conversion efficiency and product selectivity. Alternatively, robust metal centers having asymmetric charge distribution can effectuate C&#63743;C coupling reaction through the stabilization of intermediates, for desired product selectivity. However, generating inherent charge distribution in a single component catalyst is a difficult material design challenge. Here, a novel photocatalyst, Bi19S27Cl3, is presented which selectively converts CO2&#160;to a C2&#160;product, ethanol, in high yield under visible light irradiation. Structural analysis through transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the presence of charge polarized bismuth centers in Bi19S27Cl3. The intrinsic electric field induced by charge polarized bismuth centers renders better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pair. Furthermore, charge polarized centers yield better adsorption of CO* intermediate and accelerate the rate determining C&#63743;C coupling step through the formation of OCCOH intermediate. Formation of these intermediates is experimentally mapped by in&#160;situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Asperities for Pressure&#8208;Tunable Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many applications require on&#8208;demand control of adhesion at an interface without significant power consumption. In this work, a new form of adhesive termed &#8220;pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive&#8221; (PTA) is presented. PTAs are elastomeric surfaces patterned with stiff, axisymmetric asperities. The adhesive force of the PTA increases with increasing applied preload. The pressure&#8208;tunable adhesion is demonstrated for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling.








Abstract
Control of adhesion is important in a host of applications including soft robotics, pick&#8208;and&#8208;place manufacturing, wearable devices, and transfer printing. While there are adhesive systems with discrete switchability between states of high and low adhesion, achieving continuously variable adhesion strength remains a challenge. In this work, a pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive (PTA) that is based on the self&#8208;assembly of stiff microscale asperities on an elastomeric substrate is presented. It is demonstrated that the adhesion strength of the PTA increases with the applied compressive preload due to the unique contact formation mechanism caused by the asperities. Additionally, a contact mechanics model is developed to explain the resulting trends. For a specific PTA design, the critical pull&#8208;off force can be increased from 0.4 to 30&#160;mN by increasing the applied preload from 1 to 30&#160;mN. Finally, the applicability of precision control of adhesion strength is demonstrated by utilizing the PTA for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling. The approach in pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive design based on self&#8208;assembly of asperities presents a scalable and versatile approach that is applicable to a variety of material systems having different mechanical or surface properties.

         <title>New Method for Preparing ZnO Layer for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and environmentally friendly method, through boric acid, to remove the residual amine in zinc oxide (ZnO) without decomposing ZnO is reported. Consequently, the optimized tandem organic solar cells (OSCs) output of 19.56% power conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term illumination stability of OSCs are significantly improved.








Abstract
Owing to outstanding optoelectronic properties and simple preparation, zinc oxide (ZnO) has widely been used in organic solar cells (OSCs). Although versatile cathode interface materials have been designed in past, ZnO remains indispensable owing to its excellent overall performance. Therefore, solving the persistent problem of residual amine reacting with non&#8208;fullerene acceptors will make ZnO superior over other materials, and thus improve the performance and energy budget of OSCs. Herein, a simple, effective, and economical method for removing residual amine in ZnO without distorting ZnO is reported. By accurately comparing the alkalinities of ZnO and residual amine, boric acid (BA) is selected as the amine&#8208;removing agent because of its suitable acidic dissociation constant. Moreover, the high water solubility of BA ensures that the post&#8208;cleaning process can be easily performed. The work function, electron extraction, and stability of cathode interface layer are optimized through rinsing them with BA. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of OSCs under long&#8208;term illumination are significantly improved. The optimal 0.04&#160;and 1.00&#160;cm2&#160;single&#8208;junction OSCs are based on PBDB&#8208;TF:HDO&#8208;4Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9&#160;bulk heterojunction output 18.40% and 17.42% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, tandem OSCs based on the BA&#8208;treated ZnO exhibit a 19.56% PCE, demonstrating the reliability of this method.

The optimal 0.04&#160;and 1.00&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;single-junction OSCs are based on PBDB-TF:HDO-4Cl:BTP-eC9&#160;bulk heterojunction output 18.40% and 17.42% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, tandem OSCs based on the BA-treated ZnO exhibit a 19.56% PCE, demonstrating the reliability of this method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulating the Formation of 2D/3D Heterostructure in Stable High&#8208;Performance Printable CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ X&#8208;ray scattering is applied to investigate the structure evolution pathway of the 2D phase atop 3D perovskite. By manipulating the phase transition pathway, the gradient distribution from 3D to n&#160;= 2 and n&#160;= 1 phase is realized in final films which helps charge separation and extraction, finally concurrently boosted the device stability and efficiency.








Abstract
Manipulating the formation process of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure, including its nucleation/growth dynamics and phase transition pathway, plays a critical role in controlling the charge transport between 2D and 3D crystals, and consequently, the scalable fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. Herein, the structural evolution and phase transition pathways of the ligand&#8208;dependent 2D perovskite atop the 3D surface are revealed using time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray scattering. The results show that the ligand size and shape have a critical influence on the final 2D structure. In particular, ligands with smaller sizes and more reactive sites tend to form the n&#160;= 1 phase. Increasing the ligand size and decreasing the reactive sites promote the transformation from 3D to n&#160;= 3 and n&#160;&lt; 3 phases. These findings are useful for the rational design of the phase distribution in 2D perovskites to balance the charge transport and stability of the perovskite films. Finally, solar cells based on ambient&#8208;printed CsPbI3 with n&#8208;butylammonium iodide treatment achieve an improved efficiency of 20.33%, which is the highest reported value for printed inorganic perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;Selective Antigen&#8208;Presentation by Supramolecular Chiral Polymer Micelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral polymer micelles are prepared by complexing antigens with chiral amino acid modified polyethyleneimine. D&#8208;chiral micelles present the lowest cytotoxicity while promoting the highest activation levels of dendritic cells and antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells compared to those of L&#8208;chiral and achiral micelles. Immunoactivation mediated by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in biological systems, which is closely related to biological functions, life processes, and even the pathogenesis of diseases. However, the interface between the chirality of synthetic materials and organisms, particularly the immune system, remains poorly understood. Here, supramolecular chiral polymer micelles (SCPMs) are prepared by complexing antigenic proteins with chiral amino acid&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine. The introduction of chirality not only reduces the toxicity of cationic polymer, but also benefits cell uptake and antigen presentation. Especially, D&#8208;chirality presents the lowest cytotoxicity, while promoting the highest expression level of costimulatory molecules on dendritic cells compared to L&#8208;chirality and achirality. The superiority of D&#8208;chirality to stimulate dendritic cell maturation is supported by immunization with D&#8208;SCPMs, which achieves significant antigen&#8208;specific proliferation of T cells in the spleen, lymph nodes, and tumor of mice. Chirality&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation are demonstrated by D&#8208;SCPMs self&#8208;assembled from chiral alkaline histidine or neutral phenylalanine modified polyethyleneimine and tumor associated ovalbumin or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike 1 antigenic protein. Immunoactivation enabled by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.

         <title>A Molecularly Tailored Photosensitizer with an Efficiency of 13.2% for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) is demonstrated as an efficient &#960;&#8208;linker for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells. Endowed with the hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination, yielding a record power conversion efficiency of 13.2% and an outstanding stability under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h.








Abstract
Photosensitizers yielding superior photocurrents are crucial for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Herein, two molecularly tailored organic sensitizers are presented, coded ZS4 and ZS5, through judiciously employing dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8243;,3&#8243;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) as the &#960;&#8208;linker and hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) or naphthalene&#8208;fused&#8208;quinoxaline (NFQ) as the auxiliary electron&#8208;accepting unit, respectively. Endowed with the HPQ acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination as compared to ZS5. As a result, ZS4&#8208;based DSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% under standard AM1.5G sunlight, with a high short&#8208;circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05&#160;V and a fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. Remarkably, DSCs sensitized with ZS4 exhibit an outstanding stability, retaining 95% of their initial PCE under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h. It is believed that&#160;this is a new record efficiency reported so far for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based DSCs using a single sensitizer. The work highlights the importance of developing molecularly tailored photosensitizers for highly efficient DSCs with copper electrolyte.

         <title>Sulfonium&#8208;Cations&#8208;Assisted Intermediate Engineering for Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of sulfonium cation on the evolution of intermediates in quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites are investigated. It is found that the undesired intermediate can be suppressed with a favorable intermediate promoted after treatment, leading to improved film quality and enhanced device performance with superior photovoltaic efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D&#160;Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites with superior stability are admirable candidates for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) toward commercialization. However, the device performance remains unsatisfactory due to the disordered crystallization of perovskites. In this work, the effects of sulfonium cations on the evolution of intermediates and photovoltaic properties of 2D RP perovskites are investigated. The introduction of sulfonium cations leads to preferred intermediate transformation and improved film quality of perovskites. The resulting devices deliver a champion efficiency of 19.08% at room temperature and 20.52% at 180&#160;K, due to reduced recombination and enhanced charge transport. More importantly, the unencapsulated device maintains 84% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 40&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h. This work helps to gain a comprehensive understanding of the crystallization process of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites and provides a simple strategy to modulate the intermediates of perovskites.

         <title>Discovery of Type II Interlayer Trions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first observation of Type II interlayer trions by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic system&#8208;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure is reported. Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions.








Abstract
In terms of interlayer trions, electronic excitations in van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) can be classified into Type I (i.e., two identical charges in the same layer) and Type II (i.e., two identical charges in the different layers). Type I interlayer trions are investigated theoretically and experimentally. By contrast, Type II interlayer trions remain elusive in vdWHs, due to inadequate free charges, unsuitable band alignment, reduced Coulomb interactions, poor interface quality, etc. Here, the first observation of Type II interlayer trions is reported by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic system&#8212;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure (1L&#160;+&#160;2L HS). Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned and observed via PL spectroscopy. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions, which is highly correlated with the transition dipole moment of pentacene. The results pave the way to develop excitonic devices and all&#8208;optical circuits using atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic bilayers.

         <title>Ultrastable Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Fuel Cell Electrocatalysts by Eliminating Non&#8208;Coordinating Nitrogen and Regulating Coordination Structures at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastable Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C electrocatalyst for the oxygen electroreduction in proton exchange membrane fuel cells is developed by virtue of high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis chemistry at above 1100&#160;&#176;C, which enables the regulation of atomic coordination structures of Fe centers and the elimination of non&#8208;coordinating nitrogen dopants producing detrimental peroxide byproduct.








Abstract
Pyrolyzed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials have attracted considerable interest as one of the most active noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Despite significant progress is made in improving their catalytic activity during past decades, the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts still suffer from fairly poor electrochemical and storage stability, which greatly hurdles their practical application. Here, an effective strategy is developed to greatly improve their catalytic stability in PEMFCs and storage stability by virtue of previously unexplored high&#8208;temperature synthetic chemistry between 1100 and 1200&#160;&#176;C. Pyrolysis at this rarely adopted temperature range not only enables the elimination of less active nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon sites that generate detrimental peroxide byproduct but also regulates the coordination structure of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C from less stable D1 (O&#8211;FeN4C12) to a more stable D2 structure (FeN4C10). The optimized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits excellent stability in PEMFCs (&gt;80% performance retention after 30&#160;h under H2/O2 condition) and no activity loss after 35 day storage while maintaining a competitive ORR activity and PEMFC performance.

         <title>Controlled Desiccation of Preprinted Hydrogel Scaffolds Toward Complex 3D Microarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By printing highly shrinkable hydrogel scaffolds as templates via a low&#8208;resolution extrusion 3D printer, complex 3D architectures with micron&#8208;level resolution are successfully fabricated. This technique is capable of manufacturing a wider range of material types and reveals the opportunity for hydrogel to assist 3D microfabrication.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) is the key to creating a wide variety of 3D structures with unique and programmable functionalities. Direct ink writing is one of the widely used AM technologies with numerous printable materials. However, the extrude&#8208;based method is limited by low fabrication resolution, which is confined to printing macrostructures. Herein, a new AM strategy is reported, using a low&#8208;cost extrusion 3D printer, to create 3D microarchitectures at the macroscopic level through controlled desiccation of preprinted hydrogel scaffolds followed by infilling objective components. A printable hydrogel with a high&#8208;water content ensures maximum shrinkage (&#8776;99.5% in volume) of the printed scaffolds to achieve high resolution. Stable covalent cross&#8208;linking and a suitable drying rate enable uniform shrinkage of the scaffolds to retain their original architectures. Particularly, this method can be adapted to produce liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based 3D circuits and nanocomposite&#8208;based microrobots, indicating its capability to fabricate functional and complex 3D architectures with micron&#8208;level resolution from different material systems.

         <title>Hofmeister Effect&#8208;Enhanced Hydration Chemistry of Hydrogel for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar&#8208;Driven Interfacial Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid hydrogel (PMH) judiciously integrated by modified needle coke as solar absorber with polyvinyl alcohol as hydratable matrix and its implementation as evaporator for solar desalination are reported. The Hofmeister chaotropic ions can interfere hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks of PMH and strengthen corresponding hydration chemistry, thus delivering a lowered water vaporization enthalpy and an elevated evaporation performance of PMH in brine.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation technology holds great potential for mitigating the global water scarcity due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Lowering the vaporization enthalpy of water is key to boost the performance of solar&#8208;driven desalination. Herein, a highly hydratable hydrogel (PMH) network, consisting of modified needle coke as photothermal material and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as hydratable matrix, is crafted via simple physical cross&#8208;linking method. When capitalizing on the PMH as evaporator for 3.5&#160;wt% NaCl solution, a high evaporation rate of 3.18&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;under one sun illumination is deliver ed, unexpectedly outperforming that in pure water (2.53&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1). More importantly, the PMH shows a robust desalination durability, thus enabling a self&#8208;cleaning system. Further investigations reveal that the outstanding evaporation performance of PMH in brine roots in its hydrability tuned by chaotropic Cl&#8722;, wherein the Cl&#8722; can mediate the hydration chemistry of PVA in PMH and suppress related crystallinity, thus contributing to the increased content of intermediate water and the lowered vaporization enthalpy of brine. This work first scrutinizes the Hofmeister effect on the evaporation behavior of PMH evaporator in brine and provides insights for high&#8208;efficiency solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination.

         <title>Intrinsic Interfacial Dynamic Engineering of Zincophilic Microbrushes via Regulating Zn Deposition for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural and chemical design is proposed to anchor zincophilic microbrushes uniformly on zinc plates. By the interfacial engineering of guiding layer, zinc ion deposition is efficiently regulated, resulting in suppressed dendrite formation and hindered side reactions.

Aqueous rechargeable zinc ion batteries are promising efficient energy storage systems due to remarkable safety and satisfactory capacity. However, zinc metal anode instability including dendrite growth and side reactions severely hinders widespread applications. Herein, zincophilic microbrushes have been in situ anchored on zinc plates through simple freeze&#8208;drying and mild reduction of graphene oxide, successfully overcoming these thorny issues. By introducing suitable oxygen&#8208;containing groups, the microbrushes exhibit a good affinity for zinc ions, thereby providing sufficient depositing sites, promoting zinc plating and stripping during cycling, and suppressing side reactions. The delicate zincophilic microbrushes can not only function as protective layer to guide the deposition of zinc ions, but also act as high&#8208;speed pathways to redistribute the zinc ion flux for rapid kinetics. Consequently, the microbrushes&#8208;covered zinc anode displays long lifespan and good durability, whenever in symmetric cell or full battery tests. This work paves a feasible bridge to design advanced aqueous anodes by architecting both structures and compositions of metal coverings.

&lt;p&gt;A novel structural and chemical design is proposed to anchor zincophilic microbrushes uniformly on zinc plates. By the interfacial engineering of guiding layer, zinc ion deposition is efficiently regulated, resulting in suppressed dendrite formation and hindered side reactions. These rational coverings consequently lead to satisfactory anode stability for aqueous zinc ion battery.

         <title>Janus Microdroplets with Tunable Self&#8208;Recoverable and Switchable Reflective Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus microdroplets consisting of chiral nematic liquid crystals and silicone oil are synthesized, showing a large area of reflective colors compared with the spherical microdroplets. The reflective colors can be tuned by the chiral dopant concentration, the viewing angle, and magnetic field&#8208;responsive orientation of the droplets. Their suspension can be applied to&#160;self&#8208;recoverable displays, magnetic tracking, and data encryption.








Abstract
Microdroplets made from chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) can display reflective structural colors. However, the small area of reflection and their isotropic shape limit their performance. Here, Janus microdroplets are synthesized through phase separation between CLCs and silicone oil. The as&#8208;synthesized Janus microdroplets show primary structural colors with &#8776;14 times larger area compared to their spherical counterparts at a specific orientation; the orientation and thus the colored/transparent states can be switched by applying a magnetic field. The color of the Janus microdroplets can be tuned ranging from red to violet by varying the concentration of the chiral dopant in the CLC phase. Due to the density difference between the two phases, the Janus microdroplets prefer to orientate the silicone oil side up vertically, enabling the self&#8208;recoverable structural color after distortion. The Janus microdroplets can be dispersed in aqueous media to track the configuration and speed of magnetic objects. They can also be patterned as multiplexed labels for data encryption. The magnetic field&#8208;responsive Janus CLC microdroplets presented here offer new insights to generate and switch reflective colors with high color saturation. It also paves the way for broader applications of CLCs, including anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data encryption, display, and untethered speed sensors.

Chiral carbon dots (Ch&#8208;CDs) trigger circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of CsPbBr3&#160;nanocrystals. Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;retains emission characteristics of the CsPbBr3&#160;with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and meanwhile has special CPL. By anion exchange, CPL can cover almost the entire visible light band. This is the first report of chiral perovskite which is induced by other chiral nanomaterials.








Abstract
Chiral carbon dots (Ch&#8208;CDs) trigger the full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of CsPbX3&#160;nanocrystals (NCs). Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;NCs are successfully synthesized via simple ligand&#8208;assisted coprecipitation of Ch&#8208;CDs and metal halides precursors at room temperature. Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;retains emission characteristics of the CsPbBr3&#160;with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and meanwhile has special CPL, with a maximum luminescence dissymmetric factor (glum) of &#8722;3.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, which is induced by Ch&#8208;CDs. This is the first report of chiral perovskite which is induced by other chiral nanomaterials. By anion exchange, CPL can cover almost the entire visible light band. Surprisingly, the chiral signal of Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;NCs is in&#8208;versed under excitation state, which can be induced by the charge transfers between Ch&#8208;CDs and perovskite NCs. The combination of perovskites and Ch&#8208;CDs pave away for the design of new chiral perovskite on multifunctional applications.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Regenerated LiFePO4 from Spent Cathode by Elevating the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe in regenerated LiFePO4 (RSLFP@NC), which effectively restrains Fe migration and the formation of antisite defects during cycling. Therefore, the regenerated LFP shows excellent cycling performance with &#8776;80% retention after 1000&#160;cycles, which is better than the cycling performance of pristine LiFePO4.








Abstract
A large amount of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) has been produced in recent years because it is one of the most widely used cathode materials for electric vehicles. The traditional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling methods are doubted because of the economic and environmental benefits; the direct regeneration method is considered a promising way to recycle spent LFP. However, the performance of regenerated LFP by direct recycling is not ideal due to the migration of Fe ions during cycling and irreversible phase transition caused by sluggish Li+ diffusion. The key to addressing the challenge is to immobilize Fe atoms in the lattice and improve the Li+ migration capability during cycling. In this work, spent LFP is regenerated by using environmentally friendly ethanol, and its cycling stability is promoted by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe atoms via construction of a heterogeneous interface between LFP and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. The Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions during cycling is suppressed due to the elevated d&#8208;band center. The Li+ diffusion kinetics in the regenerated LFP are improved, leading to an excellent reversibility of the phase transition. Therefore, &#160;the regenerated LFP exhibits an ultrastable cycling performance at a high rate of 10&#160;C with &#8776;80% capacity retention after 1000&#160;cycles.

Perovskite Solar Cells
In article 2208061, Lukas E. Lehner, Martin Kaltenbrunner, and co&#8208;workers report the controlled nucleation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites at the liquid&#8211;air interface of the precursor solution. Restricting the initial crystal growth to the surface of the liquid results in highly aligned perovskite thin films with improved charge transport, enabling efficient solar cells with excellent stability.

All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries
The application of a lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) has been hampered by its low electronic conductivity and the high reactivity of its lattice oxygen. In article number 2207234, Ruizhi Yu, Jiantao Wang, Xifei Li, Chandra Veer Singh, Xueliang Sun, and co&#8208;workers successfully address this by introducing an appropriate amount of conductive additives to the solid&#8208;state electrodes and manipulating the surface chemistry, realizing long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life LLO&#8208;based ASSBs.

Cathode Materials
The cycling performance of regenerated LiFePO4 by the direct recycling method is generally not ideal due to the migration of iron (Fe) ions during cycling. In article number 2208034, Zheng Liang, Guangmin Zhou, Hui&#8208;Ming Cheng, and co&#8208;workers report long&#8208;life regenerated LiFePO4 from the spent cathode. Fe&#8211;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions is suppressed by elevating the d&#8208;band center of the Fe. Therefore, excellent cycle performance of LiFePO4 is realized and this strategy provides a guideline for achieving good performance of regenerated LiFePO4.

Pressure&#8208;Tunable Adhesives
In article number 2207337, Chelsea Davis and co&#8208;workers show that pressure&#8208;tunable adhesives (PTAs) demonstrate variable adhesive separation forces depending on the application pressure used to form the interface. PTAs are formed by annealing a polymer film on a silicone surface so that it dewets, forming polygonal clusters. The large gray circle is the flat face of a cylindrical probe about to make contact with the PTA during a probe&#8208;tack adhesion experiment.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite recent rapid growth, traditional synthetic approaches to quantum materials have limited architectural control beyond the atomic scale. By contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can tailor structures over a wide range of length scales. This review explores opportunities for soft matter to impact quantum material synthesis, highlighting existing work at the interface, and offering perspectives on soft&#8208;matter&#8208;enabled quantum materials.








Abstract
The field of quantum materials has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, driven by exciting new discoveries with immense transformative potential. Traditional synthetic methods to quantum materials have, however, limited the exploration of architectural control beyond the atomic scale. By contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can be used to tailor material structure over a large range of length scales, with a vast array of possible form factors, promising emerging quantum material properties at the mesoscale. This review explores opportunities for soft matter science to impact the synthesis of quantum materials with advanced properties.

         <title>Block Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly Directed Synthesis of Porous Materials with Ordered Bicontinuous Structures and Their Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article overviews the progress of the studies on block copolymer self&#8208;assembly guided synthesis of bicontinuous porous materials, with the emphases on their synthetic strategies, structural control, and potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.








Abstract
Porous materials with their ordered bicontinuous structures have attracted great interest owing to ordered periodic structures as well as 3D interconnected network and pore channels. Bicontinuous structures may favor efficient mass diffusion to the interior of materials, thus increasing the utilization ratio of active sites. In addition, ordered bicontinuous structures confer materials with exceptional optical and magnetic properties, including tunable photonic bandgap, negative refraction, and multiple equivalent magnetization configurations. The attractive structural advantages and physical properties have inspired people to develop strategies for preparing bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous materials. Among a few synthetic approaches, the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers represents a versatile strategy to prepare various bicontinuous&#8208;structured functional materials with pore sizes and lattice parameters ranging from 1 to 500&#160;nm. This article overviews progress in this appealing area, with an emphasis on the synthetic strategies, the structural control (including topologies, pore sizes, and unit cell parameters), and their potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.

         <title>Pivotal Routes for Maximizing Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cell Performance: Photon Propagation Management and Carrier Kinetics Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic understanding of the mechanism of photon propagation and carrier kinetics of semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;PSCs. In this paper, the key factors affecting the high light utilization of ST&#8208;PSCs are deeply discussed from the theoretical analysis, and the recent advances from the view of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation of ST&#8208;PSCs are summarized, which provides guidance for promoting the rapid development and further commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) are ideal candidates for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and tandem solar cells (TSCs) owing to their tunable bandgap and high visible transparency. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ST&#8208;PSCs is close to 15% with an average visible transmittance of over 20%, which still lags far behind the PCE of normal opaque PSCs. This can be attributed to the poor light utilization efficiency (LUE) of ST&#8208;PSCs. Herein, the pivotal routes for maximizing LUE of ST&#8208;PSCs in terms of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation are systematically rationalized. First, the fundamental theoretical analyses on optical processes and electronic properties are provided. Then, insights on photon propagation management measures and carrier kinetics regulation strategies are provided. Furthermore, a summary of the promising commercial application of ST&#8208;PSCs in BIPV and TSCs is provided. Finally, the main progress of ST&#8208;PSCs is briefly summarized, and the directions for the commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs are proposed.

         <title>Toward Plasmonic Neural Probes: SERS Detection of Neurotransmitters through Gold&#8208;Nanoislands&#8208;Decorated Tapered Optical Fibers with Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm Gaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy based neural probe that can detect neurotransmitters down to the micromolar range is presented. Striving for the development of minimally invasive neuroplasmonic probes providing highly sensitive biomolecular detection in the deep brain regions, a nonplanar repeated dewetting technique to fabricate gold nanoislands with sub&#8208;10 nm gaps around the entire tapered optical fiber surface is introduced.








Abstract
Integration of plasmonic nanostructures with fiber&#8208;optics&#8208;based neural probes enables label&#8208;free detection of molecular fingerprints via surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), and it represents a fascinating technological horizon to investigate brain function. However, developing neuroplasmonic probes that can interface with deep brain regions with minimal invasiveness while providing the sensitivity to detect biomolecular signatures in a physiological environment is challenging, in particular because the same waveguide must be employed for both delivering excitation light and collecting the resulting scattered photons. Here, a SERS&#8208;active neural probe based on a tapered optical fiber (TF) decorated with gold nanoislands (NIs) that can detect neurotransmitters down to the micromolar range is presented. To do this, a novel, nonplanar repeated dewetting technique to fabricate gold NIs with sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gaps, uniformly distributed on the wide (square millimeter scale in surface area), highly curved surface of TF is developed. It is experimentally and numerically shown&#160;that the amplified broadband near&#8208;field enhancement of the high&#8208;density NIs layer allows for achieving a limit of detection in aqueous solution of 10&#8722;7&#160;m for rhodamine 6G and 10&#8722;5&#160;m for serotonin and dopamine through SERS at near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. The NIs&#8208;TF technology is envisioned as a first step toward the unexplored frontier of in vivo label&#8208;free plasmonic neural interfaces.

         <title>Effects of Multiple Ion Reactions based on a CoSe2/MXene Cathode in Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum ion batteries have emerged as a promising battery storage technology owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness, operational safety, and high energy density. However, their actual capacity is substantially lower than their true capacity and their cycling stability is poor. Therefore, unerstanding the energy&#8208;storage mechanism may contribute to the successful design of a stable electrode material, on which the performance can be optimized. The aim of this study w as to investigate AlCl4&#8722; ions in transition metal cathode materials and mechanisms that enable for their high energy storage potential and low Coulombic efficiency. Results of theoretical analysis and experimental verification show that a multi&#8208;ion transport mechanism is responsible for the electrochemical behavior of the battery. The lattice distortion of CoSe2 caused by AlCl4&#8722; ion intercalation, has a considerable effect on the initial stability of the battery. MXene as a support material reduces the size of CoSe2 growing on its surface, effectively inhibiting the lattice distortion caused by the interaction with the aluminum anion complex, thus addressing the issues of poor reversibility, cycle instability, and low Coulombic efficiency of the battery. Hence, understanding the impact of MXene on the battery may aid in further improving the design of electrode materials.

         <title>Reviving Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis of Bulk La&#8211;Ni Intermetallics via Gaseous Hydrogen Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen processing strategy is utilized to optimize the microstructure of bulk LaNi5 to activate its alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER)&#160;performance. Furthermore, the phase evolution, as well as the role of La during the OER process, is unequivocally decoupled. Hydrogen storage, hydrogen production, and hydrogen application are integrated toward the development of the hydrogen economy.








Abstract
A hydrogen processing strategy is developed to enable bulk LaNi5 to attain high activity and long&#8208;term stability toward the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By a combination of in situ Raman and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) spectra, secondary&#8208;electron&#8208;excited scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) patterns as well as the Rietveld method and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is discovered that hydrogen&#8208;induced lattice distortion, grain refinement, and particle cracks dictate the effective reconstruction of the LaNi5 surface into a porous hetero&#8208;nanoarchitecture composed of uniformly confined active &#947;&#8208;NiOOH nanocrystals by La(OH)3 layer in the alkaline OER process. This significantly optimizes the charge transfer, structural integrity, active&#8208;site exposure, and adsorption energy toward the reaction intermediates. Benefiting from these merits, the overpotential (322&#160;mV) at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the hydrogen&#8208;processed OER catalyst deposited on nickel foam is reduced by 104&#160;mV as compared to the original phase. Notably, it exhibits remarkable stability for 10 days at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of more than 560&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media.

&lt;p&gt;A hydrogen processing strategy is utilized to optimize the microstructure of bulk LaNi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; to activate its alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER)&#160;performance. Furthermore, the phase evolution, as well as the role of La during the OER process, is unequivocally decoupled. Hydrogen storage, hydrogen production, and hydrogen application are integrated toward the development of the hydrogen economy.

         <title>Actively Triggerable Metals via Liquid Metal Embrittlement for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Actively triggerable metals for biomedical applications combine the advantageous functional properties of metals with precise lifetime control. In this work, a biocompatible liquid metal is formulated into stimuli that can successfully trigger the on&#8208;demand and programmable breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically relevant environments. Additionally, three use cases for actively triggerable metals in biomedical devices are presented.








Abstract
Actively triggerable materials, which break down upon introduction of an exogenous stimulus, enable precise control over the lifetime of biomedical technologies, as well as adaptation to unforeseen circumstances, such as changes to an established treatment plan. Yet, most actively triggerable materials are low&#8208;strength polymers and hydrogels with limited long&#8208;term durability. By contrast, metals possess advantageous functional properties, including high mechanical strength and conductivity, that are desirable across several applications within biomedicine. To realize actively triggerable metals, a mechanism called liquid metal embrittlement is leveraged, in which certain liquid metals penetrate the grain boundaries of certain solid metals and cause them to dramatically weaken or disintegrate. In this work, it is demonstrated that eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), a biocompatible alloy of gallium, can be formulated to reproducibly trigger the breakdown of aluminum within different physiologically relevant environments. The breakdown behavior of aluminum after triggering can further be readily controlled by manipulating its grain structure. Finally, three possible use cases of biomedical devices constructed from actively triggerable metals are demonstrated.

         <title>Graphdiyne and Its Derivatives as Efficient Charge Reservoirs and Transporters in Semiconductor Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) graphdiyne (GDY), which is composed of sp and sp2 hybridized carbon atoms, is a promising semiconductor material with a unique porous lamellar structure. It has high carrier mobility, tunable bandgap, high density of states, and strong electrostatic interaction ability with ions and organic functional units. In recent years, interests in applying GDYs (GDY and its derivatives) in semiconductor devices are rapidly growing, and great achievements have been made. Attractively, GDYs could act as efficient reservoirs and transporters for both carriers and ions, which endows them with enormous potential in future novel optoelectronics. In this review, the progress in this field is systematically summarized, aiming to bring an in&#8208;depth insight into the GDYs&#8217; intrinsic uniqueness. Particularly, the effects of GDYs on carrier dynamics and ionic interactions in various semiconductor devices are succinctly described, analyzed, and concluded.

         <title>Enzymatically Crosslinked Collagen as Versatile Matrix for In Vitro and In Vivo Co&#8208;Engineering of Blood and Lymphatic Vasculature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Adequate vascularization is required for the successful translation of many in vitro engineered tissues. This study presents a novel collagen derivative that harbors multiple recognition peptides for orthogonal enzymatic crosslinking based on sortase A and Factor XIII. Sortase A&#8208;mediated crosslinking enables the rapid co&#8208;engineering of human blood and lymphatic microcapillaries and mesoscale capillaries in bulk hydrogels. Whereas tuning of gel stiffness determines the extent of neovascularization, the relative number of blood and lymphatic capillaries recapitulates the ratio of blood and lymphatic endothelial cells originally seeded into the hydrogel. Bioengineered capillaries readily form luminal structures and exhibit typical maturation markers both in vitro and in vivo. The secondary crosslinking enzyme Factor XIII is used for in situ tethering of the VEGF mimetic QK peptide to collagen. This approach supports the formation of blood and lymphatic capillaries in the absence of exogenous VEGF. Orthogonal enzymatic crosslinking is further used to bioengineer hydrogels with spatially defined polymer compositions with pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;angiogenic properties. Finally, macroporous scaffolds based on secondary crosslinking of microgels enable vascularization independent from supporting fibroblasts. Overall, this work demonstrates for the first time the co&#8208;engineering of mature micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;sized blood and lymphatic capillaries using a highly versatile collagen derivative.

         <title>Near Zero&#8208;threshold Voltage P&#8208;N Junction Diodes Based on Super&#8208;semiconducting Nanostructured Ag/Al Arrays</title>

Abstract
Semiconductor devices are currently one of the most common energy consumption devices. Significantly reducing the energy consumption of semiconductor devices with advanced energy&#8208;efficient technologies is highly desirable. The discovery of super&#8208;semiconductors (SSCs) based on metallic bi&#8208;layer shell arrays provides an opportunity to realize ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power consumption semiconductors devices. As an example, we report the achievement of near zero&#8208;threshold voltage in p&#8208;n junction diodes based on super&#8208;semiconducting nanostructured Ag/Al arrays, realizing ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power p&#8208;n junction diodes: &#8764; 3&#160;W per trillion diodes with a working voltage of 1&#160;V, or 30&#160;mW per trillion diodes with an operating voltage of 0.1&#160;V. In addition, the p&#8208;n junction diodes exhibit a high breakdown field of &#8764; 1.1&#215;106&#160;V/cm, similar to that of SiC and GaN, due to a robust built&#8208;in field driven by infrared light photons. The SSC p&#8208;n diodes with near zero&#8208;threshold&#160;voltage and high breakdown field allow access to ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power semiconducting transistors, integrated circuits, chips, etc.

         <title>An Efficient High&#8208;entropy Perovskite&#8208;type Air Electrode for Reversible Oxygen Reduction and Water Splitting in Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) are emerging as ideal devices for highly efficient energy conversion (generating electricity) and storage (producing H2) at intermediate temperatures (400&#8208;700&#176;C). However, their commercialization is largely hindered by the development of highly efficient air electrodes for oxygen reduction and water&#8208;splitting reactions. Here we report our findings in the design of a highly active and durable air electrode: high&#8208;entropy Pr0.2Ba0.2Sr0.2La0.2Ca0.2CoO3&#8208;&#948; (HE&#8208;PBSLCC), which exhibits impressive activity and stability for oxygen reduction and water&#8208;splitting reactions, as confirmed by electrochemical characterizations and structural analyses. When used as an air electrode of R&#8208;PCEC, the HE&#8208;PBSLCC achieves encouraging performances in dual modes of fuel cells (FC) and electrolysis cells (EC) at 650&#176;C, demonstrating a maximum power density of 1.51 W cm&#8722;2 in FC mode, and a current density of &#8208;2.68 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3 V in EC mode. Furthermore, the cells display good operational durabilities in FC and EC modes for over 270 h and 500 h, respectively, and promising cycling durability for 70 h with reasonable Faradaic efficiencies. This study offers an effective strategy for the design of active and durable air electrodes for efficient oxygen reduction and water&#8208;splitting.

This study offers an effective strategy for the design of active and durable air electrodes for efficient oxygen reduction and water-splitting.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Effect of Phosphorus Modulation in Iron Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Peroxidase Mimicking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activity, owing to their well&#8208;defined isolated iron active sites on the carbon substrate, which effectively mimic the Fe&#8208;Nx active site's structure of natural peroxidase. To further meet the requirements of diverse biosensing applications, SACs POD&#8208;like activity still needs to be continuously enhanced. Herein, we introduce phosphorus heteroatoms to boost the POD&#8208;like activity of Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C SAC. A one&#8208;dimensional carbon nanowire (FeNCP/NW) catalyst with enriched Fe&#8208;N4 active sites is designed and synthesized, and phosphorus (P) atoms are doped in the carbon matrix to affect the Fe center through the long&#8208;range interaction. The experimental results show that the phosphorus&#8208;doping process can boost the POD&#8208;like activity more than the non&#8208;P&#8208;doped one with excellent selectivity and stability. The mechanism analysis results show that the introduction of P into SAC can first significantly enhance POD&#8208;like activity, and then decrease with increasing amount of P. As a proof of concept, the FeNCP/NW is employed in an enzyme cascade platform for highly&#8208;sensitive colorimetric detection of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

         <title>Vesicular Antibodies: Shedding Light on Antibody Therapeutics with Cell Membrane Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent breakthroughs in membrane&#8208;derived vesicle nanotechnology have enabled vesicular&#8208;antibody&#8208;based therapy. By proposing the concept of vesicular antibodies, reviewing their engineering strategies and biomedical applications, and highlighting their unique advantages, this perspective intends to provide new insights on the development of vesicular antibodies.








Abstract
The high stability of antibodies and their ability to precisely bind to antigens and endogenous immune receptors, as well as their susceptibility to protein engineering, enable antibody&#8208;based therapeutics to be widely applied in cancer, inflammation, infection, and other disorders. Nevertheless, the application of traditional antibody&#8208;based therapeutics has certain limitations, such as high price, limited permeability, and protein engineering complexity. Recent breakthroughs in cell membrane nanotechnology have deepened the understanding of the critical role of membrane protein receptors in disease treatment, enabling vesicular&#8208;antibody&#8208;based therapeutics. Here, the concept of vesicular antibodies that are obtained by modifying target antibodies onto cell membranes for biomedical applications is proposed. Given that an antibody is basically a protein, as an extension of this concept, vesicles or membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles that use surface antibodies and protein receptors on cell membranes for biomedical applications as vesicular antibodies are defined. Furthermore, several engineering strategies for vesicular antibodies are summarized and how vesicular antibodies can be used in a variety of situations is highlighted. In addition, current challenges and future prospects of vesicular antibodies are also discussed. It is anticipated this perspective will provide new insights on the development of next&#8208;generation antibodies for enhanced therapeutics.

         <title>Energy Efficient Neuro&#8208;inspired Phase Change Memory Based on Ge4Sb6Te7 as a Novel Epitaxial Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase change memory (PCM) is a promising candidate for neuro&#8208;inspired, data&#8208;intensive artificial intelligence applications, which relies on the physical attributes of PCM materials including gradual change of resistance states and multilevel operation with low resistance drift. However, achieving these attributes simultaneously remains a fundamental challenge for PCM materials such as Ge2Sb2Te5, the most commonly used material. Here we demonstrate bi&#8208;directional gradual resistance changes with &#8764;10x resistance window using low energy pulses in nanoscale PCM devices based on Ge4Sb6Te7, a new phase change nanocomposite material. These devices show 13 resistance levels with low resistance drift for the first 8 levels, resistance on/off ratio of &#8764;1000, and low variability. These attributes are enabled by the unique microstructural and electrothermal properties of Ge4Sb6Te7, a nanocomposite consisting of epitaxial SbTe nanoclusters within the Ge&#8208;Sb&#8208;Te matrix, and a higher crystallization but lower melting temperature than Ge2Sb2Te5. These results advance the pathway towards energy&#8208;efficient analog computing using PCM.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Dual&#8208;Function Fabric for Zero&#8208;Energy Thermal Environmental Management Through Multiband, Synergistic, and Asymmetric Optical Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar heating and radiative cooling techniques have been proposed for passive space thermal management to reduce the global energy burden. However, the currently used single&#8208;function envelope/coating materials can only achieve static temperature regulation, presenting limited energy savings and poor adaption to dynamic environments. In this study, we developed a sandwich&#8208;structured fabric, composed of vertical graphene, graphene glass fiber fabric, and polyacrylonitrile nanofibers, with heating and cooling functions integrated through multiband, synergistic, (solar spectrum and mid&#8208;infrared ranges), and asymmetric optical modulations on two sides of the fabric. The dual&#8208;function fabric demonstrated high adaption to the dynamic environment and superior performance in a zero&#8208;energy&#8208;input temperature regulation. Furthermore, it demonstrated &#8764;15.5 and &#8764;31.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;2 y&#8722;1 higher annual energy savings compared to those of their cooling&#8208;only and heating&#8208;only counterparts, corresponding to &#8764;173.7 MT reduction in the global CO2 emission. The fabric exhibited high scalability for batch manufacturing with commercially abundant raw materials and facile technologies, providing a favorable guarantee of its mass production and use.

         <title>Attenuating Metabolic Competition of Tumor Cells for Favoring the Nutritional Demand of Immune Cells by a Branched Polymeric Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A branched polymeric drug delivery system can be used as a previously unknown metabolic modulator to improve the tumor immune microenvironment via interfering with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the tumor microenvironment, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells.








Abstract
Tumor cells are dominant in the nutritional competition in the tumor microenvironment, and their metabolic abnormalities often lead to microenvironmental acidosis and nutrient deprivation, thereby impairing the function of immune cells and diminishing the antitumor therapeutic effect. Herein, a branched polymeric conjugate and its efficacy in attenuating the metabolic competition of tumor cells are reported. Compared with the control nanoparticles prepared from its linear counterpart, the branched&#8208;conjugate&#8208;based nanoparticles can more efficiently accumulate in the tumor tissue and interfere with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the TME, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells. Its combined treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) achieves an enhanced antitumor effect. The work presents a promising approach for targeting metabolic competition in the TME to enhance the chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effect against cancers.

         <title>Conformal Volumetric Grayscale Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformal volumetric grayscale metamaterials are presented as a new class of artificially structured media capable of multiplexing electromagnetic responses as a function of frequency and incident beam form. These materials can realize new classes of multifunctional devices including conformal microwave carpet cloaks, which render an object invisible to observers for a wide range of probing frequencies and incidence angles.








Abstract
Conformal artificial electromagnetic media that feature tailorable responses as a function of incidence wavelength and angle represent universal components for optical engineering. Conformal grayscale metamaterials are introduced as a new class of volumetric electromagnetic media capable of supporting highly multiplexed responses and arbitrary, curvilinear form factors. Subwavelength&#8208;scale voxels based on irregular shapes are designed to accommodate a continuum of dielectric values, enabling the freeform design process to reliably converge to exceptionally high figures of merit (FOMs) for a given multi&#8208;objective design problem. Through additive manufacturing of ceramic&#8211;polymer composites, microwave metamaterials, designed for the radio&#8208;frequency range of 8&#8211;12&#160;GHz, are experimentally fabricated and devices with extreme dispersion profiles, an airfoil&#8208;shaped beam&#8208;steering device, and a broadband, broad&#8208;angle conformal carpet cloak, are demonstrated. It is anticipated that conformal volumetric metamaterials will lead to new classes of compact and multifunctional imaging, sensing, and communications systems.

         <title>Regulating Surface Oxygen Activity by Perovskite&#8208;Coating&#8208;Stabilized Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly active anionic redox in the ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxide cathode is directly regulated by leveraging the stable oxygen vacancies/interstitials in a lithium and oxygen dual&#8208;ion conductor perovskite coating layer, which facilitates surface lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity at the same time. This work provides an effective strategy for capacity versus stability juggling of the high&#8208;energy cathodes.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxides are proposed as promising cathodes to fulfill the range demand of electric vehicles; yet, they are still haunted by compromised cyclability and thermal robustness. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art surface coating has been applied to solve the instability via blocking the physical contact between the electrolyte and the highly active Ni4+ ions on the cathode surface, but it falls short in handling the chemo&#8211;physical mobility of the oxidized lattice oxygen ions in the cathode. Herein, a direct regulation strategy is proposed to accommodate the highly active anionic redox within the solid phase. By leveraging the stable oxygen vacancies/interstitials in a lithium and oxygen dual&#8208;ion conductor (layered perovskite La4NiLiO8) coating layer, the reactivity of the surface lattice oxygen ion is dramatically restrained. As a result, the oxygen release from the lattice is suppressed, as well as the undesired irreversible phase transition and intergranular mechanical cracking. Meanwhile, the introduced dual&#8208;ion conductor can also facilitate lithium&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity on the particle surface. This work demonstrates that accommodating the anionic redox chemistry by dual&#8208;ion conductors is an effective strategy for capacity versus stability juggling of the high&#8208;energy cathodes.

         <title>A Novel &#8220;Inside&#8208;Out&#8221; Intraocular Nanomedicine Delivery Mode for Nanomaterials&#8217; Biological Effect Enhanced Choroidal Neovascularization Occlusion and Microenvironment Regulation</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pt and Au nanoparticle decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise choroidal neovascularization occlusion and microenvironment regulation. A novel &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; intraocular nanomedicine delivery mode is exploited to penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis. The mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF reduce by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively, compared to verteporfin treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treatment due to the superior light transmittance of the eye. However, PDT often leads to surrounding tissue damage and further microenvironmental deterioration, including exacerbated hypoxia, inflammation, and secondary neovascularization. In this work, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Au NPs decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise PDT and microenvironment amelioration, which can penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis and target to CNV by surface&#8208;grafted cyclo(Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp&#8211;d&#8208;Phe&#8211;Lys) after intravitreal injection. The excessive H2O2 in the CNV microenvironment is catalyzed by catalase&#8208;like Pt NPs for hypoxia relief and enhanced PDT occlusion of neovascular. Meanwhile, Au NPs show significant anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;angiogenesis properties in regulating macrophages and blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Compared with verteporfin treatment, the mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF in the nanoplatform group are downregulated by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively. Therefore, the nanoplatform realizes a comprehensive CNV treatment effect based on the high drug loading capacity and biosafety. The CNV treatment mode developed in this work provides a valuable reference for treating other diseases with similar physiological barriers that limit drug delivery and similar microenvironment.

Abstract
Soft, deformable electronic devices provide the means to monitor physiological information and health conditions for disease diagnostics. However, their practical utility is limited due to the lack of intrinsical thermal switching for mechanically transformative adaptability and self&#8208;healing capability against mechanical damages. Here, we report the design concepts, materials and physics, manufacturing approaches, and application opportunities of self&#8208;healing, reconfigurable, thermal&#8208;switching device platforms based on hyperbranched polymers and biphasic liquid metal. The former provides excellent self&#8208;healing performance and unique tunable stiffness and adhesion regulated by temperature for the on&#8208;skin switch, whereas the latter results in liquid metal circuits with extreme stretchability (&gt; 900%) and high conductivity (3.40 &#215; 104 S cm&#8722;1), as well as simple recycling capability. Triggered by the increased temperature from the skin surface, a multifunctional device platform can conveniently conform and strongly adhere to the hierarchically textured skin surface for non&#8208;invasive, continuous, comfortable health monitoring. Additionally, the self&#8208;healing and adhesive characteristics allow multiple multifunctional circuit components to assemble and completely wrap on 3D curvilinear surfaces. Together, the design, manufacturing, and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of the self&#8208;healing, transformative, and self&#8208;assembled electronics open up new opportunities for robust soft deformable devices, smart robotics, prosthetics, and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, and human&#8208;machine interfaces on irregular surfaces.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Enhanced Microwave Attenuation in Titanate Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create the high&#8208;entropy&#8208;stabilized (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2La0.2Pb0.2)TiO3&#160;perovskite that exhibits an enhanced effective microwave absorption band (90% absorption) is designed and developed. The favorable microstructural features, including abundant grain boundaries, oxygen defects, and strong shear strain caused by ultradense distorted lattices, can be achieved by regulating the entropy configuration.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), which incorporate multiple&#8208;principal cations into single&#8208;phase crystals and interact with diverse metal ions, extend the border for available compositions and unprecedented properties. Herein, a high&#8208;entropy&#8208;stabilized (Ca0.2Sr0.2Ba0.2La0.2Pb0.2)TiO3&#160;perovskite is reported, and the effective absorption bandwidth (90% absorption) improves almost two times than that of BaTiO3. The results demonstrate that the regulation of entropy configuration can yield significant grain boundaries, oxygen defects, and an ultradense distorted lattice. These characteristics give rise to strong interfacial and defect&#8208;induced polarizations, thus synergistically contributing to the dielectric attenuation performance. Moreover, the large strains derived from the strong lattice distortions in the high&#8208;entropy perovskite offer varied transport for electron carriers. The high&#8208;entropy&#8208;enhanced positive/negative charges accumulation around grain boundaries and strain&#8208;concentrated location, quantitatively validated by electron holography, results in unusual dielectric polarization loss. This study opens up an effective avenue for designing strong microwave absorption materials to satisfy the increasingly demanding requirements of advanced and integrated electronics. This work also offers a paradigm for improving other interesting properties for HEOs through entropy engineering.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Dependent Topological Hall Effect in Two&#8208;Dimensional Cr5Si3 Nanosheets with Non&#8208;Collinear Magnetic Phase</title>

Abstract
Antiferromagnets with non&#8208;collinear spin order are expected to exhibit unconventional electromagnetic response, such as spin Hall effects, chiral abnormal, quantum Hall effect and topological Hall effect. In this work, we synthesized two&#8208;dimensional (2D) thickness&#8208;controlled and high&#8208;quality Cr5Si3 nanosheets that is compatible with the CMOS technology by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. The angular dependence electromagnetic transport properties of Cr5Si3 nanosheets was investigated by physical property measurement system (PPMS) and an obvious topological Hall effect (THE) appeared at a large tilted magnetic field, which should result from the non&#8208;collinear magnetic structure of the Cr5Si3 nanosheet. The Cr5Si3 nanosheets exhibited distinct thickness&#8208;dependent perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and the THE only emerged in the specific thickness rang with moderate PMA. Our work provides opportunities for exploring fundamental spin&#8208;related physical mechanisms of noncollinear antiferromagnet in ultrathin limit.

         <title>Sulfide Bridged Covalent Quinoxaline Frameworks for Lithium&#8208;Organo&#8208;Sulfide Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The chelating ability of quinoxaline cores and the redox activity of organo&#8208;sulfide bridges in layered covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs) offer dual active sites for reversible lithium (Li)&#8208;storage. The designed COFs combining these properties feature disulfide and polysulfide&#8208;bridged networks showcasing an intriguing lithium&#8208;storage mechanism, which can be considered as a lithium&#8208;organo&#8208;sulfide (Li&#8208;OrS) battery. The experimental&#8208;computational elucidation of three quinoxaline COFs containing systematically enhanced sulfur atoms in sulfide bridging demonstrates fast kinetics during Li interactions with the quinoxaline core. Meanwhile, bilateral covalent bonding of sulfide bridges to quinoxaline core enables a redox&#8208;mediated reversible cleavage of the sulfur&#8208;sulfur bond and the formation of covalently anchored lithium&#8208;sulfide chains or clusters during Li&#8208;interactions, accompanied by a marked reduction of Li&#8208;polysulfide (Li&#8208;PS) dissolution into the electrolyte, a frequent drawback of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. The electrochemical behavior of model compounds mimicking the sulfide linkages of the COFs and operando Raman studies on the framework structure unravels the reversibility of the profound Li&#8208;ion&#8208;organo&#8208;sulfide interactions. As a result, nearly 84% retention of specific capacity was observed at 100&#160;mA/g for the polysulfide&#8208;bridged COF after 500 charge&#8208;discharge cycles. Thus, integrating redox&#8208;active organic&#8208;framework materials with covalently anchored sulfides enables a stable Li&#8208;OrS battery mechanism which shows benefits over a typical Li&#8208;S battery.

         <title>Strong&#8208;Proton&#8208;Adsorption Co&#8208;based Electrocatalysts Achieve Active and Stable Neutral Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Direct electrolysis of pH&#8208;neutral seawater to generate hydrogen is an attractive approach for storing renewable energy. However, due to the anodic competition between the chlorine evolution and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), direct seawater splitting suffers from a low current density and limited operating stability. Exploration of catalysts enabling an OER overpotential below the hypochlorite formation overpotential (&#8764; 490 mV) is critical to suppress the chloride evolution and facilitate the seawater splitting. Here we report a proton&#8208;adsorption&#8208;promoting strategy to increase the OER rate, resulting in a promoted and more stable neutral seawater splitting. The best catalysts herein are strong&#8208;proton&#8208;adsorption (SPA) materials such as palladium&#8208;doped cobalt oxide (Co3&#8208;xPdxO4) catalysts. These achieve an OER overpotential of 370 mV at 10 mA/cm2 in pH&#8208;neutral simulated seawater, outperforming Co3O4 by a margin of 70 mV. Co3&#8208;xPdxO4 catalysts provide stable catalytic performance for 450 hours at 200 mA/cm2 and 20 hours at 1 A/cm2 in neutral seawater. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations suggest that the incorporation of SPA cations accelerates the rate&#8208;determining water dissociation step in neutral OER pathway, and control studies rule out the provision of additional OER sites as a main factor herein.

         <title>Toward the Speed Limit of Phase Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase change memory (PCM) is one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation data&#8208;storage technology, the programming speed of which has enhanced within a timescale from milliseconds to subnanosecond (&#8764;500 picoseconds) through decades of effort. As the potential applications of PCM strongly depend on the switching speed, namely, the time required for the recrystallization of amorphous chalcogenide media, the finding of the ultimate crystallization speed is of great importance both theoretically and practically. Here, through systematic analysis of discovered phase change materials and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we first predict elemental Sb&#8208;based PCM may have a superfast crystallization speed. Indeed, such cells experimentally present extremely fast crystallization speeds within 360&#160;ps. Remarkably, the recrystallization process is further speeded up as the device shrinks, and a record fast crystallization speed of only 242&#160;ps is achieved in 60&#160;nm&#8208;size devices. These findings open opportunities for DRAM&#8208;like and even cache&#8208;like PCM using appropriate storage materials.

         <title>Boosting Ferroptosis Therapy with Iridium Single Atom Nanocatalyst in Ultra&#8208;low Metal Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanocatalysts pose great promise as tumor therapeutic agents due to their potent capacity to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor microenvironment (TME). Although increasing metal loading can improve the catalytic activity, addressing the dilemma between high metal content and potential systemic biotoxicity it poses still remains a great challenge. Here, we report a fully exposed active site strategy by site&#8208;specific anchoring single iridium (Ir) atoms on the outer surface of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon composite (Ir SAC) to obtain notable catalytic performance in an ultra&#8208;low metal content (&#8764; 0.11%). Ir SAC exhibited prominent dual enzymatic activities to mimic peroxidase (POD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHOx), which can catalyze the conversion of endogenous H2O2 into &#8226;OH in the acidic TME and deplete glutathione (GSH) simultaneously. With advanced support of a GSH&#8208;trapping platinum(IV), this nanocatalytic agent (Pt@IrSAC) caused intense lipid peroxidation that boosted tumor cell ferroptosis. Pt@IrSAC was further encapsulated with the membrane of red blood cells (Pt@IrSAC/RBC) to improve biocompatibility and biodistribution of nanocatalysts in vivo. The Pt@IrSAC/RBC demonstrated superior therapeutic efficacy in a mouse triple&#8208;negative mammary carcinoma model, resulting in complete tumor ablation in a single treatment session and negligible side effects. To our best knowledge, this is the first report on an ultra&#8208;low metal content Ir single atom catalyst for tumor ferroptosis therapy, which may provide valuable insights into the design of nanocatalysts with high performance and biosafety for biomedical applications.

Abstract
A robust single&#8208;molecule light&#8208;emitting diodes (SM&#8208;LED) with high color purity, linear polarization and efficiency tunability was prepared by covalently integrating one fluorescent molecule into nanogapped graphene electrodes. Furthermore, single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the electroluminescent center to different accepters was achieved through rational molecular engineering, enabling construction of a multi&#8208;color SM&#8208;LED. All these characterizations were accomplished in the photo&#8208;electrical integration system with high temporal/spatial/energy resolution, demonstrating the capability of the single&#8208;photon emission of SM&#8208;LEDs. The success in developing high&#8208;performance SM&#8208;LEDs inspires the development of the next generation of commercial display devices and promises a single&#8208;photon emitter for use in quantum computation and quantum communication.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;driven Liquid Electrolytes for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing liquid electrolytes with higher kinetics and enhanced interphase stability is one of the key challenges for lithium batteries. However, the poor solubility of lithium salts in solvents sets constraints that compromises the electrolyte properties. Here we show that introducing multiple salts to form a high&#8208;entropy solution, alters the solvation structure, which can be used to raise the solubility of specific salts and stabilize electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases. The prepared high&#8208;entropy electrolytes significantly enhance the cycling and rate performance of lithium batteries. For lithium&#8208;metal anodes the reversibility exceeds 99%, which extends the cycle life of batteries even under aggressive cycling conditions. For commercial batteries, combining a graphite anode with a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode, more than 1,000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles are achieved while maintaining a capacity retention of more than 90%. These performance improvements with respect to regular electrolytes are rationalized by the unique features of the solvation structure in high&#8208;entropy electrolytes. The weaker solvation interaction induced by the higher disorder results in improved lithium&#8208;ion kinetics, and the altered solvation composition leads to stabilized interphases. Finally, the high&#8208;entropy, induced by the presence of multiple salts, enables a decrease in melting temperature of the electrolytes and thus enables lower battery operation temperatures without changing the solvents.

         <title>Hierarchical Composite Self&#8208;Sorted Supramolecular Gel Noodles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multicomponent supramolecular systems can be used to achieve different properties and new behaviors compared to their corresponding single component systems. Here, we use a two&#8208;component system, showing that a non&#8208;gelling component modifies the assembly of the gelling component, allowing access to co&#8208;assembled structures that cannot be formed from the gelling component alone. We characterize the systems across multiple length scales, from the molecular level by NMR and CD spectroscopy, to the microstructure level by SANS and finally to the material level using nanoindentation and rheology. By exploiting the enhanced mechanical properties achieved through addition of the second component, we formed multicomponent noodles with superior mechanical properties to those formed by the single component system. Furthermore, the non&#8208;gelling component can be triggered to crystallize within the multicomponent noodles, allowing us to prepare new types of hierarchical composite noodles.

         <title>Highly selective transformation of biomass derivatives to valuable chemicals by single&#8208;atom photocatalyst Ni/TiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Selective C&#8208;C cleavage of the biomass derivative glycerol under mild conditions has been recognised as a promising yet challenging synthesis route to produce value&#8208;added chemicals. Here, a highly selective catalyst is presented for the transformation of glycerol to the high&#8208;value product glycolaldehyde, which is composed of nickel single atoms confined to the titanium dioxide surface. Driven by light, the catalyst operates under ambient conditions using air as a green oxidant. The optimised catalyst shows a selectivity of over 60% to glycolaldehyde, resulting in 1058 &#956;mol&#183;gCat&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 production rate, and nearly 3 times higher turnover number than NiOx nanoparticle&#8208;decorated TiO2 photocatalyst. Diverse operando and in&#8208;situ spectroscopies (including operando XANES, in&#8208;situ XPS, O2&#8208;TPD, EXAFS, etc.) unveil the unique function of the Ni single atom, which can significantly promote oxygen adsorption, work as an electron sink and accelerate the production of superoxide radicals, thereby improving the selectivity towards glycolaldehyde over other by&#8208;products.

         <title>3D Printing a Low&#8208;Cost Miniature Accommodating Optical Microscope</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key optical and optomechanical components of a miniature accommodating optical microscope are 3D printed in 50 min for less than $4. Synergizing the built&#8208;in voice&#8208;coil motor and compliant optomechanics facilitates focus&#8208;stacking functionality for extending imaging depth. 3D printing enables digitized component manufacturing, part&#8208;count reduction, and passive alignment for the ease of system assembly and alignment, allowing rapid customizability toward task&#8208;specific needs.








Abstract
This decade has witnessed the tremendous progress in miniaturizing optical imaging systems. Despite the advancements in 3D printing optical lenses at increasingly smaller dimensions, challenges remain in precisely manufacturing the dimensionally compatible optomechanical components and assembling them into a functional imaging system. To tackle this issue, the use of 3D printing to enable digitalized optomechanical component manufacturing, part&#8208;count&#8208;reduction design, and the inclusion of passive alignment features is reported here, all for the ease of system assembly. The key optomechanical components of a penny&#8208;sized accommodating optical microscope are 3D printed in 50 min at a significantly reduced unit cost near $4. By actuating a built&#8208;in voice&#8208;coil motor, its accommodating capability is validated to focus on specimens located at different distances, and a focus&#8208;stacking function is further utilized to greatly extend depth of field. The microscope can be readily customized and rapidly manufactured to respond to task&#8208;specific needs in form factor and optical characteristics.

         <title>Flexible Zinc&#8211;air Batteries with Ampere&#8208;hour Capacities and Wide&#8208;temperature Adaptabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries (FZABs) have significant potentials as efficient energy storage devices for wearable electronics because of their safeties and high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratios. However, their application is limited by their short cycle lives, low discharge capacities per cycle, and high charge/discharge polarizations. Accordingly, herein, a poly(sodium acrylate)&#8211;polyvinyl alcohol (PANa&#8211;PVA)&#8211;ionic liquid (IL) hydrogel (PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL) was prepared using a hygroscopic IL, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride (EMImCl), as an additive for twin&#8208;chain PANa&#8211;PVA. PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL exhibited a high conductivity of 306.9 mS cm&#8722;1 and a water uptake of 2515 wt% at room temperature. Moreover, a low&#8208;cost bifunctional catalyst, namely, Co9S8 nanoparticles anchored on N&#8208; and S&#8208;co&#8208;doped activated carbon black pearls 2000 (Co9S8&#8208;NSABP), was synthesised, which demonstrated a low O2 reversibility potential gap of 0.629&#160;V. FZABs based on PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL and Co9S8&#8208;NSABP demonstrated high discharge capacities of 1.67 mAh cm&#8722;2 per cycle and long cycle lives of 330&#160;h. Furthermore, large&#8208;scale flexible rechargeable Zn&#8211;air pouch cells were fabricated using PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL and Co9S8&#8208;NSABP, which exhibited total capacities of 1.03 Ah and energy densities of 246&#160;Wh kgcell&#8722;1. This study provides new information about hydrogels with high ionic conductivities and water uptakes and should facilitate the application of FZABs in wearable electronics.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study provides new information about hydrogels with high ionic conductivities and water uptakes and should facilitate the application of FZABs in wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photoinduced Dithiolane Crosslinking for Multiresponsive Dynamic Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While many hydrogels are elastic networks crosslinked by covalent bonds, viscoelastic hydrogels with adaptable crosslinks are increasingly being developed to better recapitulate time and position&#8208;dependent processes found in many tissues. In this work, 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes are presented as dynamic covalent photocrosslinkers of hydrogels, resulting in disulfide bonds throughout the hydrogel that respond to multiple stimuli. Using lipoic acid as a model dithiolane, disulfide crosslinks were formed under physiological conditions, enabling cell encapsulation via an initiator&#8208;free light&#8208;induced dithiolane ring&#8208;opening photopolymerization. The resulting hydrogels allow for multiple photoinduced dynamic responses including stress relaxation, stiffening, softening, and network functionalization using a single chemistry, which can be supplemented by permanent reaction with alkenes to further control network properties and connectivity using irreversible thioether crosslinks. Moreover, complementary photochemical approaches were used to achieve rapid and complete sample degradation via radical scission and post&#8208;gelation network stiffening when irradiated in the presence of reactive gel precursor. Results herein demonstrate the versatility of this material chemistry to study and direct 2D and 3D cell&#8208;material interactions. This manuscript highlights dithiolane&#8208;based hydrogel photocrosslinking as a robust method for generating adaptable hydrogels with a range of biologically relevant mechanical and chemical properties that are varied on demand.

         <title>Enhancing Photon Utilization Efficiency for High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaic Cells via Regulating Phase Transition Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient photon utilization is key to achieving high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. In this study, we constructed a multiscale fibril network morphology in a PBQx&#8208;TCl:PBDB&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based system by regulating donor and acceptor phase transition kinetics. The distinctive phase transition process and crystal size were systematically investigated. PBQx&#8208;TCl and eC9&#8208;2Cl formed fibril structures with diameters of approximately 25&#160;nm in ternary films. Additionally, fine fibrils assembled by PBDB&#8208;TF were uniformly distributed over the fibril networks of PBQx&#8208;TCl and eC9&#8208;2Cl. The ideal multiscale fibril network morphology enables the ternary system to achieve superior charge transfer and transport processes compared to binary systems; these improvements promote enhanced photon utilization efficiency. Finally, we achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 19.51% in a single&#8208;junction OPV cell. The external quantum efficiency of the optimized ternary cell exceeded 85% over a wide range of 500&#8211;800&#160;nm. We also fabricated a tandem OPV cell to increase solar photon absorption. The tandem cell had an excellent PCE of more than 20%. This study provides guidance for constructing an ideal multiscale fibril network morphology and improving the photon utilization efficiency of OPV cells.

         <title>Tumor Cell Nanovaccines based on Genetically Engineered Antibody&#8208;anchored Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the promise in whole&#8208;tumor cell vaccines, a key challenge is to overcome the lack of co&#8208;stimulatory signals. Here, we reported agonistic antibody&#8208;boosted tumor cell nanovaccines by genetically engineered antibody&#8208;anchored membrane (AAM) technology, capable of effectively activating co&#8208;stimulatory pathways. Specifically, the AAM can be stably constructed following genetically engineering of tumor cell membranes with anti&#8208;CD40 single chain variable fragment (scFv), an agonistic antibody to induce co&#8208;stimulatory signals. The nanovaccines were versatilely designed and obtained based on the anti&#8208;CD40 scFv&#8208;anchored membrane and nanotechnology. Following vaccination, the anti&#8208;CD40 scFv&#8208;anchored membrane nanovaccines (Nano&#8208;AAM/CD40) significantly facilitated the dendritic cell (DC) maturation in CD40&#8208;humanized transgenic mice and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Compared to membrane&#8208;based nanovaccines alone, the enhanced anti&#8208;tumor efficacy in both &#8220;hot&#8221; and &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor models of the Nano&#8208;AAM/CD40 demonstrated the importance of agonistic antibodies in development of tumor cell&#8208;based vaccines. To expand the design of nanovaccines, further incorporation of cell lysates into the Nano&#8208;AAM/CD40 to conceptually construct tumor cell&#8208;like nanovaccines resulted in boosted immune responses and improved antitumor efficacy against malignant tumors inoculated into CD40&#8208;humanized transgenic mice. Overall, this genetically engineered AAM technology provides a versatile design of nanovaccines by incorporation of tumor cell&#8208;based components and agonistic antibodies of co&#8208;stimulatory immune checkpoints.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Nanoflakes&#8208;Enabled All&#8208;Optical Nonlinear Activation Function for On&#8208;Chip Photonic Deep Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nanoflake 2D material MXene is designed for a neural network nonlinear broadband activator on a chip and realized using waveguide spectroscopy. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure of the proposed MXene&#8208;based activator configurations via tuning the wavelength of operation.








Abstract
2D metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) are promising material platforms for on&#8208;chip neural networks owing to their nonlinear saturable absorption effect. The localized surface plasmon resonances in metallic MXene nanoflakes may play an important role in enhancing the electromagnetic absorption; however, their contribution is not determined due to the lack of a precise understanding of its localized surface plasmon behavior. Here, a saturable absorber made of MXene thin film and a silicon waveguide with MXene flakes overlayer are developed to perform neuromorphic tasks. The proposed configurations are reconfigurable and can therefore be adjusted for various applications without the need to modify the physical structure of the proposed MXene&#8208;based activator configurations via tuning the wavelength of operation. The capability and feasibility of the obtained results of machine&#8208;learning applications are confirmed via handwritten digit classification task, with near 99% accuracy. These findings can guide the design of advanced ultrathin saturable absorption materials on a chip for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Electron Lifetime of Over One Month in Disordered Organic Solid&#8208;State Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultralong charge&#8208;carrier lifetime of more than one month in a disordered film of an organic semiconductor stored at room temperature is demonstrated. The charge carriers stored in the film are stabilized by spontaneous orientation polarization. It is also revealed that the charge carriers retain spatial information due to their slow diffusion in the plane of the organic layer.








Abstract
Understanding intrinsic carrier lifetime in disordered organic solid&#8208;state semiconductors is essential for improving device performance in not only molecule&#8208;based optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells (OSC) but also photocatalysts used for producing solar fuel cells. Carriers in disordered films are generally thought to have short lifetimes on a scale ranging from nanoseconds to milliseconds. These short carrier lifetimes cause loss of charges in OSCs and low quantum yields in photocatalysts and impede the future application of organic semiconductors to, for example, charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based memory devices. This study reports an ultralong intrinsic carrier lifetime of more than one month in a disordered film of an organic semiconductor stored at room temperature without external power. This extraordinary lifetime, which is several orders of magnitude longer than that generally believed possible in conventional organic semiconductors, arises from carrier stabilization by spontaneous orientation polarization, excited spin&#8208;triplet recycling, and blocking of recombination processes in disordered films.

The properties and application progress of hollow multi&#8208;shelled structure (HoMS) drug delivery system (DDS) for small&#8208;molecule and macromolecular drugs.








Abstract
Hollow&#8208;structured nanomaterials (HSNMs) have attracted increased interest in biomedical fields, owing to their excellent potential as drug delivery systems (DDSs) for clinical applications. Among HSNMs, hollow multi&#8208;shelled structures (HoMSs) exhibit properties such as high loading capacity, sequential drug release, and multi&#8208;functionalized modification and represent a new class of nanoplatforms for clinical applications. The remarkable properties of HoMS&#8208;based DDS can simultaneously satisfy and enhance DDSs for delivering small molecular drugs (e.g., antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, and imaging agents) and macromolecular drugs (e.g., protein/peptide&#8208; and nucleic acid&#8208;based drugs). First, the latest research advances in delivering small molecular drugs are summarized and highlight the inherent advantages of HoMS&#8208;based DDSs for small molecular drug targeting, combining continuous therapeutic drug delivery and theranostics to optimize the clinical benefit. Meanwhile, the macromolecular drugs DDSs are in the initial development stage and currently offer limited delivery modes. There is a growing need to analyze the deficiency of other HSNMs and integrate the advantages of HSNMs, providing solutions for the safe, stable, and cascade delivery of macromolecular drugs to meet vast treatment requirements. Therefore, the latest advances in HoMS&#8208;based DDSs are comprehensively reviewed, mainly focusing on the characteristics, research progress by drug category, and future research prospects.

         <title>Humidity&#8208;Insensitive, Large&#8208;Area&#8208;Applicable, Hot&#8208;Air&#8208;Assisted Ambient Fabrication of 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A hot&#8208;air&#8208;assisted ambient fabrication technique is introduced to prepare 2D layered perovskite films for efficient and stable solar cells. This method is material&#8208;saving, humidity&#8208;insensitive, large&#8208;area&#8208;applicable, and adaptable for different 2D perovskites. High&#8208;quality 2D perovskite films are obtained with good crystallinity, preferable orientation, and desirable morphology.








Abstract
2D layered perovskites (LPs) have shown great potential to deliver high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices with long&#8208;term stability. Despite many signs of progress being made in film quality and device performance, LP films are mainly processed in strict conditions and through non&#8208;scalable techniques. Here, the hot&#8208;air&#8208;assisted ambient fabrication technique is introduced to prepare LP films for efficient and stable solar cells. The high&#8208;quality LP films with good crystallinity, preferable orientation and desirable morphology are obtained by balancing the crystal nucleation and growth processes. Employing the synchrotron&#8208;based in situ grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction technique, hot air induces the solidification of solutes and forms an intermediate at the air&#8211;liquid interface, which transforms into 3D&#8208;like perovskite, followed by the growth of the 2D species toward the substrate. The optimal LP film delivers a device power conversion efficiency of 16.36%, the best value for the LP&#8208;based solar cells prepared by the non&#8208;spin&#8208;coating techniques. The solar cell performance is insensitive to the film processing humidity and the device size is upscalable, which promises real&#8208;world deployment of LP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>An Integrated Solar Panel with a Triboelectric Nanogenerator Array for Synergistic Harvesting of Raindrop&#160;and Solar Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A constructed integrated generator with a raindrop triboelectric nanogenerator (R&#8208;TENG) array and a solar panel can realize all&#8208;weather, complementary energy harvesting of raindrop and solar energy, and sustainable energy supply for the widely distributed sensors, which can promote the self&#8208;powered wireless environmental monitoring and the development of remote meteorological monitoring or smart farming, etc.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is regarded as an effective strategy for harvesting energy from raindrops, and is a complementary solution with solar cells to achieve all&#8208;weather energy harvesting and sustainable energy supply. However, due to the irregularity of natural rainfalls in the volume, frequency, density, and location, designing high&#8208;efficiency raindrop TENG (R&#8208;TENG) arrays faces great challenges. In this work, a highly transparent, large&#8208;area, and high&#8208;efficiency R&#8208;TENG array with rational material choice, electrode structure, and array distribution is developed for efficiently harvesting irregular raindrop energy. The problem of electrical signal cancellation among adjacent raindrops can be fully avoided, as viewed from the high&#8208;resolution space&#8211;time analyses of high&#8208;speed camera and electrical signal characteristics. With the rationally designed electrode instead of multiple complex electrodes, all charges can be exported by the R&#8208;TENG array in a simulated irregular raindrop scenario. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the R&#8208;TENG possesses higher average power density (40.80&#160;mW m&#8722;2) than that of the solar cell (37.03&#160;mW m&#8722;2) in rainy condition. Additionally, a self&#8208;powered wireless light&#8208;intensity&#8208;monitoring system is demonstrated for real&#8208;time and all&#8208;day weather monitoring. This work provides useful guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TENG arrays integrated with solar panels for harvesting irregular raindrop energy and solar energy.

         <title>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Mediated Drug Delivery for First Aid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system is developed for targeted drug delivery (uFAST), which enables autonomous administration of emergency therapeutics via UAVs to achieve timely first aid. The implementability and safety of the uFAST with a dual&#8208;mode glucagon microneedle patch in emergency care is well demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig disease model.








Abstract
Timely administration of key medications toward patients with sudden diseases is critical to saving lives. However, slow transport of first&#8208;aid therapeutics and the potential absence of trained people for drug usage can&#160;lead&#160;to severe injuries or even death. Herein, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system for targeted delivery (uFAST) is developed. It allows unattended administration of emergency therapeutics&#8208;loaded transdermal microneedle (MN) patches toward patients to relieve symptoms by a contact&#8208;triggered microneedle applicator (CTMA). The implementability and safety of the uFAST for first aid is demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig model by automatically delivering a glucagon patch with immediate and bioresponsive dual release modes. This platform technique may facilitate the development of UAV&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid treatments for other sudden diseases.

         <title>Oral Delivery of siRNA Using Fluorinated, Small&#8208;Sized Nanocapsules toward Anti&#8208;Inflammation Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;sized, reversibly cross&#8208;linked, fluorinated nanocapsules are developed to mediate efficient intestinal absorption of siRNA and systemic tumor necrosis factor &#945; gene silencing via oral administration. They feature high oral bioavailability of 20.4%, and demonstrate potent anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy against both acute and chronic inflammation. This study provides a transformative platform for oral siRNA delivery.








Abstract
Oral delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) provides a promising paradigm for treating diseases that require regular injections. However, the multiple gastrointestinal (GI) and systemic barriers often lead to inefficient oral absorption and low bioavailability of siRNA. Technologies that can overcome these barriers are still lacking, which hinders the clinical potential of orally delivered siRNA. Herein, small&#8208;sized, fluorinated nanocapsules (F&#8208;NCs) are developed to mediate efficient oral delivery of tumor necrosis factor &#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;) siRNA for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment. The NCs possess a disulfide&#8208;cross&#8208;linked shell structure, thus featuring robust stability in the GI tract. Because of their small size (&#8776;30&#160;nm) and fluorocarbon&#8208;assisted repelling of mucin adsorption, the best&#8208;performing F3&#8208;NCs show excellent mucus penetration and intestinal transport capabilities without impairing the intestinal tight junction, conferring the oral bioavailability of 20.4% in relative to intravenous injection. The disulfide cross&#8208;linker can be cleaved inside target cells, causing NCs dissociation and siRNA release to potentiate the TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing efficiency. In murine models of acute and chronic inflammation, orally delivered F3&#8208;NCs provoke efficient TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing and pronounced anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacies. This study therefore provides a transformative strategy for oral siRNA delivery, and will render promising utilities for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment.

         <title>Surface Optics and Color Effects of Liquid Metal Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid metals (LMs) such as gallium or bismuth based alloys are emerging as new functional materials with rather unique physical or chemical behaviors. They are generally safe and non&#8208;toxic, have high boiling points, reflectivities, good thermal and electrical conductivities, intrinsic flexibility, fluidity, self&#8208;healing capability and remain in liquid state at room temperature. However, the further applications of LMs are limited by their single&#8208;color physical appearance, such as working in the situations with imposed stringent requirements for color and aesthetics. Recently, the color and fluorescence functionalization of liquid metals have overcome many conventional technical bottlenecks and opened significant potential for emerging applications in numerous fields owing to their rich colors and unique liquid structure. In this review, the recent developments in the optical properties, color and fluorescence effects of liquid metals are comprehensively investigated. The synthesis, structures, properties, chromogenic mechanisms, and potential photoelectric applications of colorful liquid metals are systematically analyzed and compared. The effectiveness and characteristics of colorful liquid metals induced by coating, mixing, compounding, surface modification, external stimuli are provided, aiming to establish a potential system for the synthesis and practices of colorful liquid metals. Finally, the challenges and prospects in the field have also been identified and explained to preferably guide further scientific and technical researches in the coming time

         <title>Strong Interlayer Coupling in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices in twisted van der Waals materials offer a powerful platform for exploring light&#8208;matter interactions. The periodic moir&#233; potentials in moir&#233; superlattices can induce strongly correlated quantum phenomena such as moir&#233; excitons, superconductivity and the Mott&#8208;insulating state, all of which depend on the moir&#233; potential associated with the interlayer coupling at the interface. However, moir&#233; superlattices are primarily prepared by the mechanical exfoliation technique and the manual stacking method, where the transfer methods easily cause interfacial contamination, and the preparation of high&#8208;quality bilayer two&#8208;dimensional materials with small twist angles by direct growth methods remains a significant challenge. Here, we synthesized the WSe2/WSe2 homobilayer with different twist angles by a CVD method using a heteroatom&#8208;assisted growth technique. Using the low&#8208;frequency Raman scattering, the uniformity of the moir&#233; superlattices were mapped to demonstrate the strong interfacial coupling of the CVD&#8208;fabricated twist&#8208;angle homobilayer. The moir&#233; potential depths of the CVD&#8208;grown and artificially stacked homostructures with twist angles of 1.5&#176; were 115 and 45 meV (an increased of 155%), indicating that the depth of the moir&#233; potential can be modulated by the interfacial coupling. Our results open a new avenue to study the modulation of moir&#233; potential by strong interlayer coupling and provide a foundation for the development of twistronics

         <title>Harvesting Energy from Atmospheric Water: Grand Challenges in Continuous Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Atmospheric water is ubiquitous on Earth and extensively participates in the natural water cycle through evaporation and condensation. This process involves tremendous energy exchange with the environment, but very little of the energy has so far been harnessed. The recently emerged hydrovoltaic technology, especially moisture&#8208;induced electricity, has shown great potential in harvesting energy from atmospheric water and gives birth to moisture energy harvesting devices. The device performance, especially the long&#8208;term operational capacity, has been significantly enhanced over the past few years. Further development, however, requires in&#8208;depth understanding of mechanisms, innovative materials, and ingenious system designs. In this review, beginning with describing the basic properties of water, we discuss the key aspects of the water&#8208;hygroscopic material interactions and mechanisms of power generation. We then summarize the current material systems and advances in promising material development. Aiming at the chief bottlenecks of limited operational time, we list advanced system designs that are helpful to improve device performance. Especially, the synergistic effect of moisture adsorption and water evaporation on material and system levels to accomplish sustained electricity generation is discussed. Finally, we analyze the remaining challenges and suggest future directions for developing this promising technology.

         <title>Chiral MoSe2 Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive Monitoring of Reactive Oxygen Species In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral molybdenum diselenide nanoparticles modified by the fluorescent molecule (cyanine 3) are synthesized. They are used as nanoprobes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection through changes in chiral and fluorescent signals due to Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reaction induced by ROS on the surface of nanoparticles. These signals can indicate the ROS levels in living cells and in vivo.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and acute hepatitis, and quantification of ROS is critical for the early diagnosis of these diseases. In this work, a novel probe is developed,&#160;based on chiral molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) nanoparticles (NPs) modified by the fluorescent molecule, cyanine 3 (Cy3). Chiral MoSe2 NPs show intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals at 390 and 550&#160;nm, whereas the fluorescence of Cy3 at 560&#160;nm is quenched by MoSe2 NPs. In the presence of ROS, the probe reacts with the ROS and then oxidates rapidly, resulting in decreased CD signals and the recovery of the fluorescence. Using this strategy, the limit of detection values of CD and fluorescent signals in living cells are 0.0093&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.024&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The high selectivity and sensitivity to ROS in complex biological environments is attributed to the Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reactions on the surface of the NPs. Furthermore, chiral MoSe2 NPs are able to monitor the levels of ROS in vivo by the fluorescence. Collectively, this strategy offers a new approach for ROS detection and has the potential to inspire others to explore chiral nanomaterials as biosensors to investigate biological events.

         <title>Microenvironmentally Responsive Chemotherapeutic Prodrugs and CHEK2 Inhibitors Self&#8208;Assembled Micelles: Protecting Fertility and Enhancing Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A co&#8208;delivery micelle (BML@PMP) that consists of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) is developed for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. The BML@PMP micelles enhance the antitumor effect by delivering a high dose of paclitaxel to the tumor and inhibiting DNA damage repair, and prevent fertility damage by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway in the ovary.








Abstract
Chemotherapy is a widely used and effective adjuvant treatment for cancer, and it has unavoidable damage to female fertility, with statistics showing 38% of women who have received chemotherapy are infertile. How to reduce fertility toxicity while enhancing the oncologic chemotherapy is a clinical challenge. Herein, co&#8208;delivery micelles (BML@PMP) are developed, which are composed of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. BML@PMP achieves fertility protection through three actions: (1) Due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, BML@PMP is more enriched in the tumor, while very little in the ovary (about 1/10th of the tumor). (2) Glutathione (GSH) triggers the release of PTX, and with low levels of GSH in the ovary, the amount of PTX released in the ovary is correspondingly reduced. (3) BML277 inhibits oocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway. Because of the different downstream targets of CHEK2 in tumor cells and oocytes, BML277 also enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy by reducing DNA damage repair which is activated through the CHEK2 pathway. This bidirectional effect of CHEK2 inhibitor&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery system represents a promising strategy for improving oncology treatment indices and preventing chemotherapy&#8208;associated fertility damage.

         <title>Toward Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction: Longstanding Debates and Emerging Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The study on direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) has lasted around 70 years since its first investigation in the early 1950s. Though enormous effort has been devoted in this field, it is still far from commercialization. The methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) as a semi&#8208;reaction of DMFCs is the bottleneck reaction that restricts the overall performance of DMFCs. To date, there are intense debates on the complex 6&#8208;electron reaction, but barely any reviews have systematically discussed this topic. To this end, we summarized the controversies and progress regarding the electrocatalytic mechanisms, performance evaluations as well as the design science toward MOR electrocatalysts. This review also provides a comprehensive introduction on the recent development of emerging MOR electrocatalysts with a focus on the innovation of the alloy, core&#8208;shell structure, heterostructure and single&#8208;atom catalysts. Finally, perspectives on the future outlook toward the mechanisms study and electrocatalysts design are provided.

         <title>Ceria Nanoparticles as Copper Chaperones that Activate SOD1 for Synergistic Antioxidant Therapy to Treat Ischemic Vascular Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All exogenous nanomaterials undergo rapid biotransformation once injected into body and fall short of executing the intended purpose. Here we report that copper&#8208;deposited ceria nanoparticles (CuCe NPs) exhibit enhanced antioxidant effects than pristine ceria nanoparticles as the released copper buffers the depletion of glutathione while providing the bioavailable copper as a cofactor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1. The upregulated intracellular antioxidants along with ceria nanoparticles synergistically scavenge reactive oxygen species and promote anti&#8208;inflammation and M2 polarization of macrophages by modulating STAT1 and STAT6. The therapeutic effect of CuCe NPs is demonstrated in ischemic vascular diseases (i.e., murine models of hindlimb ischemia and myocardial infarction) in which the copper&#8208;deposition affords increased perfusion and alleviation in tissue damages. The results provide rationale that metal oxide nanomaterials can be designed in a way to induce the upregulation of specific biological factors for optimal therapeutic performance.

         <title>Highly Reversible Lithium Metal Anode Enabled by 3D Lithiophilic&#8208;Lithiophobic Dual&#8208;Skeletons</title>

Abstract
Lithium metal is a promising anode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium batteries, but its practical application is still hindered by intrinsic defects such as infinite volume expansion and uncontrollable dendrites growth. Herein, a dendrite&#8208;free 3D composite Li anode (Li&#8208;B@SSM) is prepared by mechanically rolling of lithiophilic LiB nanofibers supported Li&#8208;B composite and lithiophobic stainless&#8208;steel mesh (SSM). Featuring hierarchical lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons, the Li&#8208;B@SSM anode shows an ultra&#8208;high Coulombic efficiency of 99.95% and a long lifespan of 900 h under 2 mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2. It is demonstrated that the abnormally reversible Li stripping/plating processes should be closely related to the site&#8208;selective plating behavior and spatial confinement effect induced by the robust lithiophilic&#8208;lithiophobic dual&#8208;skeletons, which alleviates the volume changes, suppresses the growth of Li dendrites, and reduces the accumulation of &#8220;dead&#8221; Li. More importantly, the application feasibility of the Li&#8208;B@SSM anode is also confirmed in full batteries, of which the Li&#8208;B@SSM|LiFePO4 full cell shows a high capacity retention of 97.5% after 400 cycles while the Li&#8208;B@SSM|S pouch battery exhibits good cycle stability even under practically harsh conditions. This work paves the way for the facile and efficient fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency Li metal anode toward practical applications.

         <title>Multiplexed Ultrasensitive Sample&#8208;to&#8208;Answer RT&#8208;LAMP Chip for the Identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Influenza Viruses</title>

         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip operated by LED is developed to detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses simultaneously. The ultrafast target enrichment (&#8776;500&#215;) followed by autonomous elution and amplification via photothermal activation enables limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The sensitive detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings comparable to standard polymerase chain reaction allows timely management of various pandemic situations that may be faced shortly.








Abstract
Prompt on&#8208;site diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with other respiratory infections will have minimized the global impact of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic through rapid, effective management. However, no such multiplex point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) chip has satisfied a suitable sensitivity of gold&#8208;standard nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Here, a rapid multiplexed ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (MUSAL) chip operated by simple LED&#8208;driven photothermal amplification to detect six targets from single&#8208;swab sampling is presented. First, the MUSAL chip allows ultrafast on&#8208;chip sample preparation with &#8776;500&#8208;fold preconcentration at a rate of 1.2&#160;mL min&#8722;1. Second, the chip enables contamination&#8208;free amplification using autonomous target elution into on&#8208;chip reagents by photothermal activation. Finally, the chip accomplishes multiplexed on&#8208;chip diagnostics of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The rapid, ultrasensitive, cost&#8208;effective sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip with a multiplex capability will allow timely management of various pandemics situations that may be faced shortly.

         <title>Correlated Rattling of Sodium&#8208;Chains Suppressing Thermal Conduction in Thermoelectric Stannides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks encapsulating zigzag Na&#8208;chains show lower thermal conductivity with decreasing inter&#8208;Na distances. Na atoms behave as Einstein&#8208;like oscillators along the tunnel, while significant interactions exist both between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and the framework. The large anisotropic oscillations, the correlation of Na atoms in the tunnels, and their interaction with frameworks&#160;lead to low thermal conductivity.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks containing zigzag Na chains that excite correlated rattling impinging on the framework phonons are attractive as thermoelectric materials owing to their low lattice thermal conductivity. The correlated rattling of Na atoms in the zigzag chains and the origin of the low thermal conductivity is uncovered via experimental and computational analyses. The Na atoms behave as oscillators along the tunnel, resulting in substantial interactions between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and framework. In these intermetallic compounds, a shorter inter&#8208;rattler distance results in lower thermal conductivity, suggesting that phonon scattering by the correlated rattling Na&#8208;chains is enhanced. These results provide new insights into the behavior of thermoelectric materials with low thermal conductivity and suggest strategies for the development of such materials that utilize the correlated rattling.

         <title>Direct CO2 Capture by Alkali&#8208;Dissolved Cellulose and Sequestration in Building Materials and Artificial Reef Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media to lead mineralized cellulose materials at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio. Cellulose lean gels are converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites; meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration.








Abstract
Current carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies require high energy input and costly catalysts. Here, an effective pathway is offered that addresses climate action by atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Industrially relevant highly reactive alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media. The latter lead to mineralized cellulose materials (MCM) at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio, forming organic&#8208;inorganic viscous systems (viscosity from 102 to 107&#160;mPa&#160;s and storage modulus from 10 to 105&#160;Pa). CO2 absorption and conversion into calcium carbonate and associated minerals translate to maximum absorption of 6.5&#160;gCO2 gcellulose&#8722;1, tracking inversely with cellulose loading. Cellulose lean gels are easily converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites. Meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) suggests new CCU opportunities for building materials, as demonstrated in underwater deployment for coral reef ecosystem restoration.

&lt;p&gt;Alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption media to lead mineralized cellulose materials at a tailorable cellulose-to-mineral ratio. Cellulose lean gels are converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites; meanwhile, cellulose-rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone-like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies require high energy input and costly catalysts. Here, an effective pathway is offered that addresses climate action by atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration. Industrially relevant highly reactive alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption media. The latter lead to mineralized cellulose materials (MCM) at a tailorable cellulose-to-mineral ratio, forming organic-inorganic viscous systems (viscosity from 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mPa&#160;s and storage modulus from 10 to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;Pa). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption and conversion into calcium carbonate and associated minerals translate to maximum absorption of 6.5&#160;gCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; g&lt;sub&gt;cellulose&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, tracking inversely with cellulose loading. Cellulose lean gels are easily converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites. Meanwhile, cellulose-rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone-like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) suggests new CCU opportunities for building materials, as demonstrated in underwater deployment for coral reef ecosystem restoration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Controlled Distributed Ti3C2Tx Hollow Microspheres on Thermally Conductive Polyimide Composite Films for Excellent Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible multifunctional polymer&#8208;based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding composite films have important applications in the fields of 5G communication technology, wearable electronic devices, and artificial intelligence. Based on the design of a porous/multilayered structure, and using polyimide (PI) as the matrix and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microspheres as the template, flexible (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite films with controllable pore sizes and distribution of Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres are successfully prepared by sacrificial template method. Owing to the porous/multilayered structure, when the pore size of the Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres is 10&#160;&#956;m and the mass ratio of PMMA/Ti3C2Tx is 2:1, the (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite film has the most excellent EMI shielding performance, with EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of 85&#160;dB. It is further verified by finite element simulation that the composite film has an excellent shielding effect on electromagnetic waves. In addition, the composite film has good thermal conductivity (thermal conductivity coefficient of 3.49&#160;W/(m&#183;K)) and mechanical properties (tensile strength of 65.3&#160;MPa). This flexible (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite film with excellent EMI shielding performance, thermal conductivity, and mechanical properties has demonstrated great potential for applications in EMI shielding protection for high&#8208;power, portable, and wearable flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;assisted Nanozyme Design: Lessons from Materials and Engineered Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanozymes are nanomaterials that exhibit enzyme&#8208;like biomimicry. In combination with intrinsic characteristics of nanomaterials, nanozymes have broad applicability in materials science, chemical engineering, bioengineering, biochemistry, and disease theranostics. Recently, the heterogeneity of published results highlights the complexity and diversity of nanozymes in terms of consistency of catalytic capacity. Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials, yet it remains challenging to design new nanozymes based on ML approaches. Alternatively, ML has been employed to promote optimization of intelligent design and application of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes. Incorporation of the successful ML algorithms used in the intelligent design of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes can concomitantly facilitate the guided development of next&#8208;generation nanozymes with desirable properties. Here, we summarize recent progress in ML, its utilization in the design of catalytic materials and enzymes, and how emergent ML applications serve as promising strategies to circumvent challenges associated with time&#8208;expensive and laborious testing in nanozyme research and development. The potential applications of successful examples of ML&#8208;aided catalytic materials and engineered enzymes in nanozyme design are also highlighted, with special focus on the unified aims in enhancing design and recapitulation of substrate selectivity and catalytic activity.

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Monoliths of Steel with Self&#8208;Reinforcing Adaptive Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous steel structures combining ultralow weight and high mechanical efficiency are manufactured by printing, reducing, and sintering wet foams containing iron oxide precursor particles. By forming new load&#8208;bearing struts when compressed, the porous structures are able to reversibly stiffen in response to nonuniform stresses, a behavior that conceptually resembles the unique adaptive properties of human bone.








Abstract
Porous structures offer an attractive approach to reduce the amount of natural resources used while maintaining relatively high mechanical efficiency. However, for some applications the drop in mechanical properties resulting from the introduction of porosity is too high, which has limited the broader utilization of porous materials in industry. Here, it is shown that steel monoliths can be designed to display high mechanical efficiency and reversible self&#8208;reinforcing properties when made with porous architectures with up to three hierarchical levels. Ultralight steel structures that can float on water and autonomously adapt their stiffness are manufactured by the thermal reduction and sintering of 3D printed foam templates. Using distinct mechanical testing techniques, image analysis, and finite element simulations, the mechanisms leading to the high mechanical efficiency and self&#8208;stiffening ability of the hierarchical porous monoliths are studied. The design and fabrication of mechanically stable porous monoliths using iron as a widely available natural resource is expected to contribute to the future development of functional materials with a more sustainable footprint.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Locked Tandem Fluorescent Probe for Imaging of Pyroptosis in Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is presented for real&#8208;time near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. It provides a non&#8208;invasive tool to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis during cancer therapy and predict cancer therapeutic efficacy, hence capable of being applied to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of programmed cancer cell death (PCD) is imperative to monitor cancer therapeutic efficacy and tailor therapeutic regimens; however, specific in vivo detection of intratumoral pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, a dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is reported for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. The probe comprises a hemicyanine dye dual&#8208;locked with an enzyme&#8208;responsive moiety that can be tandemly cleaved by pyroptosis&#8208;related biomarker (Caspase&#8208;1) and cancer biomarker (GGT) to turn on its NIRF signal. As pyroptosis plays a vital role in triggering anti&#8208;tumor immune responses, the activated signal of DTAP correlates well with the population of tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and tumor growth inhibition, consequently permitting the prediction of cancer therapeutic efficacy. This study also provides a non&#8208;invasive technique to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis in cancer therapy and to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.

         <title>Understanding Self&#8208;Assembly of Silica&#8208;Precipitating Peptides to Control Silica Particle Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic silaffin&#8208;based peptides give rise to different template structures depending on stereochemistry and connectivity of the central residue. NMR experiments help to decipher the peptidic template structures. The resulting structure&#8211;activity relationship provides a key to rationally control the assembly of such peptides and thereby the resulting silica material as the peptidic precursor structures determine the materials final architecture.








Abstract
The most advanced materials are those found in nature. These evolutionary optimized substances provide highest efficiencies, e.g., in harvesting solar energy or providing extreme stability, and are intrinsically biocompatible. However, the mimicry of biological materials is limited to a few successful applications since there is still a lack of the tools to recreate natural materials. Herein, such means are provided based on a peptide library derived from the silaffin protein R5 that enables rational biomimetic materials design. It is now evident that biomaterials do not form via mechanisms observed in vitro. Instead, the material's function and morphology are predetermined by precursors that self&#8208;assemble in solution, often from a combination of protein and salts. These assemblies act as templates for biomaterials. The RRIL peptides used here are a small part of the silica&#8208;precipitation machinery in diatoms. By connecting RRIL motifs via varying central bi&#8208; or trifunctional residues, a library of stereoisomers is generated, which allows characterization of different template structures in the presence of phosphate ions by combining residue&#8208;resolved real&#8208;time NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

     alt="Understanding Self-Assembly of Silica-Precipitating Peptides to Control Silica Particle Morphology"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomimetic silaffin-based peptides give rise to different template structures depending on stereochemistry and connectivity of the central residue. NMR experiments help to decipher the peptidic template structures. The resulting structure&#8211;activity relationship provides a key to rationally control the assembly of such peptides and thereby the resulting silica material as the peptidic precursor structures determine the materials final architecture.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most advanced materials are those found in nature. These evolutionary optimized substances provide highest efficiencies, e.g., in harvesting solar energy or providing extreme stability, and are intrinsically biocompatible. However, the mimicry of biological materials is limited to a few successful applications since there is still a lack of the tools to recreate natural materials. Herein, such means are provided based on a peptide library derived from the silaffin protein R5 that enables rational biomimetic materials design. It is now evident that biomaterials do not form via mechanisms observed in vitro. Instead, the material's function and morphology are predetermined by precursors that self-assemble in solution, often from a combination of protein and salts. These assemblies act as templates for biomaterials. The RRIL peptides used here are a small part of the silica-precipitation machinery in diatoms. By connecting RRIL motifs via varying central bi- or trifunctional residues, a library of stereoisomers is generated, which allows characterization of different template structures in the presence of phosphate ions by combining residue-resolved real-time NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Understanding these templates in atomistic detail, the morphology of silica particles is controlled via manipulation of the template precursors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently reported new methods to induce strain are summarized and discussed, and the latest developments on the modification of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of 2D materials are updated by strain engineering (in particular properties such as the electrochemical, magnetic and superconducting characteristics, and their strain tuning have received little attention previously), and future perspectives are presented.








Abstract
Strain engineering is a promising way to tune the electrical, electrochemical, magnetic, and optical properties of 2D&#160;materials, with the potential to achieve high&#8208;performance 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices ultimately. This review discusses the experimental and theoretical results from recent advances in the strain engineering of 2D materials. Some novel methods to induce strain are summarized and then the tunable electrical and optical/optoelectronic properties of 2D materials via strain engineering are highlighted, including particularly the previously less&#8208;discussed strain tuning of superconducting, magnetic, and electrochemical properties. Also, future perspectives of strain engineering are given for its potential applications in functional devices. The state of the survey presents the ever&#8208;increasing advantages and popularity of strain engineering for tuning properties of 2D materials. Suggestions and insights for further research and applications in optical, electronic, and spintronic devices are provided.

         <title>Intracellular Glucose&#8208;Depriving Polymer Micelles for Antiglycolytic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glucose&#8208;responsive polymer is designed, considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells. The polymer exhibits micellar&#8208;structure stability during blood circulation and accumulates in tumor tissues. Specific binding between the polymer and intracellular glucose induces glucose deprivation in tumor cells. Glucose metabolism is particularly inhibited; the lack of energy in tumor cells is intensified, leading to tumor suppression.








Abstract
A new anticancer strategy to exploit abnormal metabolism of cancer cells rather than to merely control the drug release or rearrange the tumor microenvironment is reported. An antiglycolytic amphiphilic polymer, designed considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells (Warburg effect) and aimed at the regulation of glucose metabolism, is synthesized through chemical conjugation between glycol chitosan (GC) and phenylboronic acid (PBA). GC&#8208;PBA derivatives form stable micellar structures under physiological conditions and respond to changes in glucose concentration. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor site, intracellular glucose capture occurs, and the resultant energy deprivation through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis remarkably suppresses tumor growth without significant side effects in vivo. This strategy highlights the need to develop safe and effective cancer treatment without the use of conventional anticancer drugs.

         <title>3D Printing of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanofibrous Multidomain Peptide Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multidomain peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides, are used to 3D print complex, 3D structures. Multiple MDPs are demonstrated as printable, and oppositely charged MDPs are printed together into layered, porous constructs. MDPs are found to support high cell viability regardless of charge, while charge is shown to influence cellular behavior and morphology.








Abstract
3D printing has become one of the primary fabrication strategies used in biomedical research. Recent efforts have focused on the 3D printing of hydrogels to create structures that better replicate the mechanical properties of biological tissues. These pose a unique challenge, as soft materials are difficult to pattern in three dimensions with high fidelity. Currently, a small number of biologically derived polymers that form hydrogels are frequently reused for 3D printing applications. Thus, there exists a need for novel hydrogels with desirable biological properties that can be used as 3D printable inks. In this work, the printability of multidomain peptides (MDPs), a class of self&#8208;assembling peptides that form a nanofibrous hydrogel at low concentrations, is established. MDPs with different charge functionalities are optimized as distinct inks and are used to create complex 3D structures, including multi&#8208;MDP prints. Additionally, printed MDP constructs are used to demonstrate charge&#8208;dependent differences in cellular behavior in vitro. This work presents the first time that self&#8208;assembling peptides have been used to print layered structures with overhangs and internal porosity. Overall, MDPs are a promising new class of 3D printable inks that are uniquely peptide&#8208;based and rely solely on supramolecular mechanisms for assembly.

         <title>Picoperovskites: The Smallest Conceivable Isolated Halide Perovskite Structures Formed within Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 form &#8220;picoperovskites&#8221; in 1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm&#8208;diameter single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with cross&#8208;sectional unit&#8208;cell or sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell dimensions. The smallest of these are bilayer inorganic polymers retaining ABX3 stoichiometry while intermediate&#8208;scale Cs3PbBr3 preserves Pb2+ by forming ordered vacancies. The largest Cs4Sn4Ix form alternates Cs4 and Sn4Ix layers along the nanotube cavities.








Abstract
Halide perovskite structures are revolutionizing the design of optoelectronic materials, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and photovoltaics when formed at the quantum scale. Four isolated sub&#8208;nanometer, or picoscale, halide perovskite structures formed inside &#8776;1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by melt insertion from CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 are reported. Three directly relate to the ABX3 perovskite archetype while a fourth is a perovskite&#8208;like lamellar structure with alternating Cs4 and polyhedral Sn4Ix layers. In &#8776;1.4&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 forms Cs3PbIIBr5 nanowires, one ABX3 unit cell in cross section with the Pb2+ oxidation state maintained by ordered Cs+ vacancies. Within &#8776;1.2&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 and CsSnI3 form inorganic&#8208;polymer&#8208;like bilayer structures, one&#8208;fourth of an ABX3 unit cell in cross section with systematically reproduced ABX3 stoichiometry. Producing these smallest halide perovskite structures at their absolute synthetic cross&#8208;sectional limit enables quantum confinement effects with first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrating bandgap widening compared to corresponding bulk structural forms.

         <title>Upcycling of Waste Plastic into Hybrid Carbon Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Graphitic one&#8208;dimensional (1D) and hybrid nanomaterials represent a powerful solution in composite and electronic applications due to exceptional properties, but large&#8208;scale synthesis of hybrid materials has yet to be realized. Here, we report a rapid, scalable method to produce graphitic 1D materials from polymers using flash Joule heating (FJH). This avoids lengthy chemical vapor deposition and uses no solvent or water. The flash 1D materials (F1DM), synthesized using a variety of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, have controllable diameters and morphologies by parameter tuning. Furthermore, the process can be modified to form hybrid materials, with F1DM bonded to turbostratic graphene. In nanocomposites, F1DM outperform commercially available carbon nanotubes. Compared to current 1D material synthetic strategies using life cycle assessment, FJH synthesis represents an 86&#8211;92% decrease in cumulative energy demand and 92&#8211;94% decrease in global warming potential. Our work suggests that FJH affords a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable route to upcycle waste plastic into valuable 1D and hybrid nanomaterials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphitic one-dimensional (1D) and hybrid nanomaterials represent a powerful solution in composite and electronic applications due to exceptional properties, but large-scale synthesis of hybrid materials has yet to be realized. Here, we report a rapid, scalable method to produce graphitic 1D materials from polymers using flash Joule heating (FJH). This avoids lengthy chemical vapor deposition and uses no solvent or water. The flash 1D materials (F1DM), synthesized using a variety of earth-abundant catalysts, have controllable diameters and morphologies by parameter tuning. Furthermore, the process can be modified to form hybrid materials, with F1DM bonded to turbostratic graphene. In nanocomposites, F1DM outperform commercially available carbon nanotubes. Compared to current 1D material synthetic strategies using life cycle assessment, FJH synthesis represents an 86&#8211;92% decrease in cumulative energy demand and 92&#8211;94% decrease in global warming potential. Our work suggests that FJH affords a cost-effective and sustainable route to upcycle waste plastic into valuable 1D and hybrid nanomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Graph Analysis with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristive Crossbar Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graph analysis based on the desired sneak current is performed using a self&#8208;rectifying memristor and a &#8220;metal cell at diagonalcrossbar array (mCBA)&#8221; structure. mCBA effectively extracts hidden information from complex networks without preprocessing and loss of information. Three graph algorithms (pathfinding, link prediction, community detection) and brain network&#8208;based attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder classification are performed effectively based on the mCBA.








Abstract
Many big data have interconnected and dynamic graph structures growing over time. Analyzing these graphical data requires the hidden relationship between the nodes in the graphs to be identified, which has conventionally been achieved by finding the effective similarity. However, graphs are generally non&#8208;Euclidean, which does not allow finding it. In this study, the non&#8208;Euclidean graphs are mapped to a specific crossbar array (CBA) composed of self&#8208;rectifying memristors and metal cells at the diagonal positions. The sneak current, an intrinsic physical property in the CBA, allows for the identification of the similarity function. The sneak&#8208;current&#8208;based similarity function indicates the distance between the nodes, which can be used to predict the probability that unconnected nodes will be connected in the future, connectivity between communities, and neural connections in a brain. When all bit lines of the CBA are connected to the ground, the sneak current is suppressed, and the CBA can be used to search for adjacent nodes. This work demonstrates the physical calculation methods applied to various graphical problems&#160;using the CBA composed of the self&#8208;rectifying memristor based on the HfO2 switching layer. Moreover, such applications suffer less from the memristors&#8217; inherent issues related to their stochastic nature.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Water Harvesting and Concurrent Carbon Capture: A Review for Hygroscopic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As water scarcity becomes a pending global issue, hygroscopic materials prove a significant solution. Thus, there is a good cause following the structure&#8208;performance relationship to review the recent development of hygroscopic materials&#160;and provide inspirational insight of&#160;creative materials. Herein, traditional hygroscopic materials, crystalline frameworks,&#160;polymers, and composite materials are reviewed. The similarity in working conditions of water harvesting and carbon capture makes the simultaneous addressing of the water shortage and reduction of greenhouse effects possible. The concurrent water harvesting and carbon capture is&#160;likely to become a future challenge. Therefore, an emphasis is laid on MOFs for the excellent performance in water and CO2&#160;adsorption, and representative role of micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;porous materials. The water adsorption mechanisms of MOFs are summarized, followed by a review of MOF's water stabilit, with a highlight on the emerging machine learning (ML) technique to predict MOF water stability and water uptake. Recent advances in the mechanistic elaboration of moisture's effects on CO2&#160;adsorption are reviewed.&#160;This review summarizes recent advances in water harvesting porous materials with special attention on MOFs and expects to direct researchers&#8217; attention into the topic of concurrent water harvesting and carbon capture as a future challenge.

         <title>Compressible Polymer Composites with Enhanced Dielectric Temperature Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constants polymer composites have broad application prospects in flexible electronics and electrostatic energy storage capacitors. Substantial enhancement in dielectric constants (&#949;r) of polymer composites so far can only be obtained at high loading of nanofillers, resulting in high dielectric loss and high elastic modulus of polymer composites. Addressing the polarization shielding and the consequent polarization discontinuity at polymer/filler interfaces has been a long&#8208;standing challenge to achieve flexible polymer composite with high &#949;r. Herein, we propose and demonstrate a polymer composite with interconnected BaTiO3 (BT) ceramic scaffold exhibiting a high &#949;r &#8764; 210 at low BT volume fraction of &#8764; 18&#160;vol.%, approaching the upper limit predicted by the parallel model. By incorporating relaxor Ba(ZrxTi1&#8208;x)O3 phase in BT scaffold, we further achieved excellent dielectric temperature stability with &#916;&#949;r below &#177;10% within broad temperature range (25&#8208;140&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the dielectric performances remain stable under compressive strain up to 80%. This work provides a facile approach to construct large&#8208;scale polymer composites with robust dielectric performance against changes in thermal and mechanical condition, which are promising for high&#8208;temperature applications in flexible electronics.

         <title>Surface Energy Regulated Growth of &#945;&#8208;phase Cs0.03FA0.97PbI3 for Highly Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Methylammonium (MA) free formamidine (FA) dominated CsxFA(1&#8208;x)PbI3 is rising as the most promising candidate for highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. However, the growth of high quality CsxFA(1&#8208;x)PbI3 black phase perovskite structure without ion doping in lattice remains to be a challenge. Herein, we synthesized a propeller&#8208;shaped halogenated tertiary ammonium showing high binding energy on perovskite surface and large steric hindrance. This molecule can significantly reduce the barrier of high surface energy that suppress the growth of &#945;&#8208;phase CsxFA(1&#8208;x)PbI3 structure. As a result, &#945;&#8208;phase structure can be formed at room temperature, which can further act as seed for the growth of high&#8208;quality film. Solar cells based on the film show a record efficiency up to 23.6% for MA free CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 solar cells with inverted structure, and excellent stability at 85&#176;C over 200 hours.

         <title>Origin of the Anomalous Electrical Transport Behavior in Fe Intercalated Weyl Semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2 has recently attracted much attention due to its intriguing electronic properties and potential applications in spintronic. Here, Fe intercalated Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 single crystals (0 &lt;x &lt; 0.15 ) are grown successfully. The electrical and thermoelectric transport results consistently demonstrate that the phase transition temperature TS is gradually suppressed with increasing x. Theoretical calculation suggests that the increased energy of Td phase, enhanced transition barrier and more occupied bands in 1T&#8242; phase are responsible for the suppression in TS. In addition, a &#961;&#8733; &#8208;ln T behavior induced by Kondo effect is observed with x &#10878; 0.08, due to the coupling between conduction carriers and the local magnetic moments of intercalated Fe atoms. For Td&#8208;Fe0.15MoTe2, a spin&#8208;glass transition occurs at about 10K. The calculated band structure of Td&#8208;Fe0.25MoTe2 shows that two flat bands exist near the Fermi level, which are mainly contributed by the dyz and dx2&#8722;y2$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals of Fe atoms. Finally, the electronic phase diagram of Td&#8208;FexMoTe2 has been established for the first time. Our&#160;work provides a new route to control the structural instability and explore exotic electronic states for transition&#8208;metal&#160;dichalcogenides.

&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;. In addition, a &#961;&#8733; -ln &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; behavior induced by Kondo effect is observed with &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &#10878; 0.08, due to the coupling between conduction carriers and the local magnetic moments of intercalated Fe atoms. For &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a spin-glass transition occurs at about 10K. The calculated band structure of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows that two flat bands exist near the Fermi level, which are mainly contributed by the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;yz&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; and dx2&#8722;y2$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals of Fe atoms. Finally, the electronic phase diagram of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been established for the first time. Our&#160;work provides a new route to control the structural instability and explore exotic electronic states for transition-metal&#160;dichalcogenides.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Glycerol Conversion over a Mie Scattering Effect&#8208;Enhanced Porous BiVO4 Photoanode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) oxidation of glycerol (GLY) to high value&#8208;added dihydroxyacetone (DHA) can be achieved over the BiVO4 photoanode, while the PEC performance of most BiVO4 photoanodes is impeded due to the upper limits of the photocurrent density. In this work, an enhanced Mie scattering effect of a well&#8208;documented porous BiVO4 photoanode is obtained with less effort by a simple annealing process, which significantly reduces the reflectivity to near zero. The great light absorbability increases the basic photocurrent density by 1.77 times. The selective oxidation of GLY over the BiVO4 photoanode results in a photocurrent density of 6.04 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 and a DHA production rate of 325.2 mmol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1 that exceeds all reported values. This work addresses the poor ability of nanostructured BiVO4 to harvest light, paving the way for further improvements in charge transport and transfer to realize highly efficient PEC conversion.

         <title>A General Strategy to Remove Metal Aggregates toward Metal&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon Catalysts with Exclusive Atomic Dispersion</title>

Abstract
Metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped nanocarbons (M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs) are promising alternatives to precious metals for catalyzing electrochemical energy conversion processes. However, M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs synthesized by high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis frequently suffer from compositional heterogeneity with the simultaneous presence of atomically dispersed M&#8208;Nx sites and crystalline metal nanoparticles (NPs), which hinders the identification of active sites and rational optimization in performance. Herein, we report a universal and efficient strategy to obtain both precious and non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based M&#8208;N&#8208;Cs (M = Pt, Fe, Co, Ni, Mn, Cu, Zn) with exclusive atomic dispersion by making use of ammonium iodide as the etchant to remove excessive metal aggregates at high temperature. Taking Pt&#8208;N&#8208;C as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, the complete removal of Pt NPs in Pt&#8208;N&#8208;C enables the clarification on the contributions of the atomic Pt&#8208;Nx moieties and Pt NPs to the catalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction. Combined electrochemical measurements and theoretical calculations identify that the atomic Pt&#8208;Nx moieties by themselves possess negligible activity, but they could significantly boost the activity of the Pt NPs via the synergistic effect.

         <title>Exsolution Modeling and Control to Improve the Catalytic Activity of Nanostructured Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In situ exsolution for nanoscale electrode design has attracted considerable attention because of its promising activity and high stability. However, fundamental research on the mechanisms underlying particle growth remains insufficient. Herein, cation diffusion&#8208;determined exsolution is presented using an analytical model based on classical nucleation and diffusion. In the designed perovskite system, the exsolution trend for particle growth is consistent with our diffusion model, which strongly depends on the initial cation concentration and reduction conditions. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, a highly Ni&#8208;doped anode and an electrochemical switching technique are employed to promote exsolution and overcome growth limitations. The optimal cell exhibits an outstanding maximum power density of 1.7&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 900&#176;C and shows no evident degradation when operating at 800&#176;C for 240&#160;h under wet H2. This study provides crucial insights into the developing and tuning of heterogeneous catalysts for energy&#8208;conversion applications.

         <title>Encapsulating High&#8208;Temperature Superconducting Twisted van der Waals Heterostructures Blocks Detrimental Effects of Disorder</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;temperature cuprate superconductors (HTS)&#8208;based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures hold high technological promise. One of the obstacles hindering the progress is the detrimental effect of disorder on the properties of the vdW devices&#8208;based Josephson junctions (JJ). Here we&#160;report the new method of fabricating twisted vdW heterostructures made of Bi2Sr2CuCa2O8 + &#948;&#160;, crucially improving the JJ characteristics and pushing them up to those of the intrinsic JJs in bulk samples. The method combines cryogenic stacking using a solvent&#8208;free stencil mask technique and covering the interface by insulating hexagonal boron nitride crystals. Despite the high&#8208;vacuum condition down to 10&#8722;6mbar in the evaporation chamber, the interface appears to be protected from water molecules during the in&#8208;situ metal deposition only when fully encapsulated. Comparing the current&#8208;voltage curves of encapsulated and unencapsulated interfaces, we&#160;reveal that the encapsulated interfaces' characteristics are crucially improved so that the corresponding JJs demonstrate high critical currents and sharpness of the superconducting transition comparable to those of the intrinsic JJs. Finally, we&#160;show that the encapsulated heterostructures are more stable over&#160;time.

         <title>Unlock Restricted Capacity via O&#8208;Ce Hybridization for Li&#8208;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The aprotic Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) has the highest theoretical energy density of any rechargeable batteries. However, such system has been largely restricted by the electrochemically formed lithium peroxide (Li2O2) on the cathode surface, leading ultimately to low actual capacities and early cell death. In contrast to the surface&#8208;mediated growth of thin&#8208;film with thickness less than 50&#160;nm, a non&#8208;crystalline Li2O2 film with thickness of more than 400&#160;nm can be formed via an optimal O&#8208;Ce hybridized electronic structure. Specially, oxygen can react with dissolved cerium cations in the electrolyte via a cerium&#8208;oxygen reaction to form a high&#8208;energy faceted cerium oxide catalyst, which not only generates a great number of non&#8208;saturable active sites, but also erects electron transport bridges between the lattice O and adjacent Ce atoms. Such Ce&#8208;O orbital coupling also forms a direct charge transfer channel from Ce&#8208;4f of CeO2 to O22&#8722;${\rm{O}}_2^{2 - }$&#8208;&#960;* of Li2O2, eventually leading to submicron&#8208;thick Li2O2 shells via a subsequent lithium&#8208;oxygen reaction. Relying on the above merits, this work unlocks the rechargeable capacities of LOB from restricted 1000 to unprecedented 10&#8239;000 mAh g&#8722;1 with good cyclabilities and reduced charge&#8208;discharge overpotentials.

         <title>An Active Pixel&#8208;matrix Electrocaloric Device for Targeted and Differential Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
More than 55% of electronic failures are caused by damage from localized overheating. Up to now, there is still no efficient method for targeted temperature control against localized overheating. Although some existing thermal management devices handle this issue by full coverage cooling, it generates a lot of useless energy consumption. Here, we report a highly efficient pixel&#8208;matrix electrocaloric (EC) cooling device, which can realize a targeted and differential thermal management. The modified P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE) reaches a large adiabatic temperature change of 7.8 K and is more suitable for thermal transfer and electrostatic actuation at high frequencies. All active pixels in the EC cooling device exhibit a stable temperature span of 4.6 K and a heat flux of 62&#160;mW/cm2, which is more than twice that of the one&#8208;layer EC device. Each refrigeration pixel can be independently controlled and effectively cool down the localized overheating site(s) in situ. The surface temperature of the simulated CPU decreased by 33.2 K at 120 s after applying this EC device. Such a compact, embeddable, low cost and active solid&#8208;state pixel&#8208;matrix cooling device have a great potential for localized overheating protection in microelectronics.

         <title>Manipulating Polymer Backbone Configuration Via Halogenated Asymmetric End&#8208;Group Enables Over 18% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) deeply rely on the joint contributions of desirable optical absorption, adaptive energy level and appropriate morphology. Herein, two structural analogous polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs), PYFCl&#8208;T and PYF&amp;PYCl&#8208;T, were synthesized, and then incorporated into the PM6:PY&#8208;IT binary blends to construct ternary all&#8208;PSCs. Due to the superior compatibility of PY&#8208;IT and PYFCl&#8208;T, the ternary all&#8208;PSC based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT:PYFCl&#8208;T with 10 wt% PYFCl&#8208;T, presented higher and more balanced charge mobilities, suppressed charge recombination, and faster charge transfer kinetics, resulting in an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.12% with the enhanced Jsc and FF, which is much higher than that (PCE of 16.09%) of the binary all&#8208;PSCs based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT. Besides, the ternary all&#8208;PSCs also exhibited improved photostability. The conspicuous performance enhancement principally should give the credit to the miscibility&#8208;driven phase optimization of the donor and acceptor. These findings highlight the significance of polymer backbone configuration modulation of PSMAs in morphology optimization toward boosting the device properties of all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Simultaneous Oxidative Cleavage of Lignin and Reduction of Furfural via Efficient Electrocatalysis by P&#8208;doped CoMoO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical oxidative lignin cleavage and coupled 2&#8208;furaldehyde reduction provide a promising approach for producing high&#8208;value added products. However, developing efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts with noble metal&#8208;like activity still remains a challenge. Here, we report an efficient electrochemical strategy for the selective oxidative cleavage of C&#945;&#8208;C&#946; bonds in lignin into aromatic monomers by tailoring the electronic structure through P&#8208;doped CoMoO4 spinels (99% conversion, highest monomer selectivity of 56%). Additionally, the conversion and selectivity of 2&#8208;furaldehyde reduction to 2&#8208;methyl furan reached 87% and 73%, respectively. The in situ Fourier transform infrared and density functional theory analysis revealed that an upward shift of the Ed upon P&#8208;doping led to an increase in the antibonding level, which facilitated the C&#945;&#8208;C&#946; adsorption of the lignin model compounds, thereby enhancing the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the active site. This work explored the potential of a spinel as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxidative cracking of lignin and the reductive conversion of small organic molecules to high&#8208;value added chemicals via P anion modulation.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Transient Self&#8208;organization of TiNx Nano&#8208;Filament Percolated Networks for High Performance Surface&#8208;Mountable Filter Capacitors</title>

Abstract
Filter capacitors (FCs) are substantial for digital circuits and microelectronic devices, and thus more compact FCs are eternally demanded for system miniaturization. Even though microsupercapacitors are broadly regarded as an excellent candidate for the future FCs, yet due to the limitation of available electrode materials, the capacitive performance of reported MSCs drops sharply under high&#8208;frequency alternating current. Herein, we present a unique laser induced transient self&#8208;organization strategy, which synergizes pulsed laser energy and multi&#8208;physical field controlled coalescence processes, leading to the rapid and controllable preparation of titanium nitride ultrafine nano&#8208;filaments (diameter approximately 3&#8211;5 nm) networks. Their chaotic fractal nanoporous structure, superior specific surface area and excellent conductivity render these nanostructures promising candidates for FCs. Surface&#8208;mounted filter capacitors based on this electrode material exhibit ultra&#8208;long cycle&#8208;life (2,000,000 cycles) with record ultrahigh volumetric energy density of 9.17 mWh cm&#8211;3 at 120 Hz in aqueous electrolyte, displaying advantages in function, size and integratability compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aluminum electrolytic capacitors. The method here provides a versatile toolbox for designing novel nanostructures with intriguing characteristics and insights for developing advanced and miniaturized filter and power devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Gain of NdIII Complex Doped Optical Waveguide Amplifiers at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#956;m Wavelengths Based on Intramolecular Energy Transfer Mechanism</title>

Abstract
Chelate phosphine oxide ligand (9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;xanthene&#8208;4,5&#8208;diyl) bis (diphenylphosphineoxide) (XPO) is prepared as a neutral ligand to synthesize complex Nd (TTA)3 (XPO) (TTA = 2&#8208;thenoyltrifluoroacetone). An appropriate energy gap between the XPO and TTA ligands, which can support two additional energy transfer routines from the first excited triplet state (T1) energy level of the XPO to that of the TTA, improves energy transfer in the Nd complex. Based on intramolecular energy transfer mechanism, optical gains at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#956;m are demonstrated in Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped polymer waveguides with the excitation of low&#8208;power light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) instead of semiconductor lasers as pump sources. Using the vertical top&#8208;pumping mode of a 365&#160;nm LED, relative gains of 22.5 and 8.4&#160;dB cm&#8722;1 are obtained at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#956;m, respectively, in a 0.2&#8208;cm long embedded waveguide with a cross&#8208;section of 8 &#215; 5 &#956;m2. The active core layer is Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped SU&#8208;8 polymer. Moreover, relative gains are achieved in evanescent&#8208;field waveguide with a cross&#8208;section of 6 &#215; 4 &#956;m2. The 21.0 and 5.6&#160;dB cm&#8722;1 relative gains are achieved at 1.06 and 1.31&#160;&#956;m, respectively, with a net gain of 13.8 &#177; 0.3&#160;dB cm&#8722;1 obtained at 1.06&#160;&#956;m in a 0.9&#8208;cm long SU&#8208;8 waveguide with Nd (TTA)3 (XPO)&#8208;doped polymethylmethacrylate as upper cladding.

Abstract
Conventional bulky and rigid planar architecting power systems are difficult to satisfy the growing demand for wearable applications. One&#8208;dimensional fiber batteries bearing appealing features of miniaturization, adaptability, and weavability, represent a promising solution, yet challenges remain pertaining to energy density and scalability. Herein, an ingenious densifiable functional ink is invented to fabricate scalable, flexible, and high mass loading fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) by adopting a fast ink&#8208;extrusion technology. In the formulated ink, pyrrole&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide (py&#8208;rGO) is elaborately introduced and exerts multiple influences: not only assembles carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) to compose a sturdy, conductive and agglomeration&#8208;free three&#8208;dimensional network that realizes an ultra&#8208;high content (75 wt%) of the active materials and endows the electrode excellent flexibility, but serves as a capillary densification inducer, encouraging an extremely large linear mass loading (1.01&#160;mg cm&#8722;1 per fiber) and packing density (782.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;3). As a result, the assembled fiber LIBs deliver an impressive linear and volumetric energy densities with superb mechanical compliance, demonstrating the best performance among all the reported extruded fiber batteries. This work highlights a highly effective and facile approach to fabricate high&#8208;performance fiber energy storage devices for future practical wearable applications.

&lt;p&gt;Conventional bulky and rigid planar architecting power systems are difficult to satisfy the growing demand for wearable applications. One-dimensional fiber batteries bearing appealing features of miniaturization, adaptability, and weavability, represent a promising solution, yet challenges remain pertaining to energy density and scalability. Herein, an ingenious densifiable functional ink is invented to fabricate scalable, flexible, and high mass loading fiber lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) by adopting a fast ink-extrusion technology. In the formulated ink, pyrrole-modified reduced graphene oxide (py-rGO) is elaborately introduced and exerts multiple influences: not only assembles carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) to compose a sturdy, conductive and agglomeration-free three-dimensional network that realizes an ultra-high content (75 wt%) of the active materials and endows the electrode excellent flexibility, but serves as a capillary densification inducer, encouraging an extremely large linear mass loading (1.01&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; per fiber) and packing density (782.1&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Flattening Grain&#8208;Boundary Grooves for Perovskite Solar Cells with High Opto&#8208;Mechanical Reliability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Opto&#8208;mechanical reliability has emerged as an important criterion for evaluating the performance and commercialization potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to the mechanical&#8208;property mismatch of metal halide perovskites with other device layers. In this work, grain&#8208;boundary groove, a rarely discussed film microstructural characteristics, is found to impart significant effects on the opto&#8208;mechanical reliability of perovskite&#8208;substrate heterointerfaces and thus PSC performance. By pre&#8208;burying iso&#8208;butylammonium chloride additive in the electron&#8208;transport layer, we flattened GB grooves and created an opto&#8208;mechanically reliable perovskite heterointerface that resists the photothermal fatigue. The improved mechanical integrity of ETL&#8208;perovskite heterointerfaces also benefits the charge transport and chemical stability by facilitating the carrier injection and reducing the moisture or solvent trapping, respectively. Accordingly, we achieved high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells which exhibit efficiency retentions of 94.8% under 440 h damp heat test (85% RH and 85 &#176;C), and 93.0% under 2000 h continuous light soaking.

In this work, grain-boundary groove, a rarely discussed film microstructural characteristics, is found to impart significant effects on the opto-mechanical reliability of perovskite-substrate heterointerfaces and thus PSC performance. By pre-burying iso-butylammonium chloride additive in the electron-transport layer, we flattened GB grooves and created an opto-mechanically reliable perovskite heterointerface that resists the photothermal fatigue.

         <title>Spacer&#8208;engineered Ionic Channels in Covalent Organic Framework Membrane toward Ultrafast Proton Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Side chain engineering of covalent organic frameworks as advanced ion conductors is a critical issue to be explored. Herein, ionic covalent organic framework membranes (iCOFMs) with spacer&#8208;engineered ionic channel were de novo designed and prepared. The ionic channels were decorated with side chains comprising of spacers having different carbon chain lengths and the &#8208;SO3H groups at the end. Attributed to the synergistic contribution from the spacers and the &#8208;SO3H groups, the iCOFM with moderate&#8208;length spacer exhibited the highest through&#8208;plane proton conductivity of 889 mS cm&#8722;1 at 90&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Dynamically Tunable Optical Cavities with Embedded Nematic Liquid Crystalline Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tunable metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;metal (MIM) Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot cavities that can dynamically control light enable novel sensing, imaging, and display applications. However, the realization of dynamic cavities incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive materials pose a significant engineering challenge. Current approaches rely on refractive index modulation and suffer from low dynamic tunability, high losses, limited spectral ranges and require liquid and hazardous materials for operation. To overcome these challenges, a new tuning mechanism employing reversible mechanical adaptations of a polymer network is proposed and dynamic tuning of optical resonances is demonstrated. Solid&#8208;state temperature&#8208;responsive optical coatings are developed by preparing a monodomain nematic liquid crystalline network (LCN) and are incorporated between metallic mirrors to form active optical microcavities. LCN microcavities offer large, reversible and highly linear spectral tuning of Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonances reaching wavelength&#8208;shifts up to 40&#160;nm via thermo&#8208;mechanical actuation while featuring outstanding repeatability and precision over more than 100 heating&#8208;cooling cycles. This degree of tunability allows for reversible switching between the reflective and the absorbing states of the device over the entire visible and near&#8208;infrared spectral regions, reaching large changes in reflectance with modulation efficiency &#916;R = 79%.

         <title>Optically Tunable Transient Plasmons in InSb Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optical carrier incubation can effectively alter the electron transport properties of semiconductors; thus, optical switching of the plasmonic response of the semiconductor enables the ultrafast manipulation of the light at the nanoscale. Semiconductor nanostructures are promising platforms in on&#8208;chip high&#8208;speed plasmonic devices, owing to their high photoinduced electron injection efficiency at sub&#8208;picosecond and compatibility with contemporary semiconductor technologies. The pure single&#8208;crystalline InSb nanowires are promising plasmonic materials in the mid&#8208;infrared region due to their high electron mobility and small electron effective mass. Here, we utilize the pump&#8208;probe nanoscopy to investigate the pump fluence dependency and the dynamics of the non&#8208;equilibrium plasmons in the InSb nanowires. We successfully switch the InSb plasmon by injecting the photo&#8208;induced electrons and show the practical tuning of the plasmon frequency to one octave by increasing the pump fluence from 0 to 90 &#956;J/cm2. The density of the photo&#8208;induced electrons in InSb nanowires is 18.8&#215;1018 cm&#8722;3 with pump fluence as low as 90 &#956;J/cm2. The high electron mobility of the InSb supports the low&#8208;loss plasmon with a damping rate of about 200 cm&#8722;1. The InSb nanowires' excellent plasmonic properties ensure they are a promising platform for upcoming high&#8208;speed mid&#8208;infrared plasmonic materials for informatic devices.

         <title>Synergistic Surface Modification of Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic surface modification of mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films by the combination of piperazine and C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid realizes narrow&#8208;bandgap solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 22.7% and substantially elongated stability.








Abstract
Interfaces in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics play a pivotal role in determining device efficiency and longevity. In this work, the top surface treatment of mixed tin&#8211;lead (&#8776;1.26&#160;eV) halide perovskite films for p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells is studied. Charge extraction is promoted by treating the perovskite surface with piperazine. This compound reacts with the organic cations at the perovskite surface, modifying the surface structure and tuning the interfacial energy level alignment. In addition, the combined treatment with C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid (CPTA) reduces hysteresis and leads to efficiencies up to 22.7%, with open&#8208;circuit voltage values reaching 0.90&#160;V, &#8776;92% of the radiative limit for the bandgap of this material. The modified cells also show superior stability, with unencapsulated cells retaining 96% of their initial efficiency after &gt;2000 h of storage in N2 and encapsulated cells retaining 90% efficiency after &gt;450 h of storage in air. Intriguingly, CPTA preferentially binds to Sn2+ sites at film surface over Pb2+ due to the energetically favored exposure of the former, according to first&#8208;principles calculations. This work provides new insights into the surface chemistry of perovskite films in terms of their structural, electronic, and defect characteristics and this knowledge is used to fabricate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

In this work, the top surface treatment of mixed tin&#8211;lead (&#8776;1.26&#160;eV) halide perovskite films for p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells is studied. Charge extraction is promoted by treating the perovskite surface with piperazine. This compound reacts with the organic cations at the perovskite surface, modifying the surface structure and tuning the interfacial energy level alignment. In addition, the combined treatment with C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; pyrrolidine tris-acid (CPTA) reduces hysteresis and leads to efficiencies up to 22.7%, with open-circuit voltage values reaching 0.90&#160;V, &#8776;92% of the radiative limit for the bandgap of this material. The modified cells also show superior stability, with unencapsulated cells retaining 96% of their initial efficiency after &amp;gt;2000 h of storage in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and encapsulated cells retaining 90% efficiency after &amp;gt;450 h of storage in air. Intriguingly, CPTA preferentially binds to Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sites at film surface over Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; due to the energetically favored exposure of the former, according to first-principles calculations. This work provides new insights into the surface chemistry of perovskite films in terms of their structural, electronic, and defect characteristics and this knowledge is used to fabricate state-of-the-art solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Terahertz Nonlinear Hall Rectifiers Based on Spin&#8208;Polarized Topological Electronic States in&#160;1T&#8208;CoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second&#8208;order nonlinear Hall effect response for high&#8208;efficiency terahertz rectification, is observed in the spin&#8208;polarized 1T&#8208;CoTe2, led by the zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#160;extrinsic contribution of topological electronic states. The Hall&#8208;rectifier, without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, shows up room&#8208;temperature responsivity of over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2, opening up device implementation based on quantum&#8208;wavefunction engineering.








Abstract
The zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) refers to the second&#8208;order transverse current induced by an applied alternating electric field; it indicates the topological properties of inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking crystals. Despite several studies on the NLHE induced by the Berry&#8208;curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals, the direct current conversion by rectification is limited to very low driving frequencies and cryogenic temperatures. The nonlinear photoresponse generated by the NLHE at room temperature can be useful for numerous applications in communication, sensing, and photodetection across a high bandwidth. In this study, observations of the second&#8208;order NLHE in type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal CoTe2 under time&#8208;reversal symmetry are reported. This is determined by the disorder&#8208;induced extrinsic contribution on the broken&#8208;inversion&#8208;symmetry surface and room&#8208;temperature terahertz rectification without the need for semiconductor junctions or bias voltage. It is shown that remarkable photoresponsivity over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, a response time of approximately 710&#160;ns, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 can be achieved at room temperature. The results open a new pathway for low&#8208;energy photon harvesting via nonlinear rectification induced by the NLHE in strongly spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled and inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking systems, promising a considerable impact in the field of infrared/terahertz photonics.

         <title>In Situ Absorption Characterization Guided Slot&#8208;Die&#8208;Coated High&#8208;Performance Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ absorption measurement is used to investigate the aggregation behavior of acceptors during slot&#8208;die&#8208;coating. The 1 cm2 flexible device can reach a power conversion efficiency of 13.70%, with excellent shelf stability and upscaling ability. The connected modules (180 cm2) can effectively power a smartphone, showing great potential for future applications.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large&#8208;area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin&#8208;coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx&#8208;1 and Qx&#8208;2, show quite different film&#8208;formation kinetics in the slot&#8208;die coating process. In situ absorption spectroscopy indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx&#8208;2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx&#8208;1&#8208;based 1&#160;cm2 flexible device exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx&#8208;2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%. Moreover, the 30 cm2 modules based on PM6:Qx&#8208;1, containing six 5 cm2 sub&#8208;cells, exhibit a PCE of 12.20%. After being stored in a glove box for over 6000&#160;h, the PCE remains at 103% of its initial values, indicating excellent shelf stability. Therefore, these results show a promising future strategy for the upscaling fabrication of flexible large&#8208;area OSCs.

         <title>Modular Approach to Creating Functionalized Surface Arrays of Molecular Qubits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to create 2D arrays of molecular spin qubits is reported. The quantum properties are retained and the quantum coherence times are improved compared to bulk conditions.








Abstract
The quest for developing quantum technologies is driven by the promise of exponentially faster computations, ultrahigh performance sensing, and achieving thorough understanding of many&#8208;particle quantum systems. Molecular spins are excellent qubit candidates because they feature long coherence times, are widely tunable through chemical synthesis, and can be interfaced with other quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits. A present challenge for molecular spin qubits is their integration in quantum devices, which requires arranging them in thin films or monolayers on surfaces. However, clear proof of the survival of quantum properties of molecular qubits on surfaces has not been reported so far. Furthermore, little is known about the change in spin dynamics of molecular qubits going from the bulk to monolayers. Here, a versatile bottom&#8208;up method is reported to arrange molecular qubits as functional groups of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on surfaces, combining molecular self&#8208;organization and click chemistry. Coherence times of up to 13 &#181;s demonstrate that qubit properties are maintained or even enhanced in the monolayer.

         <title>Rational Design of Platinum&#8211;Bismuth Sulfide Schottky Heterostructure for Sonocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is first proposed. The synthesized platinum&#8211;bismuth sulfide&#160;nanoparticles exhibit ultrasound&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen production, glutathione oxidation, relieve hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, and effectively kill cancer cells by inhibiting cancer cell energy metabolism, increasing intratumoral reactive oxygen species levels, and inducing DNA damage.








Abstract
Conventional sonodynamic therapy is unavoidably limited by the tumor microenvironment, although many sonosensitizers have been developed to improve them to a certain extent. Given this, a concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is proposed, which is defined as an oxygen&#8208;independent therapeutics. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, the narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) is selected as the sonocatalyst and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are grown in situ to optimize their catalytic performance. In this nanocatalytic system, the Pt nanoparticles help to capture sonoexcited electrons, whereas intratumoral overexpressed glutathione (GSH), as a natural hole sacrificial agent, can consume sonoexcited holes, which greatly improves the charge&#8208;separation efficiency and promotes controllable and sustainable H2&#160;generation. Even under hypoxic conditions, the Pt&#8208;Bi2S3&#160;nanoparticles can also produce sufficient H2&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2&#160;and intratumoral redox homeostasis destruction by GSH depletion synergistically damage DNA to induce tumor cells apoptosis. At the same time, the Pt nanoparticles and holes can also trigger the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into O2&#160;to relieve tumor hypoxia,&#160;thus&#160;being synergistic with GSH depletion to reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The proposed sonocatalysis&#8208;mediated therapy will provide a new direction to realize facile and efficient cancer therapy.

Abstract
Organic inorganic hybrid perovskites have exhibited outstanding performances in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the complex solution chemistry of perovskites precursors renders it difficult to prepare large&#8208;area devices in a reproducible way, which is a prerequisite for the technology to make an impact beyond lab scale. Vacuum processing, instead, is an established technology for large&#8208;scale coating of thin films. However, with respect to the hybrid perovskites it is highly challenging due to the high vapor pressure of the organic ammonium halide. In this work, we combine vacuum evaporation of lead iodide and solution processing of organic ammonium halide to produce large&#8208;area homogeneous perovskite films with large grains in a highly reproducible way. The resulting PSCs achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.3% (certified 23.9%) on small area (0.10 cm2), 24.0% (certified 23.7%) on large area (1 cm2) and 20.0% for minimodule (16 cm2), and maintained 90% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours 1&#8208;sun operation. The vacuum evaporation prevents advert environmental effects on lead halide formation, guarantees a reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films, which opens a promising way for large scale fabrication of perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>A Super Tough, Rapidly Biodegradable, Ultrafast Hemostatic Bioglue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bioglue is composed of amidated&#8208;gelatin and Tetra&#8208;PEG&#8208;SS for rapid hemostasis in massive hemorrhage. The amino terminals in gelatin quickly react with active ester moieties in the PEG&#8208;SS, endowing the amino&#8208;gelatin&#8208;PEG glue firm and indiscriminate adhesion with various moist tissues (e.g., adhesively sealing cardiac hemorrhagic wounds). The bioglue provides a fascinating hemostatic approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.








Abstract
Death happening due to massive hemorrhage has been involved in military conflicts, traffic accidents, and surgical injuries of various human disasters. Achieving rapid and effective hemostasis to save lives is crucial in urgent massive bleeding situations. Herein, a covalent cross&#8208;linked AG&#8208;PEG glue based on extracellular matrix&#8208;like amino&#8208;gelatin (AG) and PEG derivatives is developed. The AG&#8208;PEG glue gelatinizes fast and exhibits firm and indiscriminate close adhesion with various moist tissues upon being dosed. The formed glue establishes an adhesive and robust barrier to seal the arterial, hepatic, and cardiac hemorrhagic wounds, enabling it to withstand up to 380&#160;mmHg blood pressure in comparison with normal systolic blood pressure of 60&#8211;180&#160;mmHg. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a pig cardiac penetrating hole with 6&#160;mm diameter is effectively stopped using the glue within 60&#160;s. Postoperative indexes of the treated pig gradually recover and the cardiac wounds regrow significantly at 14&#160;days. Possessing on&#8208;demand solubility, self&#8208;gelling, and rapid degradability, the AG&#8208;PEG glue may provide a fascinating stop&#8208;bleeding approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.

         <title>Imaging Guided Endogenic H2&#8208;Augmented Electrochemo&#8208;Sonodynamic Domino Co&#8208;therapy of Tumor in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) is developed. The endogenic H2&#8208;triggered &#8220;domino effect&#8221; in tumor tissue is clearly revealed. The developed H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy guided by US imaging in vivo will open up a feasible new way for green, economic, and effective treatment of cancer in the future.








Abstract
Precise and on&#8208;demand release of sufficient hydrogen (H2) to tumor sites remains a key challenge for emerging H2&#8208;oncotherapy, and little is known about the physiological effects of &#8220;abundant&#8221; H2 on complex tumor microenvironments (TME). Here, a highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) with strong &#8220;domino effect&#8221; triggered by endogenous H2 generation at tumor sites is reported to speedily eliminate tumor tissue (&#8804;80&#160;mm3) within 1&#160;day. Adequate H2 is controllably generated in tumor sites through mild electrochemistry in vivo due to acidic TME by using clinical acupuncture Fe needles as electrodes. Besides starvation damage due to gas blockage/destruction of vessels, nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;bubbles of H2 formed in situ can elevate the tumor's internal temperature and burst vessels to further destroy the tumor&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Remarkably, vulnerable homeostasis of TME is disturbed as H2 also participates in the physiological activity of tumor cells, leading to tumor dysfunction. Last but not least, the body's inflammatory response to cancer is reduced after the treatment, which is beneficial for the body's immune system during post&#8208;treatment recovery. Based on all of these merits, the H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy provides a potentially safe and viable therapeutic strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Highly Damping and Self&#8208;Healable Ionic Elastomer from Dynamic Phase Separation of Sticky Fluorinated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the heterogeneous structure of adipose tissue, the first example of damping self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer is reported, which features a dynamic phase&#8208;separated structure with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix. By virtue of phase separation and sticky liquid crystal assembly of fluorinated copolymers, this design reconciles elasticity and damping capacity, which are usually contradictive in previous ionic skins.








Abstract
Shock&#8208;induced low&#8208;frequency vibration damage is extremely harmful to bionic soft robots and machines that may incur the malfunction of fragile electronic elements. However, current skin&#8208;like self&#8208;healable ionic elastomers as the artificial sensing and protecting layer still lack the ability to dampen vibrations, due to their almost opposite design for molecular frictions to material's elasticity. Inspired by the two&#8208;phase structure of adipose tissue (the natural damping skin layer), here, a highly damping ionic elastomer with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix is introduced, which is formed by polymerization&#8208;induced dynamic phase separation of sticky fluorinated copolymers in the presence of lithium salts. Such a supramolecular design decouples the elastic and damping functions into two distinct phases, and thus reconciles a few intriguing properties including ionic conductivity, high stretchability, softness, strain&#8208;stiffening, elastic recovery, room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healability, recyclability, and most importantly, record&#8208;high damping capacity at the human motion frequency range (loss factor tan &#948;&#160;&gt;&#160;1 at 0.1&#8211;50&#160;Hz). This study opens the door for the artificial syntheses of high&#8208;performance damping ionic skins with robust sensing and protective applications in soft electronics and robotics.

         <title>A Breathable, Passive&#8208;Cooling, Non&#8208;Inflammatory, and Biodegradable Aerogel Electronic Skin for Wearable Physical&#8208;Electrophysiological&#8208;Chemical Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A breathable, passive&#8208;cooling, non&#8208;inflammatory, biodegradable, and flexible aerogel electronic skin is developed to monitor physical, electrophysiological, and metabolic biomarkers from the human body continuously and simultaneously.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of human health can be significantly improved by designing novel electronic skin (E&#8208;skin) platforms that mimic the characteristics and sensitivity of human skin. A high&#8208;quality E&#8208;skin platform that can simultaneously monitor multiple physiological and metabolic biomarkers without introducing skin discomfort or irritation is an unmet medical need. Conventional E&#8208;skins are either monofunctional or made from elastomeric films that do not include key synergistic features of natural skin, such as multi&#8208;sensing, breathability, and thermal management capabilities in a single patch. Herein, a biocompatible and biodegradable E&#8208;skin patch based on flexible gelatin methacryloyl aerogel (FGA) for non&#8208;invasive and continuous monitoring of multiple biomarkers of interest is engineered and demonstrated. Taking advantage of cryogenic temperature treatment and slow polymerization, FGA is fabricated with a highly interconnected porous structure that displays good flexibility, passive&#8208;cooling capabilities, and ultra&#8208;lightweight properties that make it comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It also provides numerous permeable capillary channels for thermal&#8208;moisture transfer, ensuring its excellent breathability. Therefore, the engineered FGA&#8208;based E&#8208;skin can simultaneously monitor body temperature, hydration, and biopotentials via electrophysiological sensors and detect glucose, lactate, and alcohol levels via electrochemical sensors. This work offers a previously unexplored materials strategy for next&#8208;generation E&#8208;skin platforms with superior practicality.

Herein, a biocompatible and biodegradable E-skin patch based on flexible gelatin methacryloyl aerogel (FGA) for non-invasive and continuous monitoring of multiple biomarkers of interest is engineered and demonstrated. Taking advantage of cryogenic temperature treatment and slow polymerization, FGA is fabricated with a highly interconnected porous structure that displays good flexibility, passive-cooling capabilities, and ultra-lightweight properties that make it comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It also provides numerous permeable capillary channels for thermal-moisture transfer, ensuring its excellent breathability. Therefore, the engineered FGA-based E-skin can simultaneously monitor body temperature, hydration, and biopotentials via electrophysiological sensors and detect glucose, lactate, and alcohol levels via electrochemical sensors. This work offers a previously unexplored materials strategy for next-generation E-skin platforms with superior practicality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Reaction Heterogeneity During Calcination of Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature calcination used for Li&#8208;ion battery particle synthesis is chemically imaged. Various parallel and serial combinations of heterogeneous reactions, such as the thermal aerobic/anaerobic decomposition, Li2CO3 decomposition, Li2&#8208;O insertion/diffusion, and O2 insertion/diffusion, prevail during the calcination reaction. The anaerobic decomposition of the precursor core slows down Li2&#8208;O incorporation.








Abstract
During solid&#8208;state calcination, with increasing temperature, materials undergo complex phase transitions with heterogeneous solid&#8208;state reactions and mass transport. Precise control of the calcination chemistry is therefore crucial for synthesizing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides (LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2, NRNCM) as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Although the battery performance depends on the chemical heterogeneity during NRNCM calcination, it has not yet been elucidated. Herein, through synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray, mass spectrometry microscopy, and structural analyses, it is revealed that the temperature&#8208;dependent reaction kinetics, the diffusivity of solid&#8208;state lithium sources, and the ambient oxygen control the local chemical compositions of the reaction intermediates within a calcined particle. Additionally, it is found that the variations in the reducing power of the transition metals (i.e., Ni, Co, and Mn) determine the local structures at the nanoscale. The investigation of the reaction mechanism via imaging analysis provides valuable information for tuning the calcination chemistry and developing high&#8208;energy/power density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Dual Topology of Dirac Electron Transport and Photogalvanic Effect in Low&#8208;Dimensional Topological Insulator Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking layer number&#8208;dependent electron structure, quantum properties, and circularly (linearly) polarized photogalvanic effect are assessed in the low&#8208;dimensional dual topological superlattices (TSLs) (Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.








Abstract
Dual topological insulators, simultaneously protected by time&#8208;reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, open great opportunities to explore different symmetry&#8208;protected metallic surface states. However, the conventional dual topological states located on different facets hinder integration into planar opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic devices. Here, dual topological superlattices (TSLs) Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N with limited stacking layer number N are constructed. Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron emission spectra of the TSLs identify the coexistence and adjustment of dual topological surface states on Bi2Se3 facet. The existence and tunability of spin&#8208;polarized dual&#8208;topological bands with N on Bi2Se3 facet result in an unconventionally weak antilocalization effect (WAL) with variable WAL coefficient &#945; (maximum close to 3/2) from quantum transport experiments. Most importantly, it is identified that the spin&#8208;polarized surface electrons from dual topological bands exhibit circularly and linearly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE and LPGE). It is anticipated that the stacked dual&#8208;topology and stacking layer number controlled bands evolution provide a platform for realizing intrinsic CPGE and LPGE. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.

         <title>Macroscale Fabrication of Lightweight and Strong Porous Carbon Foams through Template&#8208;Coating Pair Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon materials on a macroscopic length scale has a significant impact on the construction, packaging, and transportation industries. Presented herein is a tunable platform for macroscale fabrication of lightweight and strong pyrolytic carbon foams through template&#8208;coating pair design.








Abstract
Manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams can benefit the construction, transportation, and packaging industries. One successful route to lightweight and mechanically strong carbon foams involves pyrolysis of polymeric architectures, which is inevitably accompanied by drastic volumetric shrinkage (usually &gt;98%). As such, a challenge of these materials lies in maintaining bulk dimensions of building struts that span orders of magnitude difference in length scale from centimeters to nanometers. This work demonstrates fabrication of macroscale low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams that feature exceptional dimensional stability through pyrolysis of robust template&#8208;coating pairs. The template serves as the architectural blueprint and contains strength&#8208;imparting properties (e.g., high node density and small strut dimensions); it is composed of a low char&#8208;yielding porous polystyrene backbone with a high carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The coating serves to imprint and transcribe the template architecture into pyrolytic carbon; it is composed of a high char&#8208;yielding conjugated polymer with a relatively low carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The designed carbonization mismatch enables structural inheritance, while the decomposition mismatch affords hollow struts, minimizing density. The carbons synthesized through this new framework exhibit remarkable dimensional stability (&#8776;80% dimension retention; &#8776;50% volume retention) and some of the highest specific strengths (&#8776;0.13&#160;GPa g&#8722;1 cm3) among reported carbon foams derived from porous polymer templates.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Correlations and Exciton Complexes in CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many&#8208;body interactions in exciton complexes are crucial in many devices, for example, lasers, LEDs, and quantum light sources. Here, a combination of single quantum&#8208;dot photoluminescence spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures and configuration&#8208;interaction calculations reveals the size&#8208;dependent binding energies of trions (7&#8211;17&#160;meV) and biexcitons (15&#8211;30&#160;meV) in CsPbBr3&#160;quantum dots.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskite (LHP) (CsPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a competitive platform for classical light&#8208;emitting devices (in the weak light&#8211;matter interaction regime, e.g., LEDs and laser), as well as for devices exploiting strong light&#8211;matter interaction at room temperature. Many&#8208;body interactions and quantum correlations among photogenerated exciton complexes play an essential role, for example, by determining the laser threshold, the overall brightness of LEDs, and the single&#8208;photon purity in quantum light sources. Here, by combining cryogenic single&#8208;QD photoluminescence spectroscopy with configuration&#8208;interaction (CI) calculations, the size&#8208;dependent trion and biexciton binding energies are addressed. Trion binding energies increase from 7&#160;to 17&#160;meV for QD sizes decreasing from 30&#160;to 9&#160;nm, while the biexciton binding energies increase from 15&#160;to 30&#160;meV, respectively. CI calculations quantitatively corroborate the experimental results and suggest that the effective dielectric constant for biexcitons slightly deviates from the one of the single excitons, potentially as a result of coupling to the lattice in the multiexciton regime. The findings here provide a deep insight into the multiexciton properties in all&#8208;inorganic LHP QDs, essential for classical and quantum optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Polymer as a New Platform for Efficient and Selective Electroreduction of Nitrate into Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for simultaneous enhancement of activity and selectivity toward nitrate electroreduction into ammonia (NRA) is demonstrated by utilizing Ni&#8208;based conjugated coordination polymer catalysts for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. Coordination modulation can tailor their electrostatic attractions with the metal&#8208;hydrated cations that can regulate proton migration at the catalyst surface, promoting the NRA and inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).








Abstract
Electroreduction of nitrate into ammonia (NRA) provides a sustainable route to convert the widespread nitrate pollutants into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products under ambient conditions, which unfortunately suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Previous strategies of modifying the metal sites of catalysts often met a dilemma for simultaneously promoting activity and selectivity toward NRA. Here, a general strategy is reported to enable an efficient and selective NRA process through coordination modulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts to tailor the local proton concentration at the catalyst surface. By contrast, two analogous Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom enriched conjugated coordination polymers (NiO4&#8208;CCP and NiN4&#8208;CCP) with different coordination motifs are investigated for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. The NiO4&#8208;CCP catalyst exhibits an ammonia yield rate as high as 1.83&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 94.7% under a current density of 125&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming the NiN4&#8208;CCP catalyst. These experimental and theoretical studies both suggest that the strategy of coordination modulation can not only accelerate the NRA&#160;by adjusting the adsorption energies of NRA intermediates on the metal sites but also inhibit the HER through regulating the proton migration with contributions from the metal&#8208;hydrated cations adsorbed at the catalyst surface, thus achieving simultaneous enhancement of NRA selectivity and activity.

         <title>Efficient and Bright Deep&#8208;Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes based on a Lateral 0D/3D Perovskite Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and bright deep&#8208;red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are achieved based on a lateral Cs4PbI6/FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 (0D/3D) heterostructure, which can simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance light extraction. This leads to deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs with a record external quantum efficiency of 21% at a high current density of &#8776;200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Bright and efficient deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are important for applications in medical therapy and biological imaging due to the high penetration of deep&#8208;red photons into human tissues. Metal&#8208;halide perovskites have potential to achieve bright and efficient electroluminescence due to their favorable optoelectronic properties. However, efficient and bright perovskite&#8208;based deep&#8208;red LEDs have not been achieved yet, due to either Auger recombination in low&#8208;dimensional perovskites or trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination in 3D perovskites. Here, a lateral Cs4PbI6/FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 (0D/3D) heterostructure that can enable efficient deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs at very high brightness&#160;is demonstrated. The Cs4PbI6 can facilitate the growth of low&#8208;defect FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3, and act as low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index grids, which can simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance light extraction. This device reaches a peak external quantum efficiency of 21.0% at a photon flux of 1.75&#160;&#215;&#160;1021 m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of reported high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs. Theses LEDs are suitable for pulse oximeters, showing an error &lt;2% of blood oxygen saturation compared with commercial oximeters.

         <title>Impact of Planar and Vertical Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors on Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given their low&#8208;temperature solution processability and mechanical flexibility, organic field&#8208;effect transistors are promising candidates for developing Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things technologies and realizing next&#8208;generation wearable applications. Here, the authors compare the performance of flexible transistors with the emerging vertical&#8208;transistor technology, outline the critical device fabrication and material&#8208;design strategies, and discuss their role and function in a wide range of flexible electronics applications.








Abstract
The development of flexible and conformable devices, whose performance can be maintained while being continuously deformed, provides a significant step toward the realization of next&#8208;generation wearable and e&#8208;textile applications. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are particularly interesting for flexible and lightweight products, because of their low&#8208;temperature solution processability, and the mechanical flexibility of organic materials that endows OFETs the natural compatibility with plastic and biodegradable substrates. Here, an in&#8208;depth review of two competing flexible OFET technologies, planar and vertical OFETs (POFETs and VOFETs, respectively) is provided. The electrical, mechanical, and physical properties of POFETs and VOFETs are critically discussed, with a focus on four pivotal applications (integrated logic circuits, light&#8208;emitting devices, memories, and sensors). It is pointed out that the flexible function of the relatively newer VOFET technology, along with its perspective on advancing the applicability of flexible POFETs, has not been reviewed so far, and the direct comparison regarding the performance of POFET&#8208; and VOFET&#8208;based flexible applications is most likely absent. With discussions spanning printed and wearable electronics, materials science, biotechnology, and environmental monitoring, this contribution is a clear stimulus to researchers working in these fields to engage toward the plentiful possibilities that POFETs and VOFETs offer to flexible electronics.

         <title>Solvation and Interfacial Engineering Enable &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C Operation of Graphite/NCM Batteries at Energy Density over 270 wh&#160;kg&#8722;g</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic barriers related to Li+ transport at low temperatures is knocked down by formulating a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte containing Na+ as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, where a Li&#8208;Na hybrid SEI is identified to favor Li+ migration through the multiple LiF/NaF grain boundaries. As such, the electrolyte affords a 2 Ah, 270&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM523 pouch cell with discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) that can operate under low temperature (LT) conditions are essential for applications in orbital missions, subsea areas, and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, severe capacity loss is witnessed due to tremendous kinetic barriers that emerge at LT. Herein, to surmount such kinetic limitations, a low dielectric environment is tamed throughout the bulk electrolyte, which efficaciously brought the Li+ desolvation energy down to 30.76 KJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. At the meantime, the adoption of sodium cations (Na+) is proposed as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, and a Li&#8208;Na hybrid and fluoride&#8208;rich interphase is further identified via preferential reduction of Na+&#8208;(solvent/anion) clusters, which is found to efficiently facilitate Li+ migration through the LiF/NaF grain boundaries. Based on a N/P ratio of 1.1, the graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) full cell (cathode loading of &#8776;18.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) delivers a capacity as high as 125.1 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8208;20&#160;&#176;C with prolonged cycling to 100 cycles. Finally, a 270&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM pouch cell is assembled, which affords a discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C during the initial cycles. With an eye to both fundamental and practical aspects, this work will propel additional advancements and allow LIBs to fill more roles under extreme operation temperatures than ever before.

         <title>Dissolvable Self&#8208;Locking Microneedle Patches Integrated with Immunomodulators for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking dissolvable microneedle is presented as a mass&#8208;producible and cost&#8208;effective transdermal drug delivery platform for precise microdose delivery of drugs in a minimally invasive manner. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a novel combination immunotherapy approach proposed to improve melanoma treatment efficacy shows a significantly higher efficacy when delivered via self&#8208;locking microneedles than intratumoral injection.








Abstract
Advancements in micro&#8208;resolution 3D printers have significantly facilitated the development of highly complex mass&#8208;producible drug delivery platforms. Conventionally, due to the limitations of micro&#8208;milling machineries, dissolvable microneedles (MNs) are mainly fabricated in cone&#8208;shaped geometry with limited drug delivery accuracy. Herein, to overcome the limitations of conventional MNs, a novel projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking MN for precise skin insertion, adhesion, and transcutaneous microdose drug delivery is presented. The geometry of self&#8208;locking MN consists of a sharp skin&#8208;penetrating tip, a wide skin interlocking body, and a narrow base with mechanical supports fabricated over a flexible hydrocolloid patch to improve the accuracy of skin penetration into irregular surfaces. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is selected as the model for the investigation of self&#8208;locking MNs due to its irregular and uneven surface. In vivo immunotherapy efficacy is evaluated by integrating SD&#8208;208, a novel transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor that suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of tumors, and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor that induces T cell&#8208;mediated tumor cell death, into self&#8208;locking MNs and comparing them with intratumoral injection. Evaluation of (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab)/SD&#8208;208 delivery effectiveness in B16F10 melanoma&#8208;bearing mice model confirms significantly improved dose efficacy of self&#8208;locking MNs compared with intratumoral injection.

         <title>Recent Research Progress of Organic Small&#8208;Molecule Semiconductors with High Electron Mobilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the structural modification strategies of organic small&#8208;molecule semiconductors with high electron mobilities, a promising candidate for the construction of next&#8208;generation complementary organic logic&#8208;digital circuits, to achieve chemical stability and high electron transport properties. In addition, the applications of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials based on high mobility in organic electronic devices, such as organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, organic photodetectors, and gas sensors, are introduced.








Abstract
Organic electronics has made great progress in the past decades, which is inseparable from the innovative development of organic electronic devices and the diversity of organic semiconductor materials. It is worth mentioning that both of these great advances are inextricably linked to the development of organic high&#8208;performance semiconductor materials, especially the representative n&#8208;type organic small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high electron mobilities. The n&#8208;type organic small molecules have the advantages of simple synthesis process, strong intermolecular stacking, tunable molecular structure, and easy to functionalize structures. Furthermore, the n&#8208;type semiconductor is a remarkable and important component for constructing complementary logic circuits and p&#8208;n heterojunction structures. Therefore, n&#8208;type organic semiconductors play an extremely important role in the field of organic electronic materials and are the basis for the industrialization of organic electronic functional devices. This review focuses on the modification strategies of organic small molecules with high electron mobility at molecular level, and discusses in detail the applications of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high mobility in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, organic photodetectors, and gas sensors.

         <title>Electrochemical Replication and Transfer for Low&#8208;Cost, Sub&#8208;100&#160;nm Patterning of Materials on Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new additive patterning technique, named electrochemical replication and transfer, is developed to pattern a wide variety of metals, semiconductors, and polymers with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters on flexible substrates at low cost and high throughput.








Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;resolution patterns on flexible substrates is an essential step in the development of flexible electronics. However, the patterning process on flexible substrates often requires expensive equipment and tedious lithographic processing. Here, a bottom&#8208;up patterning technique, termed electrochemical replication and transfer (ERT) is reported, which fabricates multiscale patterns of a wide variety of materials by selective electrodeposition of target materials on a predefined template, and subsequent transfer of the electrodeposited materials to a flexible substrate, while leaving the undamaged template for reuse for over 100 times. The additive and parallel patterning attribute of ERT allows the fabrication of multiscale patterns with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters simultaneously, which overcomes the trade&#8208;off between resolution and throughput of conventional patterning techniques. ERT is suitable for fabricating a wide variety of materials including metals, semiconductors, metal oxides, and polymers into arbitrary shapes on flexible substrates at a very low cost.

         <title>Ultrasensitive and Ultraprecise Pressure Sensors for Soft Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making flexible sensors more precise is the focus of this research. It is found that by making the pressure sensing layer using pure materials&#160;and separating it from the rest of the sensor structure, the errors caused by the sensor's deformation can be reduced when it is subjected to external forces. This leads to improved precision and flexibility in sensing.








Abstract
Highly sensitive soft pressure sensors have attracted tremendous attention in recent years due to their great promise in robotics, healthcare, smart wearables, etc. Although high sensitivities can be realized by existing sensing mechanisms, they usually cause large random errors owing to inhomogeneous sensing layers, thus considerably reducing the sensing precision for practical applications. Herein, a pure&#8208;polymer and field emission bilayer structure (PFEBS)&#8208;based transduction mechanism is presented to successfully design an ultrasensitive and ultraprecise soft pressure sensor for the first time. This unique structure enables numerous tunneling electrons generated by field emission to be transmitted through the homogeneous sensing layer, which undergoes uniform deformation under subtle pressures, simultaneously achieving a sensing precision with variation &lt;1.62% and a sensitivity of 372.2 kPa&#8722;1. This study offers a new design strategy to develop next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible pressure sensors for soft systems.

         <title>Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers: From Light&#8208;Controlled Small Molecules to Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over supramolecular interactions is an important part of the toolbox for developing functional materials. The design of supramolecular polymers with light&#8208;triggered molecules allows remote control of supramolecular polymers and materials with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, a perspective review of various approaches and major advances toward photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with controlled functions is presented.








Abstract
Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers are well&#8208;organized assemblies based on highly oriented and reversible noncovalent interactions containing photosensitive molecules as (co&#8208;)monomers. They have attracted increasing interest in smart materials and dynamic systems with precisely controllable functions, such as light&#8208;driven soft actuators, photoresponsive fluorescent anticounterfeiting and light&#8208;triggered electronic devices. The present review discusses light&#8208;activated molecules used in photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with their main photo&#8208;induced changes, e.g., geometry, dipole moment, and chirality. Based on these distinct changes, supramolecular polymers formed by light&#8208;activated molecules exhibit photoresponsive disassembly and reassembly. As a consequence, photo&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization, &#8220;depolymerization,&#8221; and regulation of the lengths and topologies are observed. Moreover, the light&#8208;controlled functions of supramolecular polymers, such as actuation, emission, and chirality transfer along length scales, are highlighted. Furthermore, a perspective on challenges and future opportunities is presented. Besides the challenge of moving from harmful UV light to visible/near IR light avoiding fatigue, and enabling biomedical applications, future opportunities include light&#8208;controlled supramolecular actuators with helical motion, light&#8208;modulated information transmission, optically recyclable materials, and multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular systems.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Electrocatalysts Enable Efficient CO&#8208;to&#8208;Acetate Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating a coordination polymer catalyst consisting of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50%, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Upgrading carbon dioxide/monoxide to multi&#8208;carbon C2+ products using renewable electricity offers one route to more sustainable fuel and chemical production. One of the most appealing products is acetate, the profitable electrosynthesis of which demands a catalyst with higher efficiency. Here, a coordination polymer (CP) catalyst is reported that consists of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds, which enables selective reduction of CO to acetate with a 61% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.59 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cells. The catalyst is integrated in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly that enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate (3.3 molar) from the cathodic liquid stream, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50% toward CO&#8208;to&#8208;acetate conversion, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at a current density of 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Wavelength Light&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network&#8208;Based Microrobots for Reactive Species Scavenging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a hollow metal&#8211;phenolic network&#8208;based microrobot with spray&#8208;coated asymmetric capping is reported capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared irradiation and ultraviolet irradiation without fuel. With multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsiveness, tunable size of the particles, and great reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging capacity, the proposed microrobots can be ideal for future in vivo analytical sensing and medical treatment.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven microrobots with different propulsion mechanisms have attracted great attention in microrobot synthesis and applications. However, current systems rely heavily on precious metals, using a complex synthesis process and limited working wavelength. It is therefore of great interest to fabricate microrobots that can be driven by multi&#8208;wavelength irradiation and with simple components. Here, metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;based microrobots are synthesized using a sacrificial polystyrene bead template and an extra capping is added to regulate their symmetry. The hollow MPN microrobots with different layers of capping are capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, without fuel. The velocity of the microrobots under irradiation is altered by the thickness of the asymmetric capping and their motion could be manipulated remotely by switching the NIR or UV irradiation on and off. With light&#8208;driven mobility, the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) scavenging activity of the microrobots is significantly increased. Therefore, this proposed microrobot system provides a synthesis strategy to develop asymmetric light&#8208;navigated microrobots for future medical treatment with tunable structure, multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsive mobility, and great RONS scavenging capacity.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;Fusion&#8208;Mediated Multiplex Engineering of Tumor Cell Surface Glycans for Enhanced NK Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell membrane&#8208;fusogenic liposome is designed to fuse with tumor cell membrane to deliver sialyltransferase inhibitor&#8208;loaded core into cytoplasm and anchor natural killer (NK)&#8208;activating glycan&#8208;modified shell onto surface synchronously. This membrane&#8208;fusion&#8208;mediated delivery approach reprograms the sialic acid&#8208;caused immunosuppression of tumor surface into a Lewis X trisaccharide&#8208;based NK&#8208;activating type, sufficiently reactivating the NK recognition and lysis for enhanced antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell therapies show potential for tumor treatment but are immunologically resisted by the overexpressed immunosuppressing tumor cell surface glycans. To reverse this glycan&#8208;mediated immunosuppression, the surface NK&#8208;inhibitory glycan expressions need to be downregulated and NK&#8208;activating glycan levels should be elevated synchronously with optimal efficiency. Here, a core&#8211;shell membrane&#8208;fusogenic liposome (MFL) is designed to simultaneously achieve the physical modification of NK&#8208;activating glycans and biological inhibition of immunosuppressing glycans on the tumor cell surface via a membrane&#8208;fusion manner. Loaded into a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;triggered&#8208;degradable thermosensitive hydrogel, MFLs could be conveniently injected and controllably released into local tumor. Through fusion with tumor cell membrane, the released MFLs could simultaneously deliver sialyltransferase&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;loaded core into cytoplasm, and anchor NK&#8208;activating&#8208;glycan&#8208;modified shell onto tumor surface. This spatially&#8208;differential distribution of core and shell in one cell ensures the effective inhibition of intracellular sialyltransferase to downregulate immunosuppressing sialic acid, and direct presentation of NK&#8208;activating Lewis X trisaccharide (LeX) on tumor surface simultaneously. Consequentially, the sialic acid&#8208;caused immunosuppression of tumor surface is reprogrammed to be LeX&#8208;induced NK activation, resulting in sensitive susceptibility to NK&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated recognition and lysis for improved tumor elimination. This MFL provides a novel platform for multiplex&#160;cell engineering and personalized regulation of intercellular interactions for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Unlocking High Capacity and Fast Na+ Diffusion of HxCrS2 by Proton&#8208;Exchange Pretreatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pretreatment of NaCrS2 to produce HxCrS2 results in a more robust and higher performing electrode by numerous measures. Proton exchange produces a heterostructure that permits fast diffusion while also seemingly unlocking reversible access to cationic redox, enabling high capacity. The unique biphasic structure of HxCrS2 may be generalizable to other materials, opening a new class of electrode materials.








Abstract
This study presents a new material, &#8220;HxCrS2&#8221; (denotes approximate composition) formed by proton&#8208;exchange of NaCrS2 which has a measured capacity of 728 mAh g&#8722;1 with significant improvements to capacity retention, sustaining over 700 mAh g&#8722;1 during cycling experiments. This is the highest reported capacity for a transition metal sulfide electrode and outperforms the most promising proposed sodium anodes to date. HxCrS2 exhibits a biphasic structure featuring alternating crystalline and amorphous lamella on the scale of a few nanometers. This unique structural motif enables reversible access to Cr redox in the material resulting in higher capacities than seen in the parent structure which features only S redox. Pretreatment by proton&#8208;exchange offers a route to materials such as HxCrS2 which provide fast diffusion and high capacities for sodium&#8208;ion&#160;batteries.

         <title>Dislocated Bilayer MOF Enables High&#8208;Selectivity Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D monolayer and 2D bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by a simple solvothermal method. The bilayer MOF is a novel dislocation 2D porphyrin&#8208;based MOF material that exhibits good structural stability as well as ultra&#8208;high CO selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (100% selectivity). This work offers a new strategy for the construction of bilayer MOFs and provides a new perspective for the customization of photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
The highly selective photoreduction of CO2 into valuable small&#8208;molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems.

&lt;p&gt;2D monolayer and 2D bilayer metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by a simple solvothermal method. The bilayer MOF is a novel dislocation 2D porphyrin-based MOF material that exhibits good structural stability as well as ultra-high CO selectivity for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (100% selectivity). This work offers a new strategy for the construction of bilayer MOFs and provides a new perspective for the customization of photocatalytic performance.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly selective photoreduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into valuable small-molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, it remains a challenge because the complex CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction process usually generates multiple possible products and requires a subsequent separation step. In this paper, 2D monolayer and bilayer porphyrin-based metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are successfully constructed by adjusting the reaction temperature and solvent polarity with 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-pyridyl)porphyrin as the light-harvesting ligand. The bilayer MOF is a low-dimensional MOF with a special structure in which the upper and lower layers are arranged in dislocation and are bridged by halogen ions. This bilayer MOF exhibits 100% ultra-high selectivity for the reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO under simulated sunlight without any cocatalyst or photosensitizer and can be recycled at least three times. The intrinsic mechanism of this photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction process is explored through experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work shows that the rational design of the number of layers in 2D MOF structures can tune the stability of these structures and opens a new avenue for the design of highly selective MOF photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Sensitive Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetectors with Over 450 Days Stability Enabled by Synergistic Engineering for Pulse Oximetry System</title>

         <dc:description>
The multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA), with terminal amino and carboxyl groups, passivates the surface defects and enhances the stability of the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite, therefore resulting in high sensitivity and highly stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors. In addition, the ATFBA&#8208;based photodetector has been integrated with a pulse oximetry visualization system, successfully yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate.








Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap tin (Sn)&#8208;lead (Pb) halide perovskites can achieve near&#8208;infrared response for photodetectors. However, the Sn&#8208;based devices suffer from notorious instability and high defect densities due to the oxidation propensity of Sn2+. Herein, a multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA) is presented, which can passivate surface defects and inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ through hydrogen bonds and chelation coordination from the terminal amino and carboxyl groups. The perfluorinated benzene ring structure of ATFBA affords the passivator assembled at the grain boundaries to enhance the water resistance. With the synergistical passivation of these functional groups, the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetector exhibits a remarkable responsivity of 0.52&#160;A&#160;W&#8208;1 and an excellent specific detectivity of 5.34&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at 850&#160;nm, along with remaining 97% of its initial responsivity over 450 days. Benefitting from high sensitivity, the photodetector is integrated into a pulse oximetry sensor visualization system, yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate with less than 2% error. This work paves the avenue toward constructing high&#8208;performance and stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors for practical applications.

         <title>Y&#8208;Type Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors with Outer Branched Side Chains and Inner Cyclohexane Side Chains for 19.36% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains are designed for polymer solar cells with the power conversion efficiencies of 18.52% and 19.36% achieved in the binary and ternary blend devices, respectively, which are among the highest values for single&#8208;junction solar cells at present.








Abstract
Raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can increase the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and thus the photovoltaic performance of the current top performing polymer solar cells (PSCs). One of the viable routes is demonstrated by the successful Y6 derivative of L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains at the outer side. This will introduce steric hindrance and reduce intermolecular aggregation, thus open up the bandgap and raise the LUMO energy level. To take further advantages of the steric hindrance influence on optoelectronic properties of Y6 derivatives, two Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors of BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F and BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4Cl are designed and synthesized by adopting outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains. An outstanding Voc of 0.937&#160;V is achieved in the D18:BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F binary blend devices along with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.52%. With the addition of BTP&#8208;eC9 to extend the absorption spectral coverage, a remarkable PCE of 19.36% is realized finally in the related ternary blend devices, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;junction PSCs at present. The results illustrate the great potential of cyclohexane side chains in constructing high&#8208;performance non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and their PSCs.
