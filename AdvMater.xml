         <title>Efficient Electrochemical Co&#8208;Reduction of Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate to Urea with High Faradaic Efficiency on Cobalt&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Sites</title>

Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered nitrate/carbon dioxide co&#8208;reduction reaction toward urea production paves an attractive alternative to industrial urea processes and offers a clean on&#8208;site approach to closing the global nitrogen cycle. However, its large&#8208;scale implantation is severely impeded by challenging C&#8208;N coupling and requires electrocatalysts with high activity/selectivity. Here, cobalt&#8208;nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheet (Co NPs@C) is proposed as a catalyst electrode to boost yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward urea electrosynthesis with enhanced C&#8208;N coupling. Such Co NPs@C renders superb urea&#8208;producing activity with a high FE reaching 54.3% and a urea yield of 2217.5 &#956;g h&#8211;1 mgcat.&#8211;1, much superior to the Co NPs and C nanosheet counterparts, and meanwhile shows strong stability. The Co NPs@C affords rich catalytically active sites, fast reactants diffusion, and sufficient catalytic surfaces&#8208;electrolyte contacts with favored charge and ion transfer efficiencies. The theoretical calculations reveal that the high&#8208;rate formation of *CO and *NH2 intermediates is crucial for facilitating urea synthesis.

&lt;p&gt;Renewable electricity-powered nitrate/carbon dioxide co-reduction reaction toward urea production paves an attractive alternative to industrial urea processes and offers a clean on-site approach to closing the global nitrogen cycle. However, its large-scale implantation is severely impeded by challenging C-N coupling and requires electrocatalysts with high activity/selectivity. Here, cobalt-nanoparticles anchored on carbon nanosheet (Co NPs@C) is proposed as a catalyst electrode to boost yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward urea electrosynthesis with enhanced C-N coupling.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly Enabled Printable Asymmetric Self&#8208;Insulated Stretchable Conductor for Human Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft and stretchable conductors with high electrical conductivity and tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties are crucial for both on&#8208;skin and implantable electronic devices. Liquid metal&#8208;based conductors hold great promise due to their metallic conductivity and minimal stiffness. However, the surface oxidation of liquid metal particles in polymeric matrices poses a challenge in forming a continuous pathway for highly conductive elastic composites. Here, we report a printable composite material based on liquid metal and conducting polymer that undergoes a self&#8208;assembly process, achieving high conductivity (2089 S cm&#8722;1) in the bottom surface while maintaining an insulated top surface, high stretchability (&gt;800%), and a modulus akin to human skin tissue. This material was further applied to fabricate skin&#8208;interfaced strain sensors and electromyogram (EMG) sensors through 3D printing.

         <title>Assembled/Disassembled Modular Scaffolds for Multicellular Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicellular tissue engineering scaffolds with ordered spatial distribution of different cell types are successfully constructed through the strategy of assembling 3D printed modules loaded with different kinds of cells. Assembled/disassembled modular scaffolds can not only be used for the systematic investigation of intercellular cross&#8208;talk, but also be utilized as cell&#8208;laden implants for the regeneration of complex tissue.








Abstract
The behavior of tissue resident cells can be influenced by the spatial arrangement of cellular interactions. Therefore, it is of significance to precisely control the spatial organization of various cells within multicellular constructs. It remains challenging to construct a versatile multicellular scaffold with ordered spatial organization of multiple cell types. Herein, a modular multicellular tissue engineering scaffold with ordered spatial distribution of different cell types is constructed by assembling varying cell&#8208;laden modules. Interestingly, the modular scaffolds can be disassembled into individual modules to evaluate the specific contribution of each cell type in the system. Through assembling cell&#8208;laden modules, the macrophage&#8208;mesenchymal stem cell (MSC), endothelial cell&#8208;MSC, and chondrocyte&#8208;MSC co&#8208;culture models are successfully established. The in vitro results indicate that the intercellular cross&#8208;talk can promote the proliferation and differentiation of each cell type in the system. Moreover, MSCs in the modular scaffolds may regulate the behavior of chondrocytes through the nuclear factor of activated T&#8208;Cells (NFAT) signaling pathway. Furthermore, the modular scaffolds loaded with co&#8208;cultured chondrocyte&#8208;MSC exhibit enhanced regeneration ability of osteochondral tissue, compared with other groups. Overall, this work offers a promising strategy to construct a multicellular tissue engineering scaffold for the systematic investigation of intercellular cross&#8208;talk and complex tissue engineering.

         <title>Neutrophil Membrane&#8208;Camouflaged Polyprodrug Nanomedicine for Inflammation Suppression in Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neutrophil membrane&#8208;coated reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive polyprodrug nanoparticle (NRN) is reported for the ischemic brain&#8208;targeted delivery of fingolimod hydrochloride (FTY720) with minimal side effects. NRNs exhibit enhanced blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration, ischemic brain&#8208;targeted accumulation, and effective neuroprotection with minimal side effects owing to neutrophil membrane coating and ROS&#8208;responsive FTY720 release.








Abstract
Neuroinflammation has emerged as a major concern in ischemic stroke therapy because it exacebates neurological dysfunction and suppresses neurological recovery after ischemia/reperfusion. Fingolimod hydrochloride (FTY720) is an FDA&#8208;approved anti&#8208;inflammatory drug which exhibits potential neuroprotective effects in ischemic brain parenchyma. However, delivering a sufficient amount of FTY720 through the blood&#8211;brain barrier into brain lesions without inducing severe cardiovascular side effects remains challenging. Here, a neutrophil membrane&#8208;camouflaged polyprodrug nanomedicine that can migrate into ischemic brain tissues and in situ release FTY720 in response to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species. This nanomedicine delivers 15.2&#8208;fold more FTY720 into the ischemic brain and significantly reduces the risk of cardiotoxicity and infection compared with intravenously administered free drug. In addition, single&#8208;cell RNA&#8208;sequencing analysis identifies that the nanomedicine attenuates poststroke inflammation by reprogramming microglia toward anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotypes, which is realized via modulating Cebpb&#8208;regulated activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and secretion of CXCL2 chemokine. This study offers new insights into the design and fabrication of polyprodrug nanomedicines for effective suppression of inflammation in ischemic stroke therapy.

         <title>Giant Modulation of the Second Harmonic Generation by Magnetoelectricity in Two&#8208;Dimensional Multiferroic CuCrP2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetries and magnetoelectric responses of van der Waals multiferroic CuCrP2S6 are investigated by second harmonic generation (SHG). Structural and magnetic phase transitions are successfully probed. The polarization dependence of the SHG signals is significantly modified, and the signal magnitude is enhanced by one order of magnitude under a finite magnetic field, which can be explained by the magnetoelectric effect.








Abstract
Multiferroic materials have attracted considerable attention owing to their unique magnetoelectric or magnetooptical properties. The recent discovery of few&#8208;layer van der Waals&#160;multiferroic crystals provides a new research direction for controlling the multiferroic properties in the atomic layer limit. However, research on few&#8208;layer multiferroic crystals is limited and the effect of thickness&#8208;dependent symmetries on those properties is less explored. In this study, the symmetries and magnetoelectric responses of van der Waals multiferroic CuCrP2S6 are investigated by optical second harmonic generation (SHG). Structural and magnetic phase transitions are successfully probed by the temperature&#8208;dependent SHG signals, revealing significant changes by applying the magnetic field reflecting the magnetoelectric effect. Moreover, it is found that symmetries and resultant magnetoelectric responses can be modulated by the number of layers. These results offer a new principle of controlling the multiferroicity and indicate that 2D van der Waals multiferroic material is a promising building block for functional nanodevices.

         <title>Ultrahigh Nonlinear Responses from MXene Plasmons in the Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an important discovery regarding the optical properties of MXenes, demonstrating that 2D Ti3C2Tx generates a strong plasmonic phenomenon in the short&#8208;wavelength infrared range through acoustic plasmon modes. Additionally, this finding is leveraged to achieve record&#8208;high nonlinear absorption coefficients at short&#8208;wavelength infrared wavelengths.








Abstract
Surface plasmons in 2D materials such as graphene exhibit exceptional field confinement. However, the low electron density of majority of 2D materials, which are semiconductors or semimetals, has limited their plasmons to mid&#8208;wave or long&#8208;wave infrared regime. This study demonstrates that a 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene with high electron density can not only support strong plasmon confinement with an acoustic plasmon mode in the short&#8208;wave infrared region, but also provide ultrahigh nonlinear responses. The acoustic MXene plasmons (AMPs) in the MXene (Ti3C2Tx)&#8211;insulator (SiO2)&#8211;metal (Au) nanostructure generate in the 1.5&#8211;6.0 &#181;m wavelength range, exhibiting a two orders of magnitude reduction in wavelength compared to wavelength in free space. Furthermore, AMP resonators with patterned Au rods exhibit a record&#8208;high nonlinear absorption coefficient of 1.37 &#215; 10&#8722;2 m&#160;W&#8722;1 at wavelength of 1.56 &#181;m, &#8776;3 orders of magnitude greater than the highest value recorded for other 2D materials. These results indicate that MXenes can overcome fundamental plasmon wavelength limitations of previously studied 2D materials, providing groundbreaking opportunities in nonlinear optical applications, including all&#8208;optical processing and ultrafast optical switching.

         <title>Spontaneous Wetting Induced by Contact&#8208;Electrification at Liquid&#8211;Solid Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
When a droplet spreads on a polymer surface, simultaneous charge exchange occurs at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Repeated contact electrification leads to accumulated charges on the substrate, inducing spontaneous wetting phenomena. Contact angle variation strongly depends on surface charge density. Contact electrification induced wetting (CEW) can alter contact angles by 5&#176;~38&#176; across different materials.








Abstract
Wettability significantly influences various surface interactions and applications at the liquid&#8211;solid interface. However, the understanding is complicated by the intricate charge exchange occurring through contact electrification (CE) during this process. The understanding of the influence of triboelectric charge on wettability remains challenging, especially due to the complexities involved in concurrently measuring contact angles and interfacial electrical signals. Here, the relationship is investigated between surface charge density and change of contact angle of dielectric films after contact with water droplets. It is observed that the charge exchange when water spared lead to a spontaneous wetting phenomenon, which is termed as the contact electrification induced wetting (CEW). Notably, these results demonstrate a linear dependence between the change of contact angle (CA) of the materials and the density of surface charge on the solid surface. Continuous CEW tests show that not only the static CA but also the dynamics of wetting are influenced by the accumulation charges at the interface. The mechanism behind CEW involves the redistribution of surface charges on a solid surface and polar water molecules within liquid. This interaction results in a decrease in interface energy, leading to a reduction in the CA. Ab initio calculations suggest that the reduction in interface energy may stem from the enhanced surface charge on the substrate, which strengthens the hydrogen bond interaction between water and the substrate. These findings have the potential to advance the understanding of CE and wetting phenomena, with applications in energy harvesting, catalysis, and droplet manipulation at liquid&#8211;solid interfaces.

         <title>Photoluminescent Characterization of Metal Nanoclusters: Basic Parameters, Methods, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoclusters have recently emerged as a promising class of luminescent materials. Photoluminescent characterization plays a huge role in revealing the luminescent mechanism of nanoclusters and designing nanocluster&#8208;based applications. This review discusses the parameters and measurement methods in characterizing luminescent nanoclusters from the basic principles to the revelation of luminescent mechanisms and construction of practical applications.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (MNCs) can be synthesized with atomically precise structures and molecule formulae due to the rapid development of nanocluster science in recent decades. The ultrasmall size range (normally &lt; 2 nm) endows MNCs with plenty of molecular&#8208;like properties, among which photoluminescent properties have aroused extensive attention. Tracing the research and development processes of luminescent nanoclusters, various photoluminescent analysis and characterization methods play a significant role in elucidating luminescent mechanism and analyzing luminescent properties. In this review, it is aimed to systematically summarize the normally used photoluminescent characterizations in MNCs including basic parameters and methods, such as excitation/emission wavelength, quantum yield, and lifetime. For each key parameter, first its definition and meaning is introduced and then the relevant characterization methods including measuring principles and the revelation of luminescent properties from the collected data are discussed. Then, it is discussed in details how to explore the luminescent mechanism of MNCs and construct NC&#8208;based applications based on the measured data. By means of these characterization strategies, the luminescent properties of MNCs and NC&#8208;based designs can be explained quantitatively and qualitatively. Hence, this review is expected to provide clear guidance for researchers to characterize luminescent MNCs and better understand the luminescent mechanism from the measured results.

         <title>Red Carbon Mediated Formation of Cu2O Clusters Dispersed on the Oxocarbon Framework by Fehling's Route and their Use for the Nitrate Electroreduction in Acidic Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, Cu2O clusters are obtained dispersedly on the oxocarbon framework after the Fehling's&#8208;like reaction during the mild annealing process of red carbon, leading to the reduction of Cu (II) predominantly to Cu2O. The covalent oxocarbon framework improves the stability of clusters, enabling their efficient nitrate electroreduction under acidic electrolytes with a high yield rate and Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
The oligomers of carbon suboxide, known as red carbon, exhibit a highly conjugated structure and semiconducting properties. Upon mild heat treatment, it transforms into a carbonaceous framework rich in oxygen surface terminations, called oxocarbon. In this study, the abundant oxygen functionalities are harnessed as anchors to create oxocarbon&#8208;supported nanohybrid electrocatalysts. Starting with single atomic Cu (II) strongly coordinated to oxygen atoms on red carbon, the Fehling reaction leads to the formation of Cu2O clusters. Simultaneously, a covalent oxocarbon framework emerges via cross&#8208;linking, providing robust support for Cu2O clusters. Notably, the oxocarbon support effectively stabilizes Cu2O clusters of very small size, ensuring their high durability in acidic conditions and the presence of ammonia. The synthesized material exhibits a superior electrocatalytic activity for nitrate reduction under acidic electrolyte conditions, with a high yield rate of ammonium (NH4+) at 3.31&#160;mmol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 92.5% at a potential of &#8722;0.4&#160;V (vs RHE).

         <title>Enhancing Stability and Performance in Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Through Hydrogen Bond Suppression of Organic Cation Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High background carrier density in FASnI3 transistors is elucidated, originating from both Sn2+ oxidation and FA+ ion migration. The development of a hydrogen bond strategy through the integration of fluorine&#8208;substituted additives effectively suppresses cation migration, thereby reducing background carrier density and enhancing operational stability of the transistors. An impressive effective mobility of 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is achieved.








Abstract
Ion migration poses a substantial challenge in perovskite transistors, exerting detrimental effects on hysteresis and operational stability. This study focuses on elucidating the influence of ion migration on the performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). It is revealed that the high background carrier density in FASnI3 FETs arises not only from the oxidation of Sn2+ but also from the migration of FA+ ions. The formation of hydrogen bonding between FA+ and F&#8722; ions efficiently inhibits ion migration, leading to a reduction in background carrier density and an improvement in the operational stability of the transistors. The strategy of hydrogen bond is extended to fluorine&#8208;substituted additives to improve device performance. The incorporation of 4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium iodide additives into FETs significantly minimizes the shift of turn&#8208;on voltage during cyclic measurements. Notably, an effective mobility of up to 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 with an Ion/off ratio of 107 is achieved. These findings hold promising potential for advancing tin&#8208;based perovskite technology in the field of electronics.

&lt;p&gt;Ion migration poses a substantial challenge in perovskite transistors, exerting detrimental effects on hysteresis and operational stability. This study focuses on elucidating the influence of ion migration on the performance of tin-based perovskite field-effect transistors (FETs). It is revealed that the high background carrier density in FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; FETs arises not only from the oxidation of Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; but also from the migration of FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The formation of hydrogen bonding between FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions efficiently inhibits ion migration, leading to a reduction in background carrier density and an improvement in the operational stability of the transistors. The strategy of hydrogen bond is extended to fluorine-substituted additives to improve device performance. The incorporation of 4-fluorophenethylammonium iodide additives into FETs significantly minimizes the shift of turn-on voltage during cyclic measurements. Notably, an effective mobility of up to 30 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with an &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;on/off&lt;/sub&gt; ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved. These findings hold promising potential for advancing tin-based perovskite technology in the field of electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Potential Regulation of Working Anode for Long&#8208;Term Zero&#8208;Volt Storage at 37&#160;&#176;C in Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term zero&#8208;volt storage (ZVS) in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) at 37&#160;&#176;C is achieved through quantitative regulation of anode potential in working cells. This approach prevents Cu current collector dissolution and SEI degradation by controlling the Li6CoO4 content in cathode, with reversible capacity in slight over&#8208;lithiation LCO demonstrated. This paves the way for emerging applications in active implantable medical devices.








Abstract
The advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries that can tolerate zero&#8208;volt storage (ZVS) are in high demand for implantable medical devices and spacecraft. However, ZVS can raise the anode potential, leading to Cu current collector dissolution and solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) degradation, especially at 37&#160;&#176;C. In this contribution, by quantitatively regulating the dosage of Li6CoO4 cathode additives, controllable potential of the working anode under abusive&#8208;discharge conditions is demonstrated. The addition of Li6CoO4 keeps zero&#8208;crossing potential (ZCP) and the potential of ZVS below 2.0 V (vs Li/Li+) for LiCoO2|mesocarbon microbead cells at 37&#160;&#176;C. The capacity retention ratio (CRR) increases from 69.1% and 35.9% to 98.6% and 90.8% after 10 and 20 days of ZVS, respectively. The Cu dissolution and SEI degradation are effectively suppressed, while the over&#8208;lithiated cathode exhibits high reversible capacity after ZVS. The limiting conditions of long&#8208;term ZVS are further explored and a corresponding guide map is designed. When quantitatively regulating ZCP and the potential in ZVS, Cu dissolution, SEI degradation, and irreversible conversion of the cathode constitute the limiting conditions. This contribution designs the most reasonable potential range for ZVS protection at 37&#160;&#176;C, and realizes the best CRR record through precise potential regulation for the first time.

         <title>Enhanced Piezoelectricity of MAPbI3 by the Introduction of MXene and Its Utilization in Boosting High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research details a strategy to boost the piezoelectric performance of MAPbI3 by using a MXene substrate. It is demonstrated that the surface OH groups on the MXene induce a stronger polarization of the MA+ ions in the MAPbI3 compared to that of the O and F groups, leading to a much more enhanced piezoelectric effect. An innovative type of flexible photodetector (PD) based on a piezoelectric MXene/MAPbI3 heterostructure is crafted, which can be enhanced simultaneously by the piezo&#8208;phototronic and pyro&#8208;phototronic effects. Utilizing MXene to boost the piezoelectricity of MAPbI3 reveals wide&#8208;range potentials for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Recently, perovskite photodetectors (PDs) are risen to prominence due to substantial research interest. Beyond merely tweaking the composition of materials, a cutting&#8208;edge advancement lies in leveraging the innate piezoelectric polarization properties of perovskites themselves. Here, the investigation shows utilizing Ti3C2Tx, a typical MXene, as an intermediate layer for significantly boosting the piezoelectric property of MAPbI3 thin films. This improvement is primarily attributed to the enhanced polarization of the methylammonium (MA+) groups within MAPbI3, induced by the OH groups present in Ti3C2Tx. A flexible PD based on the MAPbI3/MXene heterostructure is then fabricated. The new device is sensitive to a wide range of wavelengths, displays greatly enhanced performance owing to the piezo&#8208;phototronic coupling. Moreover, the device is endowed with a greatly reduced response time, down to millisecond level, through the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect. The characterization shows applying a &#8722;1.2% compressive strain on the PD leads to a remarkable 102% increase in the common photocurrent, and a 76% increase in the pyro&#8208;phototronic current. The present work reveals how the emerging piezo&#8208;phototronic and pyro&#8208;phototronic effects can be employed to design high&#8208;performance flexible perovskite PDs.

         <title>Spacer Conformation Induced Multiple Hydrogen Bonds in 2D Perovskite toward Highly Efficient Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer&#8208;spacer conformation induces multiple hydrogen bonds in new 2D DJ perovskite toward highly efficient optoelectronic devices with exceptional sensitivity to UV and X&#8208;ray photons, while also demonstrating excellent applicability for UV weak&#8208;light imaging.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites typically outperform Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) analogs in terms of photodetection (PD). However, the mechanism behind this enhanced performance remains elusive. Theoretical calculations for elucidating interlayer spacer conformation&#8208;induced multiple hydrogen bonds in 2D perovskite are presented, along with the synthesis of DPAPbBr4 (DPB) single crystals (SCs) and their PD properties under X&#8208;ray/ultraviolet (UV) excitation. The high&#8208;quality DPB SC enhances PD with exceptional photoresponse attributes, including a high on/off ratio (4.89&#160;&#215;&#160;104), high responsivity (2.44 A&#160;W&#8315;1), along with large dynamic linear range (154 dB) and low detection limit (7.1 nW&#160;cm&#8315;2), which are currently the best results among 2D perovskite SC detectors, respectively. Importantly, high&#8208;resolution images are obtained under UV illumination with weak light levels. The SC X&#8208;ray detector exhibits a high sensitivity of 663 &#181;C Gyair&#8315;1 cm&#8211;2 at 10 V and a detection limit of 1.44 &#181;Gyair s&#8315;1. This study explores 2D DJ perovskites for efficient and innovative optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Engineering Metallic Alloy Electrode for Robust and Active Water Electrocatalysis with Large Current Density Exceeding 2000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kinetically sluggish and unstable oxygen evolution reaction&#160;(OER) electrocatalysts are elusive for large&#8208;scale industrial Hydrogen (H2) production. This work manifests that the phosphorization of Ni1&#8208;xFex nanochain arrays renders exceptionally low overpotential compared to benchmark IrO2. Moreover, the electrode permits robust water splitting at an extremely large current density of 2000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The amelioration of brilliantly effective electrocatalysts working at high current density for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is imperative for cost&#8208;efficient electrochemical hydrogen production. Yet, the kinetically sluggish and unstable catalysts remain elusive to large&#8208;scale hydrogen (H2) generation for industrial applications. Herein, a new strategy is demonstrated to significantly enhance the intrinsic activity of Ni1&#8208;xFex nanochain arrays through a trace proportion of heteroatom phosphorus doping that permits robust water splitting at an extremely large current density of 1000 and 2000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 760&#160;h. The in situ formation of Ni2P and Ni5P4 on Ni1&#8208;xFex nanochain arrays surface and hierarchical geometry of the electrode significantly promote the reaction kinetics and OER activity. The OER electrode provides exceptionally low overpotentials of 222 and 327&#160;mV at current densities of 10 and 2000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in alkaline media, dramatically lower than benchmark IrO2 and is among the most active catalysts yet reported. Remarkably, the alkaline electrolyzer renders a low voltage of 1.75&#160;V at a large current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, indicating outperformed overall water splitting. The electrochemical fingerprints demonstrate vital progress toward large&#8208;scale H2 production for industrial water electrolysis.

The in situ formation of Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P and Ni&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; on Ni&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; nanochain arrays surface and hierarchical geometry of the electrode significantly promote the reaction kinetics and OER activity. The OER electrode provides exceptionally low overpotentials of 222 and 327&#160;mV at current densities of 10 and 2000&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in alkaline media, dramatically lower than benchmark IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and is among the most active catalysts yet reported. Remarkably, the alkaline electrolyzer renders a low voltage of 1.75&#160;V at a large current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, indicating outperformed overall water splitting. The electrochemical fingerprints demonstrate vital progress toward large-scale H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production for industrial water electrolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bacterial Biohybrids for Invasion of Tumor Cells Promote Antigen Cross&#8208;Presentation through Gap Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to inherent differences in cellular composition and metabolic behavior with host cells, tumor&#8208;harbored bacteria can discriminatorily affect tumor immune landscape. However, the mechanisms by which intracellular bacteria affect antigen presentation process between tumor cells and antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) are largely unknown. We investigate the invasion behavior of attenuated Salmonella VNP20009 (VNP) into tumor cells and attempt to modulate this behavior by modifying positively charged polymers on the surface of VNP. We find that non&#8208;toxic chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) modified VNP (VNP@COS) bolsters the formation of gap junction between tumor cells and APCs by enhancing the ability of VNP to infect tumor cells. On this basis, we designed a bacterial biohybrid to promote in situ antigen cross&#8208;presentation through intracellular bacteria induced gap junction. This bacterial biohybrid also enhances the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules on the surface of tumor cells through the incorporation of Mdivi&#8208;1 coupled with VNP@COS. This strategic integration serves to heighten the immunogenic exposure of tumor antigens while preserving the cytotoxic potency of T cells. We propose a strategy to precisely controlling the function and local effects of microorganisms within tumors.

         <title>Prevented Cell Clusters&#8217; Migration Via Microdot Biomaterials for Inhibiting Scar Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cluster&#8208;like collective cell migration of fibroblasts is one of the main factors of adhesion in injured tissues. In this research, a microdot biomaterial system was constructed using &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide nanoparticles and anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles, which were prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#945;&#8208;amino acids&#8208;N&#8208;carboxylic anhydrides (NCAs) and lactide, respectively. The microdot biomaterial system slowly released functionalized polypeptides targeting mitochondria and promoting the influx of extracellular calcium ions under the inflammatory environment, thus inhibiting the expression of N&#8208;cadherin mediating cell&#8208;cell interaction, and promoting apoptosis of cluster fibroblasts, synergistically inhibiting the migration of fibroblast clusters at the site of tendon injury. Meanwhile, the anti&#8208;inflammatory micelles in the microdot biomaterial system were celecoxib (Cex) solubilized by PEG/polyester, which could improve the inflammatory microenvironment at the injury site for a long time. In vitro, the microdot biomaterial system could effectively inhibit the migration of the cluster fibroblasts by inhibiting the expression of N&#8208;cadherin between cell&#8208;cell and promoting apoptosis. In vivo, the microdot biomaterial system could promote apoptosis while achieving long&#8208;acting anti&#8208;inflammation effects, and reduce the expression of vimentin and &#945;&#8208;smooth muscle actin in fibroblasts. Thus, this microdot biomaterial system provided new ideas for the prevention and treatment of tendon adhesion by inhibiting the cluster migration of fibroblasts.

Abstract
Skin&#8208;interfaced high&#8208;sensitive biosensing systems to detect electrophysiological and biochemical signals have shown great potential in personal health monitoring and disease management. However, the integration of 3D porous nanostructures for improved sensitivity and various functional composites for signal transduction/processing/transmission often relies on different materials and complex fabrication processes, leading to weak interfaces prone to failure upon fatigue or mechanical deformations. The integrated system also needs additional adhesive to strongly conform to the human skin, which can also cause irritation, alignment issues, and motion artifacts. This work introduces a skin&#8208;attachable, reprogrammable, multifunctional, adhesive device patch fabricated by simple and low&#8208;cost laser scribing of an adhesive composite with polyimide powders and amine&#8208;based ethoxylated polyethylenimine dispersed in the silicone elastomer. The obtained laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) in the adhesive composite can be further selectively functionalized with conductive nanomaterials or enzymes for enhanced electrical conductivity or selective sensing of various sweat biomarkers. The possible combination of the sensors for real&#8208;time biofluid analysis and electrophysiological signal monitoring with RF energy harvesting and communication promises a standalone stretchable adhesive device platform based on the same material system and fabrication process.

         <title>A Solid&#8208;Liquid Bicontinuous Fiber with Strain&#8208;Insensitive Ionic Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretchable ionic conductors are crucial for enabling advanced iontronic devices to operate under diverse deformation conditions. However, when employed as interconnects, existing ionic conductors struggle to maintain stable ionic conduction under strain, hindering high&#8208;fidelity signal transmission. Here we show that strain&#8208;insensitive ionic conduction can be achieved by creating a solid&#8208;liquid bicontinuous microstructure. We fabricated a bicontinuous fiber from polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation, which contains a solid elastomer phase interpenetrated by a liquid ion&#8208;conducting phase. The spontaneous partitioning of dissolved salts leads to the formation of a robust self&#8208;wrinkled interface, fostering the development of highly tortuous ionic channels. Upon stretch, these meandering ionic channels are straightened, effectively enhancing ionic conductivities to counteract the strain effect. Remarkably, the fiber retains highly stable ionic conduction till fracture, with only 7% resistance increase at 200% strain. This approach presents a promising avenue for designing durable ionic cables capable of signal transmission with minimal strain&#8208;induced distortion.

         <title>A Multimodal Self&#8208;Propelling Tensegrity Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tensegrity structure is composed of tensile cables and compressive rods, offering high stiffness&#8208;to&#8208;mass ratio, deploy ability and excellent energy damping capability. The active and dynamic tensegrity designs demonstrate great potential for soft robots. In previous designs, the movement relied on carefully controlled input power or manually controlled light irradiation, limiting their potential applications. In this work, a hybrid tensegrity structure (HTS) is constructed by integrating thermally responsive cables, non&#8208;responsive cables and stiff rods. The HTS can self&#8208;propel continuously on a hot surface due to its unique geometry. The HTS allows for the easy achievement of multimodal self&#8208;propelled locomotive modes, which has been challenging for previously demonstrated self&#8208;propelling structures. Additionally, using Velcro tapes to adhere the rods and cables together, a modulable and re&#8208;assemblable HTS is created. The HTS introduced in this study presents a new strategy and offers a large design space for constructing self&#8208;propelling and modulable robots.

         <title>Single Layer Silk and Cotton Woven Fabrics for Acoustic Emission and Active Sound Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Whether intentionally generating acoustic waves or attempting to mitigate unwanted noise, sound control is an area of challenge and opportunity. This study investigates traditional fabrics as emitters and suppressors of sound. When attached to a single strand of a piezoelectric fiber actuator, a silk fabric emits up to 70&#160;dB of sound. Despite the complex fabric structure, vibrometer measurements reveal behavior reminiscent of a classical thin plate. Fabric pore size relative to the viscous boundary layer thickness was found&#8212;through comparative fabric analysis&#8212;to influence acoustic&#8208;emission efficiency. Sound suppression is demonstrated using two distinct mechanisms. In the first, direct acoustic interference is shown to reduce sound by up to 37 dB. The second relies on pacifying the fabric vibrations by the piezoelectric fiber, reducing the amplitude of vibration waves by 95% and attenuating the transmitted sound by up to 75%. Interestingly, this vibration&#8208;mediated suppression in principle reduces sound in an unlimited volume. It also allows the acoustic reflectivity of the fabric to be dynamically controlled, increasing by up to 68%. The sound emission and suppression efficiency of a 130&#8208;&#956;m silk fabric presents opportunities for sound control in a variety of applications ranging from apparel to transportation to architecture.

This study investigates traditional fabrics as emitters and suppressors of sound. When attached to a single strand of a piezoelectric fiber actuator, a silk fabric emits up to 70&#160;dB of sound. Despite the complex fabric structure, vibrometer measurements reveal behavior reminiscent of a classical thin plate. Fabric pore size relative to the viscous boundary layer thickness was found&#8212;through comparative fabric analysis&#8212;to influence acoustic-emission efficiency. Sound suppression is demonstrated using two distinct mechanisms. In the first, direct acoustic interference is shown to reduce sound by up to 37 dB. The second relies on pacifying the fabric vibrations by the piezoelectric fiber, reducing the amplitude of vibration waves by 95% and attenuating the transmitted sound by up to 75%. Interestingly, this vibration-mediated suppression in principle reduces sound in an unlimited volume. It also allows the acoustic reflectivity of the fabric to be dynamically controlled, increasing by up to 68%. The sound emission and suppression efficiency of a 130-&#956;m silk fabric presents opportunities for sound control in a variety of applications ranging from apparel to transportation to architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
Abstract
The musculoskeletal system, constituting the largest human physiological system, plays a critical role in providing structural support to the body, facilitating intricate movements, and safeguarding internal organs. By virtue of advancements in revolutionized materials and devices, particularly in the realms of motion capture, health monitoring, and postoperative rehabilitation, &#8220;musculoskeletal electronics&#8221; has actually emerged as an infancy area, but has not yet been explicitly proposed. In this review, we attempt to elucidate the concept of musculoskeletal electronics, and summarize the evolution history, representative progress and key strategies of the involved materials and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices. Therefore, we first introduce the fundamentals of musculoskeletal electronics and key functionality categories. Subsequently, we present recent advances in musculoskeletal electronics from the perspectives of &#8220;in&#8208;vitro&#8221; to &#8220;in&#8208;vivo&#8221; signal detection, interactive modulation, and therapeutic interventions for healing and recovery. Additionally, we propose nine strategies avenues for the development of advanced musculoskeletal electronic materials and devices. Finally, concise summaries and perspectives are proposed to highlight the directions that deserve focused attention in this booming field.

         <title>Enhancing the Thermoelectric Properties of Conjugated Polymers by Suppressing Dopant&#8208;Induced Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Doping is a crucial strategy to enhance the performance of various organic electronic devices. However, in many cases, the random distribution of dopants in conjugated polymers leads to the disruption of the polymer microstructure, severely constraining the achievable performance of electronic devices. Here, we show that by ion&#8208;exchange doping polythiophene&#8208;based P[(3HT)1&#8208;x&#8208;stat&#8208;(T)x] (x = 0 (P1), 0.12 (P2), 0.24 (P3), and 0.36 (P4)), remarkably high electrical conductivity of &gt; 400 S cm&#8722;1 and power factor of &gt;16 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 were achieved for the random copolymer P3, ranking it among highest ever reported for unaligned P3HT&#8208;based films, significantly higher than that of P1(&lt; 40 S cm&#8722;1, &lt; 4 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2). Although both polymers exhibit comparable field&#8208;effect transistor hole mobilities of ca. 0.1 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 in the pristine state, after doping, Hall effect measurements indicate that P3 exhibits a large Hall mobility up to 1.2&#8201;cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1, significantly outperforming that of P1 (0.06 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1). GIWAXS measurement determined that the in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance of doped P3 is 3.44&#197;, distinctly shorter than that of doped P1 (3.68&#197;). Our findings contribute to resolving the long&#8208;standing dopant&#8208;induced&#8208;disorder issues in P3HT and serve as an example for achieving fast charge transport in highly doped polymers for efficient electronics.

         <title>High Entropy Alloys Enable Durable and Efficient Lithium&#8208;mediated CO2 Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Designing electrocatalysts with high activity and durability for multistep reduction and oxidation reactions is challenging. High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are intriguing due to their tunable geometric and electronic structure through entropy effects. However, understanding the origin of their exceptional performance and identifying active centers is hindered by the diverse microenvironment in HEAs. Herein, we introduce NiFeCoCuRu HEAs designed with an average diameter of 2.17 nm, featuring different adsorption capacities for various reactants and intermediates in Li&#8208;mediated CO2 redox reactions. The electronegativity&#8208;dependent nature of NiFeCoCuRu HEAs induces significant charge redistribution, shifting the d&#8208;band center closer to Fermi level and forming highly active clusters of Ru, Co and Ni for Li&#8208;based compounds adsorptions. This lowers energy barriers and simultaneously stabilizes *LiCO2 and LiCO3+CO intermediates, enhancing the efficiency of both CO2 reduction and Li2CO3 decomposition over extended periods. Our work provides insights into specific active site interactions with intermediates, highlighting the potential of HEAs as promising catalysts for intricate CO2 redox reactions.

         <title>Sprayable Hydrogel Sealant for Gastrointestinal Wound Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GastroShield, an sprayable adhesive hydrogel, offers a novel solution to postoperative gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Utilizing polyethyleneimine&#8208;modified Pluronic and oxidized dextran, the hydrogel forms an instant, durable shield upon application via endoscopic spray, proven safe and effective in multiple animal models. This hydrogel uses a new approach for GI wound care, decreasing postoperative complications such as bleeding and perforation. 








Abstract
Naturally occurring internal bleeding, such as in stomach ulcers, and complications following interventions, such as polyp resection post&#8208;colonoscopy, may result in delayed (5&#8211;7 days) post&#8208;operative adverse events&#8212;such as bleeding, intestinal wall perforation, and leakage. Current solutions for controlling intra&#8208; and post&#8208;procedural complications are limited in effectiveness. Hemostatic powders only provide a temporary solution due to their short&#8208;term adhesion to GI mucosal tissues (less than 48 h). In this study, a sprayable adhesive hydrogel for facile application and sustained adhesion to GI lesions is developed using clinically available endoscopes. Upon spraying, the biomaterial (based on polyethyleneimine&#8208;modified Pluronic micelles precursor and oxidized dextran) instantly gels upon contact with the tissue, forming an adhesive shield. In vitro and in vivo studies in guinea pigs, rabbits, and pig models confirm the safety and efficacy of this biomaterial in colonic and acidic stomach lesions. The authors' findings highlight that this family of hydrogels ensures prolonged tissue protection (3&#8211;7 days), facilitates wound healing, and minimizes the risk of delayed complications. Overall, this technology offers a readily adoptable approach for gastrointestinal wound management.

         <title>Advanced Dielectric Materials for Triboelectric Nanogenerators: Principles, Methods, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in tribo&#8208;dielectric materials for TENGs are comprehensively reviewed in terms of principle, method, and application. The contact electrification and charge transport mechanism of dielectric materials for TENGs are introduced, followed by highlighting the modification mechanisms, strategies, and applications of advanced tribo&#8208;dielectrics based power sources and self&#8208;powered sensors, serving as guidelines for developing high&#8208;performance TENGs.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) manifests distinct advantages such as multiple structural selectivity, diverse selection of materials, environmental adaptability, low cost, and remarkable conversion efficiency, which becomes a promising technology for micro&#8208;nano energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing. Tribo&#8208;dielectric materials are the fundamental and core components for high&#8208;performance TENGs. In particular, the charge generation, dissipation, storage, migration of the dielectrics, and dynamic equilibrium behaviors determine the overall performance. Herein, a comprehensive summary is presented to elucidate the dielectric charge transport mechanism and tribo&#8208;dielectric material modification principle toward high&#8208;performance TENGs. The contact electrification and charge transport mechanism of dielectric materials is started first, followed by introducing the basic principle and dielectric materials of TENGs. Subsequently, modification mechanisms and strategies for high&#8208;performance tribo&#8208;dielectric materials are highlighted regarding physical/chemical, surface/bulk, dielectric coupling, and structure optimization. Furthermore, representative applications of dielectric materials based TENGs as power sources, self&#8208;powered sensors are demonstrated. The existing challenges and promising potential opportunities for advanced tribo&#8208;dielectric materials are outlined, guiding the design, fabrication, and applications of tribo&#8208;dielectric materials.

The contact electrification and charge transport mechanism of dielectric materials is started first, followed by introducing the basic principle and dielectric materials of TENGs. Subsequently, modification mechanisms and strategies for high-performance tribo-dielectric materials are highlighted regarding physical/chemical, surface/bulk, dielectric coupling, and structure optimization. Furthermore, representative applications of dielectric materials based TENGs as power sources, self-powered sensors are demonstrated. The existing challenges and promising potential opportunities for advanced tribo-dielectric materials are outlined, guiding the design, fabrication, and applications of tribo-dielectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bipolaronic Motifs Induced Spatially Separated Catalytic Sites for Tunable Syngas Photosynthesis From CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolaronic Co(II)&#8208;pyridine N motifs and Co(II)&#8208;imine N motifs are custom&#8208;designed into an imine&#8208;linked triazine covalent organic framework, resulting in an efficient reaction decoupling of CO2 reduction and water splitting. Such featured structures show efficient photocatalytic performance toward CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion with a suitable CO/H2 ratio (1:1&#8722;1:3) and can achieve a high syngas evolution rate of 15.8 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into syngas is a promising way to tackle the energy and environmental challenges; however, it remains a challenge to achieve reaction decoupling of CO2 reduction and water splitting. Therefore, efficient production of syngas with a suitable CO/H2 ratio for Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis can hardly be achieved. Herein, bipolaronic motifs including Co(II)&#8208;pyridine N motifs and Co(II)&#8208;imine N motifs are rationally designed into a crystalline imine&#8208;linked 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;5,6&#8208;dione&#8208;based covalent organic framework (bp&#8208;Co&#8208;COF) with a triazine core. These featured structures with spatially separated active sites exhibit efficient photocatalytic performance toward CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas conversion with a suitable CO/H2 ratio (1:1&#8722;1:3). The bipolaronic motifs enable a highly separated electron&#8211;hole state, whereby the Co(II)&#8208;pyridine N motifs tend to be the active sites for CO2 activation and accelerate the hydrogenation to form *COOH intermediates; whilst, the Co(II)&#8208;imine N motifs increase surface hydrophilicity for H2 evolution. The photocatalytic reductions of CO2 and H2O thus decouple and proceed via a concerted way on the bipolaronic motifs of bp&#8208;Co&#8208;COF. The optimal bp&#8208;Co&#8208;COF photocatalyst achieves a high syngas evolution rate of 15.8&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with CO/H2 ratio of 1:2, outperforming previously reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Biocompatible 2D Materials via Liquid Phase Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials can be effectively produced by liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) using different conditions. LPE generates 2D materials in aqueous solutions, represented by graphene, black phosphorus, transition metal dichalcogenides and hexagonal boron nitride, and possess a huge potential in the biomedical domain, spanning cancer therapy, drug delivery as well as antimicrobial and biosensing.








Abstract
2D materials (2DMs), such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and black phosphorus (BP), have been proposed for different types of bioapplications, owing to their unique physicochemical, electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE), as one of the most effective up&#8208;scalable and size&#8208;controllable methods, is becoming the standard process to produce high quantities of various 2DM types as it can benefit from the use of green and biocompatible conditions. The resulting exfoliated layered materials have garnered significant attention because of their biocompatibility and their potential use in biomedicine as new multimodal therapeutics, antimicrobials, and biosensors. This review focuses on the production of LPE&#8208;assisted 2DMs in aqueous solutions with or without the aid of surfactants, bioactive, or non&#8208;natural molecules, providing insights into the possibilities of applications of such materials in the biological and biomedical fields.

         <title>Trichome&#8208;Like Biomimetic Air Filters via Templated Silicone Nanofilaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Air pollution threats to human health have increased the awareness on the role of filter units in air cleaning applications. As an ideal energy&#8208;saving strategy for air filters, the slip effect on nanofiber surfaces can potentially overcome the trade&#8208;off between filtration efficiency and pressure drop. However, the potential of the slip effect in nanofibrous structures is significantly limited by the tight nanofiber stacks. In this study, trichome&#8208;like biomimetic (TLB) air filters with 3D&#8208;templated silicone nanofilaments (average diameter: &#8764;74 nm) are prepared based on an in situ chemical vapor deposition method inspired by plant purification. Theoretical modeling and experimental results indicate that TLB air filters make significant use of the slip effect to overcome the efficiency&#8208;resistance tradeoff. The selectable filter class (up to U15, &#8764;99.9995%) allows TLB air filters to meet various requirements, and their integral filtration performance surpasses that of most commodity air filters, including melt&#8208;blown cloth, ePTFE membranes, electrospun mats, and glass fiber paper. The proposed strategy directly transforms commercial filter media and filters into TLB air filters using a bottom&#8208;up, one&#8208;step approach. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, reusable N95 respirators and air purifiers equipped with TLB air filters are fabricated, overcoming the limitations of existing filter designs and fabrication methods.

         <title>STING Membrane Prevents Post&#8208;Surgery Tissue Adhesion and Tumor Recurrence of Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel stimulator of interferon genes &#8220;STING&#8221; membrane is developed to overcome colorectal cancer recurrence and post&#8208;surgery tissue adhesion. The gambogic acid prodrug and STING agonist are continuously released from the core and shell layers, respectively, efficiently inducing immunogenic cell death of cancer cells and evoking the systemic anticancer immunity by activating the Cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) synthase/STING pathway.








Abstract
Surgery is the standard treatment regimen for resectable colorectal cancer (CRC). However, it is very hard to completely remove all cancer cells in clinical practice, leading to the high recurrence rates of the disease. Moreover, the post&#8208;surgery tissue adhesion greatly prevents the possibility of reoperation, significantly limiting the long&#8208;term surviving of CRC patients. To overcome CRC recurrence and avoid the post&#8208;surgery tissue adhesion, this work develops a novel stimulator of interferon genes &#8220;STING&#8221; membrane based on the coaxial electrospinning technology and hyaluronic acid modification. A reactive oxygen species responsive prodrug of gambogic acid (GB) and a potent STING agonist (CDN) are coloaded in the core&#8211;shell structure of the membrane, which endows the loaded drug with sustained and sequential release patterns. The localized delivery of GB and CDN can selectively induce efficient immunogenic cell death of cancer cells and then evoke the systemic anticancer immunity by activating the Cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP (cGAMP) synthase/STING pathway. As&#8208;designed &#8220;STING&#8221; membrane not only safely prevents tumor recurrence through the synergistic chemoimmunotherapy but also efficiently avoids the post&#8208;surgery tissue adhesion, facilitating the clinical intervention of CRC.

         <title>Experimental Demonstration of Reservoir Computing with Self&#8208;Assembled Percolating Networks of Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The complex self&#8208;assembled network of neurons and synapses that comprizes the biological brain enables natural information processing with remarkable efficiency. Percolating Networks of Nanoparticles (PNNs) are complex self&#8208;assembled nanoscale systems that have been shown to possess many promising brain&#8208;like attributes and which are therefore appealing systems for neuromorphic computation. Here we perform experiments that show that PNNs can be utilized as physical reservoirs within a nanoelectronic reservoir computing framework and demonstrate successful computation for several benchmark tasks (chaotic time series prediction, non&#8208;linear transformation and memory capacity). For each task we compile relevant literature results and show that the performance of the PNNs compares favourably to that previously reported from nanoelectronic reservoirs. We then demonstrate experimentally that PNNs can be used for spoken digit recognition with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art accuracy. Finally, we emulate a parallel reservoir architecture, which increases the dimensionality and richness of the reservoir outputs and results in further improvements in performance across all tasks.

         <title>Stabilization of Lattice Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Oxophilic Ce&#8208;mediated Bi/BiCeO1.8H Electrocatalysts for Efficient Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>

Abstract
The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) offers an efficient reaction pathway for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in energy storage and conversion systems. Owing to the involvement of active lattice oxygen that enhances electrochemical activity in this approach, addressing the structural and electrochemical stabilities of LOM materials is crucial. Therefore, it is important to devise effective strategies for activating lattice oxygen in such materials while minimizing material deformations and ion elution. Herein, a heterostructure (Bi/BiCeO1.8H) containing abundant under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms having oxygen nonbonding states is synthesized by a simple electrochemical deposition method. Given the difference in reduction potentials between Bi and Ce, partially reduced Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms are generated in BiCeO1.8H. It is found that the lattice oxygen can also be activated as a reactant of the OER when the valence state of Bi increases to Bi5+, increasing metal&#8211;oxygen covalency and that the oxophilic Ce3+/4+ redox couple allows maintaining the Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms by preventing over&#8208;oxidation of Bi. As a demonstration of the practical applications, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) with Bi/BiCeO1.8H as the anode is analyzed. The AEMWE exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V even at a high practical current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the cell performance remains significantly stable over 100 h with only a 2.2% increase in the initial cell voltage, demonstrating sustainable lattice oxygen redox.

         <title>Skin&#8208;Inspired All&#8208;Natural Biogel for Bioadhesive Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Natural material&#8208;based hydrogels are considered ideal candidates for constructing robust bio&#8208;interfaces due to their environmentally sustainable nature and biocompatibility. However, these hydrogels often encounter limitations such as weak mechanical strength, low water resistance, and poor ionic conductivity. Here, inspired by the role of natural moisturizing factor (NMF) in skin, we propose a straightforward yet versatile strategy for fabricating all&#8208;natural ionic biogels that exhibit high resilience, ionic conductivity, resistance to dehydration, and complete degradability, without necessitating any chemical modification. A well&#8208;balanced combination of gelatin and sodium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (an NMF compound) gives rise to a significant enhancement in the mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, and water retention capacity of the biogel compared to pure gelatin hydrogel. The biogel manifests temperature&#8208;controlled reversible fluid&#8208;gel transition properties attributed to the triple&#8208;helix junctions of gelatin, which enables in situ gelation on diverse substrates, thereby ensuring conformal contact and dynamic compliance with curved surfaces. Due to its salutary properties, the biogel can serve as an effective and biocompatible interface for high&#8208;quality and long&#8208;term electrophysiological signal recording. These findings provide a general and scalable approach for designing natural material&#8208;based hydrogels with tailored functionalities to meet diverse application needs.

         <title>Mechanical Control of Quantum Transport in Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs) are fundamentally electro&#8208;mechanical systems. Their environment unavoidably strains them and modifies their quantum transport properties. For instance, a simple uniaxial strain could completely turn off the conductance of ballistic graphene or switch on/off the superconducting phase of magic&#8208;angle bilayer graphene. This article reports measurements of quantum transport in strained graphene transistors which agree quantitatively with models based on mechanically&#8208;induced gauge potentials. A scalar potential is mechanically induced in&#8208;situ to modify graphene's work function by up to 25 meV. Mechanically generated vector potentials suppress the ballistic conductance of graphene by up to 30 % and control its quantum interferences. The data were measured with a custom experimental platform able to precisely tune both the mechanics and electrostatics of suspended graphene transistors at low&#8208;temperature over a broad range of strain (up to 2.6 %). This work opens many opportunities to harness quantitative strain effects in 2DM quantum transport and&#160;technologies.

         <title>Fast and Slow&#8208;Twitch Actuation via Twisted Liquid Crystal Elastomer Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisted fibers composed of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) mimic the fast and slow twitch response of biological muscle typology. Distinctive geometrical transformation enhance the actuation stroke magnitude, stroke rate,&#160;and work output.








Abstract
The performance of robotic systems can benefit from low&#8208;density material actuators that emulate muscle typology (e.g., fast and slow twitch) of natural systems. Recent reports detail the thermomechanical, chemical, electrical, and pneumatic response of twisted and coiled fibers. The geometrical constraints imparted on typically commodity materials realize distinguished stimuli&#8208;induced actuation including low density, high force, and moderate stroke. Here, actuators are prepared by twisting fibers composed of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs). The actuators combine the inherent stimuli&#8208;response of LCEs with the geometrical constraints of twisted fiber actuators to dramatically increase the deformation rate, specific work, and achievable force output. In some geometries, the thermomechanical response of the LCE exhibits a pseudo&#8208;first&#8208;order transition.

         <title>A Natural Casein&#8208;Based Separator with Brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar Structure for Stable, High&#8208;Rate Proton Batteries</title>

Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous proton batteries with small organic molecule anodes are currently considered promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their low cost, stable safety and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application is limited by the poor cycling stability caused by the shuttling of soluble organic molecules between electrodes. Herein, a cell separator is modified by a GO&#8208;casein&#8208;Cu2+ layer with a brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar structure to inhibit the shuttling of small organic molecules. Experimental and calculation results indicate that, attributed to the synergistic effect of physical blocking of casein molecular chains and electrostatic and coordination interactions of Cu2+, bulk dissolution and shuttling of multiple small molecules can be inhibited simultaneously while H+ transfer across the separators is not almost affected. With the protection of the GO&#8208;casein&#8208;Cu2+ separator, soluble small molecules such as diquinoxalino[2,3&#8208;a:2',3'&#8208;c]phenazine,2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexacyano (6CN&#8208;DQPZ) exhibit a high reversible capacity of 262.6 mA h g&#8722;1 and amazing stability (capacity retention of 92.9% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). In addition, this strategy has also been proved available to other active conjugated small molecules, such as indanthrone (IDT), providing a general green sustainable strategy for advancing the use of small organic molecule electrodes in proton cells.

         <title>Chain&#8208;Like Semiconductive Fillers for Dielectric Enhancement and Loss Reduction of Polymer Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of chain&#8208;like nanofibers (TiO2 and TINO) are synthesized by electrospinning for the dielectric composites. The intrinsic high&#8208;temperature loss tangent is effectively reduced by the atomic layer deposition&#8208;coated alumina shells on the nanofibers, which blocks carrier movement across the interfaces. The transformed crystalline porous alumina can further reduce dielectric loss by isolating the polymer from the nanofibers.








Abstract
Dielectric loss is a crucial factor in determining the long&#8208;term endurance for security and energy loss of dielectric composites. Here, chain&#8208;like semiconductive fibers of titanium oxide, indium, and niobium&#8208;doped titanium oxide are used for enhancing the complex dielectric properties of a polymer through composite construction, which involves significant interface enhancements. The chain&#8208;like fibers significantly enhance the dielectric constant owing to the special morphology of the fillers and their interfacial polarization, especially at higher temperatures. The dielectric loss and electrical conductivity of the composites are substantially reduced across the entire investigated temperature range, achieved by passivating the fiber surface with an alumina shell using atomic layer deposition. The as&#8208;deposited alumina shell transformed from an amorphous to a crystalline phase through thermal annealing results in a porous shell and more effective suppression of the loss tangent and electrical conductivity. A plausible mechanism for loss suppression is associated with carrier movement along the surface of the fibers and bulk, leading to a higher loss tangent. The alumina shell blocks the carrier transport path, particularly at the interfaces, resulting in a reduced interfacial polarization contribution and energy storage loss.

     alt="Chain-Like Semiconductive Fillers for Dielectric Enhancement and Loss Reduction of Polymer Composites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two types of chain-like nanofibers (TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and TINO) are synthesized by electrospinning for the dielectric composites. The intrinsic high-temperature loss tangent is effectively reduced by the atomic layer deposition-coated alumina shells on the nanofibers, which blocks carrier movement across the interfaces. The transformed crystalline porous alumina can further reduce dielectric loss by isolating the polymer from the nanofibers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dielectric loss is a crucial factor in determining the long-term endurance for security and energy loss of dielectric composites. Here, chain-like semiconductive fibers of titanium oxide, indium, and niobium-doped titanium oxide are used for enhancing the complex dielectric properties of a polymer through composite construction, which involves significant interface enhancements. The chain-like fibers significantly enhance the dielectric constant owing to the special morphology of the fillers and their interfacial polarization, especially at higher temperatures. The dielectric loss and electrical conductivity of the composites are substantially reduced across the entire investigated temperature range, achieved by passivating the fiber surface with an alumina shell using atomic layer deposition. The as-deposited alumina shell transformed from an amorphous to a crystalline phase through thermal annealing results in a porous shell and more effective suppression of the loss tangent and electrical conductivity. A plausible mechanism for loss suppression is associated with carrier movement along the surface of the fibers and bulk, leading to a higher loss tangent. The alumina shell blocks the carrier transport path, particularly at the interfaces, resulting in a reduced interfacial polarization contribution and energy storage loss. This study provides a method for inhibiting dielectric loss by fabricating fillers with special surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Microsensors Inspired by Noctiluca Scintillans for Small&#8208;Defect Positioning and Electrical&#8208;Stress Visualization in Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a novel self&#8208;reporting microsensor (SRM) inspired by noctiluca scintillans for addressing the critical need to visualize small defects and electrical stress in dielectric polymers. The SRM couples nearby electric field energy to emit measurable fluorescence, presenting a distinct distribution of invisible electric field in polymers for the first time.








Abstract
Small defects induce concentrated electrical stress in dielectric polymers, leading to premature failure of materials. Existing sensing methods fail to effectively visualize these defects owing to the invisible&#8208;energy state of the electric field. Thus, it is necessary to establish a nondestructive method for the real&#8208;time detection of small defects in dielectric polymers. In this study, a self&#8208;reporting microsensor (SRM) inspired by Noctiluca scintillans is designed to endow materials with the ability of self&#8208;detection for defects and electrical stress. The SRM leverages the energy of a nearby electric field to emit measurable fluorescence, enabling defect localization and diagnosis as well as electrical&#8208;stress visualization. A controllable dielectric microsphere is constructed to achieve an adjustable electroluminescence threshold for the SRM, thereby increasing its detection accuracy while decreasing the electroluminescence threshold. The potential degradation in the polymer performance owing to SRM implantation is addressed by assembling long molecular chains on the SRM surface to spontaneously generate an interpenetrating network. Results of finite element analyses and experiments demonstrate that the SRM can effectively realize nondestructive visualization and positioning of small defects and concentrated electrical stress in polymers, positioning it as a promising sensing method for monitoring the electric field and charge distribution in materials.

         <title>Breaking Fundamental Limitation of Flow&#8208;Induced Anisotropic Growth for Large&#8208;Scale and Fast Printing of Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Films</title>

Abstract
Advanced organic electronic technologies have put forward a pressing demand for cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;throughput fabrication of organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs). However, solution&#8208;printed OSCFs are typically plagued by the existence of abundant structural defects, which pose a formidable challenge to achieving large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;performance organic electronics. Here, we elucidate that these structural defects are mainly originated from printing flow&#8208;induced anisotropic growth, an important factor that has been overlooked for too long. In light of this, we propose a surfactant&#8208;additive printing method to effectively overcome the anisotropic growth, enabling the deposition of uniform OSCFs over the wafer scale at a high speed of 1.2 mm s&#8722;1 at room temperature. The resulting OSCF exhibits appealing performance with a high average mobility up to 10.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is one of the highest values for flexible organic field&#8208;effect transistor arrays. Moreover, we realize large&#8208;scale OSCF&#8208;based flexible logic circuits, which can be bent without degradation to a radius as small as 4.0 mm and over 1000 cycles. Our work provides profound insights into breaking the limitation of flow&#8208;induced anisotropic growth and opens new avenues for printing large&#8208;scale organic single&#8208;crystal electronics.

         <title>Photothermal Mineralization of Polyolefin Microplastics via TiO2 Hierarchical Porous Layer&#8208;Based Semiwetting Air&#8208;Plastic&#8208;Solid Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photo&#8208;mineralization of microplastics under mild conditions has emerged as a promising solution to plastic waste disposal. However, the inadequate contact between oxygen, water&#8208;insoluble polyolefin microplastics, and photocatalysts remains a critical issue. In this study, we present a TiO2 hierarchical porous layer (TiO2&#8208;HPL) photocatalyst to establish air&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid triphase interfaces for the photothermal mineralization of polyolefins. The wettability of the TiO2&#8208;HPL&#8208;based triphase interface is finely controlled from plastophobic to plastophilic. High&#8208;resolution imaging and finite element simulation demonstrate the significance of a semiwetting state in achieving multidirectional oxygen diffusion through the hierarchical pore structure while maintaining sufficient contact between the plastic phase and photocatalysts. For low&#8208;density polyethylene, the TiO2&#8208;HPL achieves a photothermal mineralization rate of 5.63 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a conversion of 26.3% after 20 hours of continuous irradiation. Additionally, the triphase photocatalytic system with semiwetting gas&#8208;plastic&#8208;solid interfaces shows good universality for various polyolefin reagents and products, illustrating its potential in achieving efficient photothermal mineralization of non&#8208;degradable microplastics.

Abstract
This study presents a straightforward and efficient synthetic approach for producing high&#8208;yield, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use, free&#8208;standing super&#8208;powder. The synthesis protocol demonstrates versatility, enabling the creation of assemblies from various nanoparticle morphologies and compositions without the need for specific substrates. Au nanorings are employed as building blocks for fabricating the super&#8208;powder, which can be used in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The distinctive aspect ratio of the ring nanoframes allows the formation of densely packed columnar assemblies on the substrate, aligning the exposed gaps perpendicular to the laser beam. This arrangement significantly enhances the charge separation among nanorings, leading to a highly focused near&#8208;field that is applicable to SERS analysis. The SERS detection feasibility of this powder in both pre&#8208; and post&#8208;contamination conditions is demonstrated. Using a wide range of building blocks, encompassing various shapes (for instance, rods, hexagons, cubes, cuboctahedrons, elongated dodecahedrons, triangular rings, double&#8208;rings, elongated dodecahedra frames, cuboctahedra frames, and double&#8208;walled frames), we substantiate the generalizability of the process for synthesizing super&#8208;powders with diverse morphologies.

         <title>Heterogeneous Nucleating Agent for High&#8208;Boiling&#8208;Point Nonhalogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents are superior solvents to produce large&#8208;area organic solar cells (OSCs) in industry because of their wide processing window and low toxicity. While these solvents with slow evaporation kinetics will lead excessive aggregation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art small molecule acceptors (e.g. L8&#8208;BO), delivering serious efficiency losses. Here, we developed a heterogeneous nucleating agent strategy by grafting oligo (ethylene glycol) side&#8208;chains on L8&#8208;BO (BTO&#8208;BO). The formation energy of the obtained BTO&#8208;BO, while changing from liquid in a solvent to a crystalline phase, was lower than that of L8&#8208;BO irrespective of the solvent type. When BTO&#8208;BO was added as the third component into the active layer (e.g. PM6:L8&#8208;BO), it easily assembled to form numerous seed crystals, which served as nucleation sites to trigger heterogeneous nucleation and increase nucleation density of L8&#8208;BO through strong hydrogen bonding interactions even in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents. Therefore, it can effectively suppress excessive aggregation during growth, achieving ideal phase&#8208;separation active layer with small domain sizes and high crystallinity. The resultant toluene&#8208;processed OSCs exhibited a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.42% (certificated 19.12%) with excellent operational stability. The strategy also has superior advantages in large&#8208;scale devices, showing a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module with a record PCE of 16.35% (certificated 15.97%).

         <title>The Role Of Side Chains and Hydration on Mixed Charge Transport in N&#8208;Type Polymer Films</title>

Abstract
Introducing ethylene glycol (EG) side chains to a conjugated polymer backbone is a well&#8208;established synthetic strategy for designing organic mixed ion&#8208;electron conductors (OMIECs). However, the impact that film swelling has on mixed conduction properties has yet to be scoped, particularly for electron&#8208;transporting (n&#8208;type) OMIECs. Here, we investigate the effect of the length of branched EG chains on mixed charge transport of n&#8208;type OMIECs based on a naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;tetracarboxylic&#8208;diimide&#8208;bithiophene backbone. We use atomic force microscopy, grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS), and scanning tunneling microscopy to establish the similarities between the common&#8208;backbone films in dry conditions. Electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitori1ng (EQCM&#8208;D) and in situ GIWAXS measurements reveal stark changes in film swelling properties and microstructure during electrochemical doping, depending on the side chain length. We find that even in the loss of the crystallite content upon contact with the aqueous electrolyte, the films can effectively transport charges and that it is rather the high water content that harms the electronic interconnectivity within the OMIEC films. These results highlight the importance of controlling water uptake in the films to impede the charge transport in n&#8208;type electrochemical devices.

         <dc:description>
A Pt(O^N^C^N) complex (tetra&#8208;Pt&#8208;dbf) with high intermolecular bonding energy, exhibiting efficient emission in both monomer and aggregate states, is designed. Color&#8208;tunable OLEDs (CT&#8208;OLEDs) with single tetra&#8208;Pt&#8208;dbf, achieving large color&#8208;tuning range, high maximum EQE (30%), and excellent lifetime (&gt;500,000 hours), are fabricated. Electromyography&#8208;visualization system equipped with CT&#8208;OLED provides a viable option for CT&#8208;OLED applications in wearable biomedical sensors.








Abstract
Color&#8208;tunable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CT&#8208;OLEDs) have a large color&#8208;tuning range, high efficiency and operational stability at practical luminance, making them ideal for human&#8208;machine interactive terminals of wearable biomedical devices. However, the device operational lifetime of CT&#8208;OLEDs is currently far from reaching practical requirements. To address this problem, a tetradentate Pt(II) complex named tetra&#8208;Pt&#8208;dbf, which can emit efficiently in both monomer and aggregation states, is designed. This emitter has high Td of 508&#160;&#176;C and large intermolecular bonding energy of &#8208;52.0&#160;kcal&#160;mol&#8315;1, which improve its thermal/chemical stability. This unique single&#8208;emitter CT&#8208;OLED essentially avoids the &#8220;color&#8208;aging issue&#8221; and achieves a large color&#8208;tuning span (red to yellowish green) and a high external quantum efficiency &#65288;EQE&#65289; of &#8776;30% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 as well as an EQE of above 25% at 10000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. A superior LT90 operational lifetime of 520,536 h at a functional luminance of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which is over 20 times longer than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CT&#8208;OLEDs, is estimated. To demonstrate the potential application of such OLEDs in wearable biomedical devices, a simple electromyography (EMG)&#8208;visualization system is fabricated using the CT&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable Perylene Diimide Trimer Material for N&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of creating air&#8208;stable small&#8208;molecule n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors is reported with helical perylene&#8208;diimide trimer (hPDI[3]) as the model material. Alkyl sidechains are grafted onto the molecular semiconductors to increase its thin&#8208;film solution processability, then removed to create films with better ion transport and stability. High&#8208;transconductance organic electrochemical transistors are made with side&#8208;chainless hPDI[3] as the active material.








Abstract
A new method is reported to make air&#8208;stable n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor (OMIEC) films for organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) using a solution&#8208;processable small molecule helical perylene diimide trimer, hPDI[3]&#8208;C11. Alkyl side chains are attached to the conjugated core for processability and film making, which are then cleaved via thermal annealing. After the sidechains are removed, the hPDI[3] film becomes less hydrophobic, more ordered, and has a deeper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). These features provide improved ionic transport, greater electronic mobility, and increased stability in air and in aqueous solution. Subsequently, hPDI[3]&#8208;H is used as the active material in OECTs and a device with a transconductance of 44 mS, volumetric capacitance of &#8776;250 F cm&#8722;3, &#181;C* value of 1 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and excellent stability (&gt; 5 weeks) is demonstrated. As proof of their practical applications, a hPDI[3]&#8208;H&#8208;based OECTs as a glucose sensor and electrochemical inverter is utilized. The approach of side chain removal after film formation charts a path to a wide range of molecular semiconductors to be used as stable, mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors.

         <title>Revitalizing Oxygen Reduction Reactivity of Composite Oxide Electrodes via Electrochemically Deposited PrOx Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Presents a concise, straightforward approach and mechanistic insight that enables high activity in all&#8208;ceramic electrodes, providing both industrial and academic value. An old&#8208;fashioned composite oxide cathode (i.e., LSM&#8211;YSZ) in which a Pr&#8208;based nanocatalyst is introduced using an &#8216;electrochemical deposition approach&#8217; shows reinvigorated electrochemical performance, shedding new light on its potential as an air electrode.








Abstract
Solid oxide fuel cells that operate at intermediate temperatures require efficient catalysts to enhance the inherently poor electrochemical activity of the composite electrodes. Here, a simple and practical electrochemical deposition method is presented for fabricating a PrOx overlayer on lanthanum strontium manganite&#8211;yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia (LSM&#8211;YSZ) composite electrodes. The method requires less than four minutes for completion and can be carried out under at ambient temperature and pressure. Crucially, the treatment significantly improves the electrode's performance without requiring heat treatment or other supplementary processes. The PrOx&#8208;coated LSM&#8211;YSZ electrode exhibits an 89% decrease in polarization resistance at 650&#160;&#176;C (compared to an untreated electrode), maintaining a tenfold reduction after &#8776;400&#160;h. Transmission line model analysis using impedance spectra confirms how PrOx coating improved the oxygen reduction reaction activity. Further, tests with anode&#8208;supported single cells reveal an outstanding peak power density compared to those of other LSM&#8211;YSZ&#8208;based cathodes (e.g., 418&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, it is demonstrated that multicomponent coating, such as (Pr,Ce)Ox, can also be obtained with this method. Overall, the observations offer a promising route for the development of high&#8208;performance solid oxide fuel cells.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal Linear Array Detector for High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>

Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional Bi&#8208;based 329&#8208;type halide perovskite is demonstrated as a promising semiconductor for X&#8208;ray detection due to its strong X&#8208;ray absorption, superior stability, availability of large single crystals (SCs) and solution processibility at low temperature. However, its low mobility&#8208;lifetime product (&#956;&#964;) limits its further improvement in detection sensitivity. Based on the first&#8208;principles calculations, we designed a new two&#8208;dimensional Bi&#8208;based 329&#8208;type halide perovskite using a mixed&#8208;halide&#8208;induced structural dimension regulation strategy. By using a continuous supply of a precursor solution, we successfully grew inch&#8208;sized high&#8208;quality SCs. These SCs exhibit large &#956;&#964; product, high resistivity, and low ion migration. The detectors fabricated using the SCs show X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity as high as 24,509 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, short response time of 315 &#956;s, low detection limit of 4.3 nGy s&#8722;1, and superior stability. These properties are the best among all lead&#8208;free perovskite detectors and are comparable to those of the best lead&#8208;based perovskite detectors. The linear array detector assembled on the SCs for the first time also show a high spatial resolution of 10.6 lp mm&#8722;1 during X&#8208;ray imaging. The high performance combined with superior stability of these new 329&#8208;type lead&#8208;free halide perovskite SCs is expected to promote a new generation of X&#8208;ray detection technologies.

         <title>Universal Design Strategy for air&#8208;Stable Layered Na&#8208;ion Cathodes towards Sustainable Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) are considered to be sustainable alternatives to the current Li&#8208;ion technologies for energy storage systems, and even for electric vehicles, due to the abundant and widely distributed resources. However, the most promising cathode materials of NIBs so far, i.e., O3 layered oxides, are still suffering from serious air instability issue, which not only significantly increases the manufactural cost because of the long&#8208;term use of dry rooms in mass production, but also leads to a massive upsurge in energy consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions, going against the sustainable objective of NIBs. While some feasible strategies have been proposed via case studies, there lacks fundamental understandings in the correlations between air stability and materials&#8217; composition, therefore universal design strategies are yet to be established. Herein, we investigate the air degradation origins and mechanisms of O3 cathodes in&#8208;depth via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, and propose the Bond Dissociation Energy as an effective descriptor for predicting the air stability. We then validated experimentally in various unary, binary, and ternary O3 cathodes that the air stability can indeed be effectively improved via simple compositional design. Guided by the predictive model, the designed material can be stored in air for over 30 days without structural or electrochemical degradation, therefore confirming the accuracy and universality of our theory. Moreover, based on real&#8208;world data, it is calculated that such air&#8208;stable cathodes can significantly facilitate reductions in both energy consumption (&#8764; 4,100,000&#160;kWh) and carbon footprint (&#8764; 2,200&#8208;ton CO2) annually for a 2 GWh Na&#8208;ion batteries manufactory. Therefore, the fundamental understandings and universal design strategy presented in this work open up an avenue for rational materials design of NIBs towards both elemental and manufactural sustainability.

&lt;p&gt;Na-ion batteries (NIBs) are considered to be sustainable alternatives to the current Li-ion technologies for energy storage systems, and even for electric vehicles, due to the abundant and widely distributed resources. However, the most promising cathode materials of NIBs so far, i.e., O3 layered oxides, are still suffering from serious air instability issue, which not only significantly increases the manufactural cost because of the long-term use of dry rooms in mass production, but also leads to a massive upsurge in energy consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions, going against the sustainable objective of NIBs. While some feasible strategies have been proposed via case studies, there lacks fundamental understandings in the correlations between air stability and materials&#8217; composition, therefore universal design strategies are yet to be established. Herein, we investigate the air degradation origins and mechanisms of O3 cathodes in-depth via combined first-principles and experimental approaches, and propose the Bond Dissociation Energy as an effective descriptor for predicting the air stability. We then validated experimentally in various unary, binary, and ternary O3 cathodes that the air stability can indeed be effectively improved via simple compositional design. Guided by the predictive model, the designed material can be stored in air for over 30 days without structural or electrochemical degradation, therefore confirming the accuracy and universality of our theory.

         <title>Two&#8208;Terminal Perovskite Optoelectronic Synapse for Rapid Trained Neuromorphic Computation with High Accuracy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Emerging neural morphological vision sensors inspired by biological systems that integrate image perception, memory, and information computing are expected to transform the landscape of machine vision and artificial intelligence. However, stable and reconfigurable light&#8208;induced synaptic behavior always relies on independent gateport modulation. Despite its potential, the limitations of uncontrollable defects and ionic characteristics have led to simpler, smaller, and more integration&#8208;friendly two&#8208;terminal devices being used as sidelines. In this work, the synergy between ion migration barriers and readout voltage was proven to be the key to realizing stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current in two&#8208;terminal devices. Following the same mechanism, optical and electrical signal synchronous triggering is proposed to serve as a preprocessing method to achieve a recognition accuracy of 96.5%. Impressively, the gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs. The PSC modulation potential under short optical pulse of 20 ns is also revealed. This optoelectronic device with perception, memory, and computation capabilities can promote the development of new devices for future photonic neural morphological circuits and artificial vision.

         <title>Mechanical Performance of Copper&#8208;Nanocluster&#8208;Polymer Nanolattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report a type of copper&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;polymer composites and showcase that their 3D nanolattices exhibit a superior combination of high strength, toughness, deformability, resilience and damage&#8208;tolerance. Notably, the strength and toughness of ultralight copper&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;polymer nanolattices in some cases surpass current best performers, including alumina, nickel, and other ceramic or metallic lattices at low densities. Additionally, copper&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;polymer nanolattices are super&#8208;resilient, crack&#8208;resistant, and one&#8208;step printed under ambient condition which can be easily integrated into sophisticated microsystems as highly effective internal protectors. Our findings suggest that, unlike traditional nanocomposites, the laser&#8208;induced interface and the high fraction of ultrasmall Cu15 nanoclusters as crosslinking junctions contribute to the marked nonlinear elasticity of copper&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;polymer network, which synergizes with the lattice&#8208;topology effect and culminates in the exceptional mechanical performance.

         <title>Realization of Fine&#8208;tuning the Lattice Thermal Conductivity and Anharmonicity in Layered Semiconductors via Entropy Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Entropy engineering has been widely proven to be effective in achieving ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity for well&#8208;performed thermoelectric and heat management applications. However, no strong correlation between entropy and lattice thermal conductivity has been found until now, and the fine&#8208;tuning of thermal conductivity continuously via entropy&#8208;engineering in a wide entropy range is still lacking. Here, a series of high&#8208;entropy layered semiconductors, Ni1&#8208;x(Fe0.25Co0.25Mn0.25Zn0.25)xPS3, where 0 &#8804; x &lt; 1, with low mass/size disorder is designed. High&#8208;purity samples with mixing configuration entropy of metal atomic site in a wide range of 0&#8211;1.61R are achieved. Umklapp phonon&#8208;phonon scattering is found to be the dominating phonon scattering mechanism, as revealed by the linear T&#8722;1 dependence of thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, fine&#8208;tuning of the lattice thermal conductivity via continuous entropy engineering at metal atomic sites is achieved, in an almost linear dependence in middle&#8208;/high&#8208; entropy range. Moreover, the slope of the &#954;&#160;&#8208; T&#8722;1 curve reduces with the increase in entropy, and a linear response of the reduced Gr&#252;neisen parameter is revealed. Our work provides an entropy engineering strategy by choosing multiple metal elements with low mass/size disorder to achieve the fine&#8208;tuning of the lattice thermal conductivity and the anharmonic effect.

         <title>Anomalous detachment behavior and directional reconstruction regulation of leaching&#8208;type precatalysts for industrial water electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current reconstruction chemistry studies are mainly operated at the laboratory scale, where the operating parameters are significantly different from those used in industrial water electrolyzer. This gap leads to unclear reconstruction behaviors under industrial conditions and constrains the realistic application of catalysts. Here, we present a new reconstruction mechanism with phase separation behavior and anomalous detachment phenomena observed in leaching&#8208;type oxygen&#8208;evolving precatalysts under industrial conditions, different from the reported results obtained under laboratory conditions. The identified detachment issues are closely linked to the production of a separate phase (K2BDC, 71.8% by volume), which proves sensitive to the local environment and its instability easily leads to catalyst breakage and stripping from the substrate.

Under industrial conditions, the coupled electrolyser delivers an industrial&#8208;level current density at low cell voltage with prolonged durability, 1 A cm&#8722;2 at 2 V for over 340 hours.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current reconstruction chemistry studies are mainly operated at the laboratory scale, where the operating parameters are significantly different from those used in industrial water electrolyzer. This gap leads to unclear reconstruction behaviors under industrial conditions and constrains the realistic application of catalysts. Here, we present a new reconstruction mechanism with phase separation behavior and anomalous detachment phenomena observed in leaching-type oxygen-evolving precatalysts under industrial conditions, different from the reported results obtained under laboratory conditions. The identified detachment issues are closely linked to the production of a separate phase (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDC, 71.8% by volume), which proves sensitive to the local environment and its instability easily leads to catalyst breakage and stripping from the substrate. By establishing the detachment critical point and operating parameter-detachment correlation, a targeted reconstruction strategy is proposed to achieve smooth ligand leaching and effectively solve the detachment issue. Theoretical analyses validate the dual-site regulation in directionally reconstructed catalyst, optimizing intermediate adsorption and enhancing catalytic kinetics. Under industrial conditions, the coupled electrolyser delivers an industrial-level current density at low cell voltage with prolonged durability, 1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 2 V for over 340 hours. This work bridges the gap of leaching-type precatalysts between laboratory test conditions and industrial operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP) using forest&#8208;drawn CNT sheet onto thermally drawn polymer fiber for long&#8208;term in vivo operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Neural probe engineering is a dynamic field, driving innovation in neuroscience and addressing scientific and medical demands. Recent advancements involve integrating nanomaterials to improve performance, aiming for sustained in vivo functionality. However, challenges persist due to size, stiffness, complexity, and manufacturing intricacies. To address these issues, we propose a neural interface utilizing freestanding CNT&#8208;sheets drawn from CNT&#8208;forests integrated onto thermally drawn functional polymer fibers. This approach yields a device with structural alignment, resulting in exceptional electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties while retaining biocompatibility for prolonged periods of implantation. This Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP) employing forest&#8208;drawn CNT sheets demonstrates in vivo capabilities in neural recording, neurotransmitter detection, and brain/spinal cord circuit manipulation via optogenetics, maintaining functionality for over a year post&#8208;implantation. The straightforward fabrication method's versatility, coupled with the device's functional reliability, underscores the significance of this technique in the next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;based implants. Moreover, the device's longevity and multifunctionality positions it as a promising platform for long&#8208;term neuroscience research.

         <title>Fast Na+ Kinetics and Suppressed Voltage Hysteresis Enabled by a High&#8208;Entropy Strategy for Sodium Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
O3&#8208;type layered transition metal cathodes are promising energy storage materials due to their sufficient sodium reservoir. However, sluggish sodium ions kinetics and large voltage hysteresis, which are generally associated with Na+ diffusion properties and electrochemical phase transition reversibility, drastically minimize energy density, reduce energy efficiency, and hinder further commercialization of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Here we propose a high&#8208;entropy tailoring strategy through manipulating the electronic local environment within transition metal slabs to circumvent these issues. Experimental analysis combined with theoretical calculations verified that high&#8208;entropy metal ion mixing contributes to the improved reversibility of redox reaction and O3&#8722;P3&#8722;O3 phase transition behaviors as well as the enhanced Na+ diffusivity. Consequently, the designed O3&#8208;Na0.9Ni0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Mn0.2Ti0.15Cu0.05O2 material with high&#8208;entropy characteristic could display a negligible voltage hysteresis (&lt; 0.09 V), impressive rate capability (98.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C) and long&#8208;term cycling stability (79.8% capacity retention over 2000 cycles at 5 C). This work provides insightful guidance in mitigating the voltage hysteresis and facilitating Na+ diffusion of layered oxide cathode materials to realize high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;energy SIBs.

         <title>Remote Control of Energy Transformation&#8208;Based Cancer Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cancer treatment requires precise tumor&#8208;specific targeting at specific sites that allows for high&#8208;resolution diagnostic imaging and long&#8208;term patient&#8208;tailorable cancer therapy while minimizing side effects largely arising from non&#8208;targetability. This can be realized by harnessing exogenous remote stimuli, such as tissue&#8208;penetrative ultrasound, magnetic field, light, and radiation, that enable local activation for cancer imaging and therapy in deep tumors. A myriad of nanomedicines can be efficiently activated when the energy of such remote stimuli can be transformed into another type of energy. This review discusses the remote control of energy transformation for targetable, efficient, and long&#8208;term cancer imaging and therapy. Such ultrasonic, magnetic, photonic, radiative, and radioactive energy can be transformed into mechanical, thermal, chemical, and radiative energy to enable a variety of cancer imaging and treatment modalities. The current review article describes multimodal energy transformation where a serial cascade or multiple types of energy transformation occur. This review includes not only mechanical, chemical, hyperthermia, and radiation therapy but also emerging thermoelectric, pyroelectric, and piezoelectric therapies for cancer treatment. It also illustrates ultrasound, magnetic resonance, fluorescence, computed tomography, photoluminescence, and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapies. It highlights afterglow imaging that can eliminate autofluorescence for sustained signal emission after the excitation.

         <title>Recent Progress of Supramolecular Chemotherapy Based on Host&#8211;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chemotherapy based on host&#8211;guest interactions provides a new opportunity for the application of anticancer drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity, becoming a powerful alternative to traditional chemotherapy. The progress of supramolecular chemotherapy based on host&#8211;guest interactions over the past few years is summarized, and illustrates its significant guidance in cancer therapy.








Abstract
Chemotherapy is widely recognized as an effective approach for treating cancer due to its ability to eliminate cancer cells using chemotherapeutic drugs. However, traditional chemotherapy suffers from various drawbacks, including limited solubility and stability of drugs, severe side effects, low bioavailability, drug resistance, and challenges in tracking treatment efficacy. These limitations greatly hinder its widespread clinical application. In contrast, supramolecular chemotherapy, which relies on host&#8211;guest interactions, presents a promising alternative by offering highly efficient and minimally toxic anticancer drug delivery. In this review, an overview of recent advancements in supramolecular chemotherapy based on host&#8211;guest interactions is provided. The significant role it plays in guiding cancer therapy is emphasized. Drawing on a wealth of cutting&#8208;edge research, herein, a timely and valuable resource for individuals interested in the field of supramolecular chemotherapy or cancer therapy, is presented. Furthermore, this review contributes to the progression of the field of supramolecular chemotherapy toward clinical application.

         <title>Macromers for Encapsulating Perovskite Photovoltaics and Achieving High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macromer PIBA is carefully designed as a UV&#8208;curable adhesive for blanket encapsulating perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SC) without sacrificing the device efficiency. More importantly, the resultant CPIBA&#8208;BE pero&#8208;SCs retain &gt;95% of their initial efficiencies after the damp test (85% relative humidity) for 2000&#160;h.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) are highly unstable even under trace water. Although the blanket encapsulation (BE) strategy applied in the industry can effectively block moisture invasion, the commercial UV&#8208;curable adhesives (UVCAs) for BE still trigger power conversion efficiency deterioration, and the degradation mechanism remains unknown. For the first time, the functions of commercial UVCAs are revealed in BE&#8208;processed pero&#8208;SCs, where the small&#8208;sized monomer easily permeates to the perovskite surface, forming an insulating barrier to block charge extraction, while the high&#8208;polarity moiety can destroy perovskite lattice. To solve these problems, a macromer, named PIBA is carefully designed, by grafting two acrylate terminal groups on the highly gastight polyisobutylene and realizes an increased molecular diameter as well as avoided high&#8208;polarity groups. The PIBA macromer can stabilize on pero&#8208;SCs and then sufficiently crosslink, forming a compact and stable network under UV light without sacrificing device performance during the BE process. The resultant BE devices show negligible efficiency loss after storage at 85% relative humidity for 2000&#160;h. More importantly, these devices can even reach ISO 20653:2013 Degrees of protection IPX7 standard when immersed in one&#8208;meter&#8208;deep water. This BE strategy shows good universality in enhancing the moisture stability of pero&#8208;SCs, irrespective of the perovskite composition or device structure.

The resultant BE devices show negligible efficiency loss after storage at 85% relative humidity for 2000&#160;h. More importantly, these devices can even reach ISO 20653:2013 Degrees of protection IPX7 standard when immersed in one-meter-deep water. This BE strategy shows good universality in enhancing the moisture stability of pero-SCs, irrespective of the perovskite composition or device structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilizing Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Liquid Metal Via Dynamic Hydrogel&#8208;Derived Carbon Framework Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to encapsulate EGaIn within a hierarchically porous carbon network derived from a hydrogel matrix, which not only buffers the volume change and promotes the reaction kinetics but also reduces the side&#8208;reactions caused by the spontaneous oxidation of LM and decomposition of the SEI, is developed.








Abstract
Eutectic gallium&#8211;indium liquid metal (EGaIn&#8208;LM), with a considerable capacity and unique self&#8208;healing properties derived from its intrinsic liquid nature, gains tremendous attention for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) anode. However, the fluidity of the LM can trigger continuous consumption of the electrolyte, and its liquid&#8211;solid transition during the lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation process may result in the rupture of the solid electrolyte interface (SEI). Herein, LM is employed as an initiator to in situ assemble the 3D hydrogel for dynamically encapsulating itself; the LM nanoparticles can be homogeneously confined within the hydrogel&#8208;derived carbon framework (HDC) after calcination. Such design effectively alleviates the volume expansion of LM and facilitates electron transportation, resulting in a superior rate capability and long&#8208;term cyclability. Further, the &#8220;dual&#8208;layer&#8221; SEI structure and its key components, including the robust LiF outer layer and corrosion&#8208;resistant and ionic conductive LiGaOx inner layer are revealed, confirming the involvement of LM in the formation of SEI, as well as the important role of carbon framework in reducing interfacial side reactions and SEI decomposition. This work provides a distinct perspective for the formation, structural evolution, and composition of SEI at the liquid/solid interface, and demonstrates an effective strategy to construct a reliable matrix for stabilizing the SEI.

         <title>A T&#8208;Cell Inspired Sonoporation System Enhances Low&#8208;Dose X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Mediated Pyroptosis and Radioimmunotherapy Efficacy by Restoring Gasdermin&#8208;E Expression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated perforation, the biomimetic sonoporation system (UPS) can open target cell membranes and deliver genes under ultrasound control, facilitating gasdermin&#8208;E re&#8208;expression. Through UPS&#8208;assisted genome&#8208;editing, low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray induces pyroptosis in tumors and triggers potent antitumor immune functions.








Abstract
Genome editing has the potential to improve the unsatisfactory therapeutic effect of antitumor immunotherapy. However, the cell plasma membrane prevents the entry of almost all free genome&#8208;manipulation agents. Therefore, a system can be spatiotemporally controlled and can instantly open the cellular membrane to allow the entry of genome&#8208;editing agents into target cells is needed. Here, inspired by the ability of T cells to deliver cytotoxins to cancer cells by perforation, an ultrasound (US)&#8208;controlled perforation system (UPS) is established to enhance the delivery of free genome&#8208;manipulating agents. The UPS can perforate the tumor cell membrane while maintaining cell viability via a controllable lipid peroxidation reaction. In vitro, transmembrane&#8208;incapable plasmids can enter cells and perform genome editing with the assistance of UPS, achieving an efficiency of up to 90%. In vivo, the UPS is biodegradable, nonimmunogenic, and tumor&#8208;targeting, enabling the puncturing of tumor cells under US. With the application of UPS&#8208;assisted genome editing, gasdermin&#8208;E expression in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice is successfully restored, which leads to pyroptosis&#8208;mediated antitumor immunotherapy via low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation. This study provides new insights for designing a sonoporation system for genome editing. Moreover, the results demonstrate that restoring gasdermin expression by genome editing significantly improves the efficacy of radioimmunotherapy.

         <title>Bioinspired Bottlebrush Polymers Effectively Alleviate Frictional Damage Both in Vitro and in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bottlebrush polymers (BB) have emerged as compelling candidates for biosystems to face tribological challenges, including friction and wear. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of an engineered triblock BB polymer's affinity, cell toxicity, lubrication, and wear protection in both in vitro and in vivo settings, focusing on applications for conditions like osteoarthritis and dry eye syndrome. Results show that the designed polymer rapidly adheres to various surfaces (e.g., cartilage, eye, and contact lens), forming a robust, biocompatible layer for surface lubrication and protection. The tribological performance and biocompatibility are further enhanced in the presence of hyaluronic acid (HA) both in vitro and in vivo. The exceptional lubrication performance and favorable interaction with HA position the synthesized triblock polymer as a promising candidate for innovative treatments addressing deficiencies in bio&#8208;lubricant systems.

Abstract
Wearable epidermic electronics assembled from conductive hydrogels are attracting various research attention for their seamless integration with human body for conformally real&#8208;time health monitoring, clinical diagnostics and medical treatment, and human&#8208;interactive sensing. Nevertheless, it remains a tremendous challenge to simultaneously achieve conformally bioadhesive epidermic electronics with remarkable self&#8208;adhesiveness, reliable ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;protection ability, and admirable sensing performance for high&#8208;fidelity epidermal electrophysiological signals monitoring, along with timely photothermal therapeutic performances after medical diagnostic sensing, as well as efficient antibacterial activity and reliable hemostatic effect for potential medical therapy. Herein, a conformally bioadhesive hydrogel&#8208;based epidermic sensor, featuring superior self&#8208;adhesiveness and excellent UV&#8208;protection performance, is developed by dexterously assembling conducting MXene nanosheets network with biological hydrogel polymer network for conformally stably attaching onto human skin for high&#8208;quality recording of various epidermal electrophysiological signals with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios (SNR) and low interfacial impedance for intelligent medical diagnosis and smart human&#8208;machine interface. Moreover, a smart sign language gesture recognition platform based on collected EMG signals are designed for hassle&#8208;free communication with hearing&#8208;impaired people with the help of advanced machine learning algorithms. Meanwhile, the bioadhesive MXene hydrogel possesses reliable antibacterial capability, excellent biocompatibility and effective hemostasis properties for promising bacterial&#8208;infected wound bleeding.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Conjugated Polymer Thin Films for Organic Electronics: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional conjugated polymers (2DCPs) possess extended in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugated lattice and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, which results in enhanced electronic performance and potentially unique band structures. These properties, along with pre&#8208;designability, well&#8208;defined channels, easy post&#8208;modification, and order structure attract extensive attention from material science to organic electronics. In this review, we summarize the recent advance in the interfacial synthesis and conductivity tuning strategies of 2DCP thin films, as well as their application in organic electronics. Furthermore, we show that, by combining topology structure design and targeted conductivity adjustment, researchers have fabricated 2DCP thin films with pre&#8208;designed active groups, highly ordered structures and enhanced conductivity. These films exhibit great potential for various thin&#8208;film organic electronics, such as organic transistors, memristors, electrochromism, chemiresistors, and photodetectors. Finally, we discuss the future research directions and perspectives of 2DCPs in terms of the interfacial synthetic design and structure engineering for the fabrication of fully conjugated 2DCP thin films, as well as the functional manipulation of conductivity to advance their applications in future organic electronics.

         <title>Biphase Pd Nanosheets with Atomic&#8208;Hybrid RhOx/Pd Amorphous Skins Disentangle the Activity&#8208;Stability Trade&#8208;Off in Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

Abstract
The activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off relationship of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a tricky issue that strikes the electrocatalyst population and hinders the widespread application of fuel cells. Here we develop neoteric biphase Pd nanosheets that are structured with ultrathin 2D crystalline Pd inner cores and &#8764;1 nm&#8208;thin atomic&#8208;hybrid RhOx/Pd amorphous skins, named c/a&#8208;Pd@PdRh NSs, for disentangling this trade&#8208;off dilemma for alkaline ORR. The superthin amorphous skins significantly amplify the quantity of flexibly low&#8208;coordinated atoms for electrocatalysis. An in&#8208;situ selected oxidation of the top&#8208;surface Rh dopants creates atomically hybrid RhOx/Pd disorder surfaces. Detailed energy spectra and theoretical simulation confirm that these RhOx/Pd interfaces can arouse a surface charge redistribution, causing significant electron deficiency and lowered d&#8208;band center for surface Pd. Meanwhile, anti&#8208;corrosive Rh/RhOx species can thermodynamically passivate the neighboring Pd atoms from oxidative dissolution. Thanks to these amplified interfacial effects, the biphase c/a&#8208;Pd@PdRh NSs simultaneously exhibit a superhigh ORR activity (5.92 A mg&#8722;1, 22.8 times that of Pt/C) and an outstanding long&#8208;lasting stability after 100k cycles of accelerated durability test, showcasing unprecedented electrocatalysts for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off relationship of ORR. This work paves a bran&#8208;new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts through creating modulated amorphous skins on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;The activity-stability trade-off relationship of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a tricky issue that strikes the electrocatalyst population and hinders the widespread application of fuel cells. Here we develop neoteric biphase Pd nanosheets that are structured with ultrathin 2D crystalline Pd inner cores and &#8764;1 nm-thin atomic-hybrid RhO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Pd amorphous skins, named c/a-Pd@PdRh NSs, for disentangling this trade-off dilemma for alkaline ORR.

         <title>Direct Laser Writing: From Materials Synthesis and Conversion to Electronic Device Processing.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Direct Laser Writing (DLW) has been increasingly selected as a microfabrication route for efficient, cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;resolution material synthesis and conversion. Concurrently, lasers participate in the patterning and assembly of functional geometries in several fields of application, of which electronics stand out. In this review, we survey and outline recent advances and strategies based on DLW for electronics microfabrication, based on laser material growth strategies. First, we summarize the main DLW parameters influencing material synthesis and transformation mechanisms, aimed at selective, tailored writing of conductive and semiconducting materials. Additive and transformative DLW processing mechanisms are discussed, to open space to explore several categories of materials directly synthesized or transformed for electronics microfabrication. These include metallic conductors, metal oxides, transition metal chalcogenides and carbides, laser&#8208;induced graphene, and their mixtures. By accessing a wide range of material types, DLW&#8208;based electronic applications are explored, including processing components, energy harvesting and storage, sensing, and bioelectronics. The expanded capability of lasers to participate in multiple fabrication steps at different implementation levels, from material engineering to device processing, indicates their future applicability to next&#8208;generation electronics, where more accessible, green microfabrication approaches integrate lasers as comprehensive tools.

         <title>Printable Block Molecular Assemblies with Controlled Exciton Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Creating hierarchical molecular block heterostructures, with the control over size, shape, optical, and electronic properties of each nanostructured building block can help develop functional applications, such as information storage, nanowire spectrometry, and photonic computing. However, achieving precise control over the position of molecular assemblies, and the dynamics of excitons in each block, remains a challenge. In the present work, we demonstrate the first fabrication of molecular heterostructures with the control of exciton dynamics in each block. Additionally, these heterostructures are printable and can be precisely positioned using Direct Ink Writing&#8208;based (DIW) 3D printing technique, resulting in programmable patterns. Singlet excitons with emission lifetimes on nanosecond or microsecond timescales and triplet excitons with emission lifetimes on millisecond timescales appear simultaneously in different building blocks, with an efficient energy transfer process in the heterojunction. These organic materials also exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive emission by changing the power or wavelength of the excitation laser. We foresee potential applications of these organic heterostructures in integrated photonics, where the versatility of fluorescence, phosphorescence, efficient energy transfer, printability, and stimulus sensitivity co&#8208;exist in a single nanowire.

         <title>Rational Design of Dynamic Interface Water Evolution on Turing Electrocatalyst towards the Industrial Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Manipulating the structural and kinetic dissociation processes of water at the catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interface is vital for alkaline hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at industrial current density. This is seldom actualized due to the intricacies of the electrochemical reaction interface. Herein, we introduce a rapid, non&#8208;equilibrium cooling technique for synthesizing ternary Turing catalysts with short&#8208;range ordered structures (denoted as FeNiRu/C). These advanced structures empower the FeNiRu/C to exhibit excellent HER performance in 1 M KOH with an ultralow overpotential of 6.5 and 166.2 mV at 10 and 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, and a specific activity 7.3 times higher than that of Pt/C. Comprehensive mechanistic analyses reveal that abundant atomic species form asymmetric atomic electric fields on the catalyst surface inducing a directed evolution and the dissociation process of interfacial H2O molecules. In addition, the locally topologized structure effectively mitigates the high hydrogen coverage of the active site induced by the high current density. The establishment of the relationship between free water population and HER activity provides a new paradigm for the design of industrially relevant high performance alkaline HER catalysts.

         <title>A Viscous&#8208;Biofluid Self&#8208;Pumping Organohydrogel Dressing to Accelerate Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Viscous biofluids on wounds challenge conventional &#8220;water&#8208;absorbing&#8221; wound dressings in efficient drainage due to their poor fluidity, generally causing prolonged inflammation, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and delayed wound closure. Herein, we report that a self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing (SPD) with aligned hydrated hydrogel channels, prepared by a three&#8208;dimensional&#8208;templated wetting&#8208;enabled&#8208;transfer (3D&#8208;WET) polymerization process, can efficiently drain viscous fluids and accelerate diabetic wound healing. The asymmetric wettability of the hydrophobic&#8208;hydrophilic layers and aligned hydrated hydrogel channels enable unidirectional and efficient drainage of viscous fluids away from the wounds, preventing their overhydration and inflammatory stimulation. The organogel layer can adhere onto the skin around the wounds but can be easily detached from the wet wound area, avoiding secondary trauma to the newly&#8208;formed tissues. Taking a diabetic rat model as an example, the SPD can significantly downregulate the inflammation response by &#8764;70.8%, enhance the dermal remodeling by &#8764;14.3%, and shorten wound closure time by about 1/3 compared with the commercial dressing (3M, TegadermTM hydrocolloid thin dressing). This study sheds light on the development of the next generation of functional dressings for chronic wounds involving viscous biofluids.

         <title>Programmable DNA Interphase Layers for High&#8208;Performance Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries are promising candidates for advanced energy storage, attributed to their appealing characteristics such as high energy density, low cost, and convenient production. However, their major challenges lie in the poor cycling and rate performance owing to the inferior reversibility and kinetics of Li plating and stripping, which significantly hinder their real&#8208;world applications. Here, we demonstrate that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the most important genetic material in nature, can serve as a highly programmable interphase layer for innovation of anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries. We find that the abundant base pairs in DNA can contribute transient Li&#8208;N bonds that facilitate homogeneous Li+ flux, thus resulting in excellent Li plating/stripping kinetics and reversibility even at a harsh areal current of 15 mA cm&#8722;2. The anode&#8208;free LiFePO4 full batteries based on an ultrathin (0.12 &#956;m) and ultralight (&#8764;0.01 mg cm&#8722;2) DNA interphase layer show high CEs (&#8764;99.1%) over 400 cycles, corresponding to an increase of &#8764;186% compared with bare copper (Cu) foil. Our results shed light on the excellent programmability of DNA as a new family of interphase materials for anode&#8208;free batteries, and provide a new paradigm for future battery innovation toward high programmability, high sustainability, and remarkable electrochemical performance.

         <title>Narrow Bandgap Schottky Heterojunction Sonosensitizer with High Electron&#8208;Hole Separation Boosted Sonodynamic Therapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is applied to bladder cancer (BC) given its advantages of high depth of tissue penetration and nontoxicity due to the unique anatomical location of the bladder near the abdominal surface. However, low electron&#8208;hole separation efficiency and wide bandgap of sonosensitizers limit the effectiveness of SDT. This study aimed to develop a TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG Schottky heterojunction sonosensitizer with high electron&#8208;hole separation and narrow bandgap for SDT in BC. Density functional theory calculations and experiments collectively demonstrated that the bandgap of TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG was reduced due to the Schottky heterojunction with the characteristic of crystalline&#8208;amorphous interface formed by the deposition of ruthenium (Ru) within the shell layer of TiO2. Thanks to the enhancement of oxygen adsorption and the efficient separation of electron&#8208;hole pairs, TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG promoted the generation of reactive oxygen species under ultrasound irradiation, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of bladder tumor cells. The in vivo results proved that TiO2&#8208;Ru&#8208;PEG boosted the subcutaneous and orthotopic bladder tumor models while exhibiting good safety. This study adopted the ruthenium complex for optimizing sonosensitizers, contributing to the progress of SDT improvement strategies and presenting a paradigm for BC therapy.

         <title>Super&#8208;Stretchable and High&#8208;Energy Micro&#8208;Pseudocapacitors Based on MXene Embedded Ag Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The advancement of aqueous micro&#8208;supercapacitors offers an enticing prospect for a broad spectrum of applications, spanning from wearable electronics to micro&#8208;robotics and sensors. Unfortunately, conventional micro&#8208;supercapacitors are characterized by low capacity and slopy voltage profiles, limiting their energy density capabilities. To enhance the performance of these devices, the use of 2D MXene&#8208;based compounds has recently been proposed. Apart from their capacitive contributions, these structures can be loaded with redox&#8208;active nanowires which increase their energy density and stabilize their operation voltage. However, introducing rigid nanowires into MXene films typically leads to a significant decline in their mechanical properties, particularly in terms of flexibility. To overcome this issue, we demonstrate herein super stretchable micro&#8208;pseudocapacitor electrodes composed of MXene nanosheets and in&#8208;situ reconstructed Ag nanoparticles (Ag&#8208;NP&#8208;MXene) delivering high energy density, stable operation voltage of &#8764;1 V, and fast charging capabilities. Careful experimental analysis and theoretical simulations of the charging mechanism of the Ag&#8208;NP&#8208;MXene electrodes reveal a dual nature charge storage mechanism involving ad(de)sorption of ions and conversion reaction of Ag nanoparticles. The superior mechanical properties of synthesized films obtained through in&#8208;situ construction of Ag&#8208;NP&#8208;MXene structure show an ultrastretchability, allowing the devices to provide stable voltage and energy output even at 100% elongation.

         <title>Pyroelectric&#8208;Accelerated Perovskite Photodetector for Picosecond Light Detection and Ranging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is indispensable in applications such as unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous driving, and biomimetic robots. However, the precision and available distance of LiDAR are constrained by the speed and sensitivity of the photodetector, necessitating the use of expensive and energy&#8208;consuming avalanche diodes. To address these challenges, in this study, a pyroelectricity&#8208;based acceleration strategy with two&#8208;dimensional (2D)&#8208;(graded 3D) perovskite heterojunction is proposed to achieve record high speed (27.7 ns with active area of 9 mm2, and 176 ps with active area of 0.2 mm2) and high responsivity (0.65 A W&#8722;1) at zero bias. This success is attributed to the unique mechanism where the electrons from the pyroelectric effect at the Cl&#8208;rich 2D/3D interface directly recombine with excess holes during light&#8208;dark transitions, breaking speed limitations related to carrier mobility and capacitive effect. Furthermore, the introduced pyroelectric effect significantly enhances the photoresponse, resulting in a self&#8208;powered external quantum efficiency exceeding 100%. The study also demonstrates precise position detection at the centimeter level. In conclusion, this research presents a pioneering approach for developing high&#8208;speed photodiodes with exceptional sensitivity, mitigating energy and cost concerns in LiDAR applications.

         <title>An Encapsulation&#8208;free and Hierarchical Porous Triboelectric Scaffold with Dynamic Hydrophilicity for Efficient Cartilage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tissue engineering and electrotherapy are two promising methods to promote tissue repair. However, their integration remains an underexplored area, because their requirements on devices are usually distinct. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have shown great potential to develop self&#8208;powered devices. However, due to their susceptibility to moisture, TENGs have to be encapsulated in vivo. Therefore, existing TENGs cannot be employed as tissue engineering scaffolds, which require direct interaction with surrounding cells. Here, we propose the concept of triboelectric scaffolds (TESs). Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS), a biodegradable and relatively hydrophobic elastomer, is selected as the matrix of TESs. Each hydrophobic and moisture&#8208;resistant micropore in multi&#8208;hierarchical porous TESs efficiently serves as a working unit of TENGs even in moist environments. Integration of tons of micropores ensures the electrotherapy ability of TESs in vivo without encapsulation. Originally hydrophobic TESs degraded by surface erosion, transform to hydrophilic surface, facilitating their role as tissue engineering scaffolds. Notably, TESs seeded with chondrocytes obtain dense and large matured cartilages after subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. Importantly, rabbits with osteochondral defects receiving TESs implantation show favorable hyaluronan cartilage regeneration and complete cartilage healing. This work provides a promising electronic biomedical device and will inspire a series of new in vivo applications.

         <title>Recent Advances in Material Technology for Leukaemia Treatments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Leukaemia is a widespread haematological malignancy characterized by an elevated white blood cell count in both the blood and the bone marrow. Despite notable advancements in leukaemia intervention in the clinic, a large proportion of patients, especially acute leukaemia patients, failed to achieve long&#8208;term remission or complete remission following treatment. Therefore, leukaemia therapy necessitates optimization to meet the treatment requirements. In recent years, a multitude of materials have undergone rigorous study to serve as delivery vectors or direct intervention agents to bolster the effectiveness of leukaemia therapy. These materials include liposomes, protein&#8208;based materials, polymeric materials, cell&#8208;derived materials, and inorganic materials. They possess unique characteristics and have been applied in a broad array of therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and other evolving treatments. In this review, we present an overview of these materials, describing their physicochemical properties, their role in leukaemia treatment, and the challenges they face in the context of clinical translation. This review will inspire researchers to further develop various materials that can be used to augment the efficacy of multiple therapeutic modalities for novel applications in leukaemia treatment.

         <title>Multicolor Photochemical Printing Inside Polymer Matrices for Advanced Photonic Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional security inks, generally directly printed on the data page surface, are vulnerable to counterfeiters, thereby raising the risk of chemical structural deciphering. In fact, polymer film&#8208;based data pages with customized patterns embedded within polymer matrix, rather than printed on the surface, emerge as a promising solution. Therefore, the key lies in developing fluorophores offering light dose&#8208;controlled fluorescent color inside polymer matrices. Though conventional fluorophores often suffer from photobleaching and uncontrolled photoreactions, disqualifying them for this purpose. Herein we developed a diphenanthridinylfumaronitrile&#8208;based photo&#8208;transformers (trans&#8208;D5) that undergoes photoisomerization and subsequent photocyclization during photopolymerization of the precursor, successively producing cis&#8208; and cyclo&#8208;D5 with stepwise redshifted solid&#8208;state emissions. The resulting cyclo&#8208;D5 exhibits up to 172 nm emission redshift in rigidifying polymer matrices, while trans&#8208;D5 experiences a slightly blue&#8208;shifted emission (&#8764;28 nm), cis&#8208;D5 undergoes a modest redshift (&#8764;14 nm). The markedly different rigidochromic behaviors of three D5 molecules within polymer matrices enable multicolor photochemical printing with a broad hue ranging from 38 to 10 via an anticlockwise direction in Munsell color space, yielding indecipherable fluorescent patterns in polymer films.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional security inks, generally directly printed on the data page surface, are vulnerable to counterfeiters, thereby raising the risk of chemical structural deciphering. In fact, polymer film-based data pages with customized patterns embedded within polymer matrix, rather than printed on the surface, emerge as a promising solution. Therefore, the key lies in developing fluorophores offering light dose-controlled fluorescent color inside polymer matrices. Though conventional fluorophores often suffer from photobleaching and uncontrolled photoreactions, disqualifying them for this purpose. Herein we developed a diphenanthridinylfumaronitrile-based photo-transformers (&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-D5) that undergoes photoisomerization and subsequent photocyclization during photopolymerization of the precursor, successively producing &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-D5 with stepwise redshifted solid-state emissions. The resulting &lt;i&gt;cyclo&lt;/i&gt;-D5 exhibits up to 172 nm emission redshift in rigidifying polymer matrices, while &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-D5 experiences a slightly blue-shifted emission (&#8764;28 nm), &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-D5 undergoes a modest redshift (&#8764;14 nm).

         <title>Ordered Vacancies as sodium ion micropumps in Cu&#8722;Deficient Copper Indium Diselenide to Enhance Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Unordered vacancies engineered in host anode materials can't well maintain the uniform Na+ adsorbed and possibly render the local structural stress intense, resulting in electrode peeling and battery failure. Here, we firstly introduce the indium into Cu2Se to achieve the formation of CuInSe2. Next, ion extraction strategy is employed to fabricate Cu0.54In1.15Se2 enriched with ordered vacancies by the spontaneous formation of defect pairs. Such ordered defects, compared with unordered ones, can serve as myriad sodium ion micropumps evenly distributing in crystalline host to homogenize the adsorbed Na+ and the generated volumetric stress during the electrochemistry. Furthermore, Cu0.54In1.15Se2 is indeed proved by the calculations to exhibit smaller volumetric variation than the counterpart with unordered vacancies. Thanks to the distinct ordered vacancy structure, the material exhibits a highly reversible capacity of 428 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C and a high&#8722;rate stability of 311.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C after 5,000 cycles when employed as an anode material for SIBs. This work presents the promotive effect of ordered vacancies on the electrochemistry of SIBs and demonstrates the superiority to the unordered vacancies, which is expected to extend it to other metal&#8722;ion batteries, not limited to SIBs to achieve high capacity and cycling stability.

         <title>Area Selective Chemical Vapor Deposition of Gold by Electron Beam Seeding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an established method for producing high&#8208;purity thin films, but it typically necessitates the pre&#8208; and post&#8208;processing using a mask to produce structures. This paper presents a novel maskless patterning technique that enables area selective CVD of gold. A focused electron beam is used to decompose the metal&#8208;organic precursor Au(acac)Me2 locally, thereby creating an autocatalytically active seed layer for subsequent CVD with the same precursor. The procedure could be included in the same CVD process without the need for clean room lithographic processing. Moreover, it operates at low temperatures of 80&#160;&#176;C, over 200&#160;K lower than standard CVD temperatures for this precursor, reducing thermal load on the specimen. Given that electron beam seeding operates on any even moderately conductive surface, the process does not constrain device design. This is demonstrated by the example of vertical nanostructures with high aspect ratios of around 40:1 and more. Written using a focused electron beam and the same precursor, these nanopillars exhibit catalytically active nuclei on their surface. Furthermore, by using the onset of the autocatalytic CVD growth, for the first time the local temperature increase caused by the writing of nanostructures with an electron beam could be precisely&#160;determined.

         <title>Precise Tailoring of Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport for Ultralong&#8208;Cycling Dendrite&#8208;Free All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries are of intense current energy storage and materials science interest and considered a game changer for electric vehicles This work reports lithium dendrite&#8208;free battery design&#160;and holds great promise for improving the energy density and performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, particularly in the context of rapidly expanding markets for electric vehicles.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries can address crucial challenges regarding insufficient battery cycling life and energy density. The demonstration of long&#8208;cycling dendrite&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries requires precise tailoring of lithium&#8208;ion transport of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). In this work, a proof of concept is reported for precise tailoring of lithium&#8208;ion transport of a halide SSE, Li3InCl6, including intragranular (within grains) but also intergranular (between grains) lithium&#8208;ion transport. Lithium&#8208;ion migration tailoring mechanism in crystals is developed by unexpected enhanced Li, In, and Cl vacancy populations and lower energy barrier for hopping. The lithium&#8208;ion transport tailoring mechanism between the grains is determined by the elimination of voids between grains and the formation of unexpected supersonic conducting grain boundaries, boosting the lithium dendrite suppression ability of SSE. Due to boosted lithium&#8208;ion conduction and dendrite&#8208;suppression ability, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries coupled with Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes and lithium metal anodes demonstrate breakthroughs in electrochemical performance by achieving extremely long cycling life at a high current density of 0.5 C (2000 cycles, 93.7% capacity retention). This concept of precise tailoring of lithium&#8208;ion transport provides a cost, time, and energy efficient solution to conquer the remaining challenges in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries for fast developing electric vehicle markets.

         <title>Soybean Oil&#8208;Derived Lipids for Efficient mRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8208;approved soybean oil, new soybean oil&#8208;derived lipids are facilely synthesized for efficient mRNA delivery. These lipids demonstrate excellent performance in delivering Cre mRNA for gene editing applications, highlighting their potential for diverse biomedical applications, especially those requiring efficient mRNA delivery and organ&#8208;specific targeting.








Abstract
The rapid progress in the development of COVID&#8208;19 mRNA vaccines during the initial year of the pandemic has highlighted the significance of lipid nanoparticles in therapeutic delivery. Various lipid types have been investigated for the effective delivery of mRNA, each with unique functions and versatile applications. These range from their use in cancer immunotherapy and gene editing to their role in developing vaccines against infectious diseases. Nonetheless, continued exploration of novel lipids and synthetic approaches is necessary to further advance the understanding and expand the techniques for optimizing mRNA delivery. In this work, new lipids derived from FDA&#8208;approved soybean oil are facilely synthesized and these are employed for efficient mRNA delivery. EGFP and Fluc mRNA are used to evaluate the delivery efficacy of the lipid formulations both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, organ&#8208;specific targeting capabilities are observed in certain formulations, and their outstanding performance is demonstrated in delivering Cre mRNA for gene editing. These results showcase the potential of soybean oil&#8208;derived lipids in mRNA delivery, offering utility across a broad spectrum of bioapplications.

A flexible TENG with ultrahigh electrical output for application in IoT is developed by constructing deep traps from the incorporation of KH556. The deep traps can effectively trap triboelectric charges and reduce the rate of charge dissipation, resulting in a 1300% enhancement in output power density.








Abstract
High output performance is critical for building triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) for future multifunctional applications. Unfortunately, the high triboelectric charge dissipation rate has a significant negative&#160;impact on its electrical output performance. Herein, a new&#160;tribolayer is designed through introducing self&#8208;assembled molecules with large energy gaps on commercial PET fibric to&#160;form carrier deep traps, which improve charge retention while decreasing dissipation rates. The deep trap density of the PET increases by two orders of magnitude, resulting in an 86% reduction in the rate of charge dissipation and a significant increase in the charge density that can be accumulated on tribolayer during physical contact. The key explanation is that increasing the density of deep traps improves the dielectric's ability to store charges, making it more difficult for the triboelectric charges trapped by the tribolayer to escape from the deep traps, lowering the rate of charge dissipation. This TENG has a 1300% increase in output power density as a result of altering the deep trap density, demonstrating a significant improvement. This work describes a simple yet&#160;efficient method for building TENGs with&#160;ultra&#8208;high electrical output and promotes their practical implementation in the sphere of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Ultrafast Negative Capacitance Transition for 2D Ferroelectric MoS2/Graphene Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>

The subthreshold swing (SS) serves as the key performance parameter for high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power electronics. Boltzmann distribution limits the SS to 60&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in conventional field effect transistors. Here, in a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device architecture, ultralow SS across the five decades of drain current is&#160;achieved by utilizing efficient Dirac contacts and ultrafast negative&#8208;capacitance transition in layered ferroelectric gate insulator.








Abstract
Negative capacitance gives rise to subthreshold swing (SS) below the fundamental limit by efficient modulation of surface potential in transistors. While negative&#8208;capacitance transition is reported in polycrystalline Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 (PZT) and HfZrO2 (HZO) thin&#8208;films in few microseconds timescale, low SS is not persistent over a wide range of drain current when used instead of conventional dielectrics. In this work, the clear nano&#8208;second negative transition states in 2D single&#8208;crystal CuInP2S6 (CIPS) flakes have been demonstrated by an alternative fast&#8208;transient measurement technique. Further, integrating this ultrafast NC transition with the localized density of states of Dirac contacts and controlled charge transfer in the CIPS/channel (MoS2/graphene) a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device architecture, negative capacitance Dirac source drain field effect transistor (FET) is introduced. This yields an ultralow SS of 4.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 with an average sub&#8208;10 SS across five decades with on&#8208;off ratio exceeding 107, by simultaneous improvement of transport and body factors in monolayer MoS2&#8208;based FET, outperforming all previous reports. This approach could pave the way to achieve ultralow&#8208;SS FETs for future high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power electronics.

         <title>Exchange Bias Between van der Waals Materials: Tilted Magnetic States and Field&#8208;Free Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Torque Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exchange&#8208;bias interactions between van der Waals ferromagnets and van der Waals antiferromagnets are unusual in that the antiferromagnetic surface can be completely uncompensated. In Pt/Fe3GeTe2/CrSBr heterostructures, this produces interfacial exchange interactions along the in&#8208;plane easy&#8208;axis of CrSBr comparable to the interlayer interactions. Such an effect produces non&#8208;uniform tilted magnetic configurations and enables field&#8208;free deterministic spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching of the Fe3GeTe2 layer.








Abstract
Magnetic van der Waals heterostructures provide a unique platform to study magnetism and spintronics device concepts in the 2D limit. Here, studies of exchange bias from the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrSBr acting on the van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) are reported. The orientation of the exchange bias is along the in&#8208;plane easy axis of CrSBr, perpendicular to the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy of the FGT, inducing a strongly tilted magnetic configuration in the FGT. Furthermore, the in&#8208;plane exchange bias provides sufficient symmetry breaking to allow deterministic spin&#8211;orbit torque switching of the FGT in CrSBr/FGT/Pt samples at zero applied magnetic field. A minimum thickness of the CrSBr of &gt;10 nm is needed to provide a non&#8208;zero exchange bias at 30&#160;K.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Triggered Cascade Therapy: A NIR&#8208;II AIE Luminogen Collaborating with Nitric Oxide Facilitates Efficient Collagen Depletion for Boosting Pancreatic Cancer Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional theranostic liposome (Lip&#8208;DTI/NO) by integration of a NIR&#8208;II AIE luminogen DTITBT and GSH or heat&#8208;responsive NO donor S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) is constructed and demonstrated the NIR light&#8208;triggered in situ generation of ONOO&#8722; for tumor stroma depletion and enhanced drug delivery, and consequently boosting pancreatic cancer phototherapy.








Abstract
The dense extracellular matrix (ECM) in the pancreatic cancer severely hampers the penetration of nanodrugs, which causes inferior therapeutic efficacy. To address this issue, a multifunctional liposome, namely, Lip&#8208;DTI/NO, integrating a type&#8208;I photosensitizer DTITBT with glutathione (GSH) or heat&#8208;responsive nitric oxide (NO) donor S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;penicillamine (SNAP) is constructed to deplete the tumor ECM, leading to enhanced drug delivery and consequently improved phototherapy. The loaded DTITBT possesses multiple functions including NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging, efficient superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8722;) generation and excellent photothermal conversion efficiency, making it feasible for precisely pinpointing the tumor in the phototherapy process. Responding to the intracellular overexpressed glutathione or heat produced by photothermal effect of DTITBT, NO can be released from SNAP. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, Lip&#8208;DTI/NO could selectively induce in situ generation of peroxynitrite anion (ONOO&#8722;) in tumor after cascade processes including O2&#8226;&#8722; production, GSH or heat&#8208;triggered NO release, and rapid reaction between O2&#8226;&#8722; and NO. The generated ONOO&#8722; could activate the expression of endogenous matrix metalloproteinases which could efficiently digest collagen of tumor ECM, thus facilitating enhanced penetration and accumulation of Lip&#8208;DTI/NO in tumor. In vivo evaluation demonstrates the notable therapeutic efficacy via ONOO&#8722;&#8208;potentiated synergistic photodynamic&#8208;photothermal therapies on both subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic cancer model.

         <title>Bridging the Catalytic Turnover Gap Between Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozymes and Natural Enzymes by Engineering the First and Second Shell Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a first&#8211; and second&#8211;shell coordination tuning strategy of iron&#8211;based SAzymes is reported using Na2S2O5&#8211;mediated thermal activation. Axial ligands of the active sites and functionalities of the carbon host are modulated to elevate the reaction kinetics. The optimized SAzyme exhibits the highest k
cat value (52.7 s&#8722;1) in peroxidase reaction, and consequently, presents remarkable anti&#8211;tumor properties.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) constitute a promising category of enzyme&#8208;mimicking materials with outstanding catalytic performance. The performance of SAzymes improves through modification of the coordination environments around the metal center. However, the catalytic turnover rates of SAzymes, which are key measures of the effectiveness of active site modifications, remain lower than those of natural enzymes, especially in peroxidase&#8208;reactions. Here, the first and second shell coordination tuning strategy that yields SAzymes with structures and activities analogous to those of natural enzymes is reported. The optimized SAzyme exhibits a turnover rate of 52.7 s&#8722;1 and a catalytic efficiency of 6.97 &#215; 105 M&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. A computational study reveals that axial S&#8208;ligands induce an alternative reaction mechanism, and SO2&#8722; functional groups provide hydrogen bonds to reduce the activation energy. In addition, SAzyme shows superior anti&#8208;tumor ability in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate the validity of coordination engineering strategies and the carcinostatic potential of SAzymes.

&lt;p&gt;Here, a first&#8211; and second&#8211;shell coordination tuning strategy of iron&#8211;based SAzymes is reported using Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;mediated thermal activation. Axial ligands of the active sites and functionalities of the carbon host are modulated to elevate the reaction kinetics. The optimized SAzyme exhibits the highest &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt; value (52.7 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in peroxidase reaction, and consequently, presents remarkable anti&#8211;tumor properties.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom nanozymes (SAzymes) constitute a promising category of enzyme-mimicking materials with outstanding catalytic performance. The performance of SAzymes improves through modification of the coordination environments around the metal center. However, the catalytic turnover rates of SAzymes, which are key measures of the effectiveness of active site modifications, remain lower than those of natural enzymes, especially in peroxidase-reactions. Here, the first and second shell coordination tuning strategy that yields SAzymes with structures and activities analogous to those of natural enzymes is reported. The optimized SAzyme exhibits a turnover rate of 52.7 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a catalytic efficiency of 6.97 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; M&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. A computational study reveals that axial S-ligands induce an alternative reaction mechanism, and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722; functional groups provide hydrogen bonds to reduce the activation energy. In addition, SAzyme shows superior anti-tumor ability in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate the validity of coordination engineering strategies and the carcinostatic potential of SAzymes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conducting Polymer Coatings Prepared by Mixed Emulsions Are Highly Conductive and Stable in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conducting polymer coating is prepared by a mixture of two emulsions: an aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer, and an aqueous emulsion of hydrophobic and rubbery chains copolymerized with silane coupling agents. The coating features percolated nanocrystals which make the coating highly conductive, and the hydrophobic covalent network which stabilizes the coating in water.








Abstract
An aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer is commonly applied on a substrate to form a coating after drying. The coating, however, disintegrates in water. This paper reports a coating prepared using a mixture of two emulsions: an aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer, and an aqueous emulsion of hydrophobic and rubbery chains copolymerized with silane coupling agents. When applied on a substrate and dried, particles of the mixed emulsion merge into a continuous film. While the conducting polymer forms percolated nanocrystals, the silane groups crosslink the rubbery chains and interlink the rubbery chains to the substrate. The percolated nanocrystals make the coating highly conductive. The covalent network of hydrophobic polymer chains stabilizes the coating in water. The high conductivity and stability in water may enable broad applications.

         <title>Saltwater&#8208;Induced Rapid Gelation of Photoredox&#8208;Responsive Mucomimetic Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach toward injectable, shear&#8208;thinning hydrogels is reported, where bottlebrush polymers are cross&#8208;linked into water&#8208;soluble polymer networks through host&#8211;guest cross&#8208;linking interactions. Injection of the pre&#8208;gel solution into saltwater induces rapid gelation, affording viscous hydrogels with broad adhesive properties that can be converted into shear&#8208;thinning materials in response to heating or through a novel visible&#8208;light photoredox mechanism.








Abstract
Shear&#8208;thinning hydrogels represent an important class of injectable soft materials that are often used in a wide range of biomedical applications. Creation of new shear&#8208;thinning materials often requires that factors such as viscosity, injection rate/force, and needle gauge be evaluated to achieve efficient delivery, while simultaneously protecting potentially sensitive cargo. Here, a new approach to establishing shear&#8208;thinning hydrogels is reported where a host&#8211;guest cross&#8208;linked network initially remains soluble in deionized water but is kinetically trapped as a viscous hydrogel once exposed to saltwater. The shear&#8208;thinning properties of the hydrogel is then &#8220;switched on&#8221; in response to heating or exposure to visible light. These hydrogels consist of polynorbornene&#8208;based bottlebrush copolymers with porphyrin&#8208; and oligoviologen&#8208;containing side chains that are cross&#8208;linked through the reversible formation of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8211;adamantane inclusion complexes. The resultant viscous hydrogels display broad adhesive properties across polar and nonpolar substrates, mimicking that of natural mucous and thus making it easier to distribute onto a wide range of surfaces. Additional control over the hydrogel's mechanical properties (storage/loss moduli) and performance (adhesion) is achieved post&#8208;injection using a low&#8208;energy (blue light) photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer process. This work envisions these injectable copolymers and multimodal hydrogels can serve as versatile next&#8208;generation biomaterials capable of light&#8208;based mechanical manipulation post&#8208;injection.

         <title>A Butterfly&#8208;Inspired Multisensory Neuromorphic Platform for Integration of Visual and Chemical Cues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A butterfly&#8208;inspired visuochemical integration platform is demonstrated utilizing the chemo&#8208;sensing properties of graphene and the photo&#8208;sensing capability of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Additionally, the in&#8208;memory computing capability of MoS2 memtransistors is harnessed to develop neural circuits that facilitate multisensory decision&#8208;making. Such multisensory integration has significant implications in both robotics and the advancement of neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Unisensory cues are often insufficient for animals to effectively engage in foraging, mating, and predatory activities. In contrast, integration of cues collected from multiple sensory organs enhances the overall perceptual experience and thereby facilitates better decision&#8208;making. Despite the importance of multisensory integration in animals, the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and neuromorphic computing has primarily focused on processing unisensory information. This lack of emphasis on multisensory integration can be attributed to the absence of a miniaturized hardware platform capable of co&#8208;locating multiple sensing modalities and enabling in&#8208;sensor and near&#8208;sensor processing. In this study, this limitation is addressed by utilizing the chemo&#8208;sensing properties of graphene and the photo&#8208;sensing capability of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) to create a multisensory platform for visuochemical integration. Additionally, the in&#8208;memory&#8208;compute capability of MoS2 memtransistors is leveraged to develop neural circuits that facilitate multisensory decision&#8208;making. The visuochemical integration platform is inspired by intricate courtship of Heliconius butterflies, where female species rely on the integration of visual cues (such as wing color) and chemical cues (such as pheromones) generated by the male butterflies for mate selection. The butterfly&#8208;inspired visuochemical integration platform has significant implications in both robotics and the advancement of neuromorphic computing, going beyond unisensory intelligence and information processing.

         <title>Protonation Stimulates the Layered to Rock Salt Phase Transition of Ni&#8208;Rich Sodium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de&#8208;protonation of electrolyte solvents and subsequent protonation of layered NaNiO2 triggers multiple degradation mechanisms. Intercalated protons are primarily responsible for the accelerated layered to rock salt phase formation process, which ends up in porous bulk structures as well as anisotropic surface degradations. 








Abstract
Protonation of oxide cathodes triggers surface transition metal dissolution and accelerates the performance degradation of Li&#8208;ion batteries. While strategies are developed to improve cathode material surface stability, little is known about the effects of protonation on bulk phase transitions in these cathode materials or their sodium&#8208;ion battery counterparts. Here, using NaNiO2 in electrolytes with different proton&#8208;generating levels as model systems, a holistic picture of the effect of incorporated protons is presented. Protonation of lattice oxygens stimulate transition metal migration to the alkaline layer and accelerates layered&#8208;rock&#8208;salt phase transition, which leads to bulk structure disintegration and anisotropic surface reconstruction layers formation. A cathode that undergoes severe protonation reactions attains a porous architecture corresponding to its multifold performance fade. This work reveals that interactions between electrolyte and cathode that result in protonation can dominate the structural reversibility/stability of bulk cathodes, and the insight sheds light for the development of future batteries.

         <title>Versatile Structural Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enabling Switchable Catalytic Selectivity</title>

         <dc:description>
A dynamically mediated synthesis strategy achieves versatile structure engineering of crystalline Zr&#8208;ODB&#8208;hz nanosheets and defective crystalline d&#8208;Zr&#8208;ODB&#8208;hz nanosheets. The Pd/Zr&#8208;ODB&#8208;hz catalyst gives partially hydrogenated alcohols as the main products for the catalytic conversion of vanillin. In contrast, the defective Pd/d&#8208;Zr&#8208;ODB&#8208;hz catalyst shows switchable product selectivity and gives further hydrogenolysized alkanes as the only product.








Abstract
The structure engineering of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) forms the cornerstone of their applications. Nonetheless, realizing the simultaneous versatile structure engineering of MOFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, a dynamically mediated synthesis strategy to simultaneously engineer the crystal structure, defect structure, and nanostructure of MOFs is proposed. These include amorphous Zr&#8208;ODB nanoparticles, crystalline Zr&#8208;ODB&#8208;hz (ODB = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;oxalyldibenzoate, hz = hydrazine) nanosheets, and defective d&#8208;Zr&#8208;ODB&#8208;hz nanosheets. Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with low&#8208;dose high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field imaging technique vividly portrays these engineered structures. Concurrently, the introduced hydrazine moieties confer self&#8208;reduction properties to the respective MOF structures, allowing the in situ installation of catalytic Pd nanoparticles. Remarkably, in the hydrogenation of vanillin&#8208;like biomass derivatives, Pd/Zr&#8208;ODB&#8208;hz yields partially hydrogenated alcohols as the primary products, whereas Pd/d&#8208;Zr&#8208;ODB&#8208;hz exclusively produces fully hydrogenated alkanes. Density functional theory calculations, coupled with experimental evidence, uncover the catalytic selectivity switch triggered by the change in structure type. The proposed strategy of versatile structure engineering of MOFs introduces an innovative pathway for the development of high&#8208;performance MOF&#8208;based catalysts for various reactions.

         <title>Fluorinating All Interfaces Enables Super&#8208;Stable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries by In Situ Conversion of Detrimental Surface Li2CO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ decarbonization&#8211;fluorination approach is proposed to fluorinate all inclusive interfaces between cathode, electrolytes, and anodes. The produced LiF&#8208;rich interphases throughout the solid&#8208;state batteries suppress interfacial side reactions, reduce resistances of all interfaces, improve Li plating/stripping behavior, and stabilize Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials. The developed batteries achieve high rate capability and prolonged cycling duration at 4.5 V.








Abstract
Li&#8208;stuffed battery materials intrinsically have surface impurities, typically Li2CO3, which introduce severe kinetic barriers and electrochemical decay for a cycling battery. For energy&#8208;dense solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs), mitigating detrimental Li2CO3 from both cathode and electrolyte materials is required, while the direct removal approaches hardly avoid Li2CO3 regeneration. Here, a decarbonization&#8211;fluorination strategy to construct ultrastable LiF&#8208;rich interphases throughout the SSLBs by in situ reacting Li2CO3 with LiPF6 at 60 &#176;C is reported. The fluorination of all interfaces effectively suppresses parasitic reactions while substantially reducing the interface resistance, producing a dendrite&#8208;free Li anode with an impressive cycling stability of up to 7000&#160;h. Particularly, transition metal dissolution associated with gas evolution in the cathodes is remarkably reduced, leading to notable improvements in battery rate capability and cyclability at a high voltage of 4.5&#160;V. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one approach propels the development of SSLBs by overcoming the limitations associated with surface impurities and interfacial challenges.

         <title>Composite Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes with Organic&#8211;Inorganic Interface Engineering for Fast Ion Transport in Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na3Zr2Si2PO12/poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) composite electrospun membrane with abundant and continuous fast&#8208;ion transfer interfaces are fabricated to balance Na+ migration in quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes. PVDF&#8208;HFP is preferentially reduced to form a &#8220;NaF&#8208;rich&#8221; solid electrolyte interphase when in contact with sodium anode. The synergistic combination of multiple strategies can achieve high performance and stable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes (QSSE) are a promising candidate for addressing the limitations of liquid and solid electrolytes. However, different ion transport capacities between liquid solvents and polymers can cause localized heterogeneous distribution of Na+ fluxes. In addition, the continuous side reactions occurring at the interface between QSSE and sodium anode lead to uncontrollable dendrites growth. Herein, a novel strategy is designed to integrate the composite electrospun membrane of Na3Zr2Si2PO12 and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) into QSSE, aiming to introduce new fast ion conducting channels at the organic&#8211;inorganic interface. The efficient ion transfer pathways can effectively promote the homogenization of ion migration, enabling composite QSSE to achieve an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 4.1 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, with a Na+ transference number as high as 0.54. Moreover, the PVDF&#8208;HFP is preferentially reduced upon contact with the sodium anode to form a &#8220;NaF&#8208;rich&#8221; solid electrolyte interphase, which effectively suppresses the growth of dendrites. The synergistic combination of multiple strategies can realize exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability in both sodium symmetric batteries (&#8776;700&#160;h) and full batteries (2100 cycles). This study provides a new insight for constructing high performance and dendrite&#8208;free solid&#8208;state sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Bifunctional Interphase Promotes Li+ De&#8208;Solvation and Transportation Enabling Fast&#8208;Charging Graphite Anode at Low Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coherent Li3P coating on the graphite surface enhances Li+ transport across the solid electrolyte interphase and promotes Li+ de&#8208;solvation. This accelerates charge transport kinetics and against propylene carbonate solvent co&#8208;intercalation. Full&#8208;cells with Li3P&#8208;coated graphite anode and PC&#8208;based electrolytes exhibit 70% capacity retention at &#8722;20 &#176;C (4 C charging rate) and 65% at &#8722;40 &#176;C (0.05 C charging rate).








Abstract
The most successful lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) based on ethylene carbonate electrolytes and graphite anodes still suffer from severe energy and power loss at temperatures below &#8722;20 &#176;C, which is because of high viscosity or even solidification of electrolytes, sluggish de&#8208;solvation of Li+ at the electrode surface, and slow Li+ transportation in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Here, a coherent lithium phosphide (Li3P) coating firmly bonding to the graphite surface to effectively address these challenges is engineered. The dense, continuous, and robust Li3P interphase with high ionic conductivity enhances Li+ transportation across the SEI. Plus, it promotes Li+ de&#8208;solvation through an electron transfer mechanism, which simultaneously accelerates the charge transport kinetics and stands against the co&#8208;intercalation of low&#8208;melting&#8208;point solvent molecules, such as propylene carbonate (PC), 1,3&#8208;dioxolane, and 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane. Consequently, an unprecedented combination of high&#8208;capacity retention and fast&#8208;charging ability for LIBs at low temperatures is achieved. In full&#8208;cells encompassing the Li3P&#8208;coated graphite anode and PC electrolytes, an impressive 70% of their room&#8208;temperature capacity is attained at &#8722;20 &#176;C with a 4 C charging rate and a 65% capacity retention is achieved at &#8722;40 &#176;C with a 0.05 C charging rate. This research pioneers a transformative trajectory in fortifying LIB performance in cryogenic environments.

         <title>Subcutaneous Administration of a Zwitterionic Chitosan&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Controlled Spatiotemporal Release of Monoclonal Antibodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogel is developed using chitosan and chitosan@DOTAGA, enabling the repurposing of sterile monoclonal antibodies formulations designed for intravenous administration as tunable subcutaneous (SC) formulations. This hydrogel has demonstrated biodegradability, biocompatibility, and controlled release properties in mice and nonhuman primates, offering rapid translation to human use and potential for clinical development of SC biosimilars.








Abstract
Subcutaneous (SC) administration of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a proven strategy for improving therapeutic outcomes and patient compliance. The current FDA&#8208;/EMA&#8208;approved enzymatic approach, utilizing recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) to enhance mAbs SC delivery, involves degrading the extracellular matrix's hyaluronate to increase tissue permeability. However, this method lacks tunable release properties, requiring individual optimization for each mAb. Seeking alternatives, physical polysaccharide hydrogels emerge as promising candidates due to their tunable physicochemical and biodegradability features. Unfortunately, none have demonstrated simultaneous biocompatibility, biodegradability, and controlled release properties for large proteins (&#8805;150&#160;kDa) after SC delivery in clinical settings. Here, a novel two&#8208;component hydrogel comprising chitosan and chitosan@DOTAGA is introduced that can be seamlessly mixed with sterile mAbs formulations initially designed for intravenous (IV) administration, repurposing them as novel tunable SC formulations. Validated in mice and nonhuman primates (NHPs) with various mAbs, including trastuzumab and rituximab, the hydrogel exhibited biodegradability and biocompatibility features. Pharmacokinetic studies in both species demonstrated tunable controlled release, surpassing the capabilities of rHuPH20, with comparable parameters to the rHuPH20+mAbs formulation. These findings signify the potential for rapid translation to human applications, opening avenues for the clinical development of this novel SC biosimilar formulation.

         <title>&#8220;Spark&#8221; PtMnIr Nanozymes for Electrodynamic&#8208;Boosted Multienzymatic Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
PtMnIr nanozymes exhibit pentaenzymatic activities for reactive oxygen species generation and glutathione consumption. Under alternating current stimulation, highly active &#8220;spark&#8221; species (Ir3+ and Mn3+) are significantly increased for enzymatic/electrodynamic synergistic oncotherapy. PtMnIr nanozymes can also activate immune pathways (immunogenic cell death and Mn2+&#8208;induced cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate &#160;synthase&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes) and inhibit the tumor metastasis.








Abstract
Multienzyme&#8208;mimicking redox nanozymes capable of efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cellular homeostasis disruption are highly pursued for cancer therapy. However, it still faces challenges from the complicate tumor microenvironment (TME) and high chance for tumor metastasis. Herein, well&#8208;dispersed PtMnIr nanozymes are designed with multiple enzymatic activities, including catalase (CAT), oxidase (OXD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), which continuously produce ROS and deplete glutathione (GSH) concurrently in an &#8220;inner catalytic loop&#8221; way. With the help of electrodynamic stimulus, highly active &#8220;spark&#8221; species (Ir3+ and Mn3+) are significantly increased, resulting in an effective cascade enzymatic and electrodynamic therapy. Moreover, the cyclic generation of ROS can also facilitate ferroptosis and apoptosis in tumor cells, boosting synergistic therapy. Importantly, lung metastasis inhibition is found, which confirms efficient immunotherapy by the combined effect of immunogenic cell death (ICD) and Mn2+&#8208;induced cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthase (cGAS)&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8211;STING) pathway, contributing great potential in the treatment of malignant tumors.

         <title>A High&#8208;Q Electric&#8208;Mechano&#8208;Magnetic Coupled Resonator for ELF/SLF Cross&#8208;Medium Magnetic Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a novel high&#8208;Q electric&#8208;mechanical&#8208;magnetic resonator for cross&#8208;medium extremely/super low frequency (ELF/SLF) magnetic communication. Through designing hard&#8211;soft hybrid, step&#8208;stiffness piezoelectric&#8208;magnet cantilever beam, much enhanced magnetic dipole oscillations are achieved, resulting in &#8776;5000 times higher ELF/SLF magnetic field emitting efficiency over conventional loop coil antennas. This work is of great significance for future air&#8211;seawater, air&#8211;ground communication.








Abstract
Extremely/super low frequency (ELF/SLF) electromagnetic wave can effectively propagate in the harsh cross&#8208;medium environment where a high&#8208;frequency electromagnetic wave cannot pass due to the fast decay. For efficiently transmitting a strong ELF/SLF radiation signal, the traditional electromagnetic antenna requires a super&#8208;large loop (&gt;10&#160;km). To address this issue, in this work, a piezoelectric ceramic/ferromagnetic heterogeneous structured, cantilever beam&#8208;type electric&#8208;mechano&#8208;magnetic coupled resonator at only centimeter scale for ELF/SLF cross&#8208;medium magnetic communication is reported. Through designing hard&#8208;soft hybrid step&#8208;stiffness elastic beam, the resonator exhibits a much higher quality factor Q (&#8776;240) for ELF/SLF magnetic field transmitting, which is one to five orders of magnitude higher than those of previously reported mechanical antennas and loop coil antennas. Moreover, the resonator exhibits a 5000 times higher magnetic field emitting efficiency compared to a conventional loop coil antenna in ELF/SLF band. It also demonstrates a 200% increase in magnetic field emitting capacity compared to existing piezoelectric&#8208;driven antennas. In addition, an ASK+PSK modulation method is proposed for suppressing relaxation time of the resonator, and a reduction in the relaxation time by 80% is observed. Furthermore, an air&#8211;seawater cross&#8208;medium magnetic field communication is successful demonstrated, indicating its potential as portable, high&#8208;efficient antenna for underwater and underground communications.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells via Activating Lead&#8211;Iodine Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 without MA+, Cs+, Rb+, and Br&#8722; has lagged because of the high difficulty of preparation. A facile synthesis pathway of high&#8208;quality phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 by a new solution modification strategy, which activates Pb&#9472;I frameworks by strong Pb&#8943;O coordination, is proposed. The forming Pb&#8943;O coated network can simultaneously realize the antisolvent&#8208;free spontaneous uniform nucleation and the rapid phase transition from &#948; to &#945;. The resulting devices achieve a record efficiency of 23.15%.








Abstract
Narrow bandgap cubic formamidine perovskite (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) is widely studied for its potential to achieve record&#8209;breaking efficiency. However, its high preparation difficulty caused by lattice instability is criticized. A popular strategy for stabilizing the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 lattice is to replace intrinsic FA+ or I&#8722; with smaller ions of MA+, Cs+, Rb+, and Br&#8722;, whereas this generally leads to broadened optical bandgap and phase separation. Studies show that ions substitution&#8208;free phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 can achieve intrinsic phase stability. However, the challenging preparation of high&#8208;quality films has hindered its further development. Here, a facile synthesis of high&#8208;quality MA+, Cs+, Rb+, and Br&#8722;&#8208;free phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite film by a new solution modification strategy is reported. This enables the activation of lead&#8211;iodine (Pb&#9472;I) frameworks by forming the coated Pb&#8943;O network, thus simultaneously promoting spontaneous homogeneous nucleation and rapid phase transition from &#948; to &#945; phase. As a result, the efficient and stable phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 PSC is obtained through a one&#8208;step method without antisolvent treatment, with a record efficiency of 23.15% and excellent long&#8208;term operating stability for 500 h under continuous light stress.

A popular strategy for stabilizing the &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; lattice is to replace intrinsic FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with smaller ions of MA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas this generally leads to broadened optical bandgap and phase separation. Studies show that ions substitution-free phase-pure &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can achieve intrinsic phase stability. However, the challenging preparation of high-quality films has hindered its further development. Here, a facile synthesis of high-quality MA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-free phase-pure &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite film by a new solution modification strategy is reported. This enables the activation of lead&#8211;iodine (Pb&#9472;I) frameworks by forming the coated Pb&#8943;O network, thus simultaneously promoting spontaneous homogeneous nucleation and rapid phase transition from &#948; to &#945; phase. As a result, the efficient and stable phase-pure &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PSC is obtained through a one-step method without antisolvent treatment, with a record efficiency of 23.15% and excellent long-term operating stability for 500 h under continuous light stress.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Constructing Fully&#8208;Active and Ultra&#8208;Active Sites in High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoclusters for Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Electrolytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing sufficiently effective catalysts and electrolysis systems for electrolytic hydrogen production is crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of hydrogen energy and sustainable energy development. This work innovatively constructs high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoclusters with full&#8208;active sites and super&#8208;active sites and demonstrates the best&#8208;level performance for hydrogen evolution reaction, hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), and two&#8208;electrode HzOR&#8208;assisted hydrogen production system.








Abstract
The development of sufficiently high&#8208;efficiency systems and effective catalysts for electrocatalytic hydrogen production is of great significance but challenging. Here, high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoclusters (HEANCs) with full&#8208;active sites and super&#8208;active sites are innovatively constructed for hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted electrolytic hydrogen production. The HEANCs show an average size of only seven atomic layers (1.48&#160;nm). As the catalysts for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction, the HEANC/C exhibits the best&#8208;level performance among reported electrocatalysts. Especially, the HEANC/C achieves an ultrahigh mass activity of 12.85 A mg&#8722;1noble metals at &#8722;0.07&#160;V and overpotential of only 9.5&#160;mV for 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for alkaline HER. Further, with HEANC/C as both anode and cathode catalysts, an overall hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted splitting (OHzS) electrolyzer shows a record mass activity of 250.2&#160;mA mg&#8722;1catalysts at 0.1&#160;V and only requires working voltages of 0.025 and 0.181&#160;V to reach 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, outperforming those of overall water&#8208;splitting system and other reported chemicals&#8208;assisted hydrogen production systems. Active site libraries including 72 sites on HEANC surface are originally constructed by theoretical calculations, revealing that all sites on HEANC surface are effective active sites for OHzS; especially some are super&#8208;active sites, endowing the best&#8208;level performance of HEANC/C.

         <title>Nanoscale Operando Characterization of Electrolyte&#8208;Gated Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Reveals Charge Transport Bottlenecks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study delves into the charge transport properties of electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors by employing in&#8208;liquid scanning dielectric microscopy. By introducing a novel interpretation framework, the research achieves quantitative mapping of the local electric potential, facilitating a detailed assessment of charge transport bottlenecks across all operational regimes. The findings can fosterthe formulation ofstructure&#8211;property&#8211;function relationships for device optimization.








Abstract
Charge transport in electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (EGOFETs) is governed by the microstructural property of the semiconducting thin film that is in direct contact with the electrolyte. Therefore, a comprehensive nanoscale operando characterization of the active channel is crucial to pinpoint various charge transport bottlenecks for rational and targeted optimization of the devices. Here, the local electrical properties of EGOFETs are systematically probed by in&#8208;liquid scanning dielectric microscopy (in&#8208;liquid SDM) and a direct picture of their functional mechanism at the nanoscale is provided across all operational regimes, starting from subthreshold, linear to saturation, until the onset of pinch&#8208;off. To this end, a robust interpretation framework of in&#8208;liquid SDM is introduced that enables quantitative local electric potential mapping directly from raw experimental data without requiring calibration or numerical simulations. Based on this development, a straightforward nanoscale assessment of various charge transport bottlenecks is performed, like contact access resistances, inter&#8208; and intradomain charge transport, microstructural inhomogeneities, and conduction anisotropy, which have been inaccessible earlier. Present results contribute to the fundamental understanding of charge transport in electrolyte&#8208;gated transistors and promote the development of direct structure&#8211;property&#8211;function relationships to guide future design rules.

A Cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;inspired system capable of using ultralow&#8208;dose chemical drugs to manipulate pyroptosis and trigger antitumour immune function.








Abstract
A Cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;inspired system capable of using ultralow&#8208;dose chemical drugs to manipulate cell death is needed to investigate the antitumor immunotherapy. Recent studies reveal pyroptosis promotes antitumor immune function. However, high&#8208;dose chemotherapy leads to cytokine release syndrome by pyroptosis. Therefore, pyroptosis&#8208;inducing ultralow&#8208;dose chemotherapy is potential in preclinical and clinical research, but its efficacy, safety, and the antitumor immune responses are not clear. Here, a near&#8208;infrared light controllable killing system (BIK system) is established by which ultralow&#8208;dose doxorubicin can be spatiotemporally transported to tumor cells and mediate efficient pyroptosis. This BIK system reduces total drug consumption to less than one&#8208;thirtieth the common dose in vitro. Moreover, this BIK system exhibited good tumor targeting and tumor penetration. This system is applied for pyroptosis&#8208;induced antitumor therapies, which shows less than &#8776;25&#160;&#181;g kg&#8722;1 doxorubicin is sufficient for tumor regression with negligible injuries to major organs. The antitumor immune function are proven to correlate with the impressive efficacy of pyroptosis&#8208;inducing ultralow&#8208;dose chemotherapy. This study provides new insights into the design of nanoassisted systems for activating the antitumor immunity by microstimulation; the application of the BIK system suggests that ultralow&#8208;dose chemotherapy is sufficient for inducing a robust pyroptosis&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity.

         <title>A Fiber Sensor for Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Extracellular Potassium Ion Fluctuations in Chronic Neuropsychiatric Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber potassium ion (K+) sensor with long&#8208;term stability of up to 6 months in vivo is fabricated with a rough conductive fiber and a hydrophobic&#8208;treated transduction layer stably interfaced with a K+&#8208;selective membrane. The resultant sensor can monitor fluctuations in extracellular K+ concentration in the brain under diverse physiological states even throughout the progression of depression over months.








Abstract
The extracellular potassium ion concentration in the brain exerts a significant influence on cellular excitability and intercellular communication. Perturbations in the extracellular potassium ion level are closely correlated with various chronic neuropsychiatric disorders including depression. However, a critical gap persists in performing real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term monitoring of extracellular potassium ions, which is necessary for comprehensive profiling of chronic neuropsychiatric diseases. Here, a fiber potassium ion sensor (FKS) that consists of a soft conductive fiber with a rough surface and a hydrophobic&#8208;treated transduction layer interfaced with a potassium ion&#8208;selective membrane is found to solve this problem. The FKS demonstrates stable interfaces between its distinct functional layers in an aqueous environment, conferring an exceptional stability of 6 months in vivo, in stark contrast to previous reports with working durations from hours to days. Upon implantation into the mouse brain, the FKS enables effective monitoring of extracellular potassium ion dynamics under diverse physiological states including anesthesia, forced swimming, and tail suspension. Using this FKS, tracking of extracellular potassium ion fluctuations that align with behaviors associated with the progression of depression over months is achieved, demonstrating its usability in studying chronic neuropsychiatric disorders from a new biochemical perspective.

Using this FKS, tracking of extracellular potassium ion fluctuations that align with behaviors associated with the progression of depression over months is achieved, demonstrating its usability in studying chronic neuropsychiatric disorders from a new biochemical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Passivating Dipole Layer Bridged 3D/2D Perovskite Heterojunction for Highly Efficient and Stable p&#8208;i&#8208;n Solar Cells</title>

A strategy of passivating dipole layer to reconstruct an efficient 3D/2D perovskite heterojunction has been successfully developed, enabling high&#8208;performance p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Constructing 3D/2D perovskite heterojunction is a promising approach to integrate the benefits of high efficiency and superior stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, in contrast to n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectural PSCs, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with 3D/2D heterojunction have serious limitations in achieving high&#8208;performance as they suffer from a large energetic mismatch and electron extraction energy barrier from a 3D perovskite layer to a 2D perovskite layer, and serious nonradiative recombination at the heterojunction. Here a strategy of incorporating a thin passivating dipole layer (PDL) onto 3D perovskite and then depositing 2D perovskite without dissolving the underlying layer to form an efficient 3D/PDL/2D heterojunction is developed. It is revealed that PDL regulates the energy level alignment with the appearance of interfacial dipole and strongly interacts with 3D perovskite through covalent bonds, which eliminate the energetic mismatch, reduce the surface defects, suppress the nonradiative recombination, and thus accelerate the charge extraction at such electron&#8208;selective contact. As a result, it is reported that the 3D/PDL/2D junction p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs present a power conversion efficiency of 24.85% with robust stability, which is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of the 3D/2D junction n&#8208;i&#8208;p devices.

         <title>Nucleation Regulation and Mesoscopic Dielectric Screening in &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that ((methyl&#8208;sulfonyl)phenyl)ethylamines (MSPEs)&#160;interact with FAPbI3. By increasing the polarity of MSPE additives, the nucleation and crystallization of perovskite are effectively controlled, leading to superior films. This polarity engineering also attenuates Coulomb attractions among charged defects and screens carrier capture process, thereby minimizing non&#8208;radiative recombination. The technique has led to a notable power conversion efficiency of 20.5% of perovskite solar modules (active area of 70 cm2).








Abstract
While significant advancements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been made, attaining controllable perovskite crystallization is still a considerable hurdle. This challenge stems from the initial formation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3, a more energetically stable phase than the desired black &#945;&#8208;phase, during film deposition. This disrupts the heterogeneous nucleation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, causing the formation of mixed phases and defects. To this end, polarity engineering using molecular additives, specifically ((methyl&#8208;sulfonyl)phenyl)ethylamines (MSPEs) are introduced. The findings reveal that the interaction of PbI2&#8208;MSPEs&#8208;FAI intermediates is enhanced with the increased polarity of MSPEs, which in turn expedites the nucleation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This leads to the development of high&#8208;quality &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films, characterized by vertical crystal orientation and reduced residual stresses. Additionally, the increased dipole moment of MSPE at perovskite grain boundaries attenuates Coulomb attractions among charged defects and screens carrier capture process, thereby diminishing non&#8208;radiative recombination. Utilizing these mechanisms, PSCs treated with highly polar 2&#8208;(4&#8208;MSPE) achieve an impressive PCE of 25.2% in small&#8208;area devices and 20.5% in large&#8208;area perovskite solar modules (PSMs) with an active area of 70 cm2. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy in achieving controllable crystallization of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, paving the way for scalable&#8208;production of high&#8208;efficiency PSMs.

         <title>Continuous Melt Spinning of Adaptable Covalently Cross&#8208;Linked Self&#8208;Healing Ionogel Fibers for Multi&#8208;Functional Ionotronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new molecular strategy based on dynamic covalent cross&#8208;linking networks is proposed to realize the continuous preparation of the adaptable covalently crosslinked ionogel fiber. The resultant DOU&#8208;IG fibers with high transparency, tensile strength, stretchability, solvent resistance, and self&#8208;healing capacity shown great potential for use in sensor, triboelectric nanogenerator, and electroluminescent display. This strategy will be powerful tools to develop high&#8208;performance materials.








Abstract
Stretchable conductive fibers play key roles in electronic textiles, which have substantial improvements in terms of flexibility, breathability, and comfort. Compared to most existing electron&#8208;conductive fibers, ion&#8208;conductive fibers are usually soft, stretchable, and transparent, leading to increasing attention. However, the integration of desirable functions including high transparency, stretchability, conductivity, solvent resistance, self&#8208;healing ability, processability, and recyclability remains a challenge to be addressed. Herein, a new molecular strategy based on dynamic covalent cross&#8208;linking networks is developed to enable continuous melt spinning of the ionogel fiber with the aforementioned properties. As a proof of concept, adaptable covalently cross&#8208;linked ionogel fibers based on dimethylglyoximeurethane (DOU) groups (DOU&#8208;IG fiber) are prepared. The resultant DOU&#8208;IG fiber exhibited high transparency (&gt;93%), tensile strength (0.76&#160;MPa), stretchability (784%), and solvent resistance. Owing to the dynamic of DOU groups, the DOU&#8208;IG fiber shows high healing performance using near&#8208;infrared light. Taking advantage of DOU&#8208;IG fibers, multifunctional ionotronics with the integration of several desirable functionalities including sensor, triboelectric nanogenerator, and electroluminescent display are fabricated and used for motion monitoring, energy harvesting, and human&#8211;machine interaction. It is believed that these DOU&#8208;IG fibers are promising for fabricating the next generation of electronic textiles and other wearable electronics.

         <title>Enhanced Electron Delocalization within Coherent Nano&#8208;Heterocrystal Ensembles for Optimizing Polysulfide Conversion in High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>

Construction of coherent nano&#8208;heterocrystal ensembles (CNEs) aims to achieve enhanced electron delocalization, ensure stability of high&#8208;activity crystal facets, improve catalytic efficiency, and lower the energy barriers for sulfur species conversion. The synergistic optimization of multi&#8208;reactive facets facilitates efficient conversion of polysulfides, offering a new approach for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and long&#8208;life Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
Commercialization of high energy density Lithium&#8208;Sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is impeded by challenges such as polysulfide shuttling, sluggish reaction kinetics, and limited Li+ transport. Herein, a jigsaw&#8208;inspired catalyst design strategy that involves in situ assembly of coherent nano&#8208;heterocrystal ensembles (CNEs) to stabilize high&#8208;activity crystal facets, enhance electron delocalization, and reduce associated energy barriers is proposed. On the catalyst surface, the stabilized high&#8208;activity facets induce polysulfide aggregation. Simultaneously, the surrounded surface facets with enhanced activity promote Li2S deposition and Li+ diffusion, synergistically facilitating continuous and efficient sulfur redox. Experimental and DFT computations results reveal that the dual&#8208;component hetero&#8208;facet design alters the coordination of Nb atoms, enabling the redistribution of 3D orbital electrons at the Nb center and promoting d&#8208;p hybridization with sulfur. The CNE, based on energy level gradient and lattice matching, endows maximum electron transfer to catalysts and establishes smooth pathways for ion diffusion. Encouragingly, the NbN&#8208;NbC&#8208;based pouch battery delivers a Weight energy density of 357&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, thereby demonstrating the practical application value of CNEs. This work unveils a novel paradigm for designing high&#8208;performance catalysts, which has the potential to shape future research on electrocatalysts for energy storage applications.

Encouragingly, the NbN-NbC-based pouch battery delivers a Weight energy density of 357&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby demonstrating the practical application value of CNEs. This work unveils a novel paradigm for designing high-performance catalysts, which has the potential to shape future research on electrocatalysts for energy storage applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Co/Mon Invigorated Bilateral Kinetics Modulation for Advanced Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the discharging/charging process, S8 molecules are rapidly and stably converted into Li2S due to the synergistic effect of different functional microdomains of Co/MoN. As expected, the Co/MoN decorated separators not only speed up sulfur redox kinetics and inhibit polysulfide shuttling but also realize uniform ion diffusion and stable lithium nucleation growth during cycling based on bilateral kinetics modulation strategy.








Abstract
Sluggish sulfur redox kinetics and Li&#8208;dendrite growth are the main bottlenecks for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Separator modification serves as a dual&#8208;purpose approach to address both of these challenges. In this study, the Co/MoN composite is rationally designed and applied as the modifier to modulate the electrochemical kinetics on both sides of the sulfur cathode and lithium anode. Benefiting from its adsorption&#8208;catalysis function, the decorated separators (Co/MoN@PP) not only effectively inhibit polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttle and accelerate their electrochemical conversion but also boost Li+ flux, realizing uniform Li plating/stripping. The accelerated LiPSs conversion kinetics and excellent sulfur redox reversibility triggered by Co/MoN modified separators are evidenced by performance, in&#8208;situ Raman detection and theoretical calculations. The batteries with Co/MoN@PP achieve a high initial discharge capacity of 1570 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C with a low decay rate of 0.39%, uniform Li+ transportation at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 over 800&#160;h. Moreover, the areal capacity of 4.62 mAh cm&#8722;2 is achieved under high mass loadings of 4.92&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This study provides a feasible strategy for the rational utilization of the synergistic effect of composite with multifunctional microdomains to solve the problems of Li anode and S cathode toward long&#8208;cycling Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Organic High&#8208;Temperature Synaptic Phototransistors for Energy&#8208;Efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile design of organic high&#8208;temperature optoelectronic synapses is reported and their visual object recognition capability at elevated temperatures is verified. The proposed flexible high&#8208;temperature optoelectronic synaptic arrays demonstrate an ultralow power consumption of 12.3 aJ per synaptic event. The conundrum of achieving reliable optical&#8208;modulated neuromorphic applications while balancing low power consumption can be effectively addressed.








Abstract
Organic optoelectronic synaptic devices that can reliably operate in high&#8208;temperature environments (i.e., beyond 121&#176;C) or remain stable after high&#8208;temperature treatments have significant potential in biomedical electronics and bionic robotic engineering. However, it is challenging to acquire this type of organic devices considering the thermal instability of conventional organic materials and the degradation of photoresponse mechanisms at high temperatures. Here, high&#8208;temperature synaptic phototransistors (HTSPs) based on thermally stable semiconductor polymer blends as the photosensitive layer are developed, successfully simulating fundamental optical&#8208;modulated synaptic characteristics at a wide operating temperature range from room temperature to 220&#176;C. Robust optoelectronic performance can be observed in HTSPs even after experiencing 750 h of the double 85 testing due to the enhanced operational reliability. Using HTSPs, Morse&#8208;code optical decoding scheme and the visual object recognition capability are also verified at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, flexible HTSPs are fabricated, demonstrating an ultralow power consumption of 12.3 aJ per synaptic event at a low operating voltage of &#8722;0.05&#160;mV. Overall, the conundrum of achieving reliable optical&#8208;modulated neuromorphic applications while balancing low power consumption can be effectively addressed. This research opens up a simple but effective avenue for the development of high&#8208;temperature and energy&#8208;efficient wearable optoelectronic devices in neuromorphic computing applications.

         <title>Unrestricted Chiral Patterning by Laser Writing in Liquid Crystalline and Plasmonic Nanocomposite Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling chirality of materials is crucial for optoelectronic and spintronic technologies. This study presents a universal approach for governing the chirality in thin films of compounds exhibiting chirality synchronization. The developed system based on laser writing locally melts and guides the crystallization front of the material. Combined with autonomous analysis of chirality, it enables unrestricted formation of chiral patterns.








Abstract
Obtaining hierarchical structures with arbitrarily controlled chirality remains a challenge. Here, thin films featuring chiroptically bipolar patterns are produced by a device utilizing microscale photothermal re&#8208;melting of materials exhibiting chirality synchronization. This device operates autonomously, guided by an algorithm that facilitates the homochiral growth of supramolecular organic helices through controlling their re&#8208;melting. The chirality synchronization phenomena of constitutionally achiral molecules grants availability of both handednesses of the helices, enabling unrestricted chiral writing in the film. The collective chiroptical response of assembled molecules is utilised to guide the patterning process, creating a foundation for optically secured information. The established methodology enables achieving dissymmetry factor values for circular dichroism (CD) a magnitude higher than previously reported, as confirmed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, synchrotron&#8208;based Mueller matrix polarimetry (MMP). Moreover, the developed method is extended to nanocomposites comprising gold nanoparticles, providing the opportunity to tune the CD toward the plasmonic region. This strategic application of photothermal processing, specifically laser&#8208;directed melting, uncovers the potential to broaden the selection of nanostructured materials with precisely designed functionalities for photonic applications.

         <title>Waterproof and Flexible Perovskite Photodetector Enabled By P&#8208;type Organic Molecular Rubrene with High Moisture and Mechanical Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using the amorphous P&#8208;type organic small molecule Rubrene film as both the protective layer and the hole&#8208;transporting layer significantly enhances the stability of perovskite&#8208;based flexible optoelectronic devices. Without encapsulation, the Rubrene/PVK/ZnO heterojunction, fabricated via the physical vapor deposition method, maintained its structure and performance intact after being immersed in water for 6000 min.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite films have gained significant attention because of their remarkable optoelectronic performances. However, their poor stability upon the severe environment appears to be one of the main facets that impedes their further commercial applications. Herein, a method to improve the stability of flexible photodetectors under water and humidity environment without encapsulation is reported. The devices are fabricated using the physical vapor deposition method (Pulse Laser Deposition &amp; Thermal Evaporation) under high&#8208;vacuum conditions. An amorphous organic Rubrene film with low molecular polarity and high elastic modulus serves as both a protective layer and hole transport layer. After immersed in water for 6000&#160;min, the photoluminescence intensity attenuation of films only decreased by a maximum of 10%. The demonstrator device, based on Rubrene/CsPbBr3/ZnO heterojunction confirms that the strategy not only enhances device moisture and mechanical stability but also achieves high sensitivity in optoelectronic detection. In self&#8208;powered mode, it has a fast response time of 79.4 &#181;s /207.6 &#181;s and a responsivity 124&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1. Additionally, the absence of encapsulation simplifies the fabrication of complex electrodes, making it suitable for various applications. This study highlights the potential use of amorphous organic films in improving the stability of perovskite&#8208;based flexible devices.

         <title>3D&#160;Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect in Magnetic Topological Insulator Trilayers of Hundred&#8208;Nanometer Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first work in synthesizing 3D quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators with a thickness of one hundred nanometers, exceeding ten times the thickest QAH sample record, is reported. The hundred&#8208;nanometer&#8208;thick QAH insulators provide a promising platform for the exploration of the topological magnetoelectric effect, image magnetic monopole, as well as high&#8208;order topological insulator (TI) phase.








Abstract
Magnetic topological states refer to a class of exotic phases in magnetic materials with the non&#8208;trivial topological property determined by magnetic spin configurations. An example of such states is the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, which is a zero magnetic field manifestation of the quantum Hall effect. Current research in this direction focuses on QAH insulators with a thickness of less than 10&#160;nm. Here, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is employed to synthesize magnetic TI trilayers with a thickness of up to &#8776;106&#160;nm. It is found that these samples exhibit well&#8208;quantized Hall resistance and vanishing longitudinal resistance at zero magnetic field. By varying the magnetic dopants, gate voltages, temperature, and external magnetic fields, the properties of these thick QAH insulators are examined and the robustness of the 3D QAH effect is demonstrated. The realization of the well&#8208;quantized 3D QAH effect indicates that the nonchiral side surface states of the thick magnetic TI trilayers are gapped and thus do not affect the QAH quantization. The 3D QAH insulators of hundred&#8208;nanometer thickness provide a promising platform for the exploration of fundamental physics, including axion physics and image magnetic monopole, and the advancement of electronic and spintronic devices to circumvent Moore's law.

         <title>A Novel Ferroelectric Rashba Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor owns a definite Rashba spin&#8208;texture that can be manipulated and reversed by an applied electric field. Such a material is highly sought&#8208;after for spintronic transistors and/or memories. This work presents an original demonstration of a new ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor, by confronting its measured structural ferroelectric distortion to its observed Rashba electronic properties.








Abstract
Fast, reversible, and low&#8208;power manipulation of the spin texture is crucial for next generation spintronic devices like non&#8208;volatile bipolar memories, switchable spin current injectors or spin field effect transistors. Ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors (FERSC) are the ideal class of materials for the realization of such devices. Their ferroelectric character enables an electronic control of the Rashba&#8208;type spin texture by means of the reversible and switchable polarization. Yet, only very few materials are established to belong to this class of multifunctional materials. Here, Pb1&#8722;xGexTe is unraveled as a novel FERSC system down to nanoscale. The ferroelectric phase transition and concomitant lattice distortion are demonstrated by temperature dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, and their effect on electronic properties are measured by angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In few nanometer&#8208;thick epitaxial heterostructures, a large Rashba spin&#8208;splitting is exhibiting a wide tuning range as a function of temperature and Ge content. This work defines Pb1&#8722;xGexTe as a high&#8208;potential FERSC system for spintronic applications.

         <title>A Customizable Proteinic Bioadhesive Patch with Water&#8208;Switchable Underwater Adhesiveness, Adjustable Biodegradability, and Modifiable Stretchability for Healing Diverse Internal Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper proposes a unique bioadhesive patch, CUBAP, which is a crosslinked mussel protein with UV&#8208;induced polyacrylation designed to adhere underwater for various biomedical applications. CUBAP is nontoxic and customizable, providing strong water&#8208;responsive adhesion, adjustable biodegradability, and controllable physical properties suitable for healing wounds in specific internal organs and for the implantation of electronic medical devices.








Abstract
Customizable bioadhesives for individual organ requirements, including tissue type and motion, are essential, especially given the rise in implantable medical device applications demanding adequate underwater adhesion. While synthetic bioadhesives are widely used, their toxicity upon degradation shifts focus to biocompatible natural biomaterials. However, enhancing the adhesive strengths of these biomaterials presents ongoing challenges while accommodating the unique properties of specific organs. To address these issues, three types of customized underwater bioadhesive patches (CUBAPs) with strong, water&#8208;responsive adhesion and controllable biodegradability and stretchability based on bioengineered mussel adhesive proteins conjugated with acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid are proposed. The CUBAP system, although initially nonadhesive, shows strong underwater adhesion upon hydration, adjustable biodegradation, and adequate physical properties by adjusting the ratio of poly(acrylic acid) and poly(methacrylic acid). Through ex vivo and in vivo evaluations using defective organs and the implantation of electronic devices, the suitability of using CUBAPs for effective wound healing in diverse internal organs is demonstrated. Thus, this innovative CUBAP system offers strong underwater adhesiveness with tailored biodegradation timing and physical properties, giving it great potential in various biomedical applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MRI probe (ASOSN), which encompasses antiferromagnetic nanoparticles functionalized with single&#8208;chain fragment variable antibodies, is developed. The ASOSN leverages the presence of alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) oligomers to orchestrate a switchable T1&#8211;T2 MRI signal. Remarkably, ASOSN exhibits a unique ability to differentiate &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers from neuroinflammation in vivo, enabling the precise identification of endogenous &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers during the early stages of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
The alpha&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) oligomers hold a central role in the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Achieving accurate detection of &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers in vivo presents a promising avenue for early and accurate diagnosis of PD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with non&#8208;invasion and exceptional tissue penetration, offers a potent tool for visualizing &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers in vivo. Nonetheless, ensuring diagnostic specificity remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel MRI probe (ASOSN) is introduced, which encompasses highly sensitive antiferromagnetic nanoparticles functionalized with single&#8208;chain fragment variable antibodies, endowing it with the capacity for discerning recognition and binding to &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers and triggering a switchable T1&#8211;T2 MRI signal. Significantly, ASOSN possesses the unique capability to accurately discriminate &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers from neuroinflammation in vivo. Moreover, ASOSN facilitates the non&#8208;invasive and precise visualizing of endogenous &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers in living systems. This innovative design heralds the development of a non&#8208;invasive visualization strategy for &#945;&#8208;syn oligomers, marking a pivotal advancement for early and accurate diagnosis of PD.

         <title>Distinguished Roles of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Sp2 and Sp3 Hybridized Carbon on Extraordinary Supercapacitance in Acidic Aqueous Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen&#8208;doped sp2 and sp3 carbon can significantly improve the capacitance and charge storage performance of acidic aqueous supercapacitors. It is found for the first time that the charge storage efficiency is the highest when the bonding angle is in the range of 115&#8211;125o.








Abstract
The acidic aqueous supercapacitors have been found to deliver appealing capacitive properties due to fast ion diffusion caused by the applied smallest size of hydrion. However, their practical applications are largely inhibited by the narrow electrochemical stability window of water (1.23&#160;V). Herein, A nitrogen&#8208;enriched porous carbon materials (RNOPCs) is reported, consisting of varied nitrogen doping bonded on sp2 and sp3 carbon sites, which are capable of stimulating a wider potential window up to 1.4&#160;V and thus resulting in a great enhancement of capacitive performance in aqueous acidic electrolytes. Together with the improved electrical conductivity and preferable hydrion diffusion, RNOPCs exhibit an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance (1084 F cm&#8722;3) in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Besides, a fully packed RNOPCs&#8208;based symmetrical supercapacitor can deliver a high gravimetric and volumetric energy density of 31.8&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1 and 54.3&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 respectively, approaching those of lead acid batteries (25&#8211;35&#160;Wh Kg&#8722;1). The first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the lone pair electrons of the doped nitrogen can be delocalized on its neighboring carbon atoms, improving charge uptakes and overpotentials. Such facile and scale&#8208;up production of carbon&#8208;based supercapacitors can bridge the gap of energy density between traditional supercapacitors and batteries in aqueous electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen-doped &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; carbon can significantly improve the capacitance and charge storage performance of acidic aqueous supercapacitors. It is found for the first time that the charge storage efficiency is the highest when the bonding angle is in the range of 115&#8211;125&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acidic aqueous supercapacitors have been found to deliver appealing capacitive properties due to fast ion diffusion caused by the applied smallest size of hydrion. However, their practical applications are largely inhibited by the narrow electrochemical stability window of water (1.23&#160;V). Herein, A nitrogen-enriched porous carbon materials (RNOPCs) is reported, consisting of varied nitrogen doping bonded on &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; carbon sites, which are capable of stimulating a wider potential window up to 1.4&#160;V and thus resulting in a great enhancement of capacitive performance in aqueous acidic electrolytes. Together with the improved electrical conductivity and preferable hydrion diffusion, RNOPCs exhibit an ultrahigh volumetric capacitance (1084 F cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) in 0.5&#160;M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Besides, a fully packed RNOPCs-based symmetrical supercapacitor can deliver a high gravimetric and volumetric energy density of 31.8&#160;Wh Kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 54.3&#160;Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, approaching those of lead acid batteries (25&#8211;35&#160;Wh Kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Physiochemical Coupled Dynamic Nanosphere Lithography Enabling Multiple Metastructures from Single Mask</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By inserting a spacer between the nanosphere assembly and the wafer, novel dynamic nanosphere lithography is realized. With the physicochemical coupled etching mechanism, multiple metastructures with high controllability over their geometries are successfully fabricated continuously by a single etching step under a single mask.








Abstract
Metastructures are widely used in photonic devices, energy conversion, and biomedical applications. However, to fabricate multiple patterns continuously in single etching protocol with highly tunable photonic properties is challenging. Here, a simple and robust dynamic nanosphere lithography is proposed by inserting a spacer between the nanosphere assembly and the wafer. The nanosphere diameter decrease and uneven penetration of the spacer during etching lead to a dynamic masking process. Coupled anisotropic physical ion sputtering and ricocheting with isotropic chemical radical etching achieve highly tunable structures with various 3D patterns continuously forming through a single etching process. Specifically, the nanosphere diameters define the periodicity, the etched spacer forms the upper parts, and the wafer forms the lower parts. Each part of the structure is highly tunable through changing nanosphere diameter, spacer thickness, and etch conditions. Using this protocol, numerous structures of varying sizes including nanomushrooms, nanocones, nanopencils, and nanoneedles with diverse shapes are realized as proof of concepts. The broadband antireflection ability of the nanostructures and their use in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy are also demonstrated for practical application. This method substantially simplifies the fabrication procedure of various metastructures, paving the way for its application in multiple disciplines especially in photonic devices.

         <title>Cross Relaxation Enables Spatiotemporal Color&#8208;Switchable Upconversion in a Single Sandwich Nanoparticle for Information Security</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptual model is demonstrated to realize the color&#8208;switchable upconversion of Tm3+ in a sandwich nanostructure through cross relaxation, which plays a key role in temporal and spatial modulation of upconversion dynamics. The results present a deep insight into the physics of ionic interactions between lanthanide ions and further contribute to their frontier applications in information security and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Smart control of ionic interaction dynamics offers new possibilities for tuning and editing luminescence properties of lanthanide&#8208;based materials. However, it remains a daunting challenge to achieve the dynamic control of cross relaxation mediated photon upconversion, and in particular the involved intrinsic photophysics is still unclear. Herein, this work reports a conceptual model to realize the color&#8208;switchable upconversion of Tm3+ through spatiotemporal control of cross relaxation in the design of NaYF4:Gd@NaYbF4:Tm@NaYF4 sandwich nanostructure. It shows that cross relaxation plays a key role in modulating upconversion dynamics and tuning emission colors of Tm3+. Interestingly, it is found that there is a short temporal delay for the occurrence of cross relaxation in contrast to the spontaneous emission as a result of the slight energy mismatch between relevant energy levels. This further enables a fine emission color tuning upon non&#8208;steady state excitation. Moreover, a characteristic quenching time is proposed to describe the temporal evolution of cross relaxation quantitatively. These findings present a deep insight into the physics of ionic interactions in heavy doping systems, and also show great promise in frontier applications including information security, anti&#8208;counterfeiting and nanophotonics.

         <title>Harmonizing Thickness and Permeability in Bone Tissue Engineering: A Novel Silk Fibroin Membrane Inspired by Spider Silk Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The double&#8208;layer silk fibroin &#160;membrane, inspired by the structure of spider silk, serves not only as a barrier but also facilitates the connection between the bone defect area and the surrounding tissue. Its degradation products are conducive to osteogenesis. This study offers a novel approach to resolving the inherent contradiction between the barrier function and permeability of GBR membranes.








Abstract
Guided bone regeneration gathers significant interest in the realm of bone tissue engineering; however, the interplay between membrane thickness and permeability continues to pose a challenge that can be addressed by the water&#8208;collecting mechanism of spider silk, where water droplets efficiently move from smooth filaments to rough conical nodules. Inspired by the natural design of spider silk, an innovative silk fibroin membrane is developed featuring directional fluid transportation via harmoniously integrating a smooth, dense layer with a rough, loose layer; conical microchannels are engineered in the smooth and compact layer. Consequently, double&#8208;layered membranes with cone&#8208;shaped microporous passageways (CSMP&#8208;DSF membrane) are designed for in situ bone repair. Through extensive in vitro testing, it is noted that the CSMP&#8208;DSF membrane guides liquid flow from the compact layer's surface to the loose layer, enabling rapid diffusion. Remarkably, the CSMP&#8208;DSF membrane demonstrates superior mechanical properties and resistance to bacterial adhesion. When applied in vivo, the CSMP&#8208;DSF membrane achieves results on par with the commercial Bio&#8208;Gide collagen membranes. This innovative integration of a cross&#8208;thickness wetting gradient structure offers a novel solution, harmonizing the often&#8208;conflicting requirements of material transport, mechanical strength, and barrier effectiveness, while also addressing issues related to tissue engineering scaffold perfusion.

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets Constructed Hierarchical Water Transport Biological Channel for High&#8208;Performance Interfacial Seawater Evaporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large area conductive MOFs nanosheet film with hierarchical macro/microporous structures is fabricated for interfacial seawater evaporation, which effectively reduces the water evaporation enthalpy, enhances the photothermal conversion efficiency, and refreshes the evaporation rate records for MOF&#8208;based evaporators.








Abstract
Solar interfacial water evaporation shows great potential to address the global freshwater scarcity. Water evaporation being inherently energy intensive, Joule&#8208;heating assisted solar evaporation for addressing insufficient vapor under natural conditions is an ideal strategy. However, the simultaneous optimization of low evaporation enthalpy, high photothermal conversion, and excellent Joule&#8208;heating steam generation within a single material remain a rare achievement. Herein, inspired by the biological channel structures, a large&#8208;area film with hierarchical macro/microporous structures is elaborately designed by stacking the nanosheet of a conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), Ni3(HITP)2, on a paper substrate. By combining the above three features in one material, the water evaporation enthalpy reduces from 2455&#160;J&#160;g&#8722;1 to 1676 J g&#8722;1, and the photothermal conversion efficiency increases from 13.75% to 96.25%. Benefiting from the synergistic photothermal and Joule&#8208;heating effects, the evaporation rate achieves 2.60&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under one sun plus input electrical power of 4&#160;W, surpassing the thermodynamic limit and marking the highest reported value in MOF&#8208;based evaporators. Moreover, Ni3(HITP)2&#8208;paper exhibits excellent long&#8208;term stability in simulated seawater, where no salt crystallization and evaporation rate degradation are observed. This design strategy for nanosheet films with hierarchical macro/microporous channels provides inspiration for electronics, biological devices, and energy applications.

Benefiting from the synergistic photothermal and Joule-heating effects, the evaporation rate achieves 2.60&#160;kg m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under one sun plus input electrical power of 4&#160;W, surpassing the thermodynamic limit and marking the highest reported value in MOF-based evaporators. Moreover, Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HITP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-paper exhibits excellent long-term stability in simulated seawater, where no salt crystallization and evaporation rate degradation are observed. This design strategy for nanosheet films with hierarchical macro/microporous channels provides inspiration for electronics, biological devices, and energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Synergistic Lipid Nanoparticle Encapsulating mRNA Shingles Vaccine Induces Potent Immune Responses and Protects Guinea Pigs from Viral Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic lipid nanoparticle (Syn&#8208;LNP) containing two ionizable lipids is developed for the efficient delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine. Syn&#8208;LNP encapsulating the full VZV glycoprotein E&#8208;encoding mRNA elicits potent humoral and cellular immune responses in two strains of mice and protects vaccinated guinea pigs against live VZV challenges.








Abstract
Shingles is caused by the reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV) and manifests as painful skin rashes. While the recombinant protein&#8208;based vaccine proves highly effective, it encounters supply chain challenges due to a shortage of the necessary adjuvant. Messenger RNA (mRNA)&#8208;based vaccines can be rapidly produced on a large scale, but their effectiveness relies on efficient delivery and sequence design. Here, an mRNA&#8208;based VZV vaccine using a synergistic lipid nanoparticle (Syn&#8208;LNP) containing two different ionizable lipids is developed. Syn&#8208;LNP shows superior mRNA expression compared to LNPs formulated with either type of ionizable lipid and to a commercialized LNP. After encapsulating VZV glycoprotein E (gE)&#8208;encoding mRNA, mgE@Syn&#8208;LNP induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in two strains of mice. The magnitude of these responses is similar to that induced by adjuvanted recombinant gE proteins and significantly higher than that observed with live&#8208;attenuated VZV. mgE@Syn&#8208;LNP exhibits durable humoral responses for over 7 months without obvious adverse effects. In addition, mgE@Syn&#8208;LNP protects vaccinated guinea pigs against live VZV challenges. Preliminary studies on the mRNA antigen design reveal that the removal of glycosylation sites of gE greatly reduces its immune responses. Collectively, Syn&#8208;LNP encapsulating gE&#8208;encoded mRNA holds great promise as a shingles vaccine.

         <title>Enhanced Quasi&#8208;Fermi Level Splitting of Perovskite Solar Cells by Universal Dual&#8208;Functional Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional polymer additive PMA&#8208;AA is developed that enhances quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) through bulk defect passivation and interface energy level alignment, thereby effectively increasing the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). More importantly, the efficiency of 25.04% and 21.95% is achieved with this strategy for devices and modules, respectively.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention due to their higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and simple fabrication process. However, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss remains&#160;a&#160;significant impediment to enhance&#160;device performance. Here, a facile strategy to boost the VOC to 95.5% of the Shockley&#8208;Queisser (S&#8208;Q) limit through the introduction of a universal multifunctional polymer additive is demonstrated. This&#160;additive&#160;effectively passivates the cation and anion defects simultaneously, thereby leading to the transformation from the strong n&#8208;type to weak n&#8208;type of perovskite films. Benefitting from the energy level alignment and the suppression of bulk non&#8208;radiative recombination, the quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) is enhanced. &#160;Consequently, the champion devices with 1.59&#160;eV&#8208;based perovskite reach the highest VOC value of 1.24&#160;V and a PCE of 23.86%. Furthermore, this strategy boosts the VOC by at least 0.07&#160;V across five different perovskite systems, a PCE of 25.04% is achieved for 1.57&#160;eV&#8208;based PSCs, and the corresponding module (14 cm2) also obtained a high PCE of 21.95%. This work provides an effective and universal strategy to promote the VOC approach to the detailed balance theoretical limit.

         <title>Cross&#8208;Wired Memristive Crossbar Array for Effective Graph Data Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a cross&#8208;wired crossbar array (cwCBA) using a Pt/Ta2O5/HfO2/TiN memristor for precise physical graph representation (PGR) and dynamic node state control. The cwCBA, with enhanced PGR precision, successfully executes a dynamic path&#8208;finding algorithm with significantly lower processing complexity and analyzes complex protein&#8211;protein interaction networks, showing notable improvements in predictive accuracy over conventional methods.








Abstract
Graphs adequately represent the enormous interconnections among numerous entities in big data, incurring high computational costs in analyzing them with conventional hardware. Physical graph representation (PGR) is an approach that replicates the graph within a physical system, allowing for efficient analysis. This study introduces a cross&#8208;wired crossbar array (cwCBA), uniquely connecting diagonal and non&#8208;diagonal components in a CBA by a cross&#8208;wiring process. The cross&#8208;wired diagonal cells enable cwCBA to achieve precise PGR and dynamic node state control. For this purpose, a cwCBA is fabricated using Pt/Ta2O5/HfO2/TiN (PTHT) memristor with high on/off and self&#8208;rectifying characteristics. The structural and device benefits of PTHT cwCBA for enhanced PGR precision are highlighted, and the practical efficacy is demonstrated for two applications. First, it executes a dynamic path&#8208;finding algorithm, identifying the shortest paths in a dynamic graph. PTHT cwCBA shows a more accurate inferred distance and &#8776;1/3800 lower processing complexity than the conventional method. Second, it analyzes the protein&#8211;protein interaction (PPI) networks containing self&#8208;interacting proteins, which possess intricate characteristics compared to typical graphs. The PPI prediction results exhibit an average of 30.5% and 21.3% improvement in area under the curve and F1&#8208;score, respectively, compared to existing algorithms.

         <title>Significance of Engineering the MnO6 Octahedral Units to Promote the Oxygen Reduction Reaction of Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The geometric configuration of oxides plays a significant role in redox reactions performance. The octahedral tilting degree of perovskites can reduce the covalency between metal and oxygen ion, forming more highly active cation and oxygen vacancies during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) process, which can accelerate ORR process, optimize four&#8208;electrons steps, and decrease the energy barrier.








Abstract
The electronic structure and geometric configuration of catalysts play a crucial role to design novel perovskite&#8208;type catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Nowadays, many studies are more concerned with the influence of electronic structure and ignore the geometric effect, which plays a nonnegligible role in enhancing catalytic performances. Herein, this work regulates the MnO6 octahedral tilting degree of LaMnO3 by modulating the concentration of Y3+, excluding the electronic effect from the valence state of manganese. Plotting the MnO6 octahedral tilting degree as a function of concentration of Y3+ produces a volcano&#8208;shaped plot. The octahedral tilting can reduce the Mn&#8722;O covalency, generating more highly active Mn3+ and oxygen vacancies during ORR process. The specific activity has a positive correlation with octahedral tilting degree. Meanwhile, the octahedral tilting stabilizes Mn&#8722;O interactions during ORR process and promote stability. Based on experimental results and DFT calculations, octahedral tilting alters the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) and decrease the energy barrier. Subsequent extended experiment confirms that octahedral tilting is the key factor to affect the catalytic performances.

Subsequent extended experiment confirms that octahedral tilting is the key factor to affect the catalytic performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intracavitary Spraying of Nanoregulator&#8208;Encased Hydrogel Modulates Cholesterol Metabolism of Glioma&#8208;Supportive Macrophage for Postoperative Glioblastoma Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that glioma&#8208;supportive macrophages (GSMs), a &#8243;cholesterol factory&#8243;, demonstrate aberrantly hyperactive cholesterol metabolism and efflux, providing cholesterol to fuel glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) growth and induce CD8+ T cells exhaustion. To address this challenge, an sprayable nanoregulator (NR)&#8208;encased hydrogel is developed to target GSMs for synergistic Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonists to suppress cholesterol supply and prime tumoricidal immunity.








Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is notoriously resistant to immunotherapy due to its intricate immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Dysregulated cholesterol metabolism is implicated in the TME and promotes tumor progression. Here, it is found that cholesterol levels in GBM tissues are abnormally high, and glioma&#8208;supportive macrophages (GSMs), an essential &#8220;cholesterol factory&#8221;, demonstrate aberrantly hyperactive cholesterol metabolism and efflux, providing cholesterol to fuel GBM growth and induce CD8+ T cells exhaustion. Bioinformatics analysis confirms that high 7&#8208;dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7) level in GBM tissues associates with increased cholesterol biosynthesis, suppressed tumoricidal immune response, and poor patient survival, and DHCR7 expression level is significantly elevated in GSMs. Therefore, an intracavitary sprayable nanoregulator (NR)&#8208;encased hydrogel system to modulate cholesterol metabolism of GSMs is reported. The degradable NR&#8208;mediated ablation of DHCR7 in GSMs effectively suppresses cholesterol supply and activates T&#8208;cell immunity. Moreover, the combination of Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonists significantly promotes GSM polarization to antitumor phenotypes and ameliorates the TME. Treatment with the hybrid system exhibits superior antitumor effects in the orthotopic GBM model and postsurgical recurrence model. Altogether, the findings unravel the role of GSMs DHCR7/cholesterol signaling in the regulation of TME, presenting a potential treatment strategy that warrants further clinical trials.

         <title>Dielectric Filler&#8208;Induced Hybrid Interphase Enabling Robust Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries at High Areal Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dielectric&#160;NaNbO3 is incorporated into the poly(vinylidene fluoride) to gain the composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes. The NaNbO3 manipulates the interfacial reaction between Li metal and electrolyte to construct a robust fluorinated Li/Na hybrid solid electrolyte interphase, which not only facilitates the fast transport of Li+ on the interface, but also suppresses dendrite propagation to ensure long&#8208;term lithium plating/stripping cycling.








Abstract
The fillers in composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte are mainly responsible for the enhancement of the conduction of Li ions but barely regulate the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, a unique filler of dielectric NaNbO3 for the poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based polymer electrolyte, which is subjected to the exchange of Li+ and Na+ during cycling, is reported and the substituted Na+ is engaged in the construction of a fluorinated Li/Na hybrid SEI with high Young's modulus, facilitating the fast transport of Li+ at the interface at a high areal capacity and suppressing the Li dendrite growth. The dielectric NaNbO3 also induces the generation of high&#8208;dielectric &#946; phase of PVDF to promote the dissociation of Li salt. The Li/Li symmetrical cell exhibits a long&#8208;term dendrite&#8208;free cycling over 600&#160;h at a high areal capacity of 3&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2. The LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2/Li solid&#8208;state cells with NaNbO3 stably cycle 2200 times at 2 C and that paired with high&#8208;loading cathode (10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) can stably cycle for 150 times and exhibit excellent performances at &#8722;20 &#176;C. This work provides a novel design principle of fillers undertaking interfacial engineering in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes for developing the safe and stable solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery.

         <title>Robust Organogel Scintillator for Self&#8208;healing and Ultra&#8208;flexible X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable, stretchable, and self&#8208;healing (C38H34P2)MnBr4 organogel scintillator is designed through an in situ photocrosslinking process. The dynamic hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds in the organogel scintillator enable excellent stretchability and self&#8208;healing properties. The high light yield scintillator also exhibits excellent water and temperature stability and is conducive to X&#8208;ray imaging in harsh environments.








Abstract
Metal halide scintillators serve as promising candidates for X&#8208;ray detection due to their high attenuation coefficients, high light yields, and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processable characteristics. However, the issues of humidity/thermal quenching and mechanical fragility, remain obstacles to the broad and diversified development of metal halide scintillators. Here, this work reports a lead&#8208;free, water&#8208;stable, stretchable, and self&#8208;healing (ethylenebis&#8208;triphenylphosphonium manganese (II) bromide (C38H34P2)MnBr4 organogel scintillator that meets X&#8208;ray imaging in complex scenarios. The robust organogel scintillator can be stretched with elongation up to 1300% while maintaining the scintillation properties. Activated by the dynamic hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds design, the organogel scintillator exhibits excellent self&#8208;healing properties at room temperature to alleviate the vignetting problem of the rigid scintillator films, the X&#8208;ray imaging resolution can reach 16.7 lp mm&#8722;1. The organogel scintillator can also realize flexible and self&#8208;healing X&#8208;ray imaging in water, providing a design path for portable devices in harsh conditions.

         <title>Poly(Ionic Liquid) Double&#8208;Network Elastomers with High&#8208;Impact Resistance Enhanced by Cation&#8208;&#960; Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough and impact&#8208;resistant poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) double&#8208;network (DN) elastomers are constructed via multiple cross&#8208;linking of polymer networks and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions of PIL chains. The rational structural design and the introduction of cation&#8208;&#960; interactions significantly enhance the strength and toughness of PIL DN elastomers, providing excellent impact resistance as impact protection materials.








Abstract
With the continuous development of impact protection materials, lightweight, high&#8208;impact resistance, flexibility, and controllable toughness are required. Here, tough and impact&#8208;resistant poly(ionic liquid) (PIL)/poly(hydroxyethyl acrylate) (PHEA) double&#8208;network (DN) elastomers are constructed via multiple cross&#8208;linking of polymer networks and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions of PIL chains. Benefiting from the strong noncovalent cohesion achieved by the cation&#8208;&#960; interactions in PIL chains, the prepared PIL DN elastomers exhibit extraordinary compressive strength (95.24 &#177; 2.49&#160;MPa) and toughness (55.98 &#177; 0.66&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) under high&#8208;velocity impact load (5000 s&#8722;1). The synthesized PIL DN elastomer combines strength and flexibility to protect fragile items from impact. This strategy provides a new research idea in the field of the next generation of safety and protective materials.

         <title>Spontaneous Modulation Doping in Semi&#8208;Crystalline Conjugated Polymers Leads to High Conductivity at Low Doping Concentration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preferential incorporation of dopant molecules in the amorphous phase of semi&#8208;crystalline conjugated polymers, which spontaneously occurs for suitably chosen dopant&#8208;polymer combinations, leads to spontaneous modulation doping. The resulting spatial separation between the dopants and the charge transport, which occurs predominantly in the crystalline phase, causes exceptionally high conductivities at relatively low dopant concentrations.








Abstract
The possibility to control the charge carrier density through doping is one of the defining properties of semiconductors. For organic semiconductors, the doping process is known to come with several problems associated with the dopant compromising the charge carrier mobility by deteriorating the host morphology and/or introducing Coulomb traps. While for inorganic semiconductors these factors can be mitigated through (top&#8208;down) modulation doping, this concept has not been employed in organics. Here, this work shows that properly chosen host/dopant combinations can give rise to spontaneous, bottom&#8208;up modulation doping, in which the dopants preferentially sit in an amorphous phase, while the actual charge transport occurs predominantly in a crystalline phase with an unaltered microstructure, spatially separating dopants and mobile charges. Combining experiments and numerical simulations, this work shows that this leads to exceptionally high conductivities at relatively low dopant concentrations.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Pressing Metal Covalent Organic Frameworks as Personal Protection Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyethylene glycol&#8208;assisted solvent&#8208;free strategy is developed to rapidly synthesize a series of donor&#8211;acceptor metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks under air atmosphere and henceforth extends via in situ hot&#8208;pressing process to prepare related composite films with excellent photocatalytic disinfect performance.








Abstract
Effective personal protection is crucial for controlling infectious disease spread. However, commonly used personal protective materials such as disposable masks lack antibacterial/antiviral function and may lead to cross infection. Herein, a polyethylene glycol&#8208;assisted solvent&#8208;free strategy is proposed to rapidly synthesize a series of the donor&#8211;acceptor metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) (i.e., GZHMU&#8208;2, JNM&#8208;1, and JNM&#8208;2) under air atmosphere and henceforth extend it via in situ hot&#8208;pressing process to prepare MCOFs based films with photocatalytic disinfect ability. Best of them, the newly designed GZHMU&#8208;2 has a wide absorption spectrum (200 to 1500&#160;nm) and can efficiently produce reactive oxygen species under sunlight irradiation, achieving excellent photocatalytic disinfection performance. After in situ hot&#8208;pressing as a film material, the obtained GZHMU&#8208;2/NMF can effectively kill E. coli (99.99%), S. aureus (99%), and H1N1 (92.5%), meanwhile possessing good reusability. Noteworthy, the long&#8208;term use of a GZHMU&#8208;2/NWF&#8208;based mask has verified no damage to the living body by measuring the expression of mouse blood routine, lung tissue, and inflammatory factors at the in&#8208;vivo level.

         <title>Upgrading the Separators Integrated with Desolvation and Selective Deposition toward the Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated polymer lithiophilic separator loaded with an anionic anchoring agent realizes the rapid transport of Li+ and guided Li directional deposition, and the in situ formation of a polymer&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced Li composite layer constrains the volume variation of the Li anode. This separator ensures the long&#8208;term stability of Ni&#8208;rich cathode&#8208;based lithium&#8208;metal and lithium&#8208;symmetric batteries.








Abstract
A practical and effective approach to improve the cycle stability of high&#8208;energy density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) is to selectively regulate the growth of the lithium anode. The design of desolvation and lithiophilic structure have proved to be significant means to regulate the lithium deposition process. Here, a fluorinated polymer lithiophilic separator (LS) loaded with a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF801) is designed, which facilitates the rapid transfer of Li+ within the separator owing to the MOF801&#8208;anchored PF6&#8722; from the electrolyte, Li deposition is confined in the plane resulting from the polymer fiber layer rich in lithiophilic groups (C&#9472;F). The numerical simulation results confirm that LS induces a uniform electric field and Li+ concentration distribution. Visualization technology records the behavior of regular Li deposition in Li||Li and Li||Cu cells equipping LS. Therefore, LS exhibits an ultrahigh Li+ transference number (tLi+ = 0.80) and a large exchange current density (j0 = 1.963&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). LS guarantees the stable operation of Li||Li cells for over 1000&#160;h. In addition, the LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||Li cell equipped with LS exhibits superior rate and cycle performances owing to the formation of LiF&#8208;rich robust SEI layers. This study provides a way forward for dendrite&#8208;free Li anodes from the perspective of separator engineering.

         <title>Homogeneous Repair of Highly Degraded Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Material with Spent Lithium Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uses spent Li anode as lithium source to uniformly precoat a layer of biphenyl&#8208;Li on the surface of spent cathode materials at room temperature and pressure, which achieves the homogeneous repair of highly degraded Ni&#8208;rich cathode material (LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2) under relatively mild conditions. Meanwhile, this strategy can be extended to other layer cathode materials and the regenerated cathode materials exhibit comparable performance to those of corresponding commercial materials.








Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries has received wide attention owing to its potential for resource reuse and environmental benefits. The repair effect of direct regeneration methods undergoing heterogeneous repair process is usually inferior, while homogenous repair process plays a vital role to achieve satisfactory repair results. However, the practical applications of current homogeneous repair methods are challenged by the complex operations and relatively high costs owing to the requirement of additional heating or pressurization. Herein, this work proposes a simple strategy to achieve homogeneous repair of spent cathode materials under relatively mild conditions by uniformly precoating lithium source at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Followed by annealing, highly degraded LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 with severe Li deficiency and irreversible phase transition is repaired to have an initial capacity of 181.6 mAh g&#8208;1 and capacity retention of 80.7% after 150 cycles at 0.5 C. The lithium source used in this strategy is from the spent lithium anode. Moreover, this strategy is suitable for the direct regeneration of various layer oxide cathode materials with different failure degrees. This work provides both theoretical guidance and practical examples for the straightforward, effective, and universally applicable direct regeneration methods.

Low&#8208;temperature nanoporous oxocarbons are designed by thermal condensation of a forgotten organic semiconductor red carbon in the presence of a non&#8208;innocent SnCl2 salt melt. The obtained highly porous O&#8208;rich carbons present high electrocatalytic activity in metal&#8208;free nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion with an ammonia yield rate reaching 221&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a Faradic efficiency of 93%, superior to other carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Carbonaceous electrocatalysts offer advantages over metal&#8208;based counterparts, being cost&#8208;effective, sustainable, and electrochemically stable. Their high surface area increases reaction kinetics, making them valuable for environmental applications involving contaminant removal. However, their rational synthesis is challenging due to the applied high temperatures and activation steps, leading to disordered materials with limited control over doping. Here, a new synthetic pathway using carbon oxide precursors and tin chloride as a p&#8208;block metal salt melt is presented. As a result, highly porous oxygen&#8208;rich carbon sheets (with a surface area of 1600 m2 g&#8722;1) are obtained at relatively low temperatures (400 &#176;C). Mechanistic studies reveal that Sn(II) triggers reductive deoxygenation and concomitant condensation/cross&#8208;linking, facilitated by the Sn(II) &#8594; Sn(IV) transition. Due to their significant surface area and oxygen doping, these materials demonstrate exceptional electrocatalytic activity in the nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, with an ammonia yield rate of 221&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a Faradic efficiency of 93%. These results surpass those of other carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. In situ Raman studies reveal that the reaction occurs through electrochemical hydrogenation, where active hydrogen is provided by water reduction. This work contributes to the development of carbonaceous electrocatalysts with enhanced performance for sustainable environmental applications.

         <title>Thermal and Moisture Managing E&#8208;Textiles Enabled by Janus Hierarchical Gradient Honeycombs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal and moisture managing e&#8208;textile (TMME&#8208;textile) is developed, which functions with an impressive electrical performance while ensuring wearers' long&#8208;term comfort. Equipped with Janus wettability and a hierarchical gradient honeycomb&#8208;like network structure, the TMME&#8208;textile demonstrates excellent directional water transport and daytime radiative cooling properties, as well as a highly sensitive strain sensing performance, effectively enabling long&#8208;term sports monitoring.








Abstract
Moisture and thermal comfort are critical for long&#8208;term wear. In recent years, there has been rapidly growing attention on the importance of the comfortability in wearable electronic textiles (e&#8208;textiles), particularly in fields such as health monitoring, sports training, medical diagnosis and treatment, where long&#8208;term comfort is crucial. Nonetheless, simultaneously regulating thermal and moisture comfort for the human body without compromising electronic performance remains a significant challenge to date. Herein, a thermal and moisture managing e&#8208;textile (TMME&#8208;textile) that integrates unidirectional water transport and daytime radiative cooling properties with highly sensitive sensing performance is developed. The TMME&#8208;textile is made by patterning sensing electrodes on rationally designed Janus hierarchical gradient honeycombs that offer wetting gradient and optical management. The TMME&#8208;textile can unidirectionally pump excessive sweat, providing a dry and comfortable microenvironment for users. Moreover, it possesses high solar reflectivity (98.3%) and mid&#8208;infrared emissivity (89.2%), which reduce skin temperature by &#8776;7.0&#160;&#176;C under a solar intensity of 1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2. The TMME&#8208;textile&#8208;based strain sensor displays high sensitivity (0.1749&#160;kPa&#8722;1) and rapid response rate (170&#160;ms), effectively enabling smooth long&#8208;term monitoring, especially during high&#8208;intensity outdoor sports where thermal and moisture stresses are prominent challenges to conventional e&#8208;textiles.

         <title>Engineering Atomically Dispersed Cu&#8211;N1S2 Sites via Chemical Vapor Deposition to Boost Enzyme&#8208;Like Activity for Efficient Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical vapor deposition&#8208;based sulfur&#8208;engineering strategy is reported for the fabrication of copper&#8208;based single&#8208;atom nanozyme containing unique Cu&#8722;N1S2 sites. Due to the enhanced adsorption and activation process of H2O2 substrate by Cu&#8722;N1S2 sites, they exhibit significantly high enzyme&#8208;like catalytic performance. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the Cu&#8722;N1S2 sites achieve effective tumor killing through the synergy of catalytic therapy and oxygen&#8208;dependent phototherapy.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), with well&#8208;defined and uniform atomic structures, are an emerging type of natural enzyme mimics. Currently, it is important but challenging to rationally design high&#8208;performance SAzymes and deeply reveal the interaction mechanism between SAzymes and substrate molecules. Herein, this work reports the controllable fabrication of a unique Cu&#8722;N1S2&#8208;centred SAzyme (Cu&#8208;N/S&#8208;C) via a chemical vapor deposition&#8208;based sulfur&#8208;engineering strategy. Benefiting from the optimized geometric and electronic structures of single&#8208;atom sites, Cu&#8208;N/S&#8208;C SAzyme shows boosted enzyme&#8208;like activity, especially in catalase&#8208;like activity, with a 13.8&#8208;fold increase in the affinity to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) substrate and a 65.2&#8208;fold increase in the catalytic efficiency when compared to Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C SAzyme with Cu&#8722;N3 sites. Further theoretical studies reveal that the increased electron density around single&#8208;atom Cu is achieved through electron redistribution, and the efficient charge transfer between Cu&#8208;N/S&#8208;C and H2O2 is demonstrated to be more beneficial for the adsorption and activation of H2O2. The as&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;N/S&#8208;C SAzyme possesses an excellent antitumor effect through the synergy of catalytic therapy and oxygen&#8208;dependent phototherapy. This study provides a strategy for the rational design of SAzymes, and the proposed electron redistribution and charge transfer mechanism will help to understand the coordination environment effect of single&#8208;atom metal sites on H2O2&#8208;mediated enzyme&#8208;like catalytic processes.

         <title>Magnetic Aggregation&#8208;Induced Bone&#8208;Targeting Nanocarrier with Effects of Piezo1 Activation and Osteogenic&#8211;Angiogenic Coupling for Osteoporotic Bone Repair</title>

         <dc:description>
A magnetic aggregation&#8208;induced bone&#8208;targeting PLGA&#8208;based nanocarrier (ZOL&#8208;PLGA@Yoda1/SPIO) is synthesized to realize dual&#8208;targeted delivery and precise Piezo1&#8208;activated therapy for osteoporotic bone defects. ZOL&#8208;PLGA@Yoda1/SPIO can activate Piezo1 in bone defect areas of osteoporotic mice, improve osteogenesis through YAP/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling axis, promote a well&#8208;coordinated osteogenesis&#8211;angiogenesis coupling, and significantly accelerate bone reconstruction within the defects without noticeable side effects.








Abstract
Osteoporosis, characterized by an imbalance in bone homeostasis, is a global health concern. Bone defects are difficult to heal in patients with osteoporosis. Classical drug treatments for osteoporotic bone defects have unsatisfactory efficacy owing to side effects and imprecise delivery problems. In this study, a magnetic aggregation&#8208;induced bone&#8208;targeting poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid, PLGA)&#8208;based nanocarrier (ZOL&#8208;PLGA@Yoda1/SPIO) is synthesized to realize dual&#8208;targeted delivery and precise Piezo1&#8208;activated therapy for osteoporotic bone defects. Piezo1 is an important mechanotransducer that plays a key role in regulating bone homeostasis. To achieve dual&#8208;targeting properties, ZOL&#8208;PLGA@Yoda1/SPIO is fabricated using zoledronate (ZOL)&#8208;decorated PLGA, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), and Piezo1&#8208;activated molecule Yoda1 via the emulsion solvent diffusion method. Bone&#8208;targeting molecular mediation and magnetic aggregation&#8208;induced properties can jointly and effectively achieve precise delivery to localized bone defects. Moreover, Yoda1 loading enables targeted and efficient mimicking of mechanical signals and activation of Piezo1. Experiments in vivo and in vitro demonstrate that ZOL&#8208;PLGA@Yoda1/SPIO can activate Piezo1 in bone defect areas of osteoporotic mice, improve osteogenesis through YAP/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling axis, promote a well&#8208;coordinated osteogenesis&#8211;angiogenesis coupling, and significantly accelerate bone reconstruction within the defects without noticeable side effects. Overall, this novel dual&#8208;targeting nanocarrier provides a potentially effective strategy for the clinical treatment of osteoporotic bone defects.

         <title>Lattice Engineering on Li2CO3&#8208;Based Sacrificial Cathode Prelithiation Agent for Improving the Energy Density of Li&#8208;Ion Battery Full&#8208;Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely tuning the position of the Co dopant and inducing defects, Li2CO3 is transformed from an insulator into an exceptional sacrificial cathode prelithiation agent. It can be readily decomposed to CO2 through O2&#8208; intermediate releasing active Li+ to trade&#8208;off solid electrolyte interface Li+&#8208;consumption in anode, thereby improving the energy density of Li&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cell.








Abstract
Developing sacrificial cathode prelithiation technology to compensate for active lithium loss is vital for improving the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cells. Li2CO3 owns high theoretical specific capacity, superior air stability, but poor conductivity as an insulator, acting as a promising but challenging prelithiation agent candidate. Herein, extracting a trace amount of Co from LiCoO2 (LCO), a lattice engineering is developed through substituting Li sites with Co and inducing Li defects to obtain a composite structure consisting of (Li0.906Co0.043&#9643;0.051)2CO2.934 and ball milled LiCoO2 (Co&#8208;Li2CO3@LCO). Notably,&#160;both the bandgap and Li&#9472;O bond strength have essentially declined in this structure. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of Li defects and bulk phase catalytic regulation of Co, the potential of Li2CO3 deep decomposition significantly decreases from typical &gt;4.7 to &#8776;4.25&#160;V versus Li/Li+, presenting &gt;600 mAh g&#8722;1 compensation capacity. Impressively, coupling 5 wt% Co&#8208;Li2CO3@LCO within NCM&#8208;811 cathode, 235&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch&#8208;type full&#8208;cell is achieved, performing 88% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Nanocluster Surface Microenvironment Modulates Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two atomically identical thiolated 25&#8208;atom silver nanoclusters with controlled surface microenvironment possessing local hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity are designed and synthesized. The locally introduced hydrophobicity through bulky alkyl groups of the thiolate ligands plays a crucial role in dramatically enhancing the CO2 electroreduction performance of nanoclusters by modulating the interfacial water structure and the binding energies of the reaction intermediates.








Abstract
The catalytic activity and product selectivity of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) depend strongly on the local microenvironment of mass diffusion at the nanostructured catalyst and electrolyte interface. Achieving a molecular&#8208;level understanding of the electrocatalytic reaction requires the development of tunable metal&#8208;ligand interfacial structures with atomic precision, which is highly challenging. Here, the synthesis and molecular structure of a 25&#8208;atom silver nanocluster interfaced with an organic shell comprising 18 thiolate ligands are presented. The locally induced hydrophobicity by bulky alkyl functionality near the surface of the Ag25 cluster dramatically enhances the eCO2RR activity (CO Faradaic efficiency, FECO: 90.3%) with higher CO partial current density (jCO) in an H&#8208;cell compared to Ag25 cluster (FECO: 66.6%) with confined hydrophilicity, which modulates surface interactions with water and CO2. Remarkably, the hydrophobic Ag25 cluster exhibits jCO as high as &#8722;240&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with FECO &gt;90% at &#8722;3.4&#160;V cell potential in a gas&#8208;fed membrane electrode assembly device. Furthermore, this cluster demonstrates stable eCO2RR over 120&#160;h. Operando surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal how the ligands alter the neighboring water structure and *CO intermediates, impacting the intrinsic eCO2RR activity, which provides atomistic mechanistic insights into the crucial role of confined hydrophobicity.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Polyimide Curly Nanofibrous Aerogels for High&#8208;Performance Thermal Insulation Under Extreme Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyimide (PI) nanofibrous aerogel consisted of interlocked curly nanofibrous networks (crimp percentage 28.5%) is directly assembled by electrospinning. Benefiting from strong porous aerogel structure (porosity 99.8%), the PI aerogel achieves ultralight property (density 2.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;3), mechanical robustness at extreme conditions, and ultralow thermal conductivity (22.4&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), thereby offering a promising candidate for thermal insulation under extreme temperature.








Abstract
Maintaining human body temperature is one of the basic needs for living, which requires high&#8208;performance thermal insulation materials to prevent heat exchange with external environment. However, the most widely used fibrous thermal insulation materials always suffer from the heavy weight, weak mechanical property, and moderate capacity to suppress heat transfer, resulting in limited personal cold and thermal protection performance. Here, an ultralight, mechanically robust, and thermally insulating polyimide (PI) aerogel is directly synthesized via constructing 3D interlocked curly nanofibrous networks during electrospinning. Controlling the solution/water molecule interaction enables the rapid phase inversion of charged jets, while the multiple jets are ejected by regulating charge density of the fluids, thus synergistically allowing numerous curly nanofibers to interlock and cross&#8208;link with each other to form porous aerogel structure. The resulted PI aerogel integrates the ultralight property with density of 2.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;3, extreme temperature tolerance (mechanical robustness over &#8722;196 to 300 &#176;C), and thermal insulation performance with ultralow thermal conductivity of 22.4&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, providing an ideal candidate to keep human thermal comfort under extreme temperature. This work can provide a source of inspiration for the design and development of nanofibrous aerogels for various applications.

         <title>Cooperative Copper Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst in 2D Carbon Nitride for Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis to Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanopore templates in 2D carbon nitride matrices control the interatomic distances of cooperative Cu single&#8208;atom sites to synergistically enhance eCO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 production via modulation of energy barriers of the rate limiting steps in the reaction pathway.








Abstract
Renewable&#8208;electricity&#8208;powered carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction (eCO2R) to high&#8208;value fuels like methane (CH4) holds the potential to close the carbon cycle at meaningful scales. However, this kinetically staggered 8&#8208;electron multistep reduction suffers from inadequate catalytic efficiency and current density. Atomic Cu&#8208;structures can boost eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity due to enhanced intermediate binding energies (BEs) resulting from favorably shifted d&#8208;band centers. In this work, 2D carbon nitride (CN) matrices, viz. Na&#8208;polyheptazine (PHI) and Li&#8208;polytriazine imides (PTI), are exploited to host Cu&#8211;N2 type single&#8208;atom sites with high density (&#8776;1.5 at%), via a facile metal&#8208;ion exchange process. Optimized Cu loading in nanocrystalline Cu&#8208;PTI maximizes eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 performance with Faradaic efficiency (FECH4) of &#8776;68% and a high partial current density of 348&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.84&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Multi&#8208;Cu substituted N&#8208;appended nanopores in the CN frameworks yield thermodynamically stable quasi&#8208;dual/triple sites with large interatomic distances dictated by the pore dimensions. First&#8208;principles calculations elucidate the relative Cu&#8211;CN cooperative effects between the matrices and how the Cu local environment dictates the adsorbate BEs, density of states, and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 energy profile landscape. The 9N pores in Cu&#8208;PTI yield cooperative Cu&#8211;Cu sites that synergistically enhance the kinetics of the rate&#8208;limiting steps in the eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 pathway.

However, this kinetically staggered 8-electron multistep reduction suffers from inadequate catalytic efficiency and current density. Atomic Cu-structures can boost eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity due to enhanced intermediate binding energies (BEs) resulting from favorably shifted d-band centers. In this work, 2D carbon nitride (CN) matrices, viz. Na-polyheptazine (PHI) and Li-polytriazine imides (PTI), are exploited to host Cu&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; type single-atom sites with high density (&#8776;1.5 at%), via a facile metal-ion exchange process. Optimized Cu loading in nanocrystalline Cu-PTI maximizes eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; performance with Faradaic efficiency (FE&lt;sub&gt;CH4&lt;/sub&gt;) of &#8776;68% and a high partial current density of 348&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.84&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing the state-of-the-art catalysts. Multi-Cu substituted N-appended nanopores in the CN frameworks yield thermodynamically stable quasi-dual/triple sites with large interatomic distances dictated by the pore dimensions. First-principles calculations elucidate the relative Cu&#8211;CN cooperative effects between the matrices and how the Cu local environment dictates the adsorbate BEs, density of states, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; energy profile landscape. The 9N pores in Cu-PTI yield cooperative Cu&#8211;Cu sites that synergistically enhance the kinetics of the rate-limiting steps in the eCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Buried&#8208;Interface Engineering Enables Efficient and 1960&#8208;Hour&#160;ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directly adding a cyanoacrylic&#8208;acid&#8208;based molecular additive, namely BT&#8208;T, into the perovskite precursor solution achieves in situ buried&#8208;interface passivation. The power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) for 1.0&#160;cm2 inverted&#8208;structure PSCs reaches 23.48%. The encapsulated perovskite solar cell (PSC)&#160;retains 95.4% of its initial PCE following 1960&#160;h maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking under continuous light illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C (i.e., ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I protocol).








Abstract
High&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) typically require interfacial passivation, yet this is challenging for the buried interface, owing to the dissolution of passivation agents during the deposition of perovskites. Here, this limitation is overcome with in situ buried&#8208;interface passivation&#8212;achieved via directly adding a cyanoacrylic&#8208;acid&#8208;based molecular additive, namely BT&#8208;T, into the perovskite precursor solution. Classical and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that BT&#8208;T spontaneously may self&#8208;assemble at the buried interface during the formation of the perovskite layer on a nickel oxide hole&#8208;transporting layer. The preferential buried&#8208;interface passivation results in facilitated hole transfer and suppressed charge recombination. In addition, residual BT&#8208;T molecules in the perovskite layer enhance its stability and homogeneity. A power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.48% for 1.0&#160;cm2 inverted&#8208;structure PSCs is reported. The encapsulated PSC retains 95.4% of its initial PCE following 1960&#160;h maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking under continuous light illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C (i.e., ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I protocol). The demonstration of operating&#8208;stable PSCs under accelerated ageing conditions represents a step closer to the commercialization of this emerging technology.

         <title>Sr&#8208;Stabilized IrMnO2 Solid Solution Nano&#8208;Electrocatalysts with Superior Activity and Excellent Durability for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sr&#8208;doped solid solution structural ultrafine IrMnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) on the CNTs (Sr&#8208;IrMnO2/CNTs) are efficient and durable catalysts for the acidic OER. The solid solution structure promotes the s electronic coupling between Ir and Mn, improving their OER activity, while the Sr doping enhances the stability of Sr&#8208;IrMnO2, improving the durability of the Sr&#8208;IrMnO2/CNTs.








Abstract
The development of cost&#8208;effective catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is of paramount importance. This work reports that Sr&#8208;doped solid solution structural ultrafine IrMnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) (&#8776;1.56&#160;nm) on the carbon nanotubes&#160;(Sr&#8208;IrMnO2/CNTs) are efficient catalysts for the acidic OER. Even with the Ir use dosage 3.5 times lower than that of the commercial IrO2, the Sr&#8208;IrMnO2/CNTs only need an overpotential of 236.0&#160;mV to drive 10.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and show outstanding stability for &gt;400.0 h. Its Ir mass activity is 39.6 times higher than that of the IrO2 at 1.53&#160;V. The solid solution and Sr&#8208;doping structure of Sr&#8208;IrMnO2 are the main origin of the high catalytic activity and excellent stability of the Sr&#8208;IrMnO2/CNTs. The density function theory calculations indicate that the solid solution structure can promote strong electronic coupling between Ir and Mn, lowering the energy barrier of the OER rate&#8208;determining step. The Sr&#8208;doping can enhance the stability of Ir against the chemical corrosion and demetallation. Water electrolyzers and proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers assembled with the Sr&#8208;IrMnO2/CNTs show superb performance and excellent durability in the acid media.

         <title>Microwave Phosphine&#8208;Plasma&#8208;Assisted Ultrafast Synthesis of Halogen&#8208;Doped Ru/RuP2 with Surface Intermediate Adsorption Modulation for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast microwave plasma is developed to synthesize halogen elements&#8208;doped Ru/RuP2 (X&#8208;Ru/RuP2). The Br&#8208;doped electrocatalyst (Br&#8208;Ru/RuP2) exhibits excellent catalytic performances for hydrogen evolution reaction with 34 mV in 1.0 m KOH to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Anionic modification engineering is a crucial approach to develop highly efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction. Herein, halogen elements (X = Cl, Br, and I)&#8208;modified Ru&#8208;based nanosheets (X&#8208;Ru/RuP2) are designed by rapid and eco&#8208;friendly microwave&#8208;phosphide plasma approach within 60 s. Experimental and density functional theory calculations verify that the introduced halogen element, especially Br, can optimize the surface intermediates adsorption. Specially, the designed Br&#8208;Ru/RuP2 favors the water dissociation and following hydrogen adsorption/desorption process. Then, the as&#8208;synthesized Br&#8208;Ru/RuP2 exhibits low overpotential of 34&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 coupled with small Tafel slope of 27&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in alkaline electrolyte with excellent long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the electrocatalytic performances in acid and neutral media are also boosted via Br element modification. This work paves a novel way to regulate the electronic structure of Ru&#8208;based compounds, and then can boost the electrocatalytic kinetics.

Butterfly&#8208;Inspired Computing
A neuromorphic chip, inspired by butterflies, harnesses multisensory integration by combining graphene&#8208;based chemitransistors with MoS2&#8208;based photosensing memtransistors. It transcends traditional unisensory information processing in neuromorphic computing and enhances decision&#8208;making through the integration of diverse sensory inputs. More details can be found in article number 2307380 by Yikai Zheng, Subir Ghosh, and Saptarshi Das.

Antitumor Immunotherapy
In article 2309839, Qinyang Wang and co&#8208;workers have developed a CTL&#8208;inspired system that mimics the process of T&#8208;cells attacking tumour cells. The system delivers chemotherapeutic drugs to cancer cells under the control of NIR light. The researchers found that this killing system enables an ultra&#8208;low dose of chemotherapeutic drugs to trigger pyroptosis&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;tumour immune function, leading to tumour regression.

Advanced&#160;engineered nanomaterials for delivering CRISPR/Cas9 gene&#8208;editing components have revolutionized cancer therapeutics by enhancing their safety, efficiency, and specificity through optimizing the packaging capacity, pharmacokinetics, and targetability.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) gene&#8208;editing technology shows promise for manipulating single or multiple tumor&#8208;associated genes and engineering immune cells to treat cancers. Currently, most gene&#8208;editing strategies rely on viral delivery; yet, while being efficient, many limitations, mainly from safety and packaging capacity considerations, hinder the use of viral CRISPR vectors in cancer therapy. In contrast, recent advances in non&#8208;viral CRISPR/Cas9 nanoformulations have paved the way for better cancer gene editing, as these nanoformulations can be engineered to improve safety, efficiency, and specificity through optimizing the packaging capacity, pharmacokinetics, and targetability. In this review, the advance in non&#8208;viral CRISPR delivery is highlighted, and there is a discussion on how these approaches can be potentially used to treat cancers in addressing the aforementioned limitations, followed by the perspectives in designing a proper CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;based cancer nanomedicine system with translational potential.

         <title>Recycling and Reusing of Graphite from Retired Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expired lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) contain valuable battery&#8208;grade graphite materials. However, graphite is largely overlooked due to its lower profitability compared to cathode materials. This review discusses the future challenges facing the recycling industry in handling waste graphite and provides a comprehensive overview of the development of graphite recycling and reuse from spent LIBs, offering valuable insights for upcoming large&#8208;scale recycling efforts.








Abstract
The proliferation of rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) over the past decade has led to a significant increase in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) powered by these batteries reaching the end of their lifespan. With retired EVs becoming more prevalent, recycling and reusing their components, particularly graphite, has become imperative as the world transitions toward electric mobility. Graphite constitutes &#8776;20% of LIBs by weight, making it a valuable resource to be conserved. This review presents an in&#8208;depth analysis of the current global graphite mining landscape and explores potential opportunities for the &#8220;second life&#8221; of graphitefrom depleted LIBs. Various recycling and reactivation technologies in both industry and academia are discussed, along with potential applications for recycled graphite forming a vital aspect of the waste management hierarchy. Furthermore, this review addresses the future challenges faced by the recycling industry in dealing with expired LIBs, encompassing environmental, economic, legal, and regulatory considerations. In conclusion, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the developments in recycling and reusing graphite from retired LIBs, offering valuable insights for forthcoming large&#8208;scale recycling efforts.

         <title>Recent Advances in Hybrid Seawater Electrolysis for Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid seawater electrolysis, enabled by the anodic oxidation reaction of small molecules or redox mediators substituting for the energy&#8208;demanding oxygen evolution reaction, holds substantial promise for energy&#8208;saving and cost&#8208;effective hydrogen production from seawater without the notorious interfering chlorine evolution, and meanwhile enables either co&#8208;production of value&#8208;added chemicals or environmental remediation.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis (SWE) is a promising and potentially cost&#8208;effective approach to hydrogen production, considering that seawater is vastly abundant and SWE is able to combine with offshore renewables producing green hydrogen. However, SWE has long been suffering from technical challenges including the high energy demand and interference of chlorine chemistry, leading electrolyzers to a low efficiency and short lifespan. In this context, hybrid SWE, operated by replacing the energy&#8208;demanding oxygen evolution reaction and interfering chlorine evolution reaction (CER) with a thermodynamically more favorable anodic oxidation reaction (AOR) or by designing innovative electrolyzer cells, has recently emerged as a better alternative, which not only allows SWE to occur in a safe and energy&#8208;saving manner without the notorious CER, but also enables co&#8208;production of value&#8208;added chemicals or elimination of environmental pollutants. This review provides a first account of recent advances in hybrid SWE for hydrogen production. The substitutional AOR of various small molecules or redox mediators, in couple with hydrogen evolution from seawater, is comprehensively summarized. Moreover, how the electrolyzer cell design helps in hybrid SWE is briefly discussed. Last, the current challenges and future outlook about the development of the hybrid SWE technology are outlined.

         <title>Chiral Quantum Materials: When Chemistry Meets Physics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding chirality transfer mechanisms is essential for advancing chiral catalysis knowledge. Chiral quantum materials, with unique chiral electronic properties such as spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) and spin/orbital angular momentum (SAM/OAM), provide new connections between solid&#8208;state topologies and chiral catalysis. This review establishes a link between chiral electronic properties and catalysis by discussing the application of topological homochiral crystals (THCs) in heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Chirality is a fundamental property of nature with relevance in biochemistry and physics, particularly in the field of catalysis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying chirality transfer is crucial for advancing the knowledge of chiral&#8208;related catalysis. Chiral quantum materials with intriguing chirality&#8208;dependent electronic properties, such as spin&#8208;orbital coupling (SOC) and exotic spin/orbital angular momentum (SAM/OAM), open novel avenues for linking solid&#8208;state topologies with chiral catalysis. In this review, the growth of topological homochiral crystals (THCs) is described, and their applications in heterogeneous catalysis, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen electrocatalysis, and asymmetric catalysis are summarized. A possible link between chirality&#8208;dependent electronic properties and heterogeneous catalysis is discussed. Finally, existing challenges in this field are highlighted, and a brief outlook on the impact of THCs on the overarching chemical&#8211;physical research is presented.

Chiral quantum materials with intriguing chirality-dependent electronic properties, such as spin-orbital coupling (SOC) and exotic spin/orbital angular momentum (SAM/OAM), open novel avenues for linking solid-state topologies with chiral catalysis. In this review, the growth of topological homochiral crystals (THCs) is described, and their applications in heterogeneous catalysis, including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen electrocatalysis, and asymmetric catalysis are summarized. A possible link between chirality-dependent electronic properties and heterogeneous catalysis is discussed. Finally, existing challenges in this field are highlighted, and a brief outlook on the impact of THCs on the overarching chemical&#8211;physical research is presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

CRISPR lateral&#8208;flow&#8208;strip tests, combined with enzymatic amplification, and the SiMoT bioelectronic palmar devices, review as highly performing point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing technologies that have reached technology readiness level 5, are capable of single&#8208;molecule detections (10&#8722;20&#160;m in 0.1&#160;mL) and exhibit extremely high reliability (diagnostic sensitivity and selectivity&#160;&gt;&#160;95&#8211;99%). Moreover, they are multipurpose and can also be effectively utilized in resource&#8208;constrained settings.








Abstract
Screening asymptomatic organisms (humans, animals, plants) with a high&#8208;diagnostic accuracy using point&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8208;testing (POCT) technologies, though still visionary holds great potential. Convenient surveillance requires easy&#8208;to&#8208;use, cost&#8208;effective, ultra&#8208;portable but highly reliable, in&#8208;vitro&#8208;diagnostic devices that are ready for use wherever they are needed. Currently, there are not yet such devices available on the market, but there are a couple more promising technologies developed at readiness&#8208;level 5: the Clustered&#8208;Regularly&#8208;Interspaced&#8208;Short&#8208;Palindromic&#8208;Repeats (CRISPR) lateral&#8208;flow&#8208;strip tests and the Single&#8208;Molecule&#8208;with&#8208;a&#8208;large&#8208;Transistor (SiMoT) bioelectronic palmar devices. They both hold key features delineated by the World&#8208;Health&#8208;Organization for POCT systems and an occurrence of false&#8208;positive and false&#8208;negative errors &lt;1&#8211;5% resulting in diagnostic&#8208;selectivity and sensitivity &gt;95&#8211;99%, while limit&#8208;of&#8208;detections are of few markers. CRISPR&#8208;strip is a molecular assay that, can detect down to few copies of DNA/RNA markers in blood while SiMoT immunometric and molecular test can detect down to a single oligonucleotide, protein marker, or pathogens in 0.1mL of blood, saliva, and olive&#8208;sap. These technologies can prospectively enable the systematic and reliable surveillance of asymptomatic ones prior to worsening/proliferation of illnesses allowing for timely diagnosis and swift prognosis. This could establish a proactive healthcare ecosystem that results in effective treatments for all living organisms generating diffuse and well&#8208;being at efficient costs.

         <title>Multiscale Bioresponses of Metal Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) are well&#8208;recognized as novel nano&#8208;agents for addressing deficiency in nanomedicine, whose biology&#8208;related fundamentals and recent advances are summarized in this review with emphasis on their multiscale bioresponses from the molecular, cellular, to organismal levels, allowing a clear and comprehensive understanding to meet the design requirements toward the highly efficient nanomedical modalities.








Abstract
Metal nanoclusters (NCs) are well&#8208;recognized novel nano&#8208;agents that hold great promise for applications in nanomedicine because of their ultrafine size, low toxicity, and high renal clearance. As foreign substances, however, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the bioresponses to metal NCs is necessary but is still far from being realized. Herein, this review is deployed to summarize the biofates of metal NCs at various biological levels, emphasizing their multiscale bioresponses at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. In the parts&#8208;to&#8208;whole schema, the interactions between biomolecules and metal NCs are discussed, presenting typical protein&#8208;dictated nano&#8211;bio interfaces, hierarchical structures, and in vivo trajectories. Then, the accumulation, internalization, and metabolic evolution of metal NCs in the cellular environment and as&#8208;imparted theranostic functionalization are demonstrated. The organismal metabolism and transportation processes of the metal NCs are subsequently distilled. Finally, this review ends with the conclusions and perspectives on the outstanding issues of metal NC&#8208;mediated bioresponses in the near future. This review is expected to provide inspiration for tailoring the customization of metal NC&#8208;based nano&#8208;agents to meet practical requirements in different sectors of nanomedicine.

         <title>Boosting the Performance of PEDOT:PSS Based Electronics Via Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the latest research in performance enhancement and application scope of PEDOT:PSS/IL composites. A significant feature of ILs that distinguishes them from other additives is their unique ability to harmonize multiple attributes of PEDOT:PSS, encompassing conductivity, deformability, and printability. Armed with these amplified attributes, PEDOT:PSS/IL composites find a multitude of applications across diverse realms of electronics.








Abstract
The conducting polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) offers superior advantages in electronics due to its remarkable combination of high electrical conductivity, excellent biocompatibility, and mechanical flexibility, making it an ideal material among electronic skin, health monitoring, and energy harvesting and storage. Nevertheless, pristine PEDOT:PSS films exhibit limitations in terms of both low conductivity and stretchability; while, conventional processing techniques cannot enhance these properties simultaneously, facing the dilemma that highly conductive interconnected PEDOT:PSS domains are susceptible to tensile strain. Via modifying PEDOT:PSS with ionic liquids (ILs), not only a synergistic enhancement of the electrical and mechanical properties can be achieved but also the requirements for the printable bioelectronic are satisfied. In this comprehensive review, the task of providing a thorough examination of the mechanisms and applications of ILs as modifiers for PEDOT:PSS is undertaken. First, the theoretical mechanisms governing the interactions between ILs and PEDOT:PSS are discussed in detail. Then, the enhanced properties and the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms achieved through the incorporation of ILs are reviewed. Next, specific applications of ILs&#8208;modified PEDOT:PSS relevant to bioelectronic devices are presented. Last, there is a concise summary and a discussion regarding the opportunities and challenges in this exciting field.

         <title>Advanced Architectures of Air Electrodes in Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries and Hydrogen Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air electrodes serve as a vital ingredient of zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) and hydrogen fuel cells (HFCs), which determines the output power density and stability of the devices. The recent progress regarding air electrode architectures in rechargeable ZABs and HFCs is summarized. Moreover, the remaining challenges and prospects for air electrodes in future are indicated.








Abstract
The air electrode is an essential component of air&#8208;demanding energy storage/conversion devices, such as zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) and hydrogen fuel cells (HFCs), which determines the output power and stability of the devices. Despite atom&#8208;level modulation in catalyst design being recently achieved, the air electrodes have received much less attention, causing a stagnation in the development of air&#8208;demanding equipment. Herein, the evolution of air electrodes for ZABs and HFCs from the early stages to current requirements is reviewed. In addition, the operation mechanism and the corresponding electrocatalytic mechanisms of ZABs are summarized. In particular, by clarifying the air electrode interfaces of ZABs at different scales, several approaches to improve the air electrode in rechargeable ZABs are reviewed, including innovative electrode structures and bifunctional oxygen catalysts. Afterward, the operating mechanisms of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are explained. Subsequently, the strategies employed to enhance the efficiency of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) in PEMFCs and AEMFCs, respectively, are highlighted and discussed in detail. Last, the prospects for air electrodes in ZABs and HFCs are considered by discussing the main challenges. The aim of this review is to facilitate the industrialization of ZABs and HFCs.

         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) exhibit poor performance with temperature extremes because of a narrow operational range and risk to safety. To boost performance better electrolyte design will be needed. This review critically evaluates understanding of electrolytes for boosted battery performance and provides a prospective on future directions and likely outcomes in development of electrolyte design for LIBs in extreme temperature.








Abstract
With increasing energy storage demands across various applications, reliable batteries capable of performing in harsh environments, such as extreme temperatures, are crucial. However, current lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) exhibit limitations in both low and high&#8208;temperature performance, restricting their use in critical fields like defense, military, and aerospace. These challenges stem from the narrow operational temperature range and safety concerns of existing electrolyte systems. To enable LIBs to function effectively under extreme temperatures, the optimization and design of novel electrolytes are essential. Given the urgency for LIBs operating in extreme temperatures and the notable progress in this research field, a comprehensive and timely review is imperative. This article presents an overview of challenges associated with extreme temperature applications and strategies used to design electrolytes with enhanced performance. Additionally, the significance of understanding underlying electrolyte behavior mechanisms and the role of different electrolyte components in determining battery performance are emphasized. Last, future research directions and perspectives on electrolyte design for LIBs under extreme temperatures are discussed. Overall, this article offers valuable insights into the development of electrolytes for LIBs capable of reliable operation in extreme conditions.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Strategies in the Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the high&#8208;throughput (HTP) strategies in the discovery of thermoelectric (TE) materials, including performance descriptor, HTP calculation, HTP experiment, and machine learning are systematically summarized. The applications and progress of the four HTP strategies in TEs are reviewed. In addition, the challenges and possible directions in future research are also discussed.








Abstract
Searching for new high&#8208;performance thermoelectric (TE) materials that are economical and environmentally friendly is an urgent task for TE society, but the advancements are greatly limited by the time&#8208;consuming and high cost of the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error method. The significant progress achieved in the computing hardware, efficient computing methods, advance artificial intelligence algorithms, and rapidly growing material data have brought a paradigm shift in the investigation of TE materials. Many electrical and thermal performance descriptors are proposed and efficient high&#8208;throughput (HTP) calculation methods are developed with the purpose to quickly screen new potential TE materials from the material databases. Some HTP experiment methods are also developed which can increase the density of information obtained in a single experiment with less time and lower cost. In addition, machine learning (ML) methods are also introduced in thermoelectrics. In this review, the HTP strategies in the discovery of TE materials are systematically summarized. The applications of performance descriptor, HTP calculation, HTP experiment, and ML in the discovery of new TE materials are reviewed. In addition, the challenges and possible directions in future research are also discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 13, March 28, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Messenger RNA (mRNA)&#8208;based therapy is a powerful, safe, and rapidly scalable therapeutic approach for many diseases. In this review, therapeutic applications of mRNA are introduced, common types of mRNA cargos and delivery systems are summarized, and strategies to enhance nanotechnology&#8208;mediated mRNA delivery efficiency during the cellular trafficking process are highlighted, including accumulation, internalization, endosomal escape, mRNA release, and translation.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA)&#8208;based therapy has emerged as a powerful, safe, and rapidly scalable therapeutic approach that involves technologies for both mRNA itself and the delivery vehicle. Although there are some unique challenges for different applications of mRNA therapy, a common challenge for all mRNA therapeutics is the transport of mRNA into the target cell cytoplasm for sufficient protein expression. This review is focused on the behaviors at the cellular level of nanotechnology&#8208;mediated mRNA delivery systems, which have not been comprehensively reviewed yet. First, the four main therapeutic applications of mRNA are introduced, including immunotherapy, protein replacement therapy, genome editing, and cellular reprogramming. Second, common types of mRNA cargos and mRNA delivery systems are summarized. Third, strategies to enhance mRNA delivery efficiency during the cellular trafficking process are highlighted, including accumulation to the cell, internalization into the cell, endosomal escape, release of mRNA from the nanocarrier, and translation of mRNA into protein. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for the development of nanotechnology&#8208;mediated mRNA delivery systems are presented. This review can provide new insights into the future fabrication of mRNA nanocarriers with desirable cellular trafficking performance.

         <title>In Situ Nanofiber Formation Blocks AXL and GAS6 Binding to Suppress Ovarian Cancer Development</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anexelekto (AXL) is an attractive molecular target for ovarian cancer therapy because of its important role in ovarian cancer initiation and progression. To date, several AXL inhibitors have entered clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer. However, the disadvantages of low AXL affinity and severe off&#8208;target toxicity of these inhibitors limit their further clinical applications. Herein, by rational design of a nonapeptide derivative Nap&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;Glu&#8208;Ile&#8208;Arg&#8208;Leu&#8208;Arg&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys (Nap&#8208;IR), we propose a strategy of in situ nanofiber formation to suppress ovarian cancer growth. After administration, Nap&#8208;IR specifically targets overexpressed AXL on ovarian cancer membranes and undergoes a receptor&#8208;instructed nanoparticle&#8208;to&#8208;nanofiber transition. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate that in situ formed Nap&#8208;IR nanofibers efficiently induce apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells by blocking AXL activation and disrupting subsequent downstream signaling events. Remarkably, Nap&#8208;IR can synergistically enhance the anticancer effect of cisplatin against HO8910 ovarian tumors. We anticipate that our Nap&#8208;IR can be applied in clinical ovarian cancer therapy in the near future.

         <title>Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm IrRuNiMoCo High&#8208;Entropy Alloy with Iridium&#8208;Rich Medium&#8208;Entropy Oxide Shell to Boost Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles with iridium&#8208;rich medium&#8208;entropy oxides shell exhibit unprecedented activity and stability in proton exchange membrane electrolyzer. The lattice distortion and slow diffusion effect retard the migration and dissolution of the transition metals, thus enhancing the corrosion resistance.








Abstract
Ensuring high catalytic activity and durability at low iridium&#160;(Ir)usage is still a big challenge for the development of electrocatalysts toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Here, a rapid liquid&#8208;reduction combined with surface galvanic replacement strategy is reported to synthesize the sub 2&#160;nm high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanoparticles featured with Ir&#8208;rich IrRuNiMo medium&#8208;entropy oxide shell (Ir&#8208;MEO) and a IrRuCoNiMo HEA core (HEA@Ir&#8208;MEO). Advanced spectroscopies reveal that the Ir&#8208;rich MEO shell inhibits the severe structural evolution of transition metals upon the OER, thus guaranteeing the structural stability. In situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, activation energy analysis and theoretical calculations unveil that the OER on HEA@Ir&#8208;MEO follows an adsorbate evolution mechanism pathway, where the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step is substantially lowered. The optimized catalyst delivers the excellent performance (1.85&#160;V/3.0 A cm&#8722;2@80&#160;&#176;C), long&#8208;term stability (&gt;500 h@1.0 Acm&#8722;2), and low energy consumption (3.98&#160;kWh Nm&#8722;3 H2 @1.0 A cm&#8722;2) in PEMWE with low Ir usage of &#8776;0.4 mg cm&#8722;2, realizing the dramatical reduction of hydrogen (H2) production cost to 0.88 dollar&#160;per kg (H2).

         <title>Musculoskeletal Organs&#8208;on&#8208;Chips: An Emerging Platform for Studying the Nanotechnology&#8211;Biology Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in musculoskeletal organs&#8208;on&#8208;chips (OoCs) and discusses the integration of nanotechnology in musculoskeletal OoCs for precise control of the nanoscale environment and facilitated functional evaluation. The role of musculoskeletal OoCs&#160;in improving the precision, safety, and efficacy of nanomedicine is then addressed. Finally, the challenges and potential of nanotechnology in OoCs&#160;are envisioned. 








Abstract
Nanotechnology&#8208;based approaches are promising for the treatment of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders, which present significant clinical burdens and challenges, but their clinical translation requires a deep understanding of the complex interplay between nanotechnology and MSK biology. Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OoC) systems have emerged as an innovative and versatile microphysiological platform to replicate the dynamics of tissue microenvironment for studying nanotechnology&#8211;biology interactions. This review first covers recent advances and applications of MSK OoCs and their ability to mimic the biophysical and biochemical stimuli encountered by MSK tissues. Next, by integrating nanotechnology into MSK OoCs, cellular responses and tissue behaviors may be investigated by precisely controlling and manipulating the nanoscale environment. Analysis of MSK disease mechanisms, particularly bone, joint, and muscle tissue degeneration, and drug screening and development of personalized medicine may be greatly facilitated using MSK OoCs. Finally, future challenges and directions are outlined for the field, including advanced sensing technologies, integration of immune&#8208;active components, and enhancement of biomimetic functionality. By highlighting the emerging applications of MSK OoCs, this review aims to advance the understanding of the intricate nanotechnology&#8211;MSK biology interface and its significance in MSK disease management, and the development of innovative and personalized therapeutic and interventional strategies.

         <title>2D Catalytic Nanozyme Enables Cascade Enzyodynamic Effect&#8208;Boosted and Ca2+ Overload&#8208;Induced Synergistic Ferroptosis/Apoptosis in Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

2D Ca2Mn8O16 nanosheets with five enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities are rationally designed, engineered, and developed to trigger the generation of aberrant reactive oxygen species and Ca2+ overload for ferroptosis/apoptosis synergistic therapy of lung cancer.








Abstract
The introduction of glucose oxidase, exhibiting characteristics of glucose consumption and H2O2 production, represents an emerging antineoplastic therapeutic approach that disrupts nutrient supply and promotes efficient generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the instability of natural enzymes and their low therapeutic efficacy significantly impede their broader application. In this context, 2D Ca2Mn8O16 nanosheets (CMO NSs) designed and engineered to serve as a high&#8208;performance nanozyme, enhancing the enzyodynamic effect for a ferroptosis&#8211;apoptosis synergistic tumor therapy, are presented. In addition to mimicking activities of glutathione peroxidase, catalase, oxidase, and peroxidase, the engineered CMO NSs exhibit glucose oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities. This feature contributes to their antitumor performance through cascade catalytic reactions, involving the disruption of glucose supply, self&#8208;supply of H2O2, and subsequent efficient ROS generation. The exogenous Ca2+ released from CMO NSs, along with the endogenous Ca2+ enrichment induced by ROS from the peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of CMO NSs, collectively mediate Ca2+ overload, leading to apoptosis. Importantly, the ferroptosis process is triggered synchronously through ROS output and glutathione consumption. The application of exogenous ultrasound stimulation further enhances the efficiency of ferroptosis&#8211;apoptosis synergistic tumor treatment. This work underscores the crucial role of enzyodynamic performance in ferroptosis&#8211;apoptosis synergistic therapy against tumors.

         <title>Photostrictive Actuators Based on Freestanding Ferroelectric Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Complex oxides offer a wide range of functional properties, and recent advances in fabrication of freestanding membranes of these oxides are adding new mechanical degrees of freedom to this already rich functional ecosystem. Here, we demonstrate photoactuation in freestanding thin film resonators of ferroelectric Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and paraelectric Strontium Titanate (SrTiO3). The free&#8208;standing films, transferred onto perforated supports, act as nano&#8208;drums, oscillating at their natural resonance frequency when illuminated by a frequency&#8208;modulated laser. The light&#8208;induced deflections in the ferroelectric BaTiO3 membranes are two orders of magnitude larger than in the paraelectric SrTiO3 ones. Time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray micro&#8208;diffraction under illumination and temperature&#8208;dependent and holographic interferometry provide combined evidence for the photostrictive strain in BaTiO3 originating from partial screening of ferroelectric polarization by photo&#8208;excited carriers, which decreases the tetragonality of the unit cell. These findings showcase the potential of photostrictive freestanding ferroelectric films as wireless actuators operated by&#160;light.

Abstract
White light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) are the key component in next&#8208;generation lighting and display devices. The inherent toxicity of Cd/Pb&#8208;based quantum dots (QDs) limits the further application in WLEDs. Recently, more attention has been focused on eco&#8208;friendly QDs and their WLEDs, especially the phosphor&#8208;free WLEDs based on mono&#8208;component, which profits from bias&#8208;insensitive color stability. However, the imbalanced carrier distribution between red&#8208;green&#8208;blue luminescent centers, even the absence of a certain luminescent center, hinders their balanced and stable photoluminescence/electroluminescence (PL/EL). Here, an In3+&#8208;doped strategy in Zn&#8208;Cu&#8208;Ga&#8208;S@ZnS QDs is first proposed, and the balanced carrier distribution is realized by non&#8208;equivalent substitution and In3+ doping concentration modulation. The alleviation of the green emitter by the In3+&#8208;related red emitter and the compensation of blue emitter by the Zn&#8208;related electronic states contribute to the balanced red&#8208;green&#8208;blue emitting with a high PL quantum yield (PLQY) of 95.3% and a long lifetime (T90) of over 1100 h in atmospheric conditions. Thus, the In3+&#8208;doped WLEDs can achieve exceedingly slight proportional variations between red&#8208;green&#8208;blue EL intensity over time (&#8710;CIE = (0.007, 0.009)), and a high champion CRI of 94.9. This study proposes a single&#8208;component QD with balanced and stable red&#8208;green&#8208;blue PL/EL spectrum, meeting the requirements of lighting and display.

         <title>A Nature&#8208;Derived, Hetero&#8208;Structured, Pro&#8208;Healing Bioadhesive Patch for High&#8208;Performance Sealing of Wet Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nature&#8208;derived multilayered hetero&#8208;bioadhesive patch (skin secretion of Andrias davidianus (SSAD)&#8208;Patch) based on hydrophilic/hydrophobic pro&#8208;healing bioadhesives derived from the SSAD is developed, which is designed to form pressure&#8208;triggered strong adhesion with wet tissues. The SSAD&#8208;Patch is potentially adaptable to broad applications, under different pH values and air or liquid pressures, in sutureless wound sealing and healing.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives are promising alternatives to sutures and staples to achieve wound closure and hemostasis. However, they often do not work well on tissues that are soaked in blood or other biological fluids, and organs that are typically exposed to a variety of harsh environments such as different pH values, nonhomogeneous distortions, continuous expansions and contractions, or high pressures. In this study, a nature&#8208;derived multilayered hetero&#8208;bioadhesive patch (skin secretion of Andrias davidianus (SSAD)&#8208;Patch) based on hydrophilic/hydrophobic pro&#8208;healing bioadhesives derived from the SSAD is developed, which is designed to form pressure&#8208;triggered strong adhesion with wet tissues. The SSAD&#8208;Patch is successfully applied for the sealing and healing of tissue defects within 10 s in diverse extreme injury scenarios in vivo including rat stomach perforation, small intestine perforation, fetal membrane defect, porcine carotid artery incision, and lung lobe laceration. The findings reveal a promising new type of self&#8208;adhesive regenerative SSAD&#8208;Patch, which is potentially adaptable to broad applications (under different pH values and air or liquid pressures) in sutureless wound sealing and healing.

The findings reveal a promising new type of self-adhesive regenerative SSAD-Patch, which is potentially adaptable to broad applications (under different pH values and air or liquid pressures) in sutureless wound sealing and healing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Interlayer Enables High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaics with Power Conversion Efficiency Exceeding 20%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic (OVP) with efficiency exceeding 20% is achieved via the self&#8208;assembled interlayer (SAI) strategy. The use of 2PACz&#8208;SAI advances the surface/interface optoelectronic properties, including mitigated parasitic absorption, improved optical field distribution and the carrier dynamics. Moreover, the efficacy of SAI strategy is widely proved. Additionally, the 2PACz&#8208;SAI based ST&#8208;OPV exhibits a record light utilization efficiency of 5.34%.








Abstract
Interfacial layers (ILs) are prerequisites to form the selective charge transport for high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaics (OPVs) but mostly result in considerable parasitic absorption loss. Trimming the ILs down to a mono&#8208;molecular level via the self&#8208;assembled monolayer is an effective strategy to mitigate parasitic absorption loss. However, such a strategy suffers from inferior electrical contact with low surface coverage on rough surfaces and poor producibility. To address these issues, here, the self&#8208;assembled interlayer (SAI) strategy is developed, which involves a thin layer of 2&#8211;6&#160;nm to form a full coverage on the substrate via both covalent and van der Waals bonds by using a self&#8208;assembled molecule of 2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) (2PACz). Via the facile spin coating without further rinsing and annealing process, it not only optimizes the electrical and optical properties of OPVs, which enables a world&#8208;record efficiency of 20.17% (19.79% certified) but also simplifies the tedious processing procedure. Moreover, the SAI strategy is especially useful in improving the absorbing selectivity for semi&#8208;transparent OPVs, which enables a record light utilization efficiency of 5.34%. This work provides an effective strategy of SAI to optimize the optical and electrical properties of OPVs for high&#8208;performance and solar window applications.

Abstract
In recent years, there has been widespread adoption of machine learning (ML) technologies to unravel intricate relationships among diverse parameters in various additive manufacturing (AM) techniques. These ML models excel at recognizing complex patterns from extensive, well&#8208;curated datasets, thereby unveiling latent knowledge crucial for informed decision&#8208;making during the AM process. The collaborative synergy between ML and AM holds the potential to revolutionize the design and production of AM&#8208;printed parts. This review delves into the challenges and opportunities emerging at the intersection of these two dynamic fields. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the publication landscape for ML&#8208;related research in the field of AM, explores common ML applications in AM research (such as quality control, process optimization, design optimization, microstructure analysis, and material formulation), and concludes by presenting an outlook that underscores the utilization of advanced ML models, the development of emerging sensors, and ML applications in emerging AM&#8208;related fields. Notably, ML has garnered increased attention in AM due to its superior performance across various AM&#8208;related applications. It is envisioned that the integration of ML into AM processes will significantly enhance 3D printing capabilities across diverse AM&#8208;related research areas.

         <title>Flexible Indoor Perovskite Solar Cells by In Situ Bottom&#8208;Up Crystallization Modulation and Interfacial Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular bridge is introduced at the flexible SnO2/perovskite interface to simultaneously achieve in situ bottom&#8208;up crystallization modulation and interfacial passivation utilizing organic bifunctional passivator sodium 2&#8208;cyanoacetate (SZC). The flexible indoor perovskite solar cells deliver an exceptional 41.33% at 1000 lux with a high fill factor of 84.32%.








Abstract
A robust perovskite&#8208;buried interface is pivotal for achieving high&#8208;performance flexible indoor photovoltaics as it significantly influences charge transport and extraction efficiency. Herein, a molecular bridge strategy is introduced utilizing sodium 2&#8208;cyanoacetate (SZC) additive at the perovskite&#8208;buried interface to simultaneously achieve in situ passivation of interfacial defects and bottom&#8208;up crystallization modulation, resulting in high&#8208;performance flexible indoor photovoltaic applications. Supported by both theoretical calculations and experimental evidences, it illustrates how SZCs serve as molecular bridges, establishing robust bonds between SnO2 transport layer and perovskite, mitigating oxygen vacancy defects and under&#8208;coordinated Pb defects at interface during flexible fabrication. This, in turn, enhances interfacial energy level alignment and facilitates efficient carrier transport. Moreover, this in situ investigation of perovskite crystallization dynamics reveals bottom&#8208;up crystallization modulation, extending perovskite growth at the buried interface and influencing subsequent surface recrystallization. This results in larger crystalline grains and improved lattice strain of the perovskite during flexible fabrication. Finally, the optimized flexible solar cells achieve an impressive efficiency exceeding 41% at 1000 lux, with a fill factor as high as 84.32%. The concept of the molecular bridge represents a significant advancement in enhancing the performance of perovskite&#8208;based flexible indoor photovoltaics for the upcoming era of Internet of Things (IoT).

         <title>Customized Enhancement of Thermal Sensitivity of Tumors at Different Subcutaneous Depths by Multichannel Lanthanide Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated hydrophilic multichannel lanthanide&#8208;based nanoprobe, the depth of a tumor can be evaluated through fluorescence imaging. The probe enables tunable release of a heat shock protein inhibitor to enhance thermal sensitivity of tumors for customized photothermal therapy. An optimized nonuniform light field enables efficient ablation of tumors at different subcutaneous depths while minimizing injury to surrounding tissues.








Abstract
The photothermal therapeutic effect on tumors located at different subcutaneous depths varies due to the attenuation of light by tissue. Here, based on the wavelength&#8208;dependent optical attenuation properties of tissues, the tumor depth is assessed using a multichannel lanthanide nanocomposite. A zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8)&#8208;coated nanocomposite is able to deliver high amounts of the hydrophilic heat shock protein 90 inhibitor epigallocatechin gallate through a hydrogen&#8208;bonding network formed by the encapsulated highly polarized polyoxometalate guest. It is superior to both bare and PEGylated ZIF&#8208;8 for drug delivery. With the assessment of tumor depth and accumulated amount of nanocomposite by fluorescence, an irradiation prescription can be customized to release sufficient HSP90 inhibitor and generate heat for sensitized photothermal treatment of tumors, which not only ensured therapeutic efficacy but also minimized damage to the surrounding tissues.

Abstract
Over the past few decades, significant progress in piezo&#8208;/tribo&#8208;electric nanogenerators (PTEGs) has led to the development of cutting&#8208;edge wearable technologies. Nanofibers with good designability, controllable morphologies, large specific areas, and unique physicochemical properties provide a promising platform for PTEGs for various advanced applications. However, the further development of nanofiber&#8208;based PTEGs is limited by technical difficulties, ranging from materials design to device integration. Herein, we systematically review the current developments in PTEGs based on electrospun nanofibers. The review begins with the mechanisms of PTEGs and the advantages of nanofibers and nanodevices, including high breathability, waterproofness, scalability, and thermal&#8211;moisture comfort. In terms of materials and structural design, novel electroactive nanofibers and structure assemblies based on one&#8208;dimensional micro/nanostructures, two&#8208;dimensional bionic structures, and three&#8208;dimensional multilayered structures are discussed. Subsequently, nanofibrous PTEGs in applications such as energy harvesters, personalized medicine, personal protective equipment, and human&#8208;machine interactions are summarized. Nanofiber&#8208;based PTEGs still face many challenges such as energy efficiency, material durability, device stability, and device integration. In the final section of this review, the research gap between research and practical applications of PTEGs is discussed, and emerging trends are proposed, providing some ideas for the development of intelligent wearables.

Nanofiber-based PTEGs still face many challenges such as energy efficiency, material durability, device stability, and device integration. In the final section of this review, the research gap between research and practical applications of PTEGs is discussed, and emerging trends are proposed, providing some ideas for the development of intelligent wearables.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Organic Solar Cells with 19.2% Efficiency Enabled by Synergistic Side&#8208;Chain Engineering</title>

Abstract
Restricted by the energy&#8208;gap law, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit relatively low open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC; 0.8&#8211;0.9 V) because of large nonradiative energy losses. Moreover, the trade&#8208;off between VOC and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of OSCs is more distinctive; the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs are still &lt; 15% with VOCs of &gt; 1.0 V. Herein, we carefully consider the electronic properties and aggregation behaviors of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) and then delicately design a new NFA (Z19) by simultaneously introducing alkoxy and phenyl&#8208;substituted alkyl chains to the conjugated backbone. Z19 exhibits a hypochromatic&#8208;shifted absorption spectrum and a high&#8208;lying LUMO energy level. Moreover, Z19 presents an ordered two&#8208;dimensional packing mode and good miscibility with polymer donor D18. The blend film exhibits suitable crystallinity and favorable phase separation with face&#8208;on dominated molecular orientation, facilitating charge transport properties. Consequently, D18:Z19 binary devices afford an exciting PCE of 19.2% (certified 18.8%) with a high VOC of 1.002 V and an EQEmax of 91.4%, much higher than for Y6&#8208;2O&#8208;based devices (PCE = 4.85%). (The latter is the highest PCE reported to date for OSCs with VOCs of &gt; 1.0 V.) Moreover, the nonradiative energy losses of Z19&#8208;based (0.200 eV) and Y6&#8208;2O&#8208;based (0.155 eV) devices are much lower than that of Y6&#8208;based (0.239 eV) devices. Indications are that the design of such NFA organic semiconductors, considering the energy&#8208;gap law, could promote a new breakthrough in OSCs.

         <title>Memristive Explainable Artificial Intelligence Hardware</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A memristive explainable artificial intelligence (MemXAI) hardware is proposed to provide an explanation and interpretation of AI decisions, where the three essential functions are implemented using three different types of memristors. The MemXAI hardware promotes a trustworthy AI system with low energy consumption of only 4.32% compared to conventional complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;based computing systems.








Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI) is often considered a black box because it provides optimal answers without clear insight into its decision&#8208;making process. To address this black box problem, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged, which provides an explanation and interpretation of its decisions, thereby promoting the trustworthiness of AI systems. Here, a memristive XAI hardware framework is presented. This framework incorporates three distinct types of memristors (Mott memristor, valence change memristor, and charge trap memristor), each responsible for performing three essential functions (perturbation, analog multiplication, and integration) required for the XAI hardware implementation. Three memristor arrays with high robustness are fabricated and the image recognition of 3 &#215; 3 testing patterns and their explanation map generation are experimentally demonstrated. Then, a software&#8208;based extended system based on the characteristics of this hardware is built, simulating a large&#8208;scale image recognition task. The proposed system can perform the XAI operations with only 4.32% of the energy compared to conventional digital systems, enlightening its strong potential for the XAI accelerator.

         <title>2D Nanomaterials Reinforced Organic Coatings for Marine Corrosion Protection: State of the Art, Challenges, and Future Prospectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D nanomaterials have layered structures and exhibit excellent physical barrier properties. By introducing corrosion inhibitors and/or chemical modifications, organic coatings can be endowed with excellent self&#8208;healing properties. Furthermore, highly conductive nanomaterials can boost the cathodic protection performance of zinc&#8208;rich coatings and extend the lifespan of organic coatings in marine environments.








Abstract
2D nanomaterials, with extraordinary physical and chemical characteristics, have long been regarded as promising nanofillers in organic coatings for marine corrosion protection. The past decade has witnessed the high&#8208;speed progress of 2D nanomaterial&#8208;reinforced organic composite coatings, and plenty of breakthroughs have been achieved as yet. This review covers an in&#8208;depth and all&#8208;around outline of the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advances in 2D nanomaterial&#8208;modified organic coatings employed for the marine corrosion protection realm. Starting from a brief introduction to 2D nanomaterials, the preparation strategies and properties are illustrated. Subsequently, diverse protection models based on composite coatings for marine corrosion protection are also introduced, including physical barrier, self&#8208;healing, as well as cathodic protection, respectively. Furthermore, computational simulations and critical factors on the corrosion protection properties of composite coatings are clarified in detail. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects for marine corrosion protection based on 2D nanomaterials reinforced organic coatings are highlighted.

         <dc:description>
Radiative cooling (RC) is a carbon&#8208;neutral technology that harnesses the coldness of the outer space to lower the temperature of objects. This review introduces the working principles, designs, and fabrications of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art RC materials, categorized as static&#8208;homogeneous, static&#8208;composite, dynamic, and multifunctional. Through outlining future trends and solutions, this review will serve as a roadmap for the development of RC materials.








Abstract
Radiative cooling (RC) is a carbon&#8208;neutral cooling technology that utilizes thermal radiation to dissipate heat from the Earth's surface to the cold outer space. Research in the field of RC has garnered increasing interest from both academia and industry due to its potential to drive sustainable economic and environmental benefits to human society by reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from conventional cooling systems. Materials innovation is the key to fully exploit the potential of RC. This review aims to elucidate the materials development with a focus on the design strategy including their intrinsic properties, structural formations, and performance improvement. The main types of RC materials, i.e., static&#8208;homogeneous, static&#8208;composite, dynamic, and multifunctional materials, are systematically overviewed. Future trends, possible challenges, and potential solutions are presented with perspectives in the concluding part, aiming to provide a roadmap for the future development of advanced RC materials.

         <title>A Biomimetic &#8220;Salting Out&#8212;Alignment&#8212;Locking&#8221; Tactic to Design Strong and Tough Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural spider silk dragline producing process, a &#8220;salting out&#8212;alignment&#8212;locking&#8221; tactic (SALT) is developed in this paper. The obtained strength and toughness of gelatin hydrogels through SALT hold records for the previously reported gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel and are close to the tendons. The SALT also exhibits universality toward other salts and polymer systems.








Abstract
Recently, hydrogel&#8208;based soft materials have demonstrated huge potential in soft robotics, flexible electronics as well as artificial skins. Although various methods are developed to prepare tough and strong hydrogels, it is still challenging to simultaneously enhance the strength and toughness of hydrogels, especially for protein&#8208;based hydrogels. Herein, a biomimetic &#8220;salting out&#8212;alignment&#8212;locking&#8221; tactic (SALT) is introduced for enhancing mechanical properties through the synergy of alignment and the salting out effect. As a typical example, tensile strength and modulus of initially brittle gelatin hydrogels increase 940 folds to 10.12&#160;&#177;&#160;0.50&#160;MPa and 2830 folds to 34.26&#160;&#177;&#160;3.94&#160;MPa, respectively, and the toughness increases up to 1785 folds to 14.28&#160;&#177;&#160;3.13&#160;MJ m&#8722;3. The obtained strength and toughness hold records for the previously reported gelatin&#8208;based hydrogel and are close to the tendons. It is further elucidated that the salting out effect engenders hydrophobic domains, while prestretching facilitates chain alignment, both synergistically contributing to the outstanding mechanical properties. It is noteworthy that the SALT demonstrates remarkable versatility across different salt types and polymer systems, thus opening up new avenues for engineering strong, tough, and stiff hydrogels.

As a typical example, tensile strength and modulus of initially brittle gelatin hydrogels increase 940 folds to 10.12&#160;&#177;&#160;0.50&#160;MPa and 2830 folds to 34.26&#160;&#177;&#160;3.94&#160;MPa, respectively, and the toughness increases up to 1785 folds to 14.28&#160;&#177;&#160;3.13&#160;MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The obtained strength and toughness hold records for the previously reported gelatin-based hydrogel and are close to the tendons. It is further elucidated that the salting out effect engenders hydrophobic domains, while prestretching facilitates chain alignment, both synergistically contributing to the outstanding mechanical properties. It is noteworthy that the SALT demonstrates remarkable versatility across different salt types and polymer systems, thus opening up new avenues for engineering strong, tough, and stiff hydrogels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>50&#8208;nm Gas&#8208;filled Protein Nanostructures to Enable the Access of Lymphatic Cells by Ultrasound Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ultrasound imaging and ultrasound&#8208;mediated gene and drug delivery are rapidly advancing diagnostic and therapeutic methods; however, their use is often limited by the need of microbubbles, which cannot transverse many biological barriers due to their large size. Here we introduce 50&#8208;nm gas&#8208;filled protein nanostructures derived from genetically engineered gas vesicles that we referred to as 50nmGVs. These diamond&#8208;shaped nanostructures have hydrodynamic diameters smaller than commercially available 50&#8208;nm gold nanoparticles and are, to our knowledge, the smallest stable, free&#8208;floating bubbles made to date. 50nmGVs can be produced in bacteria, purified through centrifugation, and remain stable for months. Interstitially injected 50nmGVs can extravasate into lymphatic tissues and gain access to critical immune cell populations, and electron microscopy images of lymph node tissues reveal their subcellular location in antigen&#8208;presenting cells adjacent to lymphocytes. We anticipate that 50nmGVs can substantially broaden the range of cells accessible to current ultrasound technologies and may generate applications beyond biomedicine as ultrasmall stable gas&#8208;filled nanomaterials.

         <title>Structural Design for EMI Shielding: From Underlying Mechanisms to Common Pitfalls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve absorption&#8208;dominant electromagnetic interference (EMI) shields, detailed structural design is essential. This review examines various shielding configurations such as polymer nanocomposites, thin films, porous frameworks, multilayer constructs, and 3D&#8208;printed structures. It highlights key considerations for creating effective shields, explains fundamental shielding mechanisms, and addresses common misconceptions in EMI shielding science.








Abstract
Modern human civilization deeply relies on the rapid advancement of cutting&#8208;edge electronic systems that have revolutionized communication, education, aviation, and entertainment. However, the electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by digital systems poses a significant threat to the society, potentially leading to a future crisis. While numerous efforts are made to develop nanotechnological shielding systems to mitigate the detrimental effects of EMI, there is limited focus on creating absorption&#8208;dominant shielding solutions. Achieving absorption&#8208;dominant EMI shields requires careful structural design engineering, starting from the smallest components and considering the most effective electromagnetic wave attenuating factors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of shielding structures, emphasizing the critical elements of absorption&#8208;dominant shielding design, shielding mechanisms, limitations of both traditional and nanotechnological EMI shields, and common misconceptions about the foundational principles of EMI shielding science. This systematic review serves as a scientific guide for designing shielding structures that prioritize absorption, highlighting an often&#8208;overlooked aspect of shielding science.

         <title>Noncentrosymmetric Triangular Magnet CaMnTeO6: Strong Quantum Fluctuations and Role of s0 versus s2 Electronic States in Competing Exchange Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work demonstrates a framework to design triangular magnets with atomically precise control of competing intralayer and interlayer magnetic exchange interactions. Careful considerations of isotope purity, nuclear and electronic spins, lattice symmetry, frontier orbitals, and electronic states for CaMnTeO6 result in the realization of strong quantum fluctuations. This provides a powerful tool for enhancing coherent quantum dynamics in real materials.








Abstract
Noncentrosymmetric triangular magnets offer a unique platform for realizing strong quantum fluctuations. However, designing these quantum materials remains an open challenge attributable to a knowledge gap in the tunability of competing exchange interactions at the atomic level. Here, a new noncentrosymmetric triangular S&#160;=&#160;3/2 magnet CaMnTeO6 is created based on careful chemical and physical considerations. The model material displays competing magnetic interactions and features nonlinear optical responses with the capability of generating coherent photons. The incommensurate magnetic ground state of CaMnTeO6 with an unusually large spin rotation angle of 127&#176;(1) indicates that the anisotropic interlayer exchange is strong and competing with the isotropic interlayer Heisenberg interaction. The moment of 1.39(1)&#160;&#181;B, extracted from low&#8208;temperature heat capacity and neutron diffraction measurements, is only 46% of the expected value of the static moment 3&#160;&#181;B. This reduction indicates the presence of strong quantum fluctuations in the half&#8208;integer spin S&#160;=&#160;3/2 CaMnTeO6 magnet, which is rare. By comparing the spin&#8208;polarized band structure, chemical bonding, and physical properties of AMnTeO6 (A&#160;=&#160;Ca, Sr, Pb), how quantum&#8208;chemical interpretation can illuminate insights into the fundamentals of magnetic exchange interactions, providing a powerful tool for modulating spin dynamics with atomically precise control is demonstrated.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Mediated Strong Plasticization for High&#8208;Performance Alginate Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a facile processing method to fabricate natural polysaccharide plastics as convenient as a thermoforming process. Polysaccharide plastics are processed in a near&#8208;solid state by hydrogen bond mediation, realizing sufficient stretching that improves chain alignment. Highly orientated and crystalline alginate films exhibit high mechanical performance comparable to synthetic films. High&#8208;performance alginate plastics with desired functionalities are also constructed.








Abstract
The increasingly severe plastic pollution has urged an inevitable trend to develop biodegradable plastic products that can take over synthetic plastics. As one of the most abundant natural polymers, polysaccharides are an ideal candidate to substitute synthetic plastics. The rigidity of polysaccharide chains principally allows for high strength and stiffness of their materials, however, challenges the facile orientation in material processing. Here, a general hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated plasticization strategy to regulate isotropic sodium alginate (SA) chains to a highly ordered state is developed, and alginate plastics with high performances are fabricated. It is revealed that hydroxyl groups in glycerol modulate the viscoelasticity of SA solids by forming strong hydrogen bonds with SA chains, achieving a large stretchability at a high solid content. Highly orientated alginate films exhibit a superior tensile strength of 575&#160;MPa and toughness of 60.7&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, outperforming most regenerated biomass films. The high solid content and large stretchability mediated by strong hydrogen bonding ensure plastic molding of solid&#8208;like SA with high fidelity. This hydrogen bond&#8208;mediated plasticity provides a facile but effective method to justify the high performances of polysaccharide&#8208;based plastics.

         <title>Embedded Physical Intelligence in Liquid Crystalline Polymer Actuators and Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal polymers have garnered substantial interest in the pursuit of intelligent robots, thanks to their capacity for reversible shape transformation and the vast potential for manifesting physical intelligence. In this review, a focused summary of the stimulation methodologies employed from various perspectives is provided and discusses current research trends in robotics to imbue physical intelligence into LC polymer systems.








Abstract
Responsive materials possess the inherent capacity to autonomously sense and respond to various external stimuli, demonstrating physical intelligence. Among the diverse array of responsive materials, liquid crystalline polymers (LCPs) stand out for their remarkable reversible stimuli&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;morphing properties and their potential for creating soft robots. While numerous reviews have extensively detailed the progress in developing LCP&#8208;based actuators and robots, there exists a need for comprehensive summaries that elucidate the underlying principles governing actuation and how physical intelligence is embedded within these systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in developing actuators and robots endowed with physical intelligence using LCPs. This review is structured around the stimulus conditions and categorizes the studies involving responsive LCPs based on the fundamental control and stimulation logic and approach. Specifically, three main categories are examined: systems that respond to changing stimuli, those operating under constant stimuli, and those equip with learning and logic control capabilities. Furthermore, the persisting challenges that need to be addressed are outlined and discuss the future avenues of research in this dynamic field.

         <title>2D Air&#8208;Stable Nonlayered Ferrimagnetic FeCr2S4 Crystals Synthesized via Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful synthesis of highly crystalline 2D FeCr2S4 in 2D form with pure cubic spinel structure, which exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, thickness independent of TC and excellent air stability. The work promotes further exploration of the fundamental aspects of 2D magnets, and paves the way for the application of the 2D robust ferrimagnetic material in multiferroic and spintronic devices.








Abstract
The discovery of intrinsic 2D magnetic materials has opened up new opportunities for exploring magnetic properties at atomic layer thicknesses, presenting potential applications in spintronic devices. Here a new 2D ferrimagnetic crystal of nonlayered FeCr2S4 is synthesized with high phase purity using chemical vapor deposition. The obtained 2D FeCr2S4 exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, as evidenced by the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane/in&#8208;plane Hall effect and anisotropic magnetoresistance. Theoretical calculations further elucidate that the observed magnetic anisotropy can be attributed to its surface termination structure. By combining temperature&#8208;dependent magneto&#8208;transport and polarized Raman spectroscopy characterizations, it is discovered that both the measured Curie temperature and the critical temperature at which a low energy magnon peak disappeared remains constant, regardless of its thickness. Magnetic force microscopy measurements show the flipping process of magnetic domains. The exceptional air&#8208;stability of the 2D FeCr2S4 is also confirmed via Raman spectroscopy and Hall hysteresis loops. The robust anisotropic ferrimagnetism, the thickness&#8208;independent of Curie temperature, coupled with excellent air&#8208;stability, make 2D FeCr2S4 crystals highly attractive for future spintronic devices.

         <title>Designer Lithium Reservoirs for Ultralong Life Lithium Batteries for Grid Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabled by the unique mediation chemistry of elemental sulfur, the designer lithium reservoirs possess controllable electrochemical activities and high specific capacity without evolution of any reactive gases, which contribute to an outstanding cycling stability in a prototype pouch cell with an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level capacity.








Abstract
The minimization of irreversible active lithium loss stands as a pivotal concern in rechargeable lithium batteries, particularly in the context of grid&#8208;storage applications, where achieving the utmost energy density over prolonged cycling is imperative to meet stringent demands, notably in terms of life cost. Departing from conventional methodologies advocating electrode prelithiation and/or electrolyte additives, a new paradigm is proposed here: the integration of a designer lithium reservoir (DLR) featuring lithium orthosilicate (Li4SiO4) and elemental sulfur. This approach concurrently addresses active lithium consumption through solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and mitigates minor yet continuous parasitic reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface during extended cycling. The remarkable synergy between the Li&#8208;ion conductive Li4SiO4 and the SEI&#8208;favorable elemental sulfur enables customizable compensation kinetics for active lithium loss throughout continuous cycling. The introduction of a minute quantity of DLR (3 wt% Li4SiO4@S) yields outstanding cycling stability in a prototype pouch cell (graphite||LiFePO4) with an ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level capacity (&#8776;2.3 Ah), demonstrating remarkable capacity retention (&#8776;95%) even after 3000 cycles. This utilization of a DLR is poised to expedite the development of enduring lithium batteries for grid&#8208;storage applications and stimulate the design of practical, implantable rechargeable batteries based on related cell chemistries.

         <title>Polymerizing M&#8208;Series Acceptors for Efficient Polymer Solar Cells: Effect of the Molecular Shape</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The linear&#8208;shaped ADA&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule acceptor (SMA) is shown to be more advantageous to build polymer acceptors with high charge transport and photovoltaic properties than the banana&#8208;shaped one. The polymer acceptor based on the linear&#8208;shape ADA&#8208;type SMA exhibits a high efficiency of 15.65% in binary devices and an outstanding efficiency of 18.0% in ternary devices with a PM6:M36 host blend.








Abstract
Currently, high&#8208;performance polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors (PSMAs) based on ADA&#8208;type SMAs are still rare and greatly demanded for polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, two novel regioregular PSMAs (PW&#8208;Se and PS&#8208;Se) are designed and synthesized by using centrosymmetric (linear&#8208;shaped) and axisymmetric (banana&#8208;shaped) ADA&#8208;type SMAs as the main building blocks, respectively. It is demonstrated that photovoltaic performance of the PSMAs can be significantly improved by optimizing the configuration of ADA&#8208;type SMAs. Compared to the axisymmetric SMA&#8208;based polymer (PS&#8208;Se), PW&#8208;Se using a centrosymmetric SMA as the main building block exhibits better backbone coplanarity thereby resulting in bathochromically shifted absorption with a higher absorption coefficient, tighter interchain &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and more favorable blend film morphology. As a result, enhanced and more&#8208;balanced charge transport, better exciton dissociation, and reduced charge recombination are achieved for PW&#8208;Se&#8208;based devices with PM6 as polymer donor. Benefiting from these positive factors, the optimal PM6:PW&#8208;Se&#8208;based device exhibits a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.65% compared to the PM6:PS&#8208;Se&#8208;based device (8.90%). Furthermore, incorporation of PW&#8208;Se as a third component in the binary active layer of PM6:M36 yields ternary devices with an outstanding PCE of 18.0%, which is the highest value for PSCs based on ADA&#8208;type SMAs, to the best of the knowledge.

         <title>Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zn//COF Battery with UltraHigh Self&#8208;Charging Efficiency and Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient air self&#8208;charging Zn//COF&#8208;PTO battery is developed. COF&#8208;PTO spontaneously forms metal heterocyclic complexes with zinc ions (step 2) to promote the self&#8208;charging reaction (step 1), which is a mechanism similar to Le Chatelier's principle in chemical reactions. Therefore, Zn//COF&#8208;PTO batteries exhibit excellent self&#8208;charging efficiency (&#951;) and average self&#8208;charging rate (&#957;).








Abstract
Self&#8208;charging zinc batteries that combine energy harvesting technology with batteries are candidates for reliable self&#8208;charging power systems. However, the lack of rational materials design results in unsatisfactory self&#8208;charging performance. Here, a covalent organic framework containing pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone groups (COF&#8208;PTO) is reported as a cathode material for aqueous self&#8208;charging zinc batteries. The ordered channel structure of the COF&#8208;PTO provides excellent capacity retention of 98% after 18 000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1 and ultra&#8208;fast ion transfer. To visually assess the self&#8208;charging performance, two parameters, namely self&#8208;charging efficiency (self&#8208;charging discharge capacity/galvanostatic discharge capacity, &#951;) and average self&#8208;charging rate (total discharge capacity after cyclic self&#8208;charging/total cyclic self&#8208;charging time, &#957;), are proposed for performance evaluation. COF&#8208;PTO achieves an impressive &#951; of 96.9% and an &#957; of 30&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 self&#8208;charge capacity per hour in 100 self&#8208;charging cycles, surpassing the previous reports. Mechanism studies reveal the co&#8208;insertion of Zn2+ and H+ double ions in COF&#8208;PTO of self&#8208;charging zinc batteries. In addition, the C&#9552;N and C&#9552;O (on the benzene) in COF&#8208;PTO are ortho structures to each other, which can easily form metal heterocycles with Zn ions, thereby driving the forward progress of the self&#8208;charging reaction and enhancing the self&#8208;charging performance.

COF-PTO spontaneously forms metal heterocyclic complexes with zinc ions (step 2) to promote the self-charging reaction (step 1), which is a mechanism similar to Le Chatelier's principle in chemical reactions. Therefore, Zn//COF-PTO batteries exhibit excellent self-charging efficiency (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;) and average self-charging rate (&lt;i&gt;&#957;&lt;/i&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-charging zinc batteries that combine energy harvesting technology with batteries are candidates for reliable self-charging power systems. However, the lack of rational materials design results in unsatisfactory self-charging performance. Here, a covalent organic framework containing pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone groups (COF-PTO) is reported as a cathode material for aqueous self-charging zinc batteries. The ordered channel structure of the COF-PTO provides excellent capacity retention of 98% after 18 000 cycles at 10 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ultra-fast ion transfer. To visually assess the self-charging performance, two parameters, namely self-charging efficiency (self-charging discharge capacity/galvanostatic discharge capacity, &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt;) and average self-charging rate (total discharge capacity after cyclic self-charging/total cyclic self-charging time, &lt;i&gt;&#957;&lt;/i&gt;), are proposed for performance evaluation. COF-PTO achieves an impressive &lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt; of 96.9% and an &#957; of 30&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; self-charge capacity per hour in 100 self-charging cycles, surpassing the previous reports. Mechanism studies reveal the co-insertion of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; double ions in COF-PTO of self-charging zinc batteries. In addition, the C&#9552;N and C&#9552;O (on the benzene) in COF-PTO are ortho structures to each other, which can easily form metal heterocycles with Zn ions, thereby driving the forward progress of the self-charging reaction and enhancing the self-charging performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Degradation Mechanisms of Electrodes Promotes Direct Regeneration of Spent Li&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The rapid growth of electric vehicle use is expected to cause a significant environmental problem in the next few years due to the large number of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Recycling spent LIBs wouldn't only alleviate the environmental problems but also address the challenge of limited natural resources shortages. While several hydro&#8208; and pyrometallurgical processes have been developed for recycling different components of spent batteries, direct regeneration presents clear environmental and economic advantages. The principle of the direct regeneration approach is restoring the electrochemical performance by healing the defective structure of the spent materials. Thus, the development of direct regeneration technology largely depends on the formation mechanism of defects in spent LIBs. This review systematically detailed the degradation mechanisms and types of defects found in diverse cathode materials, graphite anodes, and current collectors during the battery's lifecycle. Building on this understanding, we've outlined principles and methodologies for directly rejuvenating materials within spent LIBs. We also propose the main challenges and solutions for the large&#8208;scale direct regeneration of spent LIBs. Furthermore, this review aims to pave the way for the direct regeneration of materials in discarded lithium&#8208;ion batteries by offering a theoretical foundation and practical guidance.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired Chemical&#8208;Gated Hydrogel Actuation Systems for Information 3D&#8208;Encoding Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cephalopods evolve the acetylcholine&#8208;gated actuation control function of their skin muscles, which enables their dynamic/static multi&#8208;mode display capacities for achieving perfectly spatial control over the colors/patterns on every inch of skin. Reproduction of artificial analogs that exhibit similar multimodal display is essential to reach advanced information 3D&#8208;encoding with higher security than the classic 2D&#8208;encoding strategy, but remains underdeveloped. The core difficulty is how to replicate such chemical&#8208;gated actuation control function into artificial soft actuating systems. Herein, we propose to develop azobenzene&#8208;functionalized polyacrylamide hydrogel systems, whose upper critical solution temperature (UCST) type actuation responsiveness can be intelligently programmed or even gated by the addition of hydrophilic &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD) molecules for reversible association with pendant azobenzene moieties via supramolecular host&#8208;guest interactions. By employing such &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;gated hydrogel actuator as an analogue of cephalopods&#8217; skin muscle, biomimetic mechanically modulated multicolor fluorescent display systems are designed, which demonstrate a conceptually new &#945;&#8208;CD&#8208;gated &#8220;thermal stimulation&#8208;hydrogel actuation&#8208;fluorescence output&#8221; display mechanism. Consequently, high&#8208;security 3D&#8208;encoding information carriers with an unprecedented combination of single&#8208;input multiple&#8208;output, dynamic/static dual&#8208;mode and spatially&#8208;controlled display capacities are achieved. This bioinspired strategy brings functional&#8208;integrated features for artificial display systems and opens previously unidentified avenues for information security.

         <title>Cucurbit[8]uril Mediated Supramolecular and Photocrosslinked Interpenetrating Network Hydrogel Matrices for 3D&#8208;Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Printing of biologically functional constructs is significant for applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Designing bio&#8208;inks remains remarkably challenging due to the multifaceted requirements in terms of the physical, chemical and biochemical properties of the three&#8208;dimensional matrix, such as cytocompatibility, printability and shape fidelity. In order to promote matrix and materials stiffness, while not sacrificing stress relaxation mechanisms which support cell spreading, migration and differentiation, we report an interpenetrating network bio&#8208;ink design. Our approach makes use of a chemically defined network, combining physical and chemical crosslinking unites with a tunable composition and network density, as well as spatiotemporal control over post&#8208;assembly material stiffening. To this end, star&#8208;shaped polyethylene glycols functionalized with Phe&#8208;Gly&#8208;Gly tripeptide or photoactive stilbazolium are synthesized, and used to prepare three&#8208;dimensional networks with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) through supramolecular host&#8208;guest&#8208;complexation. The hydrogel obtained shows fast relaxation and thus supports the proliferation and differentiation of cells. Upon irradiation, the mechanical properties of the hydrogel can be rapidly adapted via selective photochemical dimerization of stilbazolium within CB[8], leading to interpenetrating networks with increased form stability while retaining the dynamic nature of the hydrogels. This modular approach opens new design opportunities for extrudable and cell&#8208;friendly dynamic biomaterials for applications in 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

         <title>Kinetically Controlled Polyelectrolyte Complex Assembly of microRNA&#8208;Peptide Nanoparticles toward Treating Mesothelioma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Broad size distributions and poor long&#8208;term colloidal stability of microRNA&#8208;carrying nanoparticles, especially those formed by polyelectrolyte complexation, represent major hurdles in realizing their clinical translation. Herein, peptide design is used alongside optimized flash nanocomplexation (FNC) to produce uniform peptide&#8208;based miRNA particles of exceptional stability that display anticancer activity against mesothelioma in vitro and in vivo. Modulating the content and display of lysine&#8208;based charge from small intrinsically disordered peptides used to complex miRNA proved essential in achieving stable colloids. FNC facilitates kinetic isolation of the mechanistic steps involved in particle formation to allow the preparation of particles of discrete size in a highly reproducible, scalable, and continuous manner, facilitating pre&#8208;clinical studies. To our knowledge, this work represents the first example of employing FNC to prepare polyelectrolyte complexes of miRNA and peptide. Encapsulation of these particles into an injectable hydrogel matrix allows for their localized in vivo delivery by syringe. A one&#8208;time injection of a gel containing particles composed of miRNA&#8208;215&#8208;5p and the peptide PKM1 limited tumor progression in a xenograft model of mesothelioma.

Abstract
Aging and genetic&#8208;related disorders in the human brain lead to impairment of daily cognitive functions. Due to their neural synaptic complexity and the current limits of knowledge, reversing these disorders remains a substantial challenge for Brain&#8208;Computer Interfaces (BCI). In this work, we provide a solution to potentially override aging and neurological disorder&#8208;related cognitive function loss in the human brain through the application of our quantum synaptic device. To illustrate this point, we design and develop a quantum topological insulator (QTI) Bi2Se2Te&#8208;based synaptic neuroelectronic device, where the electric field&#8208;induced tunable topological surface edge states and quantum switching properties make them a premier option for establishing artificial synaptic neuromodulation approaches. Leveraging these unique quantum synaptic properties, our developed synaptic device provides the capability to neuromodulate distorted neural signals, leading to the reversal of age&#8208;related disorders via BCI. With the synaptic neuroelectronic characteristics of our device, we demonstrate excellent efficacy in treating cognitive neural dysfunctions through modulated neuromorphic stimuli. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate real&#8208;time neuromodulation of electroencephalogram (EEG) deduced distorted event&#8208;related potentials (ERP) by modulation of our synaptic device array.

         <title>Corrosion Engineering of Part&#8208;Per&#8208;Million Single Atom Pt1/Ni(OH)2 Electrocatalyst for PET Upcycling at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pt1/Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst with part&#8208;per&#8208;million noble Pt loading is designed for the highly efficient and selective upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into valuable chemicals (potassium diformate and terephthalic acid) and green hydrogen. This process allows the valuable chemicals production at the ampere&#8208;level current density with high efficiency and is highly profitable (588&#8211;700&#160;$&#160;ton&#8722;1 PET).








Abstract
The plastic waste issue has posed a series of formidable challenges for the ecological environment and human health. While conventional recycling strategies often lead to plastic down&#8208;cycling, the electrochemical strategy of recovering valuable monomers enables an ideal, circular plastic economy. Here a corrosion synthesized single atom Pt1/Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst with part&#8208;per&#8208;million noble Pt loading for highly efficient and selective upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into valuable chemicals (potassium diformate and terephthalic acid) and green hydrogen is reported. Electro&#8208;oxidation of PET hydrolysate, ethylene glycol (EG), to formate is processed with high Faraday efficiency (FE) and selectivity (&gt;90%) at the current density close to 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (1.444&#160;V vs RHE). The in situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the mechanism and the understanding of the high efficiency. Remarkably, the electro&#8208;oxidation of EG at the ampere&#8208;level current density is also successfully illustrated by using a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly with high FEs to formate integrated with hydrogen production for 500&#160;h of continuous operation. This process allows valuable chemical production at high space&#8208;time yield and is highly profitable (588&#8211;700&#160;$&#160;ton&#8722;1 PET), showing an industrial perspective on single&#8208;atom catalysis of electrochemical plastic upcycling.

         <title>Kornblum oxidation reaction&#8208;induced collective transformation of lead polyhalides for stable perovskite photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The iodide vacancy defects generated during the perovskite crystallization process is a common issue that limits the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Although excessive ionic iodides have been used to compensate for these vacancies, they are not effective in reducing defects through modulating the perovskite crystallization. Moreover, these iodide ions present in the perovskite films can act as interstitial defects, which are detrimental to the stability of the perovskite. Here we demonstrate an effective approach to suppress the formation of vacancy defects by manipulating the coordination chemistry of lead polyhalides during perovskite crystallization. To achieve this suppression, we introduce an &#945;&#8208;iodo ketone to undergo a process of Kornblum oxidation reaction that releases halides ions. This process induces a rapid collective transformation of lead polyhalides during the nucleation process and significantly reduces iodide vacancy defects. As a result, the ion mobility is decreased by one order of magnitude in perovskite film and the PSC achieves significantly improved thermal stability, maintaining 82% of its initial power conversion efficiency at 85&#160;&#176;C for 2800&#160;h. These findings highlight the potential of halides ions release by Kornblum oxidation reaction, which can be widely used for achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite optoelectronics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research summarizes the research progress of single atom catalysts (SACs) in petrochemical catalytic reaction process, proposes the role of structural regulation of SACs in enhancing catalytic performance, elucidates reaction mechanisms of SACs in the petrochemical processes, and then provides outlook on design, identification of active sites and the application of artificial intelligence technology for achieving scale&#8208;up application of SACs.








Abstract
Petroleum, as the &#8220;lifeblood&#8221; of industrial development, is the important energy source and raw material. The selective transformation of petroleum into high&#8208;end chemicals is of great significance, but still exists enormous challenges. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with 100% atom utilization and homogeneous active sites, promise a broad application in petrochemical processes. Herein, the research systematically summarizes the recent research progress of SACs in petrochemical catalytic reaction, proposes the role of structural design of SACs in enhancing catalytic performance, elucidates the catalytic reaction mechanisms of SACs in the conversion of petrochemical processes, and reveals the high activity origins of SACs at the atomic scale. Finally, the key challenges are summarized and an outlook on the design, identification of active sites, and the appropriate application of artificial intelligence technology is provided for achieving scale&#8208;up application of SACs in petrochemical process.

         <title>CogniFiber: Harnessing Biocompatible and Biodegradable 1D Collagen Nanofibers for Sustainable Nonvolatile Memory and Synaptic Learning Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible and biodegradable 1D collagen nanofibers demonstrate excellent resistive switching properties. The collagen&#8208;nanofiber&#8208;based device exhibits favorable resistive switching properties, showcasing voltage&#8208;tunable analog memory behavior. The optimized device demonstrates reliable nonvolatile memory performance, mimicking biological synaptic learning, and displaying good biocompatibility and cytotoxicity properties. This underscores the potential of 1D collagen nanofibers for biocompatible and biodegradable electronics.








Abstract
Here, resistive switching (RS) devices are fabricated using naturally abundant, nontoxic, biocompatible, and biodegradable biomaterials. For this purpose, 1D chitosan nanofibers (NFs), collagen NFs, and chitosan&#8211;collagen NFs are synthesized by using an electrospinning technique. Among different NFs, the collagen&#8208;NFs&#8208;based device shows promising RS characteristics. In particular, the optimized Ag/collagen NFs/fluorine&#8208;doped tin oxide RS device shows a voltage&#8208;tunable analog memory behavior and good nonvolatile memory properties. Moreover, it can also mimic various biological synaptic learning properties and can be used for pattern classification applications with the help of the spiking neural network. The time series analysis technique is employed to model and predict the switching variations of the RS device. Moreover, the collagen NFs have shown good cytotoxicity and anticancer properties, suggesting excellent biocompatibility as a switching layer. The biocompatibility of collagen NFs is explored with the help of NRK&#8208;52E (Normal Rat Kidney cell line) and MCF&#8208;7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation&#8208;7 cancer cell line). Additionally, the biodegradability of the device is evaluated through a physical transient test. This work provides a vital step toward developing a biocompatible and biodegradable switching material for sustainable nonvolatile memory and neuromorphic computing applications.

         <title>Selective Extraction of Critical Metals from Spent Li&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode: Cation&#8211;Anion Coordination and Anti&#8208;Solvent Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the differences in binding energy after coordination between anions in DES and transition metals, as well as the differences in Gibbs free energy of different coordination structures in acetone, an efficient and cost&#8208;effective system is designed for the selective recovery of transition metal ions.








Abstract
Owing to continuing global use of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), in particular in electric vehicles (EVs), there is a need for sustainable recycling of spent LIBs. Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are reported as &#8220;green solvents&#8221; for low&#8208;cost and sustainable recycling. However, the lack of understanding of the coordination mechanisms between DESs and transition metals (Ni, Mn and Co) and Li makes selective separation of transition metals with similar physicochemical properties practically difficult. Here, it is found that the transition metals and Li have a different stable coordination structure with the different anions in DES during leaching. Further, based on the different solubility of these coordination structures in anti&#8208;solvent (acetone), a leaching and separation process system is designed, which enables high selective recovery of transition metals and Li from spent cathode LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM111), with recovery of acetone. Recovery of spent LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode is also evidenced and a significant selective recovery for Co and Li is established, together with recovery and reuse of acetone and DES. It is concluded that the tuning of cation&#8211;anion coordination structure and anti&#8208;solvent crystallization are practical for selective recovery of critical metal resources in the spent LIBs recycling.

         <title>Moir&#233; Pattern Controlled Phonon Polarizer Based on Twisted Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, thermal experiment&#160;in twisted graphene is reported, measuring Moir&#233; angle&#8208;depedent thermal conductance and revealing fundamental relationship between twist angles and phonon behaviors. As revealed by experimental measurements and atomistic calculations, the dominant tuning mechanisms for tuning phonon transmission stem from high&#8208;frequency thermal modes while negligible effects on low&#8208;frequency acoustic modes near Brillouin zone center. This study offers crucial insights into mode&#8208;depedent&#160;thermal transport in Moir&#233; structures, opening avenues for the invention of quantum devices and new design methodologies based on manipulations of vibrational band structures and phonon spectra.








Abstract
Twisted van der Waals materials featuring Moir&#233; patterns present new design possibilities and demonstrate unconventional behaviors in electrical, optical, spintronic, and superconducting properties. However, experimental exploration of thermal transport across Moir&#233; patterns has not been as extensive, despite its critical role in nanoelectronics, thermal management, and energy technologies. Here, the&#160;first experimental study is conducted on thermal transport across twisted graphene, demonstrating a phonon polarizer concept from the rotational misalignment between stacked layers. The direct thermal and acoustic measurements,&#160;structural characterizations, and atomistic modeling, reveal a modulation up to 631% in thermal conductance with various Moir&#233; angles, while maintaining a high acoustic transmission. By comparing experiments with density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations, mode&#8208;dependent phonon transmissions are quantified based on the angle alignment of graphene band structures and attributed to the coupling among flexural phonon modes. The agreement confirms the dominant tuning mechanisms in adjusting phonon transmission from high&#8208;frequency thermal modes while having negligible effects on low&#8208;frequency acoustic modes near Brillouin zone center. This study offers crucial insights into the fundamental thermal transport in Moir&#233; structures, opening avenues for the invention of quantum thermal devices and new design methodologies based on manipulations of vibrational band structures and phonon spectra.

         <title>Suppressing Element Inhomogeneity Enables 14.9% Efficiency CZTSSe Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental inhomogeneity caused by Cu&#8208;directional diffusion toward Mo(S,Se)2 layer is demonstrated to be the critical factor in the formation of secondary phases and defects. By suppressing the Cu&#8208;directional diffusion with a blocking layer, a remarkable efficiency of 14.9% is achieved, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 576 mV and a certified efficiency of 14.6%.








Abstract
Kesterites, Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1&#8722;x)4 (CZTSSe), solar cells suffer from severe open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss due to the numerous secondary phases and defects. The prevailing notion attributes this issue to Sn&#8208;loss during the selenization. However, this work unveils that, instead of Sn&#8208;loss, elemental inhomogeneity caused by Cu&#8208;directional diffusion toward Mo(S,Se)2 layer is the critical factor in the formation of secondary phases and defects. This diffusion decreases the Cu/(Zn+Sn) ratio to 53% at the bottom fine&#8208;grain layer, increasing the Sn&#8208;/Zn&#8208;related bulk defects. By suppressing the Cu&#8208;directional diffusion with a blocking layer, the crystal quality is effectively improved and the defect density is reduced, leading to a remarkable photovoltaic coversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.9% with a VOC of 576&#160;mV and a certified efficiency of 14.6%. The findings provide insights into element inhomogeneity, holding significant potential to advance the development of CZTSSe solar cells.

         <title>Reduction of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;Bis(hydroxymethyl)Furan at High Current Density using a Ga&#8208;Doped AgCu:Cationomer Hybrid Electrocatalyst</title>

Hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived chemicals is of interest for the production of biofuels and chemicals. A direct electroreduction of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF) has been developed using a hybrid catalyst. The utilization of ternary metal nanodendrites mixed with a cationomer achieves a BHMF faradaic efficiency (FE) of 58% at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a production rate of 1&#160;mmol&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Hydrogenation of biomass&#8208;derived chemicals is of interest for the production of biofuels and valorized chemicals. Thermochemical processes for biomass reduction typically employ hydrogen as the reductant at elevated temperatures and pressures. Here, the authors investigate the direct electrified reduction of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to a precursor to bio&#8208;polymers, 2,5&#8208;bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (BHMF). Noting a limited current density in prior reports of this transformation, a hybrid catalyst consisting of ternary metal nanodendrites mixed with a cationic ionomer, the latter purposed to increase local pH and facilitate surface proton diffusion, is investigated. This approach, when implemented using Ga&#8208;doped Ag&#8208;Cu electrocatalysts designed for p&#8211;d orbital hybridization, steered selectivity to BHMF, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 58% at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a production rate of 1&#160;mmol&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, the latter a doubling in rate compared to the best prior reports.

         <title>Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel&#8208;Functionalized Photothermal Sponge Enables Simultaneously Continuous Solar Desalination and Electricity Generation Without Salt Accumulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional solar evaporator is developed by designing polyelectrolyte hydrogel&#8208;functionalized photothermal sponge. This evaporator not only exhibits a water evaporation rate of 3.53 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and 98.6% solar energy conversion efficiency but also can uninterruptedly deliver a voltage output of 0.972&#160;V and a current density of 172.38 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 in brine over a prolonged period under one sun.








Abstract
Technologies that can simultaneously generate electricity and desalinate seawater are highly attractive and required to meet the increasing global demand for power and clean water. Here, a bifunctional solar evaporator that features continuous electric generation in seawater without salt accumulation is developed by rational design of polyelectrolyte hydrogel&#8208;functionalized photothermal sponge. This evaporator not only exhibits an unprecedentedly high water evaporation rate of 3.53 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1along with 98.6% solar energy conversion efficiency but can also uninterruptedly deliver a voltage output of 0.972&#160;V and a current density of 172.38 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 in high&#8208;concentration brine over a prolonged period under one sun irradiation. Many common electronic devices can be driven by simply connecting evaporator units in series or in parallel without any other auxiliaries. Different from the previously proposed power generation mechanism, this study reveals that the water&#8208;enabled proton concentration fields in intermediate water region can also induce an additional ion electric field in free water region containing solute, to further enhance electricity output. Given the low&#8208;cost materials, simple self&#8208;regeneration design, scalable fabrication processes, and stable performance, this work offers a promising strategy for addressing the shortages of clean water and sustainable electricity.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Diffraction Correlation of Quantum Emitters and Local Strain Fields in Strain&#8208;Engineered WSe2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The positions of spectrally pure quantum emitters in nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers are mapped to the underlying strain field with a resolution below the diffraction limit (&#8776;30&#160;nm). The quantum emitters are displaced from the local strain maxima by an average distance of 240&#160;nm, which contradicts the assumption that strain&#8208;induced quantum emitters are concentrated at the local strain maxima.








Abstract
Strain&#8208;engineering in atomically thin metal dichalcogenides is a useful method for realizing single&#8208;photon emitters (SPEs) for quantum technologies. Correlating SPE position with local strain topography is challenging due to localization inaccuracies from the diffraction limit. Currently, SPEs are assumed to be positioned at the highest strained location and are typically identified by randomly screening narrow&#8208;linewidth emitters, of which only a few are spectrally pure. In this work, hyperspectral quantum emitter localization microscopy is used to locate 33 SPEs in nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers with sub&#8208;diffraction&#8208;limit resolution (&#8776;30&#160;nm) and correlate their positions with the underlying strain field via image registration. In this system, spectrally pure emitters are not concentrated at the highest strain location due to spectral contamination; instead, isolable SPEs are distributed away from points of peak strain with an average displacement of 240&#160;nm. These observations point toward a need for a change in the design rules for strain&#8208;engineered SPEs and constitute a key step toward realizing next&#8208;generation quantum optical architectures.

     alt="Sub-Diffraction Correlation of Quantum Emitters and Local Strain Fields in Strain-Engineered WSe2 Monolayers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The positions of spectrally pure quantum emitters in nanoparticle-strained WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers are mapped to the underlying strain field with a resolution below the diffraction limit (&#8776;30&#160;nm). The quantum emitters are displaced from the local strain maxima by an average distance of 240&#160;nm, which contradicts the assumption that strain-induced quantum emitters are concentrated at the local strain maxima.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strain-engineering in atomically thin metal dichalcogenides is a useful method for realizing single-photon emitters (SPEs) for quantum technologies. Correlating SPE position with local strain topography is challenging due to localization inaccuracies from the diffraction limit. Currently, SPEs are assumed to be positioned at the highest strained location and are typically identified by randomly screening narrow-linewidth emitters, of which only a few are spectrally pure. In this work, hyperspectral quantum emitter localization microscopy is used to locate 33 SPEs in nanoparticle-strained WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers with sub-diffraction-limit resolution (&#8776;30&#160;nm) and correlate their positions with the underlying strain field via image registration. In this system, spectrally pure emitters are not concentrated at the highest strain location due to spectral contamination; instead, isolable SPEs are distributed away from points of peak strain with an average displacement of 240&#160;nm. These observations point toward a need for a change in the design rules for strain-engineered SPEs and constitute a key step toward realizing next-generation quantum optical architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concurrent Ammonia Synthesis and Alcohol Oxidation Boosted by Glutathione&#8208;Capped Quantum Dots under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the protein environment for NOx&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH4+ process, glutathione&#8208;capped quantum dot is designed to accomplish efficient, selective, and scalable ammonia and ketone synthesis via NOx&#8722; reduction and alcohol oxidation concurrently under visible light. The positively&#8208;shifted surface charge and cogenerating GS&#183;and H&#183; radicals facilitate balanced electron and hole utilization, offering promising synthetic potential of value&#8208;added nitrogenous chemicals.








Abstract
Mother nature accomplishes efficient ammonia synthesis via cascade N2 oxidation by lightning strikes followed with enzyme&#8208;catalyzed nitrogen oxyanion (NOx&#8722;, x = 2,3) reduction. The protein environment of enzymatic centers for NOx&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH4+ process greatly inspires the design of glutathione&#8208;capped (GSH) quantum dots (QDs) for ammonia synthesis under visible light (440&#160;nm) in tandem with plasma&#8208;enabled N2 oxidation. Mechanistic studies reveal that GSH induces positive shift of surface charge to strengthen the interaction between NOx&#8722; and QDs. Upon visible light irradiation of QDs, the balanced and rapid hole and electron transfer furnish GS&#183;radicals for 2e&#8722;/2H+ alcohol oxidation and H&#183;for 8e&#8722;/10H+ NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH4+ reduction simultaneously. For the first time, mmol&#8208;scale ammonia synthesis is realized with apparent quantum yields of 5.45% &#177; 0.64%, and gram&#8208;scale synthesis of value&#8208;added acetophenone and NH4Cl proceeds with 1:4 stoichiometry and stability, demonstrating promising multielectron and multiproton ammonia synthesis efficiency and sustainability with nature&#8208;inspired artificial photocatalysts.

         <title>Visible Microfluidic Deprotonation for Aramid Nanofibers as Building Blocks of Cascade&#8208;Microfluidic&#8208;Processed Colloidal Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic deprotonation approach with an in situ observation function is proposed first to realize the continuous, scalable, efficient, and uniform production of aramid nanofibers. The kinetic exfoliation process is established quantificationally, bringing about appreciable prospects for the cascade&#8208;microfluidic&#8208;processed colloidal aerogels and providing inspiration for exfoliating any other nano&#8208;building blocks.








Abstract
&#160;Microfluidic deprotonation approach is proposed to realize continuous, scalable, efficient, and uniform production of aramid nanofibers (ANFs)&#160;by virtue of large specific surface area, high mixing efficiency, strong heat transfer capacity, narrow residence time distribution, mild laminar&#8208;flow process, and amplification&#8208;free effect of the microchannel reactor. By means of monitoring capabilities endowed by the high transparency of the microchannel, the kinetic exfoliation process of original aramid particles is in situ observed and the corresponding exfoliation mechanism is established quantificationally. The deprotonated time can be reduced from the traditional several days to 7 min for the final colloidal dispersion due to the synergistic effect between enhanced local shearing/mixing and the rotational motion of aramid particles in microchannel revealed by numerical simulations. Furthermore, the cascade microfluidic processing approach is used to make various ANF colloidal aerogels including aerogel fibers, aerogel films, and 3D&#8208;printed aerogel articles. Comprehensive characterizations show that these cascade&#8208;microfluidic&#8208;processed colloidal aerogels have identical features as those prepared in batch&#8208;style mode, revealing the versatile use value of these ANFs. This work achieves significant progress toward continuous and efficient production of ANFs, bringing about appreciable prospects for the practical application of ANF&#8208;based materials and providing inspiration for exfoliating any other nano&#8208;building blocks.

         <title>Achieving Zero&#8208;Temperature Coefficient Point Behavior by Defect Passivation for Temperature&#8208;Immune Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The zero&#8208;temperature coefficient (ZTC) point behavior is first achieved by eliminating Fermi pinning using a defect passivation strategy, which complements the ZTC point theory and achieves temperature&#8208;immune organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). The temperature&#8208;immune output current can be realized in the variable temperature bias voltage test over 50000 s by biasing OFETs at ZTC points.








Abstract
Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have broad prospects in biomedical, sensor, and aerospace applications. However, obtaining temperature&#8208;immune OFETs is difficult because the electrical properties of organic semiconductors (OSCs) are temperature&#8208;sensitive. The zero&#8208;temperature coefficient (ZTC) point behavior can be used to achieve a temperature&#8208;immune output current; however, it is difficult to achieve in organic devices with thermal activation characteristics, according to the existing ZTC point theory. Here, the Fermi pinning in OSCs is eliminated using the defect passivation strategy, making the Fermi level closer to the tail state at low temperatures; thus threshold voltage (VT) is negatively correlated with temperature. ZTC point behaviors in OFETs are achieved by compensation between VT and mobility at different temperatures to improve its temperature immunity. A temperature&#8208;immune output current can be realized in a variable&#8208;temperature bias voltage test over 50000&#160;s by biasing the device at the ZTC point. This study provides an effective solution for temperature&#8208;immune OFETs and inspiration for their practical application.

         <title>Humidity Sensing with Supramolecular Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of the art of supramolecular nanostructures as active components for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance humidity sensors is reviewed. The different sensing mechanisms that exploit structural or electronic/ionic&#8208;transport changes resulting from the interaction of the supramolecular nanostructures with water molecules to read out the environmental humidity with key performance indicators beyond the state of the art are discussed.








Abstract
Precise monitoring of the humidity level is important for the living comfort and for many applications in various industrial sectors. Humidity sensors have thus become one among the most extensively studied and used chemical sensors by targeting a maximal device performance through the optimization of the components and working mechanism. Among different moisture&#8208;sensitive systems, supramolecular nanostructures are ideal active materials for the next generation of highly efficient humidity sensors. Their noncovalent nature guarantees fast response, high reversibility, and fast recovery time in the sensing event. Herein, the most enlightening recent strategies on the use of supramolecular nanostructures for humidity sensing are showcased. The key performance indicators in humidity sensing, including operation range, sensitivity, selectivity, response, and recovery speed are discussed as milestones for true practical applications. Some of the most remarkable examples of supramolecular&#8208;based humidity sensors are presented, by describing the finest sensing materials, the operating principles, and sensing mechanisms, the latter being based on the structural or charge&#8208;transport changes triggered by the interaction of the supramolecular nanostructures with the ambient humidity. Finally, the future directions, challenges, and opportunities for the development of humidity sensors with performance beyond the state of the art are discussed.

         <title>The Challenge of Water Competition in Physical Adsorption of CO2 by Porous Solids for Carbon Capture Applications &#8211; A Short Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water is intrinsic to post&#8208;combustion flue streams. Its impact on chemisorptive carbon capture is well established. For physisorptive carbon capture, water is largely regarded as a nearly insurmountable hurdle for competitive carbon dioxide sorption. This perspective discusses, from chemical and engineering vantages, not just the opportunities to physisorb CO2 in wet gas but even suppress the sorption of water.








Abstract
With ever&#8208;increasing efforts to design sorbent materials to capture carbon dioxide from flue gas and air, this perspective article is provided based on nearly a decade of collaboration across science, engineering, and industry partners. A key point learned is that a holistic view of the carbon capture problem is critical. While researchers can be inclined to value their own fields and associated metrics, often, key parameters are those that enable synergy between materials and processes. While the role of water in the chemisorption of CO2 is well&#8208;studied, in this perspective, it is hoped to highlight the often&#8208;overlooked but critical role of water in assessing the potential of a physical adsorbent for CO2 capture. This is a challenge that requires interdisciplinarity. As such, this document is written for a general audience rather than experts in any specific discipline.

         <title>Hygroscopic&#8208;Microgels&#8208;Enabled Rapid Water Extraction from Arid Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hygroscopic microgels (HMGs), composed of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and salt, are developed for extracting moisture from arid air. The HMGs can realize rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics by short&#8208;distance diffusion in microgels and thermoresponsiveness of HPC, exhibiting 24&#8211;36 cycles of operation per day at low RH with potential water yield of 7.9&#8211;19.1 L kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sorbent&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) has emerged as a promising decentralized water&#8208;production technology to mitigate the freshwater crisis in arid areas. Hydrogels have been regarded as attractive sorbents due to their high water retention and tailorable polymer&#8211;water interactions. Yet, the kinetics of water sorption and desorption at low relative humidity (RH) shall be improved for their practical implementation. Here, hygroscopic microgels (HMGs) composed of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and hygroscopic salt are reported, which achieve a water uptake of ca. 0.5&#8211;0.8&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15&#8211;30% RH. HMGs enable rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics owing to the short&#8208;distance diffusion in the microgels and hydrophilicity&#8211;hydrophobicity switching of the thermoresponsive HPC. To validate the feasibility of HMGs for moisture extraction, a potential daily water collection of up to equivalent 7.9&#8211;19.1 L kg&#8722;1 at low RH is demonstrated, enabled by 24&#8211;36 operation cycles per day based on the material&#8208;level experiments. With renewable raw materials and superior performance, HMGs provide a sustainable approach for rapid moisture extraction in arid climates.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained Programmable Hygroelectronic Interfaces for Humidity&#8208;Regulated Hierarchical Information Encryption and Display</title>

The emerging moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG) technology opens up new possibilities for humidity&#8208;responsive materials, devices, and interdisciplinary opportunities in fields like information security.

Abstract
The emerging moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG) technology opens up new possibilities for humidity&#8208;responsive materials, devices, and interdisciplinary opportunities in fields like information security. However, such potential remains untapped. Here, an original MEG structure with a hygroionic energy&#8208;conversion route by selective coating of ionic hygroscopic hydrogels on a carbon black surface is reported. The hygroionic route features a process in which the scavenged energy is stored in the electrical double layers formed at the interfaces between the ionic hydrogel and the carbon nanoparticles. The resultant electrical field developed across the hydrogel&#8208;coated wet carbon and the rest of the dry carbon area is thus durably lasted. Based on this unique structure, hygroelectronic information interfaces (HEII) for humidity&#8208;regulated information encryption and display&#160;are put forward by devising hydrogel patterns on a carbon platform. Further by tuning the hygroscopicity of the ionic hydrogels and incorporating encoding methods (e.g., Morse code), it is demonstrated that the HEII platform is programmable to carry different information in certain humidity ranges. Unlike those conventional anti&#8208;counterfeiting methods that optically reveal the hidden information once the required stimulus is provided, the new HEII serves as a hierarchical solution for high&#8208;security encryption and display.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled Nonreciprocal Self&#8208;Oscillators for Fluidic Transportation and Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;sustained motions are widely reported in stimuli&#8208;responsive material systems. Here, a cilia&#8208;like&#160;soft actuator that can perform self&#8208;sustained oscillation under water, with programmable nonreciprocal strokes, is demonstrated. The self&#8208;oscillators can realize microfluidic pumping, translocation of a micro&#8208;object, and coupling between two non&#8208;equilibrium material pieces through fluidic interaction in an autonomous manner.








Abstract
Light&#8208;fueled self&#8208;oscillators based on soft actuating materials have triggered novel designs for small&#8208;scale robotic constructs that self&#8208;sustain their motion at non&#8208;equilibrium states and possess bioinspired autonomy and adaptive functions. However, the motions of most self&#8208;oscillators are reciprocal, which hinders their use in sophisticated biomimetic functions such as fluidic transportation. Here, an optically powered soft material strip that can perform nonreciprocal, cilia&#8208;like,&#160;self&#8208;sustained oscillation under water is reported. The actuator is made of planar&#8208;aligned liquid crystal elastomer responding to visible light. Two laser beams from orthogonal directions allow for piecewise control over the strip deformation, enabling two self&#8208;shadowing effects coupled in one single material to yield nonreciprocal strokes. The nonreciprocity, stroke pattern and handedness are connected to the fluidic pumping efficiency, which can be controlled by the excitation conditions. Autonomous microfluidic pumping in clockwise and anticlockwise directions, translocation of a micro&#8208;object by liquid propulsion, and coupling between two oscillating strips through liquid medium interaction are demonstrated. The results offer new concepts for non&#8208;equilibrium soft actuators that can perform bio&#8208;like functions under water.

         <title>CO2 Adsorption in a Robust Iron(III) Pyrazolate&#8208;Based MOF: Molecular&#8208;Level Details and Frameworks Dynamics From Powder X&#8208;ray Diffraction Adsorption Isotherms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth CO2 adsorption and structural study enabled by a multi&#8208;technique approach on the robust pyrazolate&#8208;based MOF Fe2(BDP)3 shows that, with a proper treatment of HR&#8208;PXRD data at variable gas pressure and temperature, it is possible go beyond the classical crystallographic description of host&#8211;guest interactions, retrieving thermodynamic information of the adsorption process.








Abstract
Understanding adsorption processes at the molecular level, with multi&#8208;technique approaches, is nowadays at the frontier of porous materials research. In this work it is shown that with a proper data treatment, in situ high&#8208;resolution powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (HR&#8208;PXRD) at variable temperature and gas pressure can reveal atomic details of the accommodation sites, the framework dynamics as well as thermodynamic information (isosteric heat of adsorption) of the CO2 adsorption process in the robust iron(III) pyrazolate&#8208;based MOF Fe2(BDP)3 [H2BDP = 1,4&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene]. Highly reliable &#8220;HR&#8208;PXRD adsorption isotherms&#8221; can be constructed from occupancy values of CO2 molecules. The &#8220;HR&#8208;PXRD adsorption isotherms&#8221; accurately match the results of conventional static and dynamic gas sorption experiments and Monte Carlo simulations.

     alt="CO2 Adsorption in a Robust Iron(III) Pyrazolate-Based MOF: Molecular-Level Details and Frameworks Dynamics From Powder X-ray Diffraction Adsorption Isotherms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An in-depth CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and structural study enabled by a multi-technique approach on the robust pyrazolate-based MOF Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BDP)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shows that, with a proper treatment of HR-PXRD data at variable gas pressure and temperature, it is possible go beyond the classical crystallographic description of host&#8211;guest interactions, retrieving thermodynamic information of the adsorption process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding adsorption processes at the molecular level, with multi-technique approaches, is nowadays at the frontier of porous materials research. In this work it is shown that with a proper data treatment, in situ high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction (HR-PXRD) at variable temperature and gas pressure can reveal atomic details of the accommodation sites, the framework dynamics as well as thermodynamic information (isosteric heat of adsorption) of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption process in the robust iron(III) pyrazolate-based MOF Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(BDP)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BDP = 1,4-bis(1&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-pyrazol-4-yl)benzene]. Highly reliable &#8220;HR-PXRD adsorption isotherms&#8221; can be constructed from occupancy values of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. The &#8220;HR-PXRD adsorption isotherms&#8221; accurately match the results of conventional static and dynamic gas sorption experiments and Monte Carlo simulations. These results are indicative of the impact of the molecular-level behavior on the bulk properties of the system under study and of the potential of the presented multi-technique approach to understand adsorption processes in metal&#8211;organic frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Morphology Tuning via Linker Modulation: Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Nanostructures with Exceptional Chemical Stability for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;rationally designed synthetic route for synthesizing pure imidazole&#8208;linked porous organic polymers&#160;(POPs) by modulating the liker geometry to induce rigidity into the system&#160;is&#160;presented. Directing the reaction solely toward imidazole linkage formation instead of the imine&#8208;imidazole mixture tunes the random morphology to hollow&#8208;spheres, improving porosity&#160;and thermal and chemical stability. These POPs show excellent performance as metal&#8208;free bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts toward water splitting with long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
The development of synthetic routes for the formation of robust porous organic polymers (POPs) with well&#8208;defined nanoscale morphology is fundamentally significant for their practical applications. The thermodynamic characteristics that arise from reversible covalent bonding impart intrinsic chemical instability in the polymers, thereby impeding their overall potential. Herein, a unique strategy is reported to overcome the stability issue by designing robust imidazole&#8208;linked POPs via tandem reversible/irreversible bond formation. Incorporating inherent rigidity into the secondary building units leads to robust microporous polymeric nanostructures with hollow&#8208;spherical morphologies. An in&#8208;depth analysis by extensive solid&#8208;state NMR (1D and 2D) study on 1H, 13C, and 14N nuclei elucidates the bonding and reveals the high purity of the newly designed imidazole&#8208;based POPs. The nitrogen&#8208;rich polymeric nanostructures are further used as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for water splitting. In particular, the rigid POPs show excellent catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with long&#8208;term durability. Among them, the most efficient OER electrocatalyst (TAT&#8208;TFBE) requires 314&#160;mV of overpotential to drive 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density, demonstrating its superiority over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts (RuO2 and IrO2).

         <title>Confined Water Cluster Formation in Water Harvesting by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H versus CAU&#8208;10&#8208;CH3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H, an energetically favorable water cluster can form in the hydrophobic pore, enabling water harvesting in the desert, while for CAU&#8208;10&#8208;CH3, steric hindrance prevents this. The materials&#8217; structural deformation and water ordering during adsorption are unraveled with in situ sum&#8208;frequency generation and XRD, and molecular simulations. Via water adsorption isotherms of a series of MOFs, the conclusions can be generalized.








Abstract
Several metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) excel in harvesting water from the air or as heat pumps as they show a steep increase in water uptake at 10&#8211;30 % relative humidity (RH%). A precise understanding of which structural characteristics govern such behavior is lacking. Herein, CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H and CAU&#8208;10&#8208;CH3 are studied with &#63743;H, &#63743;CH3 corresponding to the functions grafted to the organic linker. CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H shows a steep water uptake &#8776;18 RH% of interest for water harvesting, yet the subtle replacement of &#63743;H by &#63743;CH3 in the organic linker drastically changes the water adsorption behavior to less steep water uptake at much higher humidity values. The materials&#8217; structural deformation and water ordering during adsorption with in situ sum&#8208;frequency generation, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, and molecular simulations are unraveled. In CAU&#8208;10&#8208;H, an energetically favorable water cluster is formed in the hydrophobic pore, tethered via H&#8208;bonds to the framework &#956;&#63743;OH groups, while for CAU&#8208;10&#8208;CH3, such a favorable cluster cannot form. By relating the findings to the features of water adsorption isotherms of a series of MOFs,&#160;it is concluded that favorable water adsorption occurs when sites of intermediate hydrophilicity are present in a hydrophobic structure, and the formation of energetically favorable water clusters is possible.

         <title>Influence of Water Content on Speciation and Phase Formation in Zr&#8211;Porphyrin&#8208;Based MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work evaluates the complexities of synthesizing porphyrinic Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), specifically disordered PCN&#8208;224 (dPCN&#8208;224). It is shown that hydrolysis of ZrCl4&#160;or the addition of water is crucial for the formation of the inorganic building unit, and hence, the MOF. In addition, MOF's formation pathway is characterized, revealing that dPCN&#8208;224&#160;forms via at least one intermediate.








Abstract
Controlled synthesis of phase&#8208;pure metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential for their application in technological areas such as catalysis or gas sorption. Yet, knowledge of their phase formation and growth remain rather limited, particularly with respect to species such as water whose vital role in MOF synthesis is often neglected. As a consequence, synthetic protocols often lack reproducibility when multiple MOFs can form from the same metal source and linker, and phase mixtures are obtained with little or no control over their composition. In this work, the role of water in the formation of the Zr&#8211;porphyrin MOF disordered PCN&#8208;224 (dPCN&#8208;224) is investigated. Through X&#8208;ray total scattering and scanning electron microscopy, it is observed that dPCN&#8208;224&#160;forms via a metal&#8211;organic intermediate that consists of Zr6O4(OH)4&#160;clusters linked by tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxy&#8208;phenyl)porphyrin molecules. Importantly, water is not only essential to the formation of Zr6O4(OH)4&#160;clusters, but it also plays a primary role in dictating the formation kinetics of dPCN&#8208;224. This multidisciplinary approach to studying the speciation of dPCN&#8208;224&#160;provides a blueprint for how Zr&#8208;MOF synthesis protocols can be assessed and their reproducibility increased, and highlights the importance of understanding the role of water as a decisive component in Zr&#8208;MOF formation.

         <title>When Polymorphism in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enables Water Sorption Profile Tunability for Enhancing Heat Allocation and Water Harvesting Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cis&#8208; or trans&#8208;&#181;&#8208;OH&#8208;connectivity in the corner&#8208;sharing chains of AlO6 octahedra in water stable microporous aluminum&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks leads to two polymorphs, which solely differ in the straight or helical&#8208;shape of the chains.

The development of thermally driven water&#8208;sorption&#8208;based technologies relies on high&#8208;performing water vapor adsorbents. Here, polymorphism in Al&#8211;metal&#8211;organic frameworks is disclosed as a new strategy to tune the hydrophilicity of MOFs. This involves the formation of MOFs built from chains of either trans&#8208; or cis&#8208; &#181;&#8208;OH&#8208;connected corner&#8208;sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra. Specifically, [Al(OH)(muc)] or MIP&#8208;211, is made of trans, trans&#8208;muconate linkers, and cis&#8208;&#181;&#8208;OH&#8208;connected corner&#8208;sharing AlO4(OH)2 octahedra giving a 3D network with sinusoidal channels. The polymorph MIL&#8208;53&#8208;muc has a tiny change in the chain structure that results in a shift of the step position of the water isotherm from P/P0&#160;&#8776; 0.5 in MIL&#8208;53&#8208;muc, to P/P0&#160;&#8776; 0.3 in MIP&#8208;211. Solid&#8208;state NMR and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo reveal that the adsorption occurs initially between two hydroxyl groups of the chains, favored by the cis&#8208;positioning in MIP&#8208;211, resulting in a more hydrophilic behavior. Finally, theoretical evaluations show that MIP&#8208;211 would allow achieving a coefficient of performance for cooling (COPc) of 0.63 with an ultralow driving temperature of 60&#160;&#176;C, outperforming benchmark sorbents for small temperature lifts. Combined with its high stability, easy regeneration, huge water uptake capacity, green synthesis, MIP&#8208;211 is among the best adsorbents for adsorption&#8208;driven air conditioning and water harvesting from the air.

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- or &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-&#181;-OH-connectivity in the corner-sharing chains of AlO6 octahedra in water stable microporous aluminum-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks leads to two polymorphs, which solely differ in the straight or helical-shape of the chains. This polymorphism is associated with a drastic change in their water sorption behavior in a view of tuning the heat allocation and water harvesting performances.

         <title>Extreme Water Uptake of Hygroscopic Hydrogels through Maximized Swelling&#8208;Induced Salt Loading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The swelling dynamics of hydrogels in aqueous lithium chloride solutions are studied and unprecedented salt loadings and water vapor uptakes reaching 1.79 and 3.86&#160;gg&#8722;1 are acheived at relative humidity of 30% and 70%, respectively. This exceeds previously reported uptakes of hydrogels by 15%, while also avoiding the leakage problems common with salts.








Abstract
Hygroscopic hydrogels are emerging as scalable and low&#8208;cost sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting, dehumidification, passive cooling, and thermal energy storage. However, devices using these materials still exhibit insufficient performance, partly due to the limited water vapor uptake of the hydrogels. Here, the swelling dynamics of hydrogels in aqueous lithiumchloride solutions, the implications on hydrogel salt loading, and the resulting vapor uptake of the synthesized hydrogel&#8211;salt composites are characterized. By tuning the salt concentration of the swelling solutions and the cross&#8208;linking properties of the gels, hygroscopic hydrogels with extremely high salt loadings are synthesized, which enable unprecedented water uptakes of 1.79 and 3.86&#160;gg&#8722;1 at relative humidity (RH) of 30% and 70%, respectively. At 30% RH, this exceeds previously reported water uptakes of metal&#8211;organic frameworks by over 100% and of hydrogels by 15%, bringing the uptake within 93% of the fundamental limit of hygroscopic salts while avoiding leakage problems common in salt solutions. By modeling the salt&#8208;vapor equilibria, the maximum leakage&#8208;free RH is elucidated as a function of hydrogel uptake and swelling ratio. These insights guide the design of hydrogels with exceptional hygroscopicity that enable sorption&#8208;based devices to tackle water scarcity and the global energy crisis.

         <title>Generic Air&#8208;Gen Effect in Nanoporous Materials for Sustainable Energy Harvesting from Air Humidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic effect in nanoporous thin&#8208;film materials for continuous energy harvesting from air humidity is reported. The charging process results from the dynamic air&#8208;water exchange at the porous interface and can be sustained over time.








Abstract
Air humidity is a vast, sustainable reservoir of energy that, unlike solar and wind, is continuously available. However, previously described technologies for harvesting energy from air humidity are either not continuous or require unique material synthesis or processing, which has stymied scalability and broad deployment. Here, a generic effect for continuous energy harvesting from air humidity is reported, which can be applied to a broad range of inorganic, organic, and biological materials. The common feature of these materials is that they are engineered with appropriate nanopores to allow air water to pass through and undergo dynamic adsorption&#8211;desorption exchange at the porous interface, resulting in surface charging. The top exposed interface experiences this dynamic interaction more than the bottom sealed interface in a thin&#8208;film device structure, yielding a spontaneous and sustained charging gradient for continuous electric output. Analyses of material properties and electric outputs lead to a &#8220;leaky capacitor&#8221; model that can describe how electricity is harvested and predict current behaviors consistent with experiments. Predictions from the model guide the fabrication of devices made from heterogeneous junctions of different materials to further expand the device category. The work opens a wide door for the broad exploration of sustainable electricity from air.

Porphyrin&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks
A major challenge in studying Zr&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is the poor reproducibility of reported syntheses. Article number 2210613 by Bettina V. Lotsch and co&#8208;workers investigates the formation of Zr&#8208;MOF particles step&#8208;by&#8208;step to understand and ultimately control the critical stages during nucleation and growth. Notably, water is essential to the formation of Zr&#8208;oxo clusters and influences both the formation kinetics and phase purity of the product.

Self&#8208;Sustained Programmable Hygroelectronic Interfaces
In article number 2208081, Yaoxin Zhang, John Wang, Swee Ching Tan, and co&#8208;workers report an intelligent and programmable moisture&#8208;driven energy generating platform for humidity&#8208;regulated information encryption and display. This is enabled by asymmetric coating of ionic hygroscopic hydrogels on a carbon black nano&#8208;surface. Further tuning the hydrogel's deliquescence to relative humidity, the device is able to conceal and reveal information hierarchically in various relative humidity ranges.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Networks Meet Water: It's Complicated!</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft robotics is a field of research that solves the challenges facing traditional robotics through the use of compliant materials such as liquid crystal networks (LCNs). However, LCNs face limitations when interacting with water. The relationship between LCNs and water is examined, the existing body of literature on LCNs as aquatic soft robots is discussed, and possible paths forward are discussed.








Abstract
Soft robots are composed of compliant materials that facilitate high degrees of freedom, shape&#8208;change adaptability, and safer interaction with humans. An attractive choice of material for soft robotics is crosslinked networks of liquid crystal polymers (LCNs), as they are responsive to a wide variety of external stimuli and capable of undergoing fast, programmable, complex shape morphing, which allows for their use in a wide range of soft robotic applications. However, unlike hydrogels, another popular material in soft robotics, LCNs have limited applicability in flooded or aquatic environments. This can be attributed not only to the poor efficiency of common LCN actuation methods underwater but also to the complicated relationship between LCNs and water. In this review, the relationship between water and LCNs is elaborated and the existing body of literature is surveyed where LCNs, both hygroscopic and non&#8208;hygroscopic, are utilized in aquatic soft robotic applications. Then the challenges LCNs face in widespread adaptation to aquatic soft robotic applications are discussed and, finally, possible paths forward for their successful use in aquatic environments are envisaged.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Water Harvesting and Concurrent Carbon Capture: A Review for Hygroscopic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hygroscopic materials are a solution to global water shortage. Following the structure&#8211;performance relationship, their current performance and future challenges are reviewed. The similarity in working conditions makes water harvesting and concurrent carbon capture practical. An emphasis is laid on metal&#8211;organic frameworks for their excellent performance in water and CO2 adsorption and representative role of micro&#8208; and mesoporous materials.








Abstract
As water scarcity becomes a pending global issue, hygroscopic materials prove a significant solution. Thus, there is a good cause following the structure&#8211;performance relationship to review the recent development of hygroscopic materials&#160;and provide inspirational insight into&#160;creative materials. Herein, traditional hygroscopic materials, crystalline frameworks,&#160;polymers, and composite materials are reviewed. The similarity in working conditions of water harvesting and carbon capture makes simultaneously addressing water shortages and reduction of greenhouse effects possible. Concurrent water harvesting and carbon capture is&#160;likely to become a future challenge. Therefore, an emphasis is laid on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for their excellent performance in water and CO2&#160;adsorption, and representative role of micro&#8208; and mesoporous materials. Herein, the water adsorption mechanisms of MOFs are summarized, followed by a review of MOF's water stability, with a highlight on the emerging machine learning (ML) technique to predict MOF water stability and water uptake. Recent advances in the mechanistic elaboration of moisture's effects on CO2&#160;adsorption are reviewed.&#160;This review summarizes recent advances in water&#8211;harvesting porous materials with special attention on MOFs and expects to direct researchers&#8217; attention into the topic of concurrent water harvesting and carbon capture as a future challenge.

         <title>Hierarchical Engineering of Sorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential applications for atmospheric water harvesting are tantalizing. This review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date summary of the most recent developments and challenges for developing practical sorption&#8208;based atmospheric&#8208;water harvesters. The sorbent design at the nanoscale, condensation enhancement at the mesoscale, device development at the macroscale, and water scarcity assessments at the global scale are discussed in detail.








Abstract
Harvesting water from air in sorption&#8208;based devices is a promising solution to decentralized water production, aiming for providing potable water anywhere, anytime.

&lt;p&gt;Harvesting water from air in sorption-based devices is a promising solution to decentralized water production, aiming for providing potable water anywhere, anytime. This technology involves a series of coupled processes occurring at distinct length scales, ranging from nanometer to meter and even larger, including water sorption/desorption at the nanoscale, condensation at the mesoscale, device development at the macroscale and water scarcity assessment at the global scale. Comprehensive understanding and bespoke designs at every scale are thus needed to improve the water-harvesting performance. For this purpose, a brief introduction of the global water crisis and its key characteristics is provided to clarify the impact potential and design criteria of water harvesters. Next the latest molecular-level optimizations of sorbents for efficient moisture capture and release are discussed. Then, novel microstructuring of surfaces to enhance dropwise condensation, which is favorable for atmospheric water generation, is shown. After that, system-level optimizations of sorbent-assisted water harvesters to achieve high-yield, energy-efficient, and low-cost water harvesting are highlighted.

         <title>Advanced Material Design and Engineering for Water&#8208;Based Evaporative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evaporation&#8208;induced cooling effect is gaining significant interest due to its low carbon footprint and low or even zero electricity consumption. This review systematically introduces the fundamentals and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material design and engineering in water&#8208;based evaporative cooling technologies, and critically assess the challenges and offers outlooks on future development of this emerging field.








Abstract
Water&#8208;based evaporative cooling is emerging as a promising technology to provide sustainable and low&#8208;cost cold to alleviate the rising global cooling demand. Given the significant and fast progress made in recent years, this review aims to provide a timely overview on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material design and engineering in water&#8208;based evaporative cooling. The fundamental mechanisms and major components of three water&#8208;based evaporative cooling processes are introduced, including direct evaporative cooling, cyclic sorption&#8208;driven liquid water evaporative cooling (CSD&#8208;LWEC), and atmospheric water harvesting&#8208;based evaporative cooling (AWH&#8208;EC). The distinctive requirements on the sorbent materials in CSD&#8208;LWEC and AWH&#8208;EC are highlighted, which helps synthesize the literature information on the advanced material design and engineering for the purpose of improving cooling performance. The challenges and future outlooks on further improving the water&#8208;based evaporative cooling performance are also provided.

To facilitate the development of moisture&#8208;responsive textiles with real&#8208;life applications, the mechanisms, research status, existing engineering and scientific limitations, and future directions of moisture&#8208;responsive textiles from flap opening and closing, yarn/fiber deformation, and sweat&#8208;evaporation regulation are systematically summarized in three categories, respectively.








Abstract
Personal thermal management can effectively manage the skin microenvironment, improve human comfort, and reduce energy consumption. In personal thermal&#8208;management technology, owing to the high latent heat of water evaporation in wet&#8208;response textiles, heat&#8208; and moisture&#8208;transfer coexist and interact with each other. In the last few years, with rapid advances in materials science and innovative polymers, humidity&#8208;sensitive textiles have been developed for personal thermal management. However, a large gap exists between the conceptual laboratory&#8208;scale design and actual textile. Here, moisture&#8208;responsive textiles based on flap opening and closing, those based on yarn/fiber deformation, and sweat&#8208;evaporation regulation based on textile design for personal thermoregulation are reviewed, and the corresponding mechanisms and research progress are discussed. Finally, the existing engineering and scientific limitations and future developments are considered to resolve the existing issues and accelerate the practical application of moisture&#8208;responsive textiles and related technologies.

         <title>Harvesting Energy from Atmospheric Water: Grand Challenges in Continuous Electricity Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atmospheric water is ubiquitous on Earth and extensively participates in the natural water cycle through evaporation and condensation. This process involves tremendous energy exchange with the environment, which can be harnessed by moisture energy harvesting devices. In this review, this emerging technology is summarized, especially focusing on continuous power generation, from key aspects of mechanisms, materials, and system designs.








Abstract
Atmospheric water is ubiquitous on earth and extensively participates in the natural water cycle through evaporation and condensation. This process involves tremendous energy exchange with the environment, but very little of the energy has so far been harnessed. The recently emerged hydrovoltaic technology, especially moisture&#8208;induced electricity, shows great potential in harvesting energy from atmospheric water and gives birth to moisture energy harvesting devices. The device performance, especially the long&#8208;term operational capacity, has been significantly enhanced over the past few years. Further development; however, requires in&#8208;depth understanding of mechanisms, innovative materials, and ingenious system designs. In this review, beginning with describing the basic properties of water, the key aspects of the water&#8211;hygroscopic material interactions and mechanisms of power generation are discussed. The current material systems and advances in promising material development are then summarized. Aiming at the chief bottlenecks of limited operational time, advanced system designs that are helpful to improve device performance are listed. Especially, the synergistic effect of moisture adsorption and water evaporation on material and system levels to accomplish sustained electricity generation is discussed. Last, the remaining challenges are analyzed and future directions for developing this promising technology are suggested.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Resilient Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite solar cells have attracted significant attention for commercialization. However, their intrinsic instabilities due to their high susceptibility to moisture cause irreversible perovskite degradation and device failures must be addressed. This article discusses extensively all available strategies to make perovskite solar cells, before final encapsulation, as moisture resilient as possible.








Abstract
With the rapid rise in device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), overcoming instabilities under outdoor operating conditions has become the most crucial obstacle toward their commercialization. Among stressors such as light, heat, voltage bias, and moisture, the latter is arguably the most critical, as it can decompose metal&#8208;halide perovskite (MHP) photoactive absorbers instantly through its hygroscopic components (organic cations and metal halides). In addition, most charge transport layers (CTLs) commonly employed in PSCs also degrade in the presence of water. Furthermore, photovoltaic module fabrication encompasses several steps, such as laser processing, subcell interconnection, and encapsulation, during which the device layers are exposed to the ambient atmosphere. Therefore, as a first step toward long&#8208;term stable perovskite photovoltaics, it is vital to engineer device materials toward maximizing moisture resilience, which can be accomplished by passivating the bulk of the MHP film, introducing passivation interlayers at the top contact, exploiting hydrophobic CTLs, and encapsulating finished devices with hydrophobic barrier layers, without jeopardizing device performance.

     alt="Moisture-Resilient Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Stability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells have attracted significant attention for commercialization. However, their intrinsic instabilities due to their high susceptibility to moisture cause irreversible perovskite degradation and device failures must be addressed. This article discusses extensively all available strategies to make perovskite solar cells, before final encapsulation, as moisture resilient as possible.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the rapid rise in device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), overcoming instabilities under outdoor operating conditions has become the most crucial obstacle toward their commercialization. Among stressors such as light, heat, voltage bias, and moisture, the latter is arguably the most critical, as it can decompose metal-halide perovskite (MHP) photoactive absorbers instantly through its hygroscopic components (organic cations and metal halides). In addition, most charge transport layers (CTLs) commonly employed in PSCs also degrade in the presence of water. Furthermore, photovoltaic module fabrication encompasses several steps, such as laser processing, subcell interconnection, and encapsulation, during which the device layers are exposed to the ambient atmosphere. Therefore, as a first step toward long-term stable perovskite photovoltaics, it is vital to engineer device materials toward maximizing moisture resilience, which can be accomplished by passivating the bulk of the MHP film, introducing passivation interlayers at the top contact, exploiting hydrophobic CTLs, and encapsulating finished devices with hydrophobic barrier layers, without jeopardizing device performance. Here, existing strategies for enhancing the performance stability of PSCs are reviewed and pathways toward moisture-resilient commercial perovskite devices are formulated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrovoltaic Electricity Generator with Hygroscopic Materials: A Review and New Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 12, March 21, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the design and applications of hydrovoltaic electricity generators through an in&#8208;depth discussion of published case studies. Upon a concise introduction of their operating principles, strategic considerations for the development of high&#8208;performance HEGs, including the choice of hydrovoltaic active materials, hygroscopic materials, electrode materials, and device structures are provided.








Abstract
The global energy crisis caused by the overconsumption of nonrenewable fuels has prompted researchers to develop alternative strategies for producing electrical energy. In this review, a fascinating strategy that simply utilizes water, an abundant natural substance throughout the globe and even in air as moisture, as a power source is introduced. The concept of the hydrovoltaic electricity generator (HEG) proposed herein involves generating an electrical potential gradient by exposing the two ends of the HEG device to dissimilar physicochemical environments, which leads to the production of an electrical current through the active material. HEGs, with a large variety of viable active materials, have much potential for expansion toward diverse applications including permanent and/or emergency power sources. In this review, representative HEGs that generate electricity by the mechanisms of diffusion, streaming, and capacitance as case studies for building a fundamental understanding of the electricity generation process are discussed. In particular, by comparing the use and absence of hygroscopic materials, HEG mechanism studies to establish active material design principles are meticulously elucidated. The review with future perspectives on electrode design using conducting nanomaterials, considerations for high performance device construction, and potential impacts of the HEG technology in improving the livelihoods are reviewed.

         <title>The Case for a Defect Genome Initiative</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Point defects in crystalline solids are likened to new &#8220;elements&#8221; beyond the periodic table. In the spirit of the Material Genome Initiative, a Defect Genome Initiative (DGI) is proposed to fast&#8208;track defect discoveries for energy, quantum, and other applications. This initiative focuses on open defect platforms, data&#8208;driven defect design, and experimental methods, hoping to spur a new community&#8208;wide interest.








Abstract
The Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) has streamlined the materials discovery effort by leveraging generic traits of materials, with focus largely on perfect solids. Defects such as impurities and perturbations, however, drive many attractive functional properties of materials. The rich tapestry of charge, spin, and bonding states hosted by defects are not accessible to elements and perfect crystals, and defects can thus be viewed as another class of &#8220;elements&#8221; that lie beyond the periodic table. Accordingly, a Defect Genome Initiative (DGI) to accelerate functional defect discovery for energy, quantum information, and other applications is proposed. First, major advances made under the MGI are highlighted, followed by a delineation of pathways for accelerating the discovery and design of functional defects under the DGI. Near&#8208;term goals for the DGI are suggested. The construction of open defect platforms and design of data&#8208;driven functional defects, along with approaches for fabrication and characterization of defects, are discussed. The associated challenges and opportunities are considered and recent advances towards controlled introduction of functional defects at the atomic scale are reviewed. It is hoped this perspective will spur a community&#8208;wide interest in undertaking a DGI effort in recognition of the importance of defects in enabling unique functionalities in materials.

         <title>Emerging Amorphous to Crystalline Conversion Chemistry in Ca&#8208;Doped VO2 Cathodes for High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Term Wearable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freestanding amorphous Ca&#8208;doped V2O5 (a&#8208;Ca&#8208;V2O5) is successfully fabricated via an in situ electrochemical oxidation strategy as a novel cathode material for flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (FAZIBs). Benefiting from the unique amorphous structure and high conductivity, the as&#8208;assembled FAZIBs exhibit superior electrochemical performance accompanied by amorphous&#8211;crystalline reversible conversion chemistry during the charge/discharge process.








Abstract
Amorphous transition metal oxides have attracted significant attention in energy storage devices owing to their potentially desirable electrochemical properties caused by abundant unsaturated dangling bonds. However, the amorphization further amplifies the shortcoming of the poor intrinsic electronic conductivity of the metal oxides, resulting in unsatisfying rate capability and power density. Herein, freestanding amorphous Ca&#8208;doped V2O5 (a&#8208;Ca&#8208;V2O5) cathodes are successfully prepared via in situ electrochemical oxidation of Ca&#8208;doped VO2 nanoarrays for wearable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The doping of Ca and construction of freestanding structure effectively uncover the potential of amorphous V2O5, which can make full use of the abundant active sites for high volumetric capacity and simultaneously achieve fast reaction kinetics for excellent rate performance. More importantly, the introduction of Ca can notably reduce the formation energy of VO2 according to theoretical calculation results and realizes amorphous to crystalline reversible conversion chemistry in the charge/discharge procedure, thereby facilitating the reversible capacity of the newly developed a&#8208;Ca&#8208;V2O5. This work provides an innovative design strategy to construct high&#8208;rate capacity amorphous metal oxides as freestanding electrodes for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safe wearable energy&#8208;storage technology.

Gold nanostars&#8208;conjugated mesenchymal stem cells, functionalized with triamcinolone, serve as a potent corticosteroids. Their therapeutic effectiveness is enhanced by near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, generating localized heat. Thermo&#8208;responsive T lymphocytes exhibit diminished activity, attribute to interleukin 22 receptor inactivation under NIR laser exposure. This multifaceted approach adds therapeutic modulation in the treatment of severe arthritis.








Abstract
Current clinical therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of osteo&#8208; and rheumatoid&#8208;arthritis is obviously limited. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are considered as a source of promising regenerative therapy, un&#8208;modified or genetically engineered MSCs injected in vivo restrict their clinical utility because of the low drug efficacy and unpredicted side effect, respectively. Herein, a strategy to enhance the migration efficacy of MSCs to inflamed joints via an inflammation&#8208;mediated education process is demonstrated. To reinforce the limited anti&#8208;inflammatory activity of MSCs, gold nanostar loaded with triamcinolone is conjugated to MSC. Furthermore, near&#8208;infrared laser&#8208;assisted photothermal therapy (PTT) induced by gold nanostar significantly elevates the anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy of the developed drugs, even in advanced stage arthritis model. An immunological regulation mechanism study of PTT is first suggested in this study; the expression of the interleukin 22 receptor, implicated in the pathogenesis of arthritis, is downregulated in T lymphocytes by PTT, and Th17 differentiation from na&#239;ve CD4 T cell is inhibited. Collectively, inflammation&#8208;targeting MSCs conjugated with triamcinolone&#8208;loaded gold nanostar (Edu&#8208;MSCs&#8208;AuS&#8208;TA) promote the repolarization of macrophages and decrease neutrophil recruitment in joints. In addition, Edu&#8208;MSCs&#8208;AuS&#8208;TA significantly alleviate arthritis&#8208;associated pain, improve general locomotor activity, and more importantly, induce cartilage regeneration even for severe stages of arthritis model.

         <title>A Sodiophilic Amyloid Fibril Modified Separator for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel composite separator is fabricated through the vacuum filtration technique, which incorporates a unique amyloid fibril onto a glass&#8208;fiber separator. The composite separator demonstrates remarkable efficacy in suppressing the growth of sodium dendrites due to the formation of a stable solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase film enriched with nitride, which showcases its potential as a promising solution in sodium&#8208;battery technology.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) batteries are being considered as prospective candidates for the next generation of secondary batteries in contrast to lithium&#8208;based batteries, due to their high raw&#8208;material abundance, low cost, and sustainability. However, the unfavorable growth of Na&#8208;metal deposition and severe interfacial reactions have prevented their large&#8208;scale applications. Here, a vacuum filtration strategy, through amyloid&#8208;fibril&#8208;modified glass&#8208;fiber separators, is proposed to address these issues. The modified symmetric cell can be cycled for 1800&#160;h, surpassing the performance of previously reported Na&#8208;based electrodes under an ester&#8208;based electrolyte. Moreover, the Na/Na3V2(PO4)3 full cell with a sodiophilic amyloid&#8208;fibril&#8208;modified separator exhibits a capacity retention of 87.13% even after 1000 cycles. Both the experimental and the theoretical results show that the sodiophilic amyloid fibril homogenizes the electric field and Na&#8208;ion concentration, fundamentally inhibiting dendrite formation. Simultaneously, the glutamine amino acids in the amyloid fibril have the highest adsorption energy for Na, resulting in the formation of a stable Na3N&#8208; and NaNxOy&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interface film on the anode during cycling. This work provides not only a possible pathway to solve the dendrite problem in metal batteries using environmentally friendly biomacromolecular materials, but also a new direction for expanding biomaterial applications.

         <title>Super&#8208;Structured Wet&#8208;Adhesive Hydrogel with Ultralow Swelling, Ultrahigh Burst Pressure Tolerance, and Anti&#8208;Postoperative Adhesion Properties for Tissue Adhesion</title>

Super&#8208;structured wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogel designed via facile moisture&#8208;induced phase separation&#8208;solvent exchange and in situ photocuring procedures integrates ultralow swelling, ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance, and anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion properties, showing an appealing application prospect for tissue repair.








Abstract
Wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogels have been developed as an attractive strategy for tissue repair. However, achieving simultaneously low swelling and high burst pressure tolerance of wet&#8208;adhesive hydrogels is crucial for in vivo application which remains challenges. Herein, a novel super&#8208;structured porous hydrogel (denoted as PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+) is designed via facile moisture&#8208;induced phase separation&#8208;solvent exchange process for obtaining porous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel as dissipative layer and in situ photocuring technology for entangling quaternary ammonium&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid)&#8208;based wet&#8208;adhesive layer (PAAc&#8208;N+) with the porous surface of PVA layer. Benefitting from the ionic crosslinking between quaternary ammonium ions and carboxylate ions in PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer as well as the high crystallinity induced by abundant hydrogen bonds of PVA layer, the hydrogel has unique ultralow swelling property (0.29) without sacrificing adhesion strength (63.1&#160;kPa). The porous structure of PVA facilitates the mechanical interlock at the interface between PAAc&#8208;N+ wet&#8208;adhesive layer and tough PVA dissipative layer, leading to the ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance up to 493&#160;mm Hg and effective repair for porcine heart rupture; the PVA layer surface of PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+ hydrogel can prevent postoperative adhesion. By integrating ultralow swelling, ultrahigh burst pressure tolerance, and anti&#8208;postoperative adhesion properties, PVA/PAAc&#8208;N+ hydrogel shows an appealing application prospect for tissue repair.

         <title>Single Atom Iridium Decorated Nickel Alloys Supported on Segregated MoO2 for Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>

In this study, conductive oxide supported Ir1Ni single atom alloys bifunctional electrocatalysts via surface segregation coupled with galvanic replacement reaction strategy, weakening the hydrogen binding energy by Ir&#8208;Ni electronic interaction, and decoration of Ir single atom accelerates surface reconstruction of Ni species to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction is successfully designed.








Abstract
Hetero&#8208;interface engineering has been widely employed to develop supported multicomponent catalysts for water electrolysis, but it still remains a substantial challenge for supported single atom alloys. Herein a conductive oxide MoO2 supported Ir1Ni single atom alloys (Ir1Ni@MoO2 SAAs) bifunctional electrocatalysts through surface segregation coupled with galvanic replacement reaction, where the Ir atoms are atomically anchored onto the surface of Ni nanoclusters via the Ir&#8208;Ni coordination accompanied with electron transfer from Ni to Ir is reported. Benefiting from the unique structure, the Ir1Ni@MoO2 SAAs not only exhibit low overpotential of 48.6&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 19&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 for hydrogen evolution reaction, but also show highly efficient alkaline water oxidation with overpotential of 280&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Their overall water electrolysis exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.52&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and excellent durability. Experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ir&#8208;Ni interface effectively weakens hydrogen binding energy, and decoration of the Ir single atoms boost surface reconstruction of Ni species to enhance the coverage of intermediates (OH*) and switch the potential&#8208;determining step. It is suggested that this approach opens up a promising avenue to design efficient and durable precious metal bifunctional electrocatalysts.

The photoisomerization of atom transfer radical polymerization&#8208;grafted azobenzene enables spatial and temporal control, leveraging digital light processing systems to simultaneously regulate and release integrated cyclodextrin&#8208;bearing drugs in numerous droplets with suspended or adhered cells, undisturbed and programmable.








Abstract
Simultaneously adding multiple drugs and other chemical reagents to individual droplets at specific time points presents a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with tiny droplets in high&#8208;throughput screening applications. In this study, a micropatterned polymer chip is developed as a miniaturized platform for light&#8208;induced programmable drug addition in cell&#8208;based screening. This chip incorporates a porous superhydrophobic polymer film with atom transfer radical polymerization reactivity, facilitating the efficient grafting of azobenzene methacrylate, a photoconformationally changeable group, onto the hydrophilic regions of polymer matrix at targeted locations and with precise densities. By employing light irradiation, the cyclodextrin&#8208;azobenzene host&#8211;guest complexes formed on the polymer chip can switch from an &#8220;associated&#8221; to a &#8220;dissociated&#8221; state, granting precise photochemical control over the supramolecular coding system and its surface patterning ability. Significantly, the exceptional spatial and temporal control offered by these chemical transitions empowers to utilize digital light processing systems for simultaneous regulation and release of cyclodextrin&#8208;bearing drugs across numerous droplets containing suspended or adhered cells. This approach minimizes mechanical disruption while achieving precise control over the timing of addition, dosage, and integration varieties of released drugs in high&#8208;throughput screening, all programmable to meet specific requirements.

         <title>3D&#8208;Architected Alkaline&#8208;Earth Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A newly developed approach enabling custom&#8208;made photoresists suited for additive manufacturing using two&#8208;photon lithography is introduced. The approach permits the production of 3D alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite (BaZrO3, CaZrO3, and SrZrO3) microarchitectures with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. The optical properties of such perovskite architectures are investigated using cathodoluminescence and wide&#8208;field photoluminescence emission to understand the defects and determine the photoluminescence lifetimes.








Abstract
3D ceramic architectures are captivating geometrical features with an immense demand in optics. In this work, an additive manufacturing (AM) approach for printing alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite 3D microarchitectures is developed. The approach enables custom&#8208;made photoresists suited for two&#8208;photon lithography, permitting the production of alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite (BaZrO3, CaZrO3, and SrZrO3) 3D structures shaped in the form of octet&#8208;truss lattices, gyroids, or inspired architectures like sodalite zeolite, and C60 buckyballs with micrometric and nanometric feature sizes. Alkaline&#8208;earth perovskite morphological, structural, and chemical characteristics are studied. The optical properties of such perovskite architectures are investigated using cathodoluminescence and wide&#8208;field photoluminescence emission to estimate the lifetime rate and defects in BaZrO3, CaZrO3, and SrZrO3. From a broad perspective, this AM methodology facilitates the production of 3D&#8208;structured mixed oxides. These findings are the first steps toward dimensionally refined high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index ceramics for micro&#8208;optics and other terrains like (photo/electro)catalysis.

         <title>Soft, Long&#8208;Lived, Bioresorbable Electronic Surgical Mesh with Wireless Pressure Monitor and On&#8208;Demand Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioresorbable electronic surgical mesh is presented that offers high mechanical strength over extended timeframes, wireless post&#8208;operative pressure monitoring, and on&#8208;demand drug delivery for the restoration of tissue structure and function. In vivo evaluations demonstrate reliable, long&#8208;lived operation, and effective treatment for abdominal hernia defects, by clear evidence of suppressed complications such as adhesion formation and infections.








Abstract
Current research in the area of surgical mesh implants is somewhat limited to traditional designs and synthesis of various mesh materials, whereas meshes with multiple functions may be an effective approach to address long&#8208;standing challenges including postoperative complications. Herein, a bioresorbable electronic surgical mesh is presented that offers high mechanical strength over extended timeframes, wireless post&#8208;operative pressure monitoring, and on&#8208;demand drug delivery for the restoration of tissue structure and function. The study of materials and mesh layouts provides a wide range of tunability of mechanical and biochemical properties. Dissolvable dielectric composite with porous structure in a pyramidal shape enhances sensitivity of a wireless capacitive pressure sensor, and resistive microheaters integrated with inductive coils provide thermo&#8208;responsive drug delivery system for an antibacterial agent. In vivo evaluations demonstrate reliable, long&#8208;lived operation, and effective treatment for abdominal hernia defects, by clear evidence of suppressed complications such as adhesion formation and infections.

         <title>3D Printing of Flow&#8208;Inspired Anisotropic Patterns with Liquid Crystalline Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling liquid crystal polymers that align during extrusion can bring us closer to the exquisite complexity of microstructures found in natural materials. By modulating nozzle pressure, an order of magnitude stiffness variation is achieved through a change of the molecular orientation at the nozzle tip. This enables the shaping of anisotropic patterns with stiffness and curvature gradients through extrusion 3D printing.








Abstract
Anisotropic materials formed by living organisms possess remarkable mechanical properties due to their intricate microstructure and directional freedom. In contrast, human&#8208;made materials face challenges in achieving similar levels of directionality due to material and manufacturability constraints. To overcome these limitations, an approach using 3D printing of self&#8208;assembling thermotropic liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) is presented. Their high stiffness and strength is granted by nematic domains aligning during the extrusion process. Here, a remarkably wide range of Young's modulus from 3 to 40 GPa is obtained by utilizing directionality of the nematic flow the printing process. &#160; By determining a relationship between stiffness, nozzle diameter, and line width, a design space where shaping and mechanical performance can be&#160;combined is identified. The ability to print LCPs with on&#8208;the&#8208;fly width changes to accommodate arbitrary spatially varying directions is demonstrated. This unlocks the possibility to manufacture exquisite patterns inspired by fluid dynamics with steep curvature variations. Utilizing the synergy between this path&#8208;planning method and LCPs, functional objects with stiffness and curvature gradients can be 3D&#8208;printed,&#160;offering potential applications in lightweight sustainable structures embedding crack&#8208;mitigation strategies. This method also opens avenues for studying and replicating&#160;intricate patterns observed in nature, such as wood or turbulent flow using 3D printing.

         <title>First Observation of Negative Capacitance in Molecular Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A significant negative capacitance response is directly observed in the thin film of molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium. When compared to conventional inorganic ferroelectrics, molecular ferroelectrics, in which order&#8211;disorder transition of the molecular induces the occurrence of polarization, would have a smaller ferroelectric anisotropy parameter &#945; and a larger domain wall formation energy.








Abstract
On the path of persisting Moore's Law, one of the biggest obstacles is the &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny,&#8221; which defines the lower limit of power consumption of individual transistors. Negative capacitance (NC) in ferroelectrics could provide a solution and has garnered significant attention in the fields of nanoelectronics, materials science, and solid&#8208;state physics. Molecular ferroelectrics, as an integral part of ferroelectrics, have developed rapidly in terms of both performance and functionality, with their inherent advantages such as easy fabrication, mechanical flexibility, low processing temperature, and structural tunability. However, studies on the NC in molecular ferroelectrics are limited. In this study, the focus is centered on the fabricated high&#8208;quality thin films of trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium(II), and a pioneering investigation on their NC responses is conducted. The findings demonstrate that the NC exhibited by molecular ferroelectrics is comparable to that of conventional HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectrics. This underscores the potential of molecular material systems for next&#8208;generation electronic devices.

         <title>Straightforward Design Strategy toward 3D Near&#8208;Net&#8208;Shape Stoichiometric SiC Parts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward design strategy coupling a granule&#8208;based fused deposition modeling process and preceramic polymer manipulation highlights the production of 3D near&#8208;net&#8208;shape stoichiometric SiC parts with a high potential impact in adverse environments as mirrors for lightweight opto&#8208;mechanical systems, as high&#8208;flux concentrated solar receivers and as heat exchangers for thermal management.








Abstract
Fused deposition modeling (FDM), traditionally reserved for thermoplastics, is modified here with a granule&#8208;based extrusion head to be extended to advanced nonoxide ceramics via a straightforward design strategy that considers the shaping opportunities and the chemical richness offered by preceramic polymers. Specifically, 3D near&#8208;net&#8208;shape stoichiometric silicon carbide (SiC) objects are designed by manipulating the key features of a commercially available polycarbosilane (fusibility, high carbon content, relatively high SiC yield). In the early stage of the process, the carbon&#8208;rich polycarbosilane is first mixed with Si and SiC fillers and then thermolyzed at 120 &#176;C to increase polymer branching while offering tailored rheological properties during the subsequent extrusion process at 90 &#176;C and adequate shape retention once extruded. This allows for the design of tailored and complex 3D complex polycarbosilane&#8208;based architectures with features down to 400&#160;&#181;m. Polymer&#8208;based parts are further converted into 3D stoichiometric SiC objects with quasi&#8208;near&#8208;net&#8208;shape&#8212;a volume shrinkage reduced to 9.1% is measured&#8212;by heat treatment at a temperature as low as 1400 &#176;C (argon flow). Given the flexibility to tune the preceramic polymer chemical and rheological properties, a new combined design approach is leveraged to generate bespoke advanced ceramics with a high freedom in geometry complexity.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Induced Regulation of Pt Strain Derived from Pt3Ga Intermetallic for Boosting Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by altering the symmetry of the PtGa&#8208;intermetallic structure, the stress environment in the surface Pt layer is precisely modified. By increasing strain, the key intermediate desorption step accelerates, resulting Pt3Ga (Pm3&#175;$\bar{\it 3}$m) with high symmetry exhibiting 10 times higher mass activity than commercial PtC and other samples with stretched surface.








Abstract
Pt&#8208;based fuel cell catalysts with excellent activity and stability for proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have been developed through strain regulation in recent years. Herein, this work demonstrates that symmetry&#8208;induced strain regulation of Pt surface of PtGa intermetallic compounds can greatly enhance the catalytic performance of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). With the strain environment varies derived from the lattice mismatch of analogous PtGa core but different symmetry, the Pt surface of the PtGa alloy and the Pt3Ga (Pm3&#175;$\bar{3}$m) precisely realize 0.58% and 2.7% compressive strain compared to the Pt3Ga (P4/mmm). Experimental and theoretical results reveal that when the compressive stress of the Pt lattice increases, the desorption process of O* intermediates becomes accelerated, which is conducive to oxygen reduction. The Pt3Ga (Pm3&#175;$\bar{3}$m) with high symmetry and compressive Pt surface exhibit the highest mass and specific activities of 2.18 A mgPt&#8722;1 and 5.36 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, which are more than one order of magnitude higher than those of commercial Pt/C catalysts. This work demonstrates that material symmetry can be used to precisely modulate Pt surface stress to enhance the ORR, as well as provide a distinct platform to investigate the relationship between Pt compressibility and catalytic activity.

Abstract
Treatment of diabetic wounds is a significant clinical challenge due to the massive infections caused by bacteria. In this study, multifunctional glycol chitosan and polydopamine&#8208;coated BiO1&#8208;xI (GPBO) nanoparticles (NPs) with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photothermal and photocatalytic abilities are prepared. When infection occurs, the local microenvironment becomes acidic, and the pH&#8208;switchable GPBO can target the bacteria of the wound site. The NIR&#8208;assisted GPBO treatment exhibits anti&#8208;bacterial effects with fast response, high efficiency, and long duration to Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. GPBO achieves excellent photothermal imaging and CT imaging of the mouse subcutaneous abscess model. With the assistance of NIR irradiation, the GPBO promotes the healing of the diabetic wound model with the effects of anti&#8208;bacteria, anti&#8208;inflammation, the M2 polarization promotion of macrophages, and angiogenesis. This is the first&#8208;time report of nano&#8208;sized BiO1&#8208;xI. The synthesis and selected application for the imaging and targeted therapy of diabetic wounds are presented. This study offers an example of the NP&#8208;assisted precise diagnosis and therapy of bacterial infection diseases.

         <title>Endogenous Zinc&#8208;Ion&#8208;Triggered In Situ Gelation Enables Zn Capture to Reprogram Benign Hyperplastic Prostate Microenvironment and Shrink Prostate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable sodium alginate (SA) and glycyrrhizic acid (GA)&#8208;interconnected hydrogel (SAGA) featuring Zn2+&#8208;triggered in situ gelation is developed to capture Zn2+, alleviate local inflammation, scavenge ROS, inhibit glycolysis and chemotaxis, which are available to reprogram the microenvironment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and shrinking prostate especially after entrapping lonidamine.








Abstract
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) as the leading cause of urination disorder is still a refractory disease, and there have no satisfied drugs or treatment protocols yet. With identifying excessive Zn2+, inflammation, and oxidative stress as the etiology of aberrant hyperplasia, an injectable sodium alginate (SA) and glycyrrhizic acid (GA)&#8208;interconnected hydrogels (SAGA) featuring Zn2+&#8208;triggered in situ gelation are developed to load lonidamine for reprogramming prostate microenvironment and treating BPH. Herein, SAGA hydrogels can crosslink with Zn2+ in BPH via coordination chelation and switch free Zn2+ to bound ones, consequently alleviating Zn2+&#8208;arisen inflammation and glycolysis. Beyond capturing Zn2+, GA with intrinsic immunoregulatory property can also alleviate local inflammation and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). Intriguingly, Zn2+ chelation&#8208;bridged interconnection in SAGA enhances its mechanical property and regulates the degradation rate to enable continuous lonidamine release, favoring hyperplastic acini apoptosis and further inhibiting glycolysis. These multiple actions cooperatively reprogram BPH microenvironment to alleviate characteristic symptoms of BPH and shrink prostate. RNA sequencing reveals that chemotaxis, glycolysis, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inflammation&#8208;related pathways associated with M1&#8208;like phenotype polarization are discerned as the action rationales of such endogenous Zn2+&#8208;triggered in situ hydrogels, providing a candidate avenue to treat BPH.

         <title>Lotus Effect Inspired Hydrophobic Strategy for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the lotus effect, a universal strategy is proposed for achieving stable Zn metal anodes. The effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H2O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism is demonstrated by designing the metal&#8211;organometallic compound layer with zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property, in which in situ integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic groups are constructed.








Abstract
Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have long suffered from the unstable Zn metal anode, which faces numerous challenges concerning dendrite growth, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution reaction. The absence of H2O adsorption control techniques has become a bottleneck for the further development of ZIBs. Using the stearic acid (SA)&#8208;modified Cu@Zn (SA&#8208;Cu@Zn) anode as an example, this work illustrates how the lotus effect controls the H2O adsorption energy on the Zn metal anode. In situ integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic long&#8208;chain alkyl groups are constructed, which provide zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property. Consequently, the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode exhibits long&#8208;term cycling stability over 2000&#160;h and high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.83% at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, which improves the electrochemical performance of the Zn||V2O5 full cell. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with water contact angle (CA) measurements demonstrate that the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn exhibits larger water CA and weaker H2O adsorption than Zn. Moreover, the presence of Cu ensures the selective adsorption of Zn on the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode, well explaining how the excellent reversibility is achieved. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H2O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism, offering a universal strategy for achieving stable ZIB anodes.

         <title>Biomimetic Targeting Nanoadjuvants for Sonodynamic and Chronological Multi&#8208;Immunotherapy against Holistic Biofilm&#8208;Related Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work originates a chronological multi&#8208;immunotherapy combined with sonodynamic therapy against biofilm&#8208;related infections (BRIs) based on macrophage membrane&#8208;decorated nanoadjuvants loaded with cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CPG&#8208;ODN) or miR&#8208;21&#8208;5p for biofilm eradication under ultrasound. CPG&#8208;ODN promotes early&#8208;stage neutrophil extracellular trap formation while redirecting macrophage polarization. MiR&#8208;21&#8208;5p facilitates tissue integration and anti&#8208;inflammation in repairing phase. This approach offers valuable clinical benefits for BRIs&#8217; treatment.








Abstract
Biofilm&#8208;related infections (BRIs) present significant challenges owing to drug resistance, adverse immune responses, and implant failure; however, current approaches inadequately cater to the diverse therapeutic requirements at different stages of infection. To address this issue, a multi&#8208;immunotherapy strategy in combination with sonodynamic therapy is proposed for the chronological treatment of BRIs. Macrophage membrane&#8208;decorated targeting sonosensitive nanoadjuvants are fabricated to load cytosine&#8208;phosphate&#8208;guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CPG&#8208;ODN) or microRNA (miR)&#8208;21&#8208;5p. In the early stages of BRI (Stage I), CPG&#8208;ODN&#8208;loaded nanoadjuvants (CPG@HMPN@M) promote the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps to capture and neutralize detached microbes. During the late stage of infection (Stage II), CPG&#8208;ODNs redirect macrophage polarization into the M1 phase to combat infections via TLR9/Myd88/TRAF6 pathway. During these stages, CPG@HMPN@M generates singlet oxygen through sonodynamic processes, eradicating the biofilms under US irradiation. Once the BRIs are eliminated, miR&#8208;21&#8208;5p&#8208;loaded nanoadjuvants (miR@HMPN@M) are delivered to the lesions to suppress excessive inflammation and promote tissue integration by evoking macrophage M2 polarization during the repair phase (Stage III) through PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway. This innovative approach aims to provide comprehensive treatment strategies for the chronological treatment of BRI by effectively eliminating infections, promoting tissue restoration, and implementing different immune regulations at different stages, thus demonstrating promising clinical value.

         <title>19.32% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by Fine&#8208;Tuning Stacking Modes of Y&#8208;Type Molecule Acceptors: Synergistic Bromine and Fluorine Substitution of the End Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking modes of Y&#8208;type small molecule acceptors are fine&#8208;tuned by synergistic bromine and fluorine substitution of the end groups for achieving high power conversion efficiencies of 18.34% and 19.32% in binary and ternary blend devices.








Abstract
The success of Y6&#8208;type nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) in polymer solar cells (PSCs) can be attributed to their unique honeycomb stacking style, which leads to favorable thin&#8208;film morphologies. The intermolecular interactions related to the crystallization tendency of these NF&#8208;SMAs is closely governed by their electron accepting end groups. For example, the high performance Y6 derivative L8&#8208;BO (BTP&#8208;4F) presents three types of stacking modes in contrast to two stacking modes of Y6. Hence, it is ultimately interesting to obtain more insight on the packing properties and the preferences influenced by chemical modifications such as end group engineering. This work designs and synthesizes asymmetric and symmetric L8&#8208;BO derivatives with brominated end groups and explores the stacking preferences in various modes. The asymmetric BTP&#8208;3FBr displays an optimized crystallization tendency and thin film morphology, leading to a decent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.34% in binary devices and a top PCE of 19.32% in ternary devices containing 15 wt% IDIC as the second acceptor.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Sleek High Entropy Alloy Tights: Realizing Superior Cyclability for Anode&#8208;Free Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;sleek high&#8208;entropy alloy layer (&#8776;20&#160;nm) with nano particles arrays is tightly wrapped on the carbon fiber surface like tights (NiCdCuInZn HEA/C), promoting the homogeneous distribution of local current density that is more conducive to the Li metal homogeneous deposition. By using NiCdCuInZn HEA/C host, the anode&#8208;free Li metal battery achieves high reversibility cycles and capacity retention rate.








Abstract
The development of Li&#8208;free anodes to inhibit Li dendrite formation and provide high energy density Li batteries is highly applauded. However, the lithiophobic interphase and heterogeneous Li deposition hindered the practical application. In this work, a 20&#160;nm ultra&#8208;sleek high entropy alloy (HEA, NiCdCuInZn) tights loaded with HEA nanoparticles are developed by a thermodynamically driven phase transition method on the carbon fiber (HEA/C). Multiple Li+ transport paths and abundant active sites are enabled by the cocktail effect of different constituent elements in HEA. These active sites with gradient absorption energies (&#8722;3.18 to &#8722;2.03&#160;eV) facilitate selective binding, providing a low barrier for homogeneous Li nucleation. Simultaneously, multiple transport paths promote Li diffusion behavior with uniform Li deposition. Thus, the&#160;HEA/C achieves high reversibility of Li plating/stripping processes over 2000 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in asymmetric cells, as well as over 7200&#160;h at 60&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/60 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells. Moreover, the anode&#8208;free full cell with the HEA/C host has an average coulombic efficiency of 99.5% at 1 C after 160 cycles. This advanced HEA structure design shows a favorable potential application for anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries.

         <title>Novel Ultra&#8208;Stable 2D SbBi Alloy Structure with Precise Regulation Ratio Enables Long&#8208;Stable Potassium/Lithium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D thin&#8208;layer binary SbBi alloy is designed, which displays superior 2D structural stability, highly reversible alloying/dealloying, fast K/Li storage kinetics, and ultra&#8208;long&#8208;cycle stability in potassium/lithium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs/LIBs).








Abstract
The inferior cycling stabilities or low capacities of 2D Sb or Bi limit their applications in high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;stability potassium/lithium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs/LIBs). Therefore, integrating the synergy of high&#8208;capacity Sb and high&#8208;stability Bi to fabricate 2D binary alloys is an intriguing and challenging endeavor. Herein, a series of novel 2D binary SbBi alloys with different atomic ratios are fabricated using a simple one&#8208;step co&#8208;replacement method. Among these fabricated alloys, the 2D&#8208;Sb0.6Bi0.4 anode exhibits high&#8208;capacity and ultra&#8208;stable potassium and lithium storage performance. Particularly, the 2D&#8208;Sb0.6Bi0.4 anode has a high&#8208;stability capacity of 381.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 (&#8776;87.8% retention) and an ultra&#8208;long&#8208;cycling stability of 1000 cycles (0.037% decay per cycle) at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 in PIBs. Besides, the superior lithium and potassium storage mechanism is revealed by kinetic analysis, in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterization techniques, and theoretical calculations. This mainly originates from the ultra&#8208;stable structure and synergistic interaction within the 2D&#8208;binary alloy, which significantly alleviates the volume expansion, enhances K+ adsorption energy, and decreases the K+ diffusion energy barrier compared to individual 2D&#8208;Bi or 2D&#8208;Sb. This study verifies a new scalable design strategy for creating 2D binary (even ternary) alloys, offering valuable insights into their fundamental mechanisms in rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Selective Shielding of the (002) Plane Enabling Vertically Oriented Zinc Plating for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically oriented Zn plating with preferential growth of the (100) plane is realized by selective shielding of the (002) plane using disodium lauryl phosphate (DLP) as an electrolyte additive. This unique growth pattern results in ultrastable Zn plating/stripping at a super&#8208;high current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a cumulative capacity of 8500 mAh cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Uncontrolled growth of Zn dendrites hinders the future development of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Despite that the (100) plane possesses better zincophilic ability and fast kinetics, dendrites are generally suppressed via (002) plane&#8208;oriented Zn deposition in previous reports; the ordered (100) plane&#8208;dominant Zn deposition, especially under high current density has not yet been realized. Herein, vertically&#8208;oriented Zn plating with preferential growth of (100) plane is reported using disodium lauryl phosphate (DLP) as an electrolyte additive. DLP is preferentially anchored on the Zn (002) crystal plane via the polar phosphate group, then the deposition of Zn atoms on the (002) plane is retarded by the long alkyl chain, finally promoting the preferred growth of the (100) plane. This unique growth pattern results in ultrastable Zn plating/stripping at a super&#8208;high current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, with a cumulative capacity of 8500 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Zn//Zn symmetric cell also cycles steadily for 700&#160;h with a large areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This study provides new insights into the realization of dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes by crystal plane modulation.

         <title>Confinement Engineering of Zinc Single&#8208;Atom Triggered Charge Redistribution on Ruthenium Site for Alkaline Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a confinement strategy between atomically dispersed Zn&#8208;N4 sites on a N&#8208;doped porous carbon and metal nanoparticles is presented, which can induce the strong electronic coupling with adjacent nanoparticles and tune their electrocatalytic activity for H2 evolution.








Abstract
Optimizing the interaction between metal and support in the supported metal catalysts effectively refines the electronic structure and boosts the catalytic properties of loaded active components. Herein a method is introduced to confine ultrafine ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles within atomically dispersed Zn&#8208;N4 sites on a N&#8208;doped carbon network (Ru/Zn&#8208;N&#8208;C) through the strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction, achieving superior catalytic activity and stability for alkaline hydrogen evolution. Spectroscopic data and theoretical modeling elucidate that the remarkable catalytic performance of Ru sites stems from their strong electronic coupling with neighboring Zn&#8208;N4 moiety and pyridinic N/pyrrolic N. This interaction induces an electron&#8208;deficient state of Ru, thereby accelerating the dissociation of H2O and lowering the energy barriers for the desorption of OH* and H*. This insight provides a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms at play. Furthermore, alkaline water electrolyzer using this catalyst as cathode delivers a mass activity of 3&#160;A&#160;mgcat&#8211;1 at 2.0&#160;V, much surpassing Ru&#8208;C. This research opens a novel pathway for the development of advanced materials , tailored for energy storage and conversion applications.

         <title>Ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II Ratiometric Nanothermometers for 3D In Vivo Thermal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II ratiometric nanothermometers with self&#8208;calibrating ability are constructed by assembling temperature&#8208;insensitive lanthanide nanocrystals and temperature&#8208;sensitive Ag2S quantum dots into a hybrid nanocomposite material. The high thermal sensitivity, robust stability and calibration procedure enable accurate 3D thermographic imaging ex vivo and in vivo.








Abstract
Luminescent nanothermometry, particularly the one based on ratiometric, has sparked intense research for non&#8208;invasive in vivo or intracellular temperature mapping, empowering their uses as diagnosis tools in biomedicine. However, ratiometric detection still suffers from biased sensing induced by wavelength&#8208;dependent tissue absorption and scattering, low thermal sensitivity (Sr), and lack of imaging depth information. Herein, this work constructs an ultrasensitive NIR&#8208;II ratiometric nanothermometer with self&#8208;calibrating ability for 3D in vivo thermographic imaging, in which temperature&#8208;insensitive lanthanide nanocrystals and strongly temperature&#8208;quenched Ag2S quantum dots are co&#8208;assembled to form a hybrid nanocomposite material. Precise control over the amount ratio between two sub&#8208;materials enables the manipulation of heat&#8208;activated back energy transfer from Ag2S to Yb3+ in lanthanide nanoparticles, thereby rendering Sr up to 7.8% &#176;C&#8722;1 at 43.5 &#176;C, and higher than 6.5% &#176;C&#8722;1 over the entire physiological temperature range. Moreover, the luminescence intensity ratio between two separated spectral regions within the narrow Yb3+ emission peak is used to determine the depth information of nanothermometers in living mice and correct the effect of tissue depth on 2D thermographic imaging, and therefore allows a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of accurate 3D in vivo thermographic imaging, constituting a solid step toward the development of advanced ratiometric nanothermometry for biological applications.

         <title>Cu@Co with Dilatation Strain for High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalytic Reduction of Low&#8208;Concentration Nitric Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a Cu@Co catalyst with dilatation strain is prepared for low&#8208;concentration NO electroreduction, and it exhibits high NH3 yield of 627.20 &#181;g h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 76.54%. The assembled Zn&#8208;NO battery using Cu@Co as cathode achieves a power density of 3.08 mW cm&#8722;2, which can simultaneously realize NO removal, NH3 green synthesis, and electricity output. 








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) is a clean and sustainable strategy to simultaneously remove NO and synthesize NH3. However, the conversion of low concentration NO to NH3 is still a huge challenge. In this work, the dilatation strain between Cu and Co interface over Cu@Co catalyst is built up and investigated for electroreduction of low concentration NO (volume ratio of 1%) to NH3. The catalyst shows a high NH3 yield of 627.20&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 76.54%. Through the combination of spherical aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy and geometric phase analyses, it shows that Co atoms occupy Cu lattice sites to form dilatation strain in the xy direction within Co region. Further density functional theory calculations and NO temperature&#8208;programmed desorption (NO&#8208;TPD) results show that the surface dilatation strain on Cu@Co is helpful to enhance the NO adsorption and reduce energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (*NO to *NOH), thereby accelerating the catalytic reaction. To simultaneously realize NO exhaust gas removal, NH3 green synthesis, and electricity output, a Zn&#8208;NO battery with Cu@Co cathode is assembled with a power density of 3.08&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and an NH3 yield of 273.37&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Transport&#8208;Limited Growth of Coccolith Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coccoliths are microscopic crystal&#8208;arrays created by unicellular organisms. Coccoliths display diverse and intricate structures that surpass what can be currently synthesized. This research reveals that the nuanced morphology of coccolith crystals is governed by a delicate interplay between transport&#8208;limited and reaction&#8208;limited growth, mirroring processes observed in snowflake formation.








Abstract
Biogenic crystals present a variety of complex morphologies that form with exquisite fidelity. In the case of the intricate morphologies of coccoliths, calcite crystals produced by marine algae, only a single set of crystallographic facets is utilized. It is unclear which growth process can merge this simple crystallographic habit with the species&#8208;specific architectures. Here, a suite of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electron microscopies is used to follow both the growth trajectories of the crystals ex&#160;situ, and the cellular environment in&#160;situ, in the species Emiliania huxleyi. It is shown that crystal growth alternates between a space filling and a skeletonized growth mode, where the crystals elongate via their stable crystallographic facets, but the final morphology is a manifestation of growth arrest. This process is reminiscent of the balance between reaction&#8208;limited and transport&#8208;limited growth regimes underlying snowflake formation. It is suggested that localized ion transport regulates the kinetic instabilities that are required for transport&#8208;limited growth, leading to reproducible morphologies.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Healing System for Polydicyclopentadiene Thermosets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;healing chemistry, employing a thermally stable bis&#8208;N&#8208;heterocyclic Ru&#8208;carbene catalyst and a Cu(I) activator, addresses the thermal instability challenges of previous self&#8208;healing chemistries, enabling self&#8208;healing in a polydicyclopentadiene thermoset which is initially cured at &#8776;200 &#176;C via frontal polymerization.








Abstract
Self&#8208;healing offers promise for addressing structural failures, increasing lifespan, and improving durability in polymeric materials. Implementing self&#8208;healing in thermoset polymers faces significant manufacturing challenges, especially due to the elevated temperature requirements of thermoset processing. To introduce self&#8208;healing into structural thermosets, the self&#8208;healing system must be thermally stable and compatible with the thermoset chemistry. This article demonstrates a self&#8208;healing microcapsule&#8208;based system stable to frontal polymerization (FP), a rapid and energy&#8208;efficient manufacturing process with a self&#8208;propagating exothermic reaction (&#8776;200 &#176;C). A thermally latent Grubbs&#8208;type complex bearing two N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene ligands addresses limitations in conventional G2&#8208;based self&#8208;healing approaches. Under FP's elevated temperatures, the catalyst remains dormant until activated by a Cu(I) co&#8208;reagent, ensuring efficient polymerization of the dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) upon damage to the polyDCPD matrix. The two&#8208;part microcapsule system consists of one capsule containing the thermally latent Grubbs&#8208;type catalyst dissolved in the solvent, and another capsule containing a Cu(I) coagent blended with liquid DCPD monomer. Using the same chemistry for both matrix fabrication and healing results in strong interfaces as demonstrated by lap&#8208;shear tests. In an optimized system, the self&#8208;healing system restores the mechanical properties of the tough polyDCPD thermoset. Self&#8208;healing efficiencies greater than 90% via tapered double cantilever beam tests are observed.

         <title>Multiple H&#8208;Bonding Cross&#8208;Linked Supramolecular Solid&#8211;Solid Phase Change Materials for Thermal Energy Storage and Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular polymeric solid&#8211;solid phase change material with high latent heat storage and superior mechanical strength is developed for thermal energy storage (TES and management through the construction of multiple H&#8208;bonding interactions within the polymer. This study provides new guidance for combining high TES density, robust mechanical properties, and sound thermal stability in one material.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) are considered among the most promising candidates for thermal energy storage and management. However, the application of SSPCMs is consistently hindered by the canonical trade&#8208;off between high TES capacity and mechanical robustness. In addition, they suffer from poor recyclability due to chemical cross&#8208;linking. Herein, a straightforward but effective strategy for fabricating supramolecular SSPCMs with high latent heat and mechanical strength is proposed. The supramolecular polymer employs multiple H&#8208;bonding interactions as robust physical cross&#8208;links. This enables SSPCM with a high enthalpy of phase transition (142.5 J g&#8722;1), strong mechanical strength (36.9&#160;MPa), and sound shape stability (maintaining shape integrity at 120 &#176;C) even with a high content of phase change component (97 wt%). When SSPCM is utilized to regulate the operating temperature of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, it significantly diminishes the battery working temperature by 23 &#176;C at a discharge rate of 3 C. The robust thermal management capability enabled through solid&#8211;solid phase change provides practical opportunities for applications in fast discharging and high&#8208;power batteries. Overall, this study presents a feasible strategy for designing linear SSPCMs with high latent heat and exceptional mechanical strength for thermal management.

         <dc:description>
The presence of paramagnetic centers in nanodiamonds drives effective reduction in longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and relaxation of neighboring water molecules, resulting in bright appearance on T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance images. , Using in vivo chicken embryos, it is confirmed nanodiamonds can provide high contrast to noise ratio for tracking and cell labeling over periods of time using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).








Abstract
Nanodiamonds (ND) hold great potential for diverse applications due to their biocompatibility, non&#8208;toxicity, and versatile functionalization. Direct visualization of ND by means of non&#8208;invasive imaging techniques will open new venues for labeling and tracking, offering unprecedented and unambiguous detection of labeled cells or nanodiamond&#8208;based drug carrier systems. The structural defects in diamonds, such as vacancies, can have paramagnetic properties and potentially act as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The smallest nanoscale diamond particles, detonation ND, are reported to effectively reduce longitudinal relaxation time T1 and provide signal enhancement in MRI. Using in vivo, chicken embryos, direct visualization of ND is demonstrated as a bright signal with high contrast to noise ratio. At 24 h following intravascular application marked signal enhancement is noticed in the liver and the kidneys, suggesting uptake by the phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES), and in vivo labeling of these cells. This is confirmed by visualization of nanodiamond&#8208;labeled macrophages as positive (bright) signal, in vitro. Macrophage cell labeling is not associated with significant increase in pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines or marked cytotoxicity. These results indicate nanodiamond as a novel gadolinium&#8208;free contrast&#8208;enhancing agent with potential for cell labeling and tracking and over periods of time.

&lt;p&gt;The presence of paramagnetic centers in nanodiamonds drives effective reduction in longitudinal relaxation time (T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and relaxation of neighboring water molecules, resulting in bright appearance on T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted magnetic resonance images. , Using in vivo chicken embryos, it is confirmed nanodiamonds can provide high contrast to noise ratio for tracking and cell labeling over periods of time using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

         <title>Split&#8208;Type Magnetic Soft Tactile Sensor with 3D Force Decoupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sensor has a sandwich&#8208;like layered structure, the top layer of which is a centripetally magnetized flexible magnetic film. It can realize the self&#8208;decoupling measurement of 3D forces and be used as a human&#8211;machine interface to control a robot. After replacing the flexible substrate, the split&#8208;type sensor enables flow rate measurement for route calculation and navigation on the water.








Abstract
Tactile sensory organs for sensing 3D force, such as human skin and fish lateral lines, are indispensable for organisms. With their sensory properties enhanced by layered structures, typical sensory organs can achieve excellent perception as well as protection under frequent mechanical contact. Here, inspired by these layered structures, a split&#8208;type magnetic soft tactile sensor with wireless 3D force sensing and a high accuracy (1.33%) fabricated by developing a centripetal magnetization arrangement and theoretical decoupling model is introduced. The 3D force decoupling capability enables it to achieve a perception close to that of human skin in multiple dimensions without complex calibration. Benefiting from the 3D force decoupling capability and split design with a long effective distance (&gt;20&#160;mm), several sensors are assembled in air and water to achieve delicate robotic operation and water flow&#8208;based navigation with an offset &lt;1.03%, illustrating the extensive potential of magnetic tactile sensors in flexible electronics, human&#8210;machine interactions, and bionic robots.

         <title>Programmable Atom&#8208;Like Nanoparticle Reporters for High&#8208;Precision Urinalysis of In Situ Membrane Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;based programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (PANs) are used to develop urinal reporters with defined ligand valence and spacing. With the rational spatial organization of ligands, the interaction between PAN reporters and membrane proteins (MPs) exhibits superior stability on cell&#8208;membrane interface under fluid microenvironment, enabling reverse assessment of in situ MP levels via measuring the renal clearance efficiency of PAN reporters.








Abstract
The expression of disease&#8208;specific membrane proteins (MPs) is a crucial indicator for evaluating the onset and progression of diseases. Urinalysis of in situ MPs has the potential for point&#8208;of&#8208;care disease diagnostics, yet remains challenging due to the lack of molecular reporter to transform the expression information of in situ MPs into the measurable urine composition. Herein, a series of tetrahedral DNA frameworks (TDFs) are employed as the cores of programmable atom&#8208;like nanoparticles (PANs) to direct the self&#8208;assembly of PAN reporters with defined ligand valence and spatial distribution. With the rational spatial organization of ligands, the interaction between PAN reporters and MPs exhibits superior stability on cell&#8208;membrane interface under renal tubule&#8208;mimic fluid microenvironment, thus enabling high&#8208;fidelity conversion of MPs expression level into binding events and reverse assessment of in situ MP levels via measurement of the renal clearance efficiency of PAN reporters. Such PAN reporter&#8208;mediated signal transformation mechanism empowers urinalysis of the onset of acute kidney injury at least 6&#8201;h earlier than the existing methods with an area under the curve of 100%. This strategy has the potential for urinalysis of a variety of in situ membrane proteins.

         <title>Highly Stable Layered Coordination Polymer Electrocatalyst toward Efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>

A novel layered coordination polymer (CuPEDOT) is developed to stabilize Cu2+ through Cu2+ and ethylenedioxythiophene coordination, which has high electrochemical and structural stability in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction.








Abstract
Cu2+&#8208;based materials, a class of promising catalysts for the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to value&#8208;added chemicals, usually undergo inevitable and uncontrollable reorganization processes during the reaction, resulting in catalyst deactivation or the new active sites formation and bringing great challenges to exploring their structure&#8211;performance relationships. Herein, a facile strategy is reported for constructing Cu2+ and 3, 4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) coordination to stabilize Cu2+ ions to prepare a novel layered coordination polymer (CuPEDOT). CuPEDOT enables selective reduction of CO2 to CH4 with 62.7% Faradaic efficiency at the current density of 354&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell, and the catalyst is stable for at least 15&#160;h. In situ spectroscopic characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that CuPEDOT catalyst can maintain the Cu2+&#8208;EDOT coordination structurally stable in CO2RR and significantly promote the further hydrogenation of *CO intermediates, favoring the formation of CH4 instead of dimerization to C2 products. The strong coordination between EDOT and Cu2+ prevents the reduction of Cu2+ ions during CO2RR. The finding of this work provides a new perspective on designing molecularly stable, highly active catalysts for CO2RR.

         <title>Eco&#8208;Friendly Solvent Engineered CsPbI2.77Br0.23 Ink for Large&#8208;Area and Scalable High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CsPbI2.77I0.23 slot&#8208;die inks are developed via the colloidal engineering of scalable large&#8208;area perovskite solar cells. Eco&#8208;friendly solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, and 2&#8208;methoxyethanol are used. Film growth is controlled by varying the solvent ratio. The cells based on films prepared by slot&#8208;die coating exhibit an efficiency of 19.05%.








Abstract
The performance of large&#8208;area perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been assessed for typical compositions, such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), using a blade coater, slot&#8208;die coater, solution shearing, ink&#8208;jet printing, and thermal evaporation. However, the fabrication of large&#8208;area all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films is not well developed. This study develops, for the first time, an eco&#8208;friendly solvent engineered all&#8208;inorganic perovskite ink of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a main solvent with the addition of acetonitrile (ACN), 2&#8208;methoxyethanol (2&#8208;ME), or a mixture of ACN and 2&#8208;ME to fabricate large&#8208;area CsPbI2.77Br0.23 films with slot&#8208;die coater at low temperatures (40&#8211;50 &#176;C). The perovskite phase, morphology, defect density, and optoelectrical properties of prepared with different solvent ratios are thoroughly examined and they are correlated with their respective colloidal size distribution and solar cell performance. The optimized slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated CsPbI2.77Br0.23 perovskite film, which is prepared from the eco&#8208;friendly binary solvents dimethyl sulfoxide:acetonitrile&#160;(0.8:0.2 v/v), demonstrates an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05%. Moreover, the device maintains &#8776;91% of its original PCE after 1 month at 20% relative humidity in the dark. It is believed that this study will accelerate the reliable manufacturing of perovskite devices.

This study develops, for the first time, an eco-friendly solvent engineered all-inorganic perovskite ink of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a main solvent with the addition of acetonitrile (ACN), 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME), or a mixture of ACN and 2-ME to fabricate large-area CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2.77&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.23&lt;/sub&gt; films with slot-die coater at low temperatures (40&#8211;50 &#176;C). The perovskite phase, morphology, defect density, and optoelectrical properties of prepared with different solvent ratios are thoroughly examined and they are correlated with their respective colloidal size distribution and solar cell performance. The optimized slot-die-coated CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2.77&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.23&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite film, which is prepared from the eco-friendly binary solvents dimethyl sulfoxide:acetonitrile&#160;(0.8:0.2 v/v), demonstrates an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05%. Moreover, the device maintains &#8776;91% of its original PCE after 1 month at 20% relative humidity in the dark. It is believed that this study will accelerate the reliable manufacturing of perovskite devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Dimensional Light&#8208;Emitting Meta&#8208;Display: Photoluminescence and Pumping Light Multiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The originally proposed design strategy for light&#8208;emitting meta&#8208;display not only intriguingly enables simultaneous and independent encoding of fluorescence and pump light, but also expands encoding freedom of different incident wavevector directions. The design strategy, which extends the capability of light&#8208;emitting metasurface to meet diverse requirements, can pave the way for multiplexing optical displays, information storage, and next&#8208;generation wearable displays.








Abstract
The advent of intelligent display devices has given rise to diverse and complex demands for miniature light&#8208;emitting devices. Light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces have emerged as a practical and efficient means of achieving precise light modulation. However, their practicality is limited by certain constraints. First, there is a need for further exploration of the ability to manipulate both pumping and emitting light simultaneously. Second, there is currently no encoding freedom in multi&#8208;dimensional emitting light. To address these concerns, using meta&#8208;atoms is proposed to encode both fluorescence and pumping light independently, and expand the encoding freedom with different incident wavevector directions. A light&#8208;emitting metasurface with quad&#8208;fold multiplex encoding meta&#8208;displays, including dual scattering images and dual fluorescence images, is further demonstrated. This design strategy not only manipulates both pumping and fluorescence light but also broadens encoding freedom for comprehensive multi&#8208;functionality. This can pave the way for multiplexing optical displays, information storage, and next&#8208;generation wearable displays.

         <title>Microstructured Polyelectrolyte Elastomer&#8208;Based Ionotronic Sensors with High Sensitivities and Excellent Stability for Artificial Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microstructured leakage&#8208;free polyelectrolyte elastomer is synthesized for ionotronic sensors, achieving a sensitivity of 69.6 kPa&#8722;1 and excellent stability under both static and dynamic loads. The broad sensing range of the sensor within the high&#8208;pressure realm enables a brand&#8208;new coding strategy. A wearable keyboard and a quasicontinuous controller for a robotic arm are demonstrated.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance flexible pressure sensors are highly demanded for artificial tactile sensing. Using ionic conductors as the dielectric layer has enabled ionotronic pressure sensors with high sensitivities owing to giant capacitance of the electric double layer (EDL) formed at the ionic conductor/electronic conductor interface. However, conventional ionotronic sensors suffer from leakage, which greatly hinders long&#8208;term stability and practical applications. Herein, a leakage&#8208;free polyelectrolyte elastomer as the dielectric layer for ionotronic sensors is synthesized. The mechanical and electrical properties of the polyelectrolyte elastomer are optimized, a micropyramid array is constructed, and it is used as the dielectric layer for an ionotronic pressure sensor with marked performances. The obtained sensor exhibits a sensitivity of 69.6 kPa&#8722;1, a high upper detecting limit on the order of 1&#160;MPa, a fast response/recovery speed of &#8776;6&#160;ms, and excellent stability under both static and dynamic loads. Notably, the sensor retains a high sensitivity of 4.96 kPa&#8722;1 at 500&#160;kPa, and its broad sensing range within high&#8208;pressure realm enables a brand&#8208;new coding strategy. The applications of the sensor as a wearable keyboard and a quasicontinuous controller for a robotic arm are demonstrated. Durable and highly sensitive ionotronic sensors potentialize high&#8208;performance artificial skins for soft robots, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and beyond.

         <title>Terahertz Liquid Biosensor Based on A Graphene Metasurface for Ultrasensitive Detection with A Quasi&#8208;Bound State in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel terahertz (THz) biosensor based on the integration of metasurface with graphene, which enables liquid detection. The study opens new avenues for the advancement of metasurfaces by establishing them as potent candidates for optical sensors with real&#8208;time and label&#8208;free capabilities.








Abstract
The concept of a quasi&#8208;bound state in a continuum (QBIC) has garnered significant attention in various fields such as sensing, communication, and optical switching. Within metasurfaces, QBICs offer a reliable platform that enables sensing capabilities through potent interactions between local electric fields and matter. Herein, a novel terahertz (THz) biosensor based on the integration of QBIC with graphene is reported, which enables multidimensional detection. The proposed biosensor is distinctive because of its ability to discern concentrations of ethanol and N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone in a wide range from 100% to 0%, by monitoring the changes in the resonance intensity and maximum wavelet coefficient. This approach demonstrates an excellent linear fit, which ensures robust quantitative analysis. The remarkable sensitivity of our biosensor enables it to detect minute changes in low&#8208;concentration solutions, with the lowest detection concentration value (LDCV) of 0.21&#160;pg&#160;mL&#8722;1. 2D wavelet coefficient intensity cards are effectively constructed through continuous wavelet transforms, which presents a more accurate approach for determining the concentration of the solution. Ultimately, the novel sensing platform offers a host of advantages, including heightened sensitivity and reusability. This pioneering approach establishes a new avenue for liquid&#8208;based terahertz biosensing.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Responsive Sliver Peroxide&#8208;Nanocarrier Serves as Broad&#8208;Spectrum Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase Inhibitor for Combating Severe Pneumonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;responsive nanovesicle, Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM, capable of a broad&#8208;spectrum metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamase (MBL) inhibition is developed to address pneumonia caused by MBL&#8208;producing bacteria. The efficacy of these nanovesicles is validated in two infection models, evidenced by significant reduction of bacterial loadings, pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels, and the recruitment of immune cells. This innovative approach presents a promising strategy for combating infections of MBL&#8208;producing bacteria.








Abstract
Metallo&#8208;&#946;&#8208;lactamases (MBLs) represent a prevalent resistance mechanism in Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, rendering last&#8208;line carbapenem&#8208;related antibiotics ineffective. Here, a bioresponsive sliver peroxide (Ag2O2)&#8208;based nanovesicle, named Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM, is developed as a broad&#8208;spectrum MBL inhibitor for combating MBL&#8208;producing bacterial pneumonia. Ag2O2 nanoparticle is first orderly modified with bovine serum albumin and polydopamine to co&#8208;load meropenem (MER) and [5&#8208;(p&#8208;fluorophenyl)&#8208;2&#8208;ureido]&#8208;thiophene&#8208;3&#8208;carboxamide (TPCA&#8208;1) and then encapsulated with macrophage membrane (MM) aimed to target inflammatory lung tissue specifically. The resultant Ag2O2@BP&#8208;MT@MM effectively abrogates MBL activity by displacing the Zn2+ cofactor in MBLs with Ag+ and displays potent bactericidal and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties, specific targeting abilities, and great bioresponsive characteristics. After intravenous injection, the nanoparticles accumulate prominently at infection sites through MM&#8208;mediated targeting . Ag+ released from Ag2O2 decomposition at the infection sites effectively inhibits MBL activity and overcomes the resistance of MBL&#8208;producing bacteria to MER, resulting in synergistic elimination of bacteria in conjunction with MER. In two murine infection models of NDM&#8208;1+ Klebsiella pneumoniae&#8208;induced severe pneumonia and NDM&#8208;1+ Escherichia coli&#8208;induced sepsis&#8208;related bacterial pneumonia, the nanoparticles significantly reduce bacterial loading, pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels locally and systemically, and the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages. This innovative approach presents a promising new strategy for combating infections caused by MBL&#8208;producing carbapenem&#8208;resistant bacteria.

In two murine infection models of NDM-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;-induced severe pneumonia and NDM-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;-induced sepsis-related bacterial pneumonia, the nanoparticles significantly reduce bacterial loading, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels locally and systemically, and the recruitment and activation of neutrophils and macrophages. This innovative approach presents a promising new strategy for combating infections caused by MBL-producing carbapenem-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage in Tungsten Bronze Dielectric Ceramics Through a Weakly Coupled Relaxor Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Obtaining high energy storage performance in tetragonal tungsten bronze dielectric ceramics is challenging, owing to the complexity of composition design and crystal structure. This study focuses on enhancing the recoverable energy density in Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485&#8722;1.5xSmxNb2O6 by creating weakly coupled polar nanoregions. The resulting system exhibits ultrahigh energy storage, surpassing the majority of counterparts in ceramics with tetragonal tungsten bronze structures.








Abstract
Dielectric energy&#8208;storage capacitors, known for their ultrafast discharge time and high&#8208;power density, find widespread applications in high&#8208;power pulse devices. However, ceramics featuring a tetragonal tungsten bronze structure (TTBs) have received limited attention due to their lower energy&#8208;storage capacity compared to perovskite counterparts. Herein, a TTBs relaxor ferroelectric ceramic based on the Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485&#8208;1.5xSmxNb2O6 composition, exhibiting an ultrahigh recoverable energy density of 9 J cm&#8722;3 and an efficiency of 84% under an electric field of 660&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 is reported. Notably, the energy storage performance of this ceramic shows remarkable stability against frequency, temperature, and cycling electric field. The introduction of Sm3+ doping is found to create weakly coupled polar nanoregions in the Gd0.03Ba0.47Sr0.485Nb2O6 ceramic. Structural characterizations reveal that the incommensurability parameter increases with higher Sm3+ content, indicative of a highly disordered A&#8208;site structure. Simultaneously, the breakdown strength is also enhanced by raising the conduction activation energy, widening the bandgap, and reducing the electric field&#8208;induced strain. This work presents a significant improvement on the energy storage capabilities of TTBs&#8208;based capacitors, expanding the material choice for high&#8208;power pulse device applications.

         <title>Peeling&#8211;Stiffening Self&#8208;Adhesive Ionogel with Superhigh Interfacial Toughness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peeling&#8211;stiffening self&#8208;adhesive ionogel with a working mechanism in stark contrast to conventional cured and pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives is reported. The ionogel incorporates two ionophilic repeating units with different associating affinities, allowing it to adaptively wet rough surface in the soft liquid&#8208;like dissipating state, and upon peeling, to dramatically stiffen to a phase&#8208;separated glassy state for superstrong adhesion.








Abstract
Self&#8208;adhesive materials that can directly adhere to diverse solid surfaces are indispensable in modern life and technologies. However, it remains a challenge to develop self&#8208;adhesive materials with strong adhesion while maintaining its intrinsic softness for efficient tackiness. Here, a peeling&#8211;stiffening self&#8208;adhesive ionogel that reconciles the seemingly contradictory properties of softness and strong adhesion is reported. The ionogel contains two ionophilic repeating units with distinct associating affinities, which allows to adaptively wet rough surface in the soft dissipating state for adhering, and to dramatically stiffen to the glassy state upon peeling. The corresponding modulus increases by 117 times driven by strain&#8208;rate&#8208;induced phase separation, which greatly suppresses crack propagation and results in a super high interfacial toughness of 8046 J m&#8722;2. The self&#8208;adhesive ionogel is also transparent, self&#8208;healable, recyclable, and can be easily removed by simple moisture treatment. This strategy provides a new way to design high&#8208;performance self&#8208;adhesive materials for intelligent soft devices.

         <title>Frank Partial Dislocations in Coplanar Ir/C Ultrathin Nanosheets Boost Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin nanosheets consisting of Ir nanoparticles with rich Frank partial dislocations (FPDs) and carbon in a coplanar structure (Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs) are synthesized first by using a nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature thermal shock method (&gt;1200&#160;&#176;C) and KBr template&#8208;assisted techniques. The Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs exhibit excellent catalytic performance due to ultrathin nanosheet structures with both FPDs and coplanar surfaces.








Abstract
Developing highly active and stable acidic hydrogen evolution catalysts is of great significance and challenge for the long&#8208;term operation of commercial proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. In this work, coplanar ultrathin nanosheets composed of rich&#8208;Frank partial dislocations (FPDs) are first synthesized. Ir nanoparticles and carbon (Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs) use a nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature thermal shock method (&gt;1200 &#176;C) and KBr template&#8208;assisted techniques. Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs exhibit excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance with a remarkably high mass activity of 6.64 A mg&#8722;1 at 50 mV, which is among the best Ir&#8208;based catalysts.In addition, Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs are able to operate stably at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 for 200 h as a cathode in a PEM electrolyser, and the original coplanar ultrathin nanosheets structure are maintained after the test, demonstrating excellent stability against stacking and agglomeration. Geometrical phase analysis and theoretical calculations show that the FPDs produce a 4% compressive strain in the Dr&#8208;Ir/C NSs, and the compressive strain weaken the adsorption of H* by Ir, thus increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescence Imaging of Chemotherapy&#8208;Induced Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly bright near&#8208;infrared chemiluminophore is synthesized and developed into a water&#8208;soluble activatable probe (CalCL) for in vivo imaging of drug&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy.








Abstract
Chemotherapy&#8208;induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) has a high prevalence but is poorly managed for cancer patients due to the lack of reliable and sensitive diagnostic techniques. Molecular optical imaging can provide a noninvasive way for real&#8208;time monitoring of CIPN; However, this is not reported, likely due to the absence of optical probes capable of imaging deep into the spinal canal and possessing sufficient sensitivity for minimal dosage through local injection into the dorsal root ganglia. Herein, a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) chemiluminophore (MPBD) with a chemiluminescence quantum yield higher than other reported probes is synthesized and a NIR activatable chemiluminescent probe (CalCL) is developed for in vivo imaging of CIPN. CalCL is constructed by caging MPBD with calpain&#8208;cleavable peptide moiety while conjugating polyethylene glycol chain to endow water solubility. Due to the deep&#8208;tissue penetration of chemiluminescence and specific turn&#8208;on response of CalCL toward calpain (a hallmark of CIPN), it allows for sensitive detection of paclitaxel&#8208;mediated CIPN in living mice, which is unattainable by fluorescence imaging. This study thus not only develops a highly efficient chemiluminescent probe, but also presents the first optical imaging approach toward high&#8208;throughput screening of neurotoxic drugs.

         <title>Hydrated Eutectic Electrolyte Induced Bilayer Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries with 100&#160;&#176;C Wide&#8208;Temperature Range</title>

The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is hindered by challenges such as dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and severe decay in harsh environments. A new&#8208;type hydrated eutectic electrolyte is developed to in situ form a zincophobic/zincophilic bilayer interphase, thereby improving the reversibility of AZIBs over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The practical implementation of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) encounters challenges such as dendrite growth, parasitic reactions, and severe decay in battery performance under harsh environments. Here, a novel hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) composed of Zn(ClO4)2&#183;6H2O, ethylene glycol (EG), and InCl3 solution is introduced to effectively extend the lifespan of AZIBs over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C. Molecular dynamics simulations and spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that the H2O molecules are confined within the liquid eutectic network through dual&#8208;interaction, involving coordination with Zn2+ and hydrogen bonding with EG, thus weakening the activity of free water and extending the electrochemical window. Importantly, cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy techniques reveal that HEE in situ forms a zincophobic/zincophilic bilayer interphase by the dissociation&#8208;reduction of eutectic molecules. Specifically, the zincophilic interphase reduces the energy barrier for Zn nucleation, promoting uniform Zn deposition, while the zincophobic interphase prevents active water from contacting the Zn surface, thus inhibiting the side reactions. Furthermore, the relationships between the structural evolution of the liquid eutectic network and interfacial chemistry at electrode/electrolyte interphase are further discussed in this work. The scalability of this design strategy can bring benefits to AZIBs operating over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Nonepitaxial Wafer&#8208;Scale Single&#8208;Crystal 2D Materials on Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy of nonepitaxial synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on arbitrary insulating substrates is presented. The metal foil in a nonadhered metal&#8211;insulator substrate system is almost melted by a brief high&#8208;temperature treatment, thereby pressing the as&#8208;grown 2D layers to well attach onto the insulators. The findings of this study provide a universal epitaxial platform for single&#8208;crystal 2D material production.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation nanodevices require 2D material synthesis on insulating substrates. However, growing high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;layered materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and graphene, on insulators is challenging owing to the lack of suitable metal catalysts, imperfect lattice matching with substrates, and other factors. Therefore, developing a generally applicable approach for realizing high&#8208;quality 2D layers on insulators remains crucial, despite numerous strategies being explored. Herein, a universal strategy is introduced for the nonepitaxial synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on arbitrary insulating substrates. The metal foil in a nonadhered metal&#8211;insulator substrate system is almost melted by a brief high&#8208;temperature treatment, thereby pressing the as&#8208;grown 2D layers to well attach onto the insulators. High&#8208;quality, large&#8208;area, single&#8208;crystal, monolayer hBN and graphene films are synthesized on various insulating substrates. This strategy provides new pathways for synthesizing various 2D materials on arbitrary insulators and offers a universal epitaxial platform for future single&#8208;crystal film production.

         <title>Longevous Cycling of Rechargeable Zn&#8208;Air Battery Enabled by &#8220;Raisin&#8208;Bread&#8221; Cobalt Oxynitride/Porous Carbon Hybrid Electrocatalysts</title>

         <dc:description>
The design of &#8220;Raisin&#8208;bread&#8221; architecture for bifunctional hybrid electrocatalyst enables the Zn&#8208;air battery to exhibit a longevous cyclability exceeding 1350&#160;h. It is realized through synergistic combination of (i) cobalt oxynitride as the protective shell, (ii) defect&#8208;rich active sites resulting from in&#8208;situ nitridation and strong coupling between cobalt raisin and surrounding 3D conductive bread, and (iii) enhanced mass and charge transportation via the boosted active surface and porosity.








Abstract
Developing commercially viable electrocatalyst lies at the research hotspot of rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries, but it is still challenging to meet the requirements of energy efficiency and durability in realistic applications. Strategic material design is critical to addressing its drawbacks in terms of sluggish kinetics of oxygen reactions and limited battery lifespan. Herein, a &#8220;raisin&#8208;bread&#8221; architecture is designed for a hybrid catalyst constituting cobalt nitride as the core nanoparticle with thin oxidized coverings, which is further deposited within porous carbon aerogel. Based on synchrotron&#8208;based characterizations, this hybrid provides oxygen vacancies and Co&#8208;Nx&#8208;C sites as the active sites, resulting from a strong coupling between CoOxNy nanoparticles and 3D conductive carbon scaffolds. Compared to the oxide reference, it performs enhanced stability in harsh electrocatalytic environments, highlighting the benefits of the oxynitride. Furthermore, the 3D conductive scaffolds improve charge/mass transportation and boost durability of these active sites. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the introduced N species into hybrid can synergistically tune the d&#8208;band center of cobalt and improve its bifunctional activity. As a result, the obtained air cathode exhibits bifunctional overpotential of 0.65&#160;V and a battery lifetime exceeding 1350 h, which sets a new record for rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery reported so far.

         <title>Specific Propyne Trapping Sites within a Robust MOF for Efficient Propyne/Propadiene Separation with Record Propadiene Productivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemically robust metal organic framework CuZrF6&#8208;TPA with specific propyne trapping sites and multiple supramolecular interactions is reported for benchmark propyne/propadiene separation with record productivity of pure propadiene (4.7 mol L&#8722;1).








Abstract
Separating propyne/propadiene to produce pure propadiene is extremely challenging in industry due to their similar properties. Herein, a novel ZrF62&#8722; anion pillared cage&#8208;like metal&#8208;organic framework (termed as CuZrF6&#8208;TPA) for highly efficient propyne/propadiene separation is reported. It exhibits high propyne capacity (177.4/188.6 cm3/cm3 at 0.5/1.0 bar and 298 K), benchmark separation selectivity (6.0), and remarkable separation potential (5.7 mol L&#8722;1) simultaneously. Record propadiene productivity (&#8776;4.7 mol L&#8722;1) is achieved through a single adsorption process in breakthrough experiments with excellent recycle stability even under humid conditions. Based on the structure of propyne&#8208;loaded single crystals, two binding sites are identified, including a major propyne trapping site at the windows and a minor binding site located in the large cages. Modelling studies further confirm that the contracted cage windows surrounded with rotating Lewis basic F atoms and aromatic rings are the optimal bonding sites to capture propyne with multiple hydrogen bonding and &#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions.

         <title>&#8220;Soggy&#8208;Sand&#8221; Chemistry for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

&#8216;Soggy&#8208;sand&#8217; electrolytes are designed for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. By acting to decrease the water molecules' reactivity, aiding in uniform zinc deposition, and capturing anions to hasten Zn2+ transport, &#8216;soggy&#8208;sand&#8217; electrolytes address several of the core challenges faced by conventional electrolytes. This work provides a new concept for activating the electrochemical properties of aqueous rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
The narrow electrochemical stability window, deleterious side reactions, and zinc dendrites prevent the use of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Here, aqueous &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; electrolytes (synergistic electrolyte&#8208;insulator dispersions) are developed for achieving high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8208;ion batteries. How these electrolytes bring a unique combination of benefits, synergizing the advantages of solid and liquid electrolytes is revealed. The oxide additions adsorb water molecules and trap anions, causing a network of space charge layers with increased Zn2+ transference number and reduced interfacial resistance. They beneficially modify the hydrogen bond network and solvation structures, thereby influencing the mechanical and electrochemical properties, and causing the Mn2+ in the solution to be oxidized. As a result, the best performing Al2O3&#8208;based &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; electrolyte exhibits a long life&#160;of 2500 h in Zn||Zn cells. Furthermore, it increases the charging cut&#8208;off voltage for Zn/MnO2 cells to 2&#160;V, achieving higher specific capacities. Even with amass loading of 10 mgMnO2 cm&#8722;2, it yields a promising specific capacity of 189 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles. The concept of &#8220;soggy&#8208;sand&#8221; chemistry provides a new approach to design powerful and universal electrolytes for aqueous batteries.

         <title>Enhancing Deep&#8208;Seated Melanoma Therapy through Wearable Self&#8208;Powered Microneedle Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a wearable, self&#8208;powered MN patch (termed F&#8208;MN patch) that integrates a flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG), aimed at advancing deep&#8208;seated tumor therapy. The F&#8208;MN patch harnesses personal mechanical movements to generate electrical energy, driving delivered therapeutic drugs to deeper locations in the skin and achieving superior therapeutic efficacy in treating solid tumors in deep site.








Abstract
Effective treatment of deep&#8208;seated tumors relies on enhanced drug penetration in transdermal drug delivery systems. While microneedles (MNs) and iontophoresis techniques have shown improved transdermal drug delivery efficiency, challenges such as skin elasticity, high electrical resistance of the stratum corneum, and external power supply requirements hinder their efficacy in treating deep&#8208;seated tumors. In this study, a wearable, self&#8208;powered MN patch that integrates a flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG) is presented, aimed at advancing deep&#8208;seated tumor therapy. MNs are composed of water&#8208;soluble materials mixed with negatively charged pH&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with therapeutic drugs. The F&#8208;TENG harnesses personal mechanical movements generate electrical energy. Leveraging the advantages of both MNs and F&#8208;TENG, therapeutic NPs can penetrate deep skin locations upon MN patch insertion, releasing drugs rapidly in acidic tumor tissues. Owing to these features, a single administration of the integrated MN&#8208;patch in a mouse model with deep&#8208;seated melanoma exhibits superior therapeutic efficacy in inhibiting deep&#8208;located tumor compared to using the MN&#8208;patch alone, indicating promising potential for treating tumors at deep sites.

         <title>Negative Enthalpy Variation Drives Rapid Recovery in Thermoplastic Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The resilience of thermoplastic polyurethane continuously deteriorates during long&#8208;range deformation, mainly caused by the dynamics of the physical crosslink networks. This study clarifies the effect of negative enthalpy variation on long&#8208;range resilience through the construction elastomers with dual soft segments. This approach supplements the classic theory of entropy elasticity, which traditionally ignores intermolecular interactions.








Abstract
The mechanism behind the resilience of polymeric materials, typically attributed to the well&#8208;established entropy elasticity, often ignores the contribution of enthalpy variation (&#916;H), because it is based on the assumption of an ideal chain. However, this model does not fully account for the reduced resilience of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) during long&#8208;range deformation, which is mainly caused by the dynamics of physical crosslink networks. Such reduction is undesirable for long&#8208;range stretchable TPU considering its wide application range. Therefore, a negative &#916;H effect is established in this work to facilitate instant recovery in long&#8208;range stretchable TPU, achieved by constructing a reversible interim interface via strain&#8208;induced phase separation. Consequently, the newly constructed dual soft segmental TPU shows resilience efficiency exceeding 95%, surpassing many synthetic high&#8208;performance TPUs with typical efficiencies below 80%, and comparable to biomaterials. Moreover, a remarkable hysteresis loop with a ratio exceeding 50%, makes it a viable candidate for applications such as artificial ligaments or buffer belts. The research also clarifies structural factors influencing resilience, including the symmetry of the dual soft segments and the content of hard segments, offering valuable insights for the design of highly resilient long&#8208;range stretchable elastomers.

         <title>Unconventional Synthesis of Hierarchically Twinned Copper as Efficient Electrocatalyst for Nitrate&#8211;Ammonia Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surfactant&#8208;free and facile strategy is developed for synthesizing copper (Cu) nanocatalysts with dense hierarchical twin boundary networks (HTBs) by the rapid thermal reductions in metastable CuO nanosheets in H2. It is found that the HTBs can significantly promote the Cu&#8208;catalyzed reduction of nitrate to generate ammonia.








Abstract
Twin boundary (TB) engineering provides exciting opportunities to tune the performance levels of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, the controllable construction of TB greatly relies on surfactants, blocking active sites, and electron transfer by surfactants. Here, a surfactant&#8208;free and facile strategy is proposed for synthesizing copper (Cu) nanocatalysts with dense hierarchical TB networks (HTBs) by the rapid thermal reductions in metastable CuO nanosheets in H2. As revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy, the formation of HTBs is associated with the fragmentation of nanosheets in different directions to generate abundant crystal nuclei and subsequently unconventional crystal growth through the collision and coalescence of nuclei. Impressively, the HTBs endow Cu with excellent electrocatalytic performance for direct nitrate&#8211;ammonia conversion, superior to that of Cu with a single&#8208;oriented TB and without TB. It is discovered that the HTBs induce the formation of compressive strains, thereby creating a synergistic effect of TBs and strains to efficiently tune the binding energies of Cu with nitrogen intermediates (i.e., NO2*) and thus promote the tandem reaction process of NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NO2&#8722; and subsequent NO2&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis. This work demonstrates the crucial role of HTBs for boosting electrocatalysis via the synergistic effect of TBs and strains.

         <title>Thermal Disorder&#8208;Induced Strain and Carrier Localization Activate Reverse Halide Segregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceeding thermal disorder&#8208;induced strain (TDIS) over light&#8208;induced strain can eliminate the photoexcitation&#8208;induced strain gradient responsible for segregation. Simultaneously, dynamic disorder&#8208;inducing polaron localization significantly reduces excess carrier density, thereby mitigating the impact of light&#8208;induced strain. As a result, entropy dominates the system's free energy. These insights highlight the importance of strain homogenization for stable&#8208;phase, mixed&#8208;halide perovskites.








Abstract
The reversal of halide ions is studied under various conditions. However, the underlying mechanism of heat&#8208;induced reversal remains unclear. This work finds that dynamic disorder&#8208;induced localization of self&#8208;trapped polarons and thermal disorder&#8208;induced strain (TDIS) can be co&#8208;acting drivers of reverse segregation. Localization of polarons results in an order of magnitude decrease in excess carrier density (polaron population), causing a reduced impact of the light&#8208;induced strain (LIS &#8211; responsible for segregation) on the perovskite framework. Meanwhile, exposing the lattice to TDIS exceeding the LIS can eliminate the photoexcitation&#8208;induced strain gradient, as thermal fluctuations of the lattice can mask the LIS strain. Under continuous 0.1&#160;W&#160;cm&#8315;2 illumination (upon segregation), the strain disorder is estimated to be 0.14%, while at 80&#160;&#176;C under dark conditions, the strain is 0.23%. However, in situ heating of the segregated film to 80&#160;&#176;C under continuous illumination (upon reversal) increases the total strain disorder to 0.25%, where TDIS is likely to have a dominant contribution. Therefore, the contribution of entropy to the system's free energy is likely to dominate, respectively. Various temperature&#8208;dependent in situ measurements and simulations further support the results. These findings highlight the importance of strain homogenization for designing stable perovskites under real&#8208;world operating conditions.

     alt="Thermal Disorder-Induced Strain and Carrier Localization Activate Reverse Halide Segregation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exceeding thermal disorder-induced strain (TDIS) over light-induced strain can eliminate the photoexcitation-induced strain gradient responsible for segregation. Simultaneously, dynamic disorder-inducing polaron localization significantly reduces excess carrier density, thereby mitigating the impact of light-induced strain. As a result, entropy dominates the system's free energy. These insights highlight the importance of strain homogenization for stable-phase, mixed-halide perovskites.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reversal of halide ions is studied under various conditions. However, the underlying mechanism of heat-induced reversal remains unclear. This work finds that dynamic disorder-induced localization of self-trapped polarons and thermal disorder-induced strain (TDIS) can be co-acting drivers of reverse segregation. Localization of polarons results in an order of magnitude decrease in excess carrier density (polaron population), causing a reduced impact of the light-induced strain (LIS &#8211; responsible for segregation) on the perovskite framework. Meanwhile, exposing the lattice to TDIS exceeding the LIS can eliminate the photoexcitation-induced strain gradient, as thermal fluctuations of the lattice can mask the LIS strain. Under continuous 0.1&#160;W&#160;cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; illumination (upon segregation), the strain disorder is estimated to be 0.14%, while at 80&#160;&#176;C under dark conditions, the strain is 0.23%. However, in situ heating of the segregated film to 80&#160;&#176;C under continuous illumination (upon reversal) increases the total strain disorder to 0.25%, where TDIS is likely to have a dominant contribution. Therefore, the contribution of entropy to the system's free energy is likely to dominate, respectively. Various temperature-dependent in situ measurements and simulations further support the results. These findings highlight the importance of strain homogenization for designing stable perovskites under real-world operating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy Layered Perovskite Coated with In Situ Exsolved Core&#8208;Shell CuFe@FeOx Nanoparticles for Efficient CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here a new SOEC cathode material is reported for CO2 electrolysis, composed of high&#8208;entropy Pr0.8Sr1.2(CuFe)0.4Mo0.2Mn0.2Nb0.2O4&#8208;&#948; (HE&#8208;PSCFMMN) perovskite uniformly coated with in situ exsolved core&#8208;shell structured CuFe@FeOx (CFA@FeO) nanoparticles. The presence of abundant oxygen vacancies in both the HE&#8208;PSCFMMN substrate and the FeOx shell facilitates the extension of the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) from the CFA@FeO/HE&#8208;PSCFMMN interface to the entire FeOx shell, thereby enhancing the kinetics of CO2 adsorption, dissociation, and reduction.








Abstract
Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are promising energy conversion devices capable of efficiently transforming CO2 into CO, reducing CO2 emissions, and alleviating the greenhouse effect. However, the development of a suitable cathode material remains a critical challenge. Here a new SOEC cathode is reported for CO2 electrolysis consisting of high&#8208;entropy Pr0.8Sr1.2(CuFe)0.4Mo0.2Mn0.2Nb0.2O4&#8208;&#948; (HE&#8208;PSCFMMN) layered perovskite uniformly coated with in situ exsolved core&#8208;shell structured CuFe alloy@FeOx (CFA@FeO) nanoparticles. Single cells with the HE&#8208;PSCFMMN&#8208;CFA@FeO cathode exhibit a consistently high current density of 1.95 A cm&#8722;2 for CO2 reduction at 1.5&#160;V while maintaining excellent stability for up to 200 h under 0.75 A cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C in pure CO2. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the exsolution of CFA@FeO nanoparticles introduces additional oxygen vacancies within HE&#8208;PSCFMMN substrate, acting as active reaction sites. More importantly, the abundant oxygen vacancies in FeOx shell, in contrast to conventional in situ exsolved nanoparticles, enable the extension of the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB), thereby enhancing the kinetics of CO2 adsorption, dissociation, and reduction.

         <title>In Situ Growth of High&#8208;Quality Single&#8208;Crystal Twisted Bilayer Graphene on Liquid Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition growth technique for single&#8208;crystal TBG with a wide range of twist angles on liquid copper substrates is reported. The clean surface, high crystallinity, thermal stability, stacking structure, growth mechanism, and electrical transport properties of as&#8208;grown TBG are investigated. This work provides a convenient avenue for investigating the physical properties of TBG.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) generates significant attention in the fundamental research of 2D materials due to its distinct twist&#8208;angle&#8208;dependent properties. Exploring the efficient production of TBG with a wide range of twist angles stands as one of the major frontiers in moir&#233; materials. Here, the local space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition growth technique for high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal TBG with twist angles ranging from 0&#176; to 30&#176; on liquid copper substrates is reported. The clean surface, pristine interface, high crystallinity, and thermal stability of TBG are verified by using comprehensive characterization techniques including optical microscopy, electron microscopy, and secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry. The proportion of TBG in bilayer graphene reaches as high as 89%. In addition, the stacking structure and growth mechanism of TBG are investigated, revealing that the second graphene layer develops beneath the first one. A series of comparative experiments illustrates that the liquid copper surface, with its excellent fluidity, promotes the growth of TBG. Electrical measurements show the twist&#8208;angle&#8208;dependent electronic properties of as&#8208;grown TBG, achieving a room&#8208;temperature carrier mobility of 26640 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This work provides an approach for the in situ preparation of 2D twisted materials and facilitates the application of TBG in the fields of electronics.

         <title>Stacking&#8208;Controlled Growth of rBN Crystalline Films with High Nonlinear Optical Conversion Efficiency up to 1%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stacking&#8208;controlled continuous precipitation strategy is proposed to synthesize uniform rBN crystalline films (lateral size of 2 &#215; 1 cm2, thickness of &gt;1&#160;&#181;m) on the vicinal FeNi (111) single crystal. The rBN films with parallel stacked layers exhibit ultrahigh nonlinear optical response with the record&#8208;high frequency conversion efficiency of 1% in the 2D&#8208;material family.








Abstract
Nonlinear optical crystals lie at the core of ultrafast laser science and quantum communication technology. The emergence of 2D&#160;materials provides a revolutionary potential for nonlinear optical crystals due to their exceptionally high nonlinear coefficients. However, uncontrolled stacking orders generally induce the destructive nonlinear response due to the optical phase deviation in different 2D layers. Therefore, conversion efficiency of 2D nonlinear crystals is typically limited to less than 0.01% (far below the practical criterion of &gt;1%). Here, crystalline films of rhombohedral boron nitride (rBN) with parallel stacked layers are controllably synthesized. This success is realized by the utilization of vicinal FeNi (111) single crystal, where both the unidirectional arrangement of BN grains into a single&#8208;crystal monolayer and the continuous precipitation of (B,N) source for thick layers are guaranteed. The preserved in&#8208;plane inversion asymmetry in rBN films keeps the in&#8208;phase second&#8208;harmonic generation field in every layer and leads to a record&#8208;high conversion efficiency of 1% in the whole family of 2D materials within the coherence thickness of only 1.6&#160;&#181;m. The work provides a route for designing ultrathin nonlinear optical crystals from 2D materials, and will promote the on&#8208;demand fabrication of integrated photonic and compact quantum optical devices.

An application to secure wired communications and the observation of exceptional points of PT$\mathcal {PT}$&#8208;symmetric reflectionless states are achieved in complex metamaterials without apparent symmetry, including cases with non&#8208;reciprocal interactions between meta&#8208;atoms.








Abstract
Symmetries and tunability are of fundamental importance in wave scattering control, but symmetries are often obvious upon visual inspection, which constitutes a significant vulnerability of metamaterial wave devices to reverse&#8208;engineering risks. Here, it is theoretically and experimentally shown that a symmetry in the reduced basis of the &#8220;primary meta&#8208;atoms&#8221; that are directly connected to the outside world is sufficient; meanwhile, a suitable topology of non&#8208;local interactions between them, mediated by the internal &#8220;secondary&#8221; meta&#8208;atoms, can hide the symmetry from sight in the canonical basis. Covert symmetry&#8208;based scattering control in a cable&#8208;network metamaterial featuring a hidden parity (P$\mathcal {P}$) symmetry in combination with hidden&#8208;P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry&#8208;preserving and hidden&#8208;P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking tuning mechanisms is experimentally demonstrated. Physical&#8208;layer security in wired communications is achieved using the domain&#8208;wise hidden P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry as a shared secret between the sender and the legitimate receiver. Within the approximation of negligible absorption, the first tuning of a complex scattering metamaterial without mirror symmetry to feature exceptional points (EPs) of PT$\mathcal {PT}$&#8208;symmetric reflectionless states, as well as quasi&#8208;bound states in the continuum, is reported. These results are reproduced in metamaterials involving non&#8208;reciprocal interactions between meta&#8208;atoms, including the first observation of reflectionless EPs in a non&#8208;reciprocal&#160;system.

         <title>Indoor Photovoltaic Fiber with an Efficiency of 25.53% under 1500 Lux Illumination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>

A highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized indoor photovoltaic fiber is designed with a photoanode made from a hybrid TiO2 layer on Ti wire and a counter electrode composed of an aligned carbon nanotube sheet on metal fiber, showing a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.53% under 1500&#160;lux illuminance. These IPVFs can supply electricity for wearables, providing a mobile power solution indoors.








Abstract
Photovoltaic devices represent an efficient electricity generation mode. Integrating them into textiles offers exciting opportunities for smart electronic textiles&#8212;with the ultimate goal of supplying power for wearable technology&#8212;which is poised to change how electronic devices are designed. Many human activities occur indoors, so realizing indoor photovoltaic fibers (IPVFs) that can be woven into textiles to power wearables is critical, although currently unavailable. Here, a dye&#8208;sensitized IPVF is constructed by incorporating titanium dioxide nanoparticles into aligned nanotubes to produce close contact and stable interfaces among active layers on a curved fiber substrate, thus presenting efficient charge transport and low charge recombination in the photoanode. With the combination of highly conductive core&#8211;sheath Ti/carbon nanotube fiber as a counter electrode, the IPVF shows a certified power conversion efficiency of 25.53% under 1500&#160;lux illuminance. Its performance variation is below 5% after bending, twisting, or pressing for 1000 cycles. These IPVFs are&#160;further integrated with fiber batteries as self&#8208;charging power textiles, which are&#160;demonstrated to effectively supply electricity for wearables, solving the power supply problem in this important direction.

Contact engineering combined with continuous processing yields fiber&#8208;organic electrochemical transistors and neuromorphic devices with mobility greater than 45 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and &#956;C* product greater than 1500&#160;F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
The latest developments in fiber design and materials science are paving the way for fibers to evolve from parts in passive components to functional parts in active fabrics. Designing conformable, organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) structures using poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) fibers has excellent potential for low&#8208;cost wearable bioelectronics, bio&#8208;hybrid devices, and adaptive neuromorphic technologies. However, to achieve high&#8208;performance, stable devices from PEDOT:PSS fibers, approaches are required to form electrodes on fibers with small diameters and poor wettability, that leads to irregular coatings. Additionally, PEDOT:PSS&#8208;fiber fabrication needs to move away from small batch processing to roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll or continuous processing. Here, it is shown that synergistic effects from a superior electrode/organic interface, and exceptional fiber alignment from continuous processing, enable PEDOT:PSS fiber&#8208;OECTs with stable contacts, high &#181;C* product (1570.5 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), and high hole mobility over 45 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Fiber&#8208;electrochemical neuromorphic organic devices (fiber&#8208;ENODes) are developed to demonstrate that the high mobility fibers are promising building blocks for future bio&#8208;hybrid technologies. The fiber&#8208;ENODes demonstrate synaptic weight update in response to dopamine, as well as a form factor closely matching the neuronal axon terminal.

         <title>Spatially Selective Solvation Structure by Electronegative Micro&#8208;Arrays for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite (nHA) exhibits a high Li+ binding energy of &#8722;5.99 eV. With nHA micro&#8208;arrays on the Cu foil, a locally Li+&#8208;rich region forms at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, which can promote the generation of aggregates (AGGs) of anions. The decomposition efficiency of anions is significantly improved, leading to the formation of a more protective solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film.








Abstract
For electrolytes with conventional lithium salt concentration, it is not easy to generate sufficient anion&#8208;derived beneficial inorganic components to stabilize the electrolyte&#8208;lithium metal anode interface due to the repulsion of the free&#8208;state anions by the anode. In this study, the above issues are solved through the strong interaction between electronegative materials and lithium ions (Li+). A locally high Li+ concentration strategy is proposed by preparing micro&#8208;arrays of electronegative nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite (nHA) on the Cu foil. It is found that the oxygen&#160;atoms in the phosphate group (&#8208;PO4) of the nHA can strongly adsorb Li+ to form a locally Li+&#8208;rich region, which increases the probability of anions interacting with Li+. The formation of more Li+&#8208;coordinated anions at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface can reduce the Li+ de&#8208;solvation energy barrier, and enable the anions to completely decompose into lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium nitride (Li3N) on the Li metal anode. The interfacial transfer dynamics is accelerated and the Li dendrites are effectively suppressed. Under high current density, the anode exhibits a long lifespan with high Coulombic efficiency and small polarization voltage. The nHA micro&#8208;arrays achieve the targeted solvation structure at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface while ensuring conventional lithium salt concentration in the bulk electrolyte.

         <title>Thorough Optimization for Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
is&#8208;OPVs with a record efficiency of 16.23%, excellent flexibility and commendable stretchability are achieved by delicate optimizations from material to device, especially the elastic polymer SEPS&#8208;containing active layer and conductive polymer/metal (M&#8208;PH1000@Ag) composite electrode.








Abstract
The development of intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) with a high efficiency is of significance for practical application. However, their efficiencies lag far behind those of rigid or even flexible counterparts. To address this issue, an advanced top&#8208;illuminated OPV is designed and fabricated, which is intrinsically stretchable and has a high performance, through systematic optimizations from material to device. First, the stretchability of the active layer is largely increased by adding a low&#8208;elastic&#8208;modulus elastomer of styrene&#8208;ethylene&#8208;propylene&#8208;styrene tri&#8208;block copolymer (SEPS). Second, the stretchability and conductivity of the opaque electrode are enhanced by a conductive polymer/metal (denoted as M&#8208;PH1000@Ag) composite electrode strategy. Third, the optical and electrical properties of a sliver nanowire transparent electrode are improved by a solvent vapor annealing strategy. High&#8208;performance is&#8208;OPVs are successfully fabricated with a top&#8208;illuminated structure, which provides a record&#8208;high efficiency of 16.23%. Additionally, by incorporating 5&#8211;10% elastomer, a balance between the efficiency and stretchability of the is&#8208;OPVs is achieved. This study provides valuable insights into material and device optimizations for high&#8208;efficiency is&#8208;OPVs, with a low&#8208;cost production and excellent stretchability, which indicates a high potential for future applications of OPVs.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;-OPVs with a record efficiency of 16.23%, excellent flexibility and commendable stretchability are achieved by delicate optimizations from material to device, especially the elastic polymer SEPS-containing active layer and conductive polymer/metal (M-PH1000@Ag) composite electrode.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (&lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;-OPVs) with a high efficiency is of significance for practical application. However, their efficiencies lag far behind those of rigid or even flexible counterparts. To address this issue, an advanced top-illuminated OPV is designed and fabricated, which is intrinsically stretchable and has a high performance, through systematic optimizations from material to device. First, the stretchability of the active layer is largely increased by adding a low-elastic-modulus elastomer of styrene-ethylene-propylene-styrene tri-block copolymer (SEPS). Second, the stretchability and conductivity of the opaque electrode are enhanced by a conductive polymer/metal (denoted as M-PH1000@Ag) composite electrode strategy. Third, the optical and electrical properties of a sliver nanowire transparent electrode are improved by a solvent vapor annealing strategy. High-performance &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;-OPVs are successfully fabricated with a top-illuminated structure, which provides a record-high efficiency of 16.23%. Additionally, by incorporating 5&#8211;10% elastomer, a balance between the efficiency and stretchability of the &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;-OPVs is achieved. This study provides valuable insights into material and device optimizations for high-efficiency &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt;-OPVs, with a low-cost production and excellent stretchability, which indicates a high potential for future applications of OPVs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vacancy Defects Inductive Effect of Asymmetrically Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Fe&#9472;N3S1 Active Sites for Robust Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction with High Turnover Frequency and Mass Activity</title>

An innovative method for synthesizing carbon&#8208;supported asymmetrically coordinated single&#8208;atom catalysts with abundant vacancy defects is reported for promoting the oxygen reduction reaction with high intrinsic activity.








Abstract
The development of facile, efficient synthesis method to construct low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is extremely important, yet still challenging. Herein, an atomically dispersed N, S co&#8208;doped carbon with abundant vacancy defects (NSC&#8208;vd) anchored Fe single atoms (SAs) is reported and a vacancy defects inductive effect is proposed for promoting electrocatalytic ORR. The optimized catalyst featured of stable Fe&#9472;N3S1 active sites exhibits excellent ORR activity with high turnover frequency and mass activity. In situ Raman, attenuated total reflectance surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy reveal the Fe&#9472;N3S1 active sites exhibit different kinetic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline solutions. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra&#160;reveal the ORR activity of Fe SAs/NSC&#8208;vd catalyst in different electrolyte is closely related to the coordination structure. Theoretical calculation reveals the upshifted d band center of Fe&#9472;N3S1 active sites facilitates the adsorption of O2 and accelerates the kinetics process of *OH reduction. The abundant vacancy defects around the Fe&#9472;N3S1 active sites balance the OOH* formation and *OH reduction, thus synergetically promoting the electrocatalytic ORR process.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Hydrogel Sensors Enabled Multimodal and Accurate Human&#8211;Machine Interaction System for Active Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes high&#8208;performance hydrogel sensors enabled multimodal human&#8211;machine interaction system to address the issue of weak signals in human&#8211;computer interaction from stroke or myasthenia patients, which can detect high&#8208;quality electromyogram and muscle deformation signals and couple them to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and high&#8208;accuracy interaction.








Abstract
Human&#8211;machine interaction (HMI) technology shows an important application prospect in rehabilitation medicine, but it is greatly limited by the unsatisfactory recognition accuracy and wearing comfort. Here, this work develops a fully flexible, conformable, and functionalized multimodal HMI interface consisting of hydrogel&#8208;based sensors and a self&#8208;designed flexible printed circuit board. Thanks to the component regulation and structural design of the hydrogel, both electromyogram (EMG) and forcemyography (FMG) signals can be collected accurately and stably, so that they are later decoded with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI). Compared with traditional multichannel EMG signals, the multimodal human&#8211;machine interaction method based on the combination of EMG and FMG signals significantly improves the efficiency of human&#8211;machine interaction by increasing the information entropy of the interaction signals. The decoding accuracy of the interaction signals from only two channels for different gestures reaches 91.28%. The resulting AI&#8208;powered active rehabilitation system can control a pneumatic robotic glove to assist stroke patients in completing movements according to the recognized human motion intention. Moreover, this HMI interface is further generalized and applied to other remote sensing platforms, such as manipulators, intelligent cars, and drones, paving the way for the design of future intelligent robot systems.

         <title>Platinum Prodrug Nanoparticles with COX&#8208;2 Inhibition Amplify Pyroptosis for Enhanced Chemotherapy and Immune Activation of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic polymer (PHDT&#8208;Pt&#8208;In) incorporating a Pt(IV) prodrug and indomethacin (In) is developed here. PHDT&#8208;Pt&#8208;In can further self&#8208;assemble to form Pt&#8208;In NP, which overcomes the chemoresistance and amplifies cisplatin&#8208;induced pyroptosis. Overall, this platform holds great promise for improving the immune response of platinum drugs, which presents a generalizable strategy for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, an emerging mechanism of programmed cell death, holds great potential to trigger a robust antitumor immune response. Platinum&#8208;based chemotherapeutic agents can induce pyroptosis via caspase&#8208;3 activation. However, these agents also enhance cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) expression in tumor tissues, leading to drug resistance and immune evasion in pancreatic cancer and significantly limiting the effectiveness of chemotherapy&#8208;induced pyroptosis. Here, an amphiphilic polymer (denoted as PHDT&#8208;Pt&#8208;In) containing both indomethacin (In, a COX&#8208;2 inhibitor) and platinum(IV) prodrug (Pt(IV)) is developed, which is responsive to glutathione (GSH). This polymer self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (denoted as Pt&#8208;In NP) that can disintegrate in cancer cells due to the GSH responsiveness, releasing In to inhibit the COX&#8208;2 expression, hence overcoming the chemoresistance and amplifying cisplatin&#8208;induced pyroptosis. In a pancreatic cancer mouse model, Pt&#8208;In NP significantly inhibit tumor growth and elicit both innate and adaptive immune responses. Moreover, when combined with anti&#8208;programmed death ligand (&#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) treatment, Pt&#8208;In NP demonstrate the ability to completely suppress metastatic tumors, transforming &#8220;cold tumors&#8221; into &#8220;hot tumors&#8221;. Overall, the sustained release of Pt(IV) and In from Pt&#8208;In NP amplifies platinum&#8208;drug&#8208;induced pyroptosis to elicit long&#8208;term immune responses, hence presenting a generalizable strategy for pancreatic cancer.

         <title>Efficient Flow Synthesis of Aspirin within 2D Sub&#8208;Nanoconfined Laminar Annealed Graphene Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D sub&#8208;nanoconfined annealed graphene oxide membranes are constructed for efficient synthesis of aspirin in directional flow. The reaction shows &#8776;100% conversion in an unprecedented short reaction time of &lt;6.36 s at 23 &#176;C. Density functional theory calculation indicates the synergistic effect of spatial confinement and surface electronic structure plays an important role in the efficient reaction.








Abstract
The aim of this work is to develop an environmentally friendly, safe, and simple route for realizing efficient preparation of aspirin. Here, inspired by enzyme synthesis in vivo, the aspirin synthesis has been realized by sub&#8208;nanoconfined esterification with directional flow and &#8776;100% conversion in an unprecedented reaction time of &lt;6.36 s at 23 &#176;C. Such flow esterification reaction is catalyzed by thermally transformed graphene oxide (GO) membranes with tailored physicochemical properties, which can be obtained simply through a mild annealing method. A possible mechanism is revealed by density functional theory calculation, indicating that the synergistic effect of spatial confinement and surface electronic structure can significantly improve the catalytic performance. By restricting reactants within 2D sub&#8208;nano space created by GO&#8208;based laminar flow&#8208;reactors, the present strategy provides a new route to achieve rapid flow synthesis of aspirin with nearly complete conversion.

&lt;p&gt;The aim of this work is to develop an environmentally friendly, safe, and simple route for realizing efficient preparation of aspirin. Here, inspired by enzyme synthesis in vivo, the aspirin synthesis has been realized by sub-nanoconfined esterification with directional flow and &#8776;100% conversion in an unprecedented reaction time of &amp;lt;6.36 s at 23 &#176;C. Such flow esterification reaction is catalyzed by thermally transformed graphene oxide (GO) membranes with tailored physicochemical properties, which can be obtained simply through a mild annealing method. A possible mechanism is revealed by density functional theory calculation, indicating that the synergistic effect of spatial confinement and surface electronic structure can significantly improve the catalytic performance. By restricting reactants within 2D sub-nano space created by GO-based laminar flow-reactors, the present strategy provides a new route to achieve rapid flow synthesis of aspirin with nearly complete conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

3D Printing
3D printing of nematic self&#8208;assembling thermotropic liquid crystal polymers allows orientation control on the fly. This method enables the creation of intricate patterns which offer potential applications in functional structures with stiffness gradients and crack&#8208;mitigation strategies. This approach also facilitates the study and replication of nature&#8208;inspired patterns through extrusion 3D printing, such as the anisotropy formed by living organisms. More details can be found in article number 2307444 by Kunal Masania and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Heterojunction Engineering of Multinary Metal Sulfide&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of advanced semiconductor photocatalyst is of great significance for the realization of efficient photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) via water splitting. This review comprehensively summarizes the representative construction strategies of multinary&#8208;metal&#8208;sulfide&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts in PHE application, which provides guidance for accelerate the development of solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen and PHE via overall water splitting.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) via water splitting using semiconductor photocatalysts is an effective path to solve the current energy crisis and environmental pollution. Heterojunction photocatalysts, containing two or more semiconductors, exhibit better PHE rates than those with only one semiconductor owing to the altered band alignment at the interface and stronger driving force for charge separation. Traditional binary metal sulfide (BMS)&#8208;based heterojunction photocatalysts, such as CdS, MoS2, and PbS, demonstrate excellent PHE performance. However, the recently developed multinary metal sulfide (MMS)&#8208;based photocatalysts possess favorable chemical stability, tunable band structure, and flexible element compositions, and have considerable potential to realize higher PHE rates than those of BMSs. In this review article, the mechanism of PHE is first elucidated and then various single and heterojunction MMS&#8208;based photocatalysts and their charge transfer behaviors and PHE performances are systematically summarized. A perspective on potential future research directions in this field is concluded.

Multi&#8208;photon 3D laser printing is a rapidly growing field of interest for the fabrication of nano&#8208; and microscale 3D structures. This review highlights recent progress, challenges, and perspectives in four core areas of application, namely microrobotics, optics and photonics, microfluidics as well as life sciences with special emphasis on the implementation of new active materials.








Abstract
Since the pioneering work of Kawata and colleagues in 1997, multi&#8208;photon 3D laser printing, also known as direct laser writing, has made significant advancements in a wide range of fields. Moreover, the development and commercialization of photocurable inks for this technique have expanded rapidly. One of the current trends is the transition from static to active printable materials, often referred to as 4D microprinting, which enables a new degree of control in the printed systems. This review focuses on four primary application areas: microrobotics, optics and photonics, microfluidics, and life sciences, highlighting recent progress and the crucial role of active materials, including liquid crystalline elastomers, hydrogels, shape memory polymers, and composites, among others. It also addresses ongoing challenges and provides insights into the future prospects in the different fields.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the pioneering work of Kawata and colleagues in 1997, multi-photon 3D laser printing, also known as direct laser writing, has made significant advancements in a wide range of fields. Moreover, the development and commercialization of photocurable inks for this technique have expanded rapidly. One of the current trends is the transition from static to active printable materials, often referred to as 4D microprinting, which enables a new degree of control in the printed systems. This review focuses on four primary application areas: microrobotics, optics and photonics, microfluidics, and life sciences, highlighting recent progress and the crucial role of active materials, including liquid crystalline elastomers, hydrogels, shape memory polymers, and composites, among others. It also addresses ongoing challenges and provides insights into the future prospects in the different fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Understanding and Utilizing Droplet Impact on Superhydrophobic Surfaces: Phenomena, Mechanisms, Regulations, Applications, and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impacts of small droplets on nature&#8208;inspired superhydrophobic surfaces make invaluable contributions to the big world. This review summarizes the phenomena and mechanisms of droplet impact dynamics, demonstrates the regulation strategies using surface engineering, and discusses their utilization in diverse applications. Understanding and utilizing droplet impact is of vital significance for illuminating a sustainable future.








Abstract
Droplet impact is a ubiquitous liquid behavior that closely tied to human life and production, making indispensable impacts on the big world. Nature&#8208;inspired superhydrophobic surfaces provide a powerful platform for regulating droplet impact dynamics. The collision between classic phenomena of droplet impact and the advanced manufacture of superhydrophobic surfaces is lighting up the future. Accurately understanding, predicting, and tailoring droplet dynamic behaviors on superhydrophobic surfaces are progressive steps to integrate the droplet impact into versatile applications and further improve the efficiency. In this review, the progress on phenomena, mechanisms, regulations, and applications of droplet impact on superhydrophobic surfaces, bridging the gap between droplet impact, superhydrophobic surfaces, and engineering applications are comprehensively summarized. It is highlighted that droplet contact and rebound are two focal points, and their fundamentals and dynamic regulations on elaborately designed superhydrophobic surfaces are discussed in detail. For the first time, diverse applications are classified into four categories according to the requirements for droplet contact and rebound. The remaining challenges are also pointed out and future directions to trigger subsequent research on droplet impact from both scientific and applied perspectives are outlined. The review is expected to provide a general framework for understanding and utilizing droplet impact.

         <title>Sweet but Challenging: Tackling the Complexity of GAGs with Engineered Tailor&#8208;Made Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The field of biomaterials presenting glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is an emerging field. Some of these biomaterials are applied for regenerative medicine but in vivo GAGs are highly diverse. Here, the methods employed to understand the complexity of GAGs are reviewed. High&#8208;throughput methods are focused on comparing multiple parameters in the same experiment.








Abstract
Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) play a crucial role in tissue homeostasis by regulating the activity and diffusion of bioactive molecules. Incorporating GAGs into biomaterials has emerged as a widely adopted strategy in medical applications, owing to their biocompatibility and ability to control the release of bioactive molecules. Nevertheless, immobilized GAGs on biomaterials can elicit distinct cellular responses compared to their soluble forms, underscoring the need to understand the interactions between GAG and bioactive molecules within engineered functional biomaterials. By controlling critical parameters such as GAG type, density, and sulfation, it becomes possible to precisely delineate GAG functions within a biomaterial context and to better mimic specific tissue properties, enabling tailored design of GAG&#8208;based biomaterials for specific medical applications. However, this requires access to pure and well&#8208;characterized GAG compounds, which remains challenging. This review focuses on different strategies for producing well&#8208;defined GAGs and explores high&#8208;throughput approaches employed to investigate GAG&#8211;growth factor interactions and to quantify cellular responses on GAG&#8208;based biomaterials. These automated methods hold considerable promise for improving the understanding of the diverse functions of GAGs. In perspective, the scientific community is encouraged to adopt a rational approach in designing GAG&#8208;based biomaterials, taking into account the in vivo properties of the targeted tissue for medical applications.

         <title>Inkjet Printing of Pharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 11, March 14, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into inkjet printing's (IJP) potential for precise drug delivery and personalized medicine. It explores pharma&#8208;inks in IJP, their formulation, components, and substrates. Various drug delivery routes are covered, while discussing how hardware, software, and artificial intelligence integration could improve IJP's precision and efficiency. Nevertheless, additional exploration and optimization are needed to fully harness IJP's capabilities in healthcare.








Abstract
Inkjet printing (IJP) is an additive manufacturing process that selectively deposits ink materials, layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer, to create 3D objects or 2D patterns with precise control over their structure and composition. This technology has emerged as an attractive and versatile approach to address the ever&#8208;evolving demands of personalized medicine in the healthcare industry. Although originally developed for nonhealthcare applications, IJP harnesses the potential of pharma&#8208;inks, which are meticulously formulated inks containing drugs and pharmaceutical excipients. Delving into the formulation and components of pharma&#8208;inks, the key to precise and adaptable material deposition enabled by IJP is unraveled. The review extends its focus to substrate materials, including paper, films, foams, lenses, and 3D&#8208;printed materials, showcasing their diverse advantages, while exploring a wide spectrum of therapeutic applications. Additionally, the potential benefits of hardware and software improvements, along with artificial intelligence integration, are discussed to enhance IJP's precision and efficiency. Embracing these advancements, IJP holds immense potential to reshape traditional medicine manufacturing processes, ushering in an era of medical precision. However, further exploration and optimization are needed to fully utilize IJP's healthcare capabilities. As researchers push the boundaries of IJP, the vision of patient&#8208;specific treatment is on the horizon of becoming a tangible reality.

Catalyst/photocatalyst&#8211;aptamer hybrid conjugates provide effective model systems for native enzymes or photosystems. Aptamers conjugated to homogeneous catalysts, heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts, or photosensitizers yield &#8220;nucleoapzymes&#8221;, &#8220;aptananozymes&#8221;, or &#8220;photoaptazymes&#8221;, emulating native enzymes and photosystems. Structure&#8211;function relationships in the hybrid systems are observed and diverse applications of the systems are addressed.








Abstract
Conjugation of aptamers to homogeneous catalysts (&#8220;nucleoapzymes&#8221;), heterogeneous nanoparticle catalysts (&#8220;aptananozymes&#8221;), and photocatalysts (&#8220;photoaptazymes&#8221;) yields superior catalytic/photocatalytic hybrid nanostructures emulating functions of native enzymes and photosystems. The concentration of the substrate in proximity to the catalytic sites (&#8220;molarity effect&#8221;) or spatial concentration of electron&#8208;acceptor units in spatial proximity to the photosensitizers, by aptamer&#8211;ligand complexes, leads to enhanced catalytic/photocatalytic efficacies of the hybrid nanostructures. This is exemplified by sets of &#8220;nucleoapzymes&#8221; composed of aptamers conjugated to the hemin/G&#8208;quadruplex DNAzymes or metal&#8211;ligand complexes as catalysts, catalyzing the oxidation of dopamine to aminochrome, oxygen&#8208;insertion into the Ar&#9472;H moiety of tyrosinamide and the subsequent oxidation of the catechol product into aminochrome, or the hydrolysis of esters or ATP. Also, aptananozymes consisting of aptamers conjugated to Cu2+&#8208; or Ce4+&#8208;ion&#8208;modified C&#8208;dots or polyadenine&#8208;stabilized Au nanoparticles acting as catalysts oxidizing&#160;dopamine or operating bioreactor biocatalytic cascades, are demonstrated. In addition, aptamers conjugated to the Ru(II)&#8211;tris&#8208;bipyridine photosensitizer or the Zn(II) protoporphyrin IX photosensitizer provide supramolecular photoaptazyme assemblies emulating native photosynthetic reaction centers. Effective photoinduced electron transfer followed by the catalyzed synthesis of NADPH or the evolution of H2 is demonstrated by the photosystems. Structure&#8211;function relationships dictate the catalytic and photocatalytic efficacies of the systems.

         <title>Nanozymes: Definition, Activity, and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a historical perspective, the definition, catalytic activity, and mechanism of nanozymes are compared with enzymes. Immobilized catalysts and catalytic nanomaterials are two types of nanozymes, and the field has benefited from the name of nanozyme to endeavor replacement of enzymes with catalytic nanomaterials for analytical, environmental, and biomedical applications.








Abstract
&#8220;Nanozyme&#8221; is used to describe various catalysts from immobilized inorganic metal complexes, immobilized enzymes to inorganic nanoparticles. Here, the history of nanozymes is dvescribed in detail, and they can be largely separated into two types. Type 1 nanozymes refer to immobilized catalysts or enzymes on nanomaterials, which&#160;were&#160;dominant in the first decade since 2004. Type 2 nanozymes, which rely on the surface catalytic properties of inorganic nanomaterials, are the dominating type in the past decade. The definition of nanozymes is evolving, and a definition based on the same substrates and products as enzymes are able to cover most currently claimed nanozymes, although they may have different mechanisms compared to their enzyme counterparts. A broader definition can inspire application&#8208;based research to replace enzymes with nanomaterials for analytical, environmental, and biomedical applications. Comparison with enzymes also requires a clear definition of a nanozyme unit. Four ways of defining a nanozyme unit are described, with iron oxide and horseradish peroxidase activity comparison as examples in each definition. Growing work is devoted to understanding the&#160;catalytic mechanism of nanozymes, which provides a basis for further rational engineering of active sites. Finally, future perspective of the nanozyme field is discussed.

         <title>Approaches to Improving the Selectivity of Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes must be selective if they are to replace enzymes in sensing or catalysis. Mimicking enzymatic active sites and nanoconfined substrate channels provides an avenue to improving the selectivity of nanozymes. However, a purely biomimetic approach to nanozyme design limits the design of enzyme mimics. Therefore, designers endeavor to utilize all synthetic methods to make more selective nanozymes.








Abstract
Nanozymes mimic enzymes and that includes their selectivity. To achieve selectivity, significant inspiration for nanoparticle design can come from the geometric and molecular features that make enzymes selective catalysts. The two central features enzymes use are control over the arrangement of atoms in the active site and the placing of the active site down a nanoconfined substrate channel. The implementation of enzyme&#8208;inspired features has already been shown to both improve activity and selectivity of nanoparticles for a variety of catalytic and sensing applications. The tuning and control of active sites on metal nanoparticle surfaces ranges from simply changing the composition of the surface metal to sophisticated approaches such as the immobilization of single atoms on a metal substrate. Molecular frameworks provide a powerful platform for the implementation of isolated and discrete active sites while unique diffusional environments further improve selectivity. The implementation of nanoconfined substrate channels around these highly controlled active sites offers further ability to control selectivity through altering the solution environment and transport of reactants and products. Implementing these strategies together offers a unique opportunity to improve nanozyme selectivity in both sensing and catalysis.

The latest advances and current challenges of enzyme&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles and their use in biosensing are highlighted, with a special focus on point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) devices and their translational path for use in biomedical devices. These materials exhibit innate advantages compared to biological enzymes and nanoparticle probes currently utilized and hold great promise for implementation in biotechnology and clinical diagnosis.








Abstract
Nanozymes represent a class of nanosized materials that exhibit innate catalytic properties similar to biological enzymes. The unique features of&#160;these materials have positioned them as promising candidates for applications in clinical sensing devices, specifically those&#160;employed at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care. They notably have found use as a means to amplify signals in nanosensor&#8208;based platforms and thereby improve sensor detection limits. Recent developments in the understanding of the fundamental chemistries underpinning these materials have enabled the development of highly effective nanozymes capable of sensing clinically relevant biomarkers at detection limits that compete with &#8220;gold&#8208;standard&#8221; techniques. However, there remain considerable hurdles that need to be overcome before these nanozyme&#8208;based sensors can be utilized in a platform ready for clinical use. An overview of the current understandings of nanozymes for disease diagnostics and biosensing applications and the unmet challenges that must be considered prior to their translation in clinical diagnostic tests is provided.

         <title>Chiral MoSe2 Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive Monitoring of Reactive Oxygen Species In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral molybdenum diselenide nanoparticles modified by the fluorescent molecule (cyanine 3) are synthesized. They are used as nanoprobes for reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection through changes in chiral and fluorescent signals due to Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reaction induced by ROS on the surface of nanoparticles. These signals can indicate the ROS levels in living cells and in vivo.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and acute hepatitis, and quantification of ROS is critical for the early diagnosis of these diseases. In this work, a novel probe is developed,&#160;based on chiral molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) nanoparticles (NPs) modified by the fluorescent molecule, cyanine 3 (Cy3). Chiral MoSe2 NPs show intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals at 390 and 550&#160;nm, whereas the fluorescence of Cy3 at 560&#160;nm is quenched by MoSe2 NPs. In the presence of ROS, the probe reacts with the ROS and then oxidates rapidly, resulting in decreased CD signals and the recovery of the fluorescence. Using this strategy, the limit of detection values of CD and fluorescent signals in living cells are 0.0093&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.024&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The high selectivity and sensitivity to ROS in complex biological environments is attributed to the Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reactions on the surface of the NPs. Furthermore, chiral MoSe2 NPs are able to monitor the levels of ROS in vivo by the fluorescence. Collectively, this strategy offers a new approach for ROS detection and has the potential to inspire others to explore chiral nanomaterials as biosensors to investigate biological events.

         <title>Oxidation of Hydrogen Sulfide to Polysulfide and Thiosulfate by a Carbon Nanozyme: Therapeutic Implications with an Emphasis on Down Syndrome</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxidized carbon nanozymes catalytically oxidize hydrogen sulfide to polysulfides and thiosulfate in an oxygen&#8208;dependent manner. In this report the reaction kinetics of polysulfide and thiosulfate formation both in a cell&#8208;free setting and intracellularly and present the possible role of these nanozymes as a supportive therapy in Down Syndrome, a condition where hydrogen sulfide production is detrimentally elevated.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a noxious, potentially poisonous, but necessary gas produced from sulfur metabolism in humans. In Down Syndrome (DS), the production of H2S is elevated and associated with degraded mitochondrial function. Therefore, removing H2S from the body as a stable oxide could be an approach to reducing the deleterious effects of H2S in DS. In this report we describe the catalytic oxidation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to polysulfides (HS2+n&#8722;) and thiosulfate (S2O32&#8722;) by poly(ethylene glycol) hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG&#8208;HCCs) and poly(ethylene glycol) oxidized activated charcoal (PEG&#8208;OACs), examples of oxidized carbon nanozymes (OCNs). We show that OCNs oxidize H2S to polysulfides and S2O32&#8722; in a dose&#8208;dependent manner. The reaction is dependent on O2 and the presence of quinone groups on the OCNs. In DS donor lymphocytes we found that OCNs increased polysulfide production, proliferation, and afforded protection against additional toxic levels of H2S compared to untreated DS lymphocytes. Finally, in Dp16 and Ts65DN murine models of DS, we found that OCNs restored osteoclast differentiation. This new action suggests potential facile translation into the clinic for conditions involving excess H2S exemplified by DS.

&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in a dose-dependent manner. The reaction is dependent on O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the presence of quinone groups on the OCNs. In DS donor lymphocytes we found that OCNs increased polysulfide production, proliferation, and afforded protection against additional toxic levels of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S compared to untreated DS lymphocytes. Finally, in Dp16 and Ts65DN murine models of DS, we found that OCNs restored osteoclast differentiation. This new action suggests potential facile translation into the clinic for conditions involving excess H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S exemplified by DS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Interaction of Amines with Gold Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
All you wanted to know about the amine gold nanoparticle interaction and never dared to ask: mode and strength of binding, kinetics of the exchange of the amines, redox processes occurring at the surface and hints for preparation of robust semisynthetic nanozymes.








Abstract
Understanding the interactions between amines and the surface of gold nanoparticles is important because of their role in the stabilization of the nanosystems, in the formation of the protein corona, and in the preparation of semisynthetic nanozymes. By using fluorescence spectroscopy, electrochemistry, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy, and molecular simulation,&#160;a detailed picture of these interactions is obtained. Herein, it is shown that amines interact with surface Au(0) atoms of the nanoparticles with their lone electron pair with a strength linearly correlating with their basicity corrected for steric hindrance. The kinetics of binding depends on the position of the gold atoms (flat surfaces or edges) while the mode of binding involves a single Au(0) with nitrogen sitting on top of it. A small fraction of surface Au(I) atoms, still present, is reduced by the amines yielding a much stronger Au(0)&#8211;RN.+ (RN., after the loss of a proton) interaction. In this case, the mode of binding involves two Au(0) atoms with a bridging nitrogen placed between them. Stable Au nanoparticles, as those required for robust semisynthetic nanozymes preparation, are better obtained when the protein is involved (at least in part) in the reduction of the gold ions.

         <title>Fibrous Zr&#8208;MOF Nanozyme Aerogels with Macro&#8208;Nanoporous Structure for Enhanced Catalytic Hydrolysis of Organophosphate Toxins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid synthesis method is developed to introduce Zr&#8208;MOF nanozyme coating into cellulose nanofibers, resulting in the formation of processable macro&#8208;micro porous aerogel composites with high metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) loadings. The hierarchically structured MOF nanozymes monolithic aerogel enables excellent accessibility to catalytic active sites for fast and efficient hydrolytic detoxification of organophosphorus&#8208;based nerve agent simulants and pesticides from contaminated water.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with Lewis acid catalytic sites, such as zirconium&#8208;based MOFs (Zr&#8208;MOFs), comprise a growing class of phosphatase&#8208;like nanozymes that can degrade toxic organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents. Rationally engineering and shaping MOFs from as&#8208;synthesized powders into hierarchically porous monoliths is essential for their use in emerging applications, such as filters for air and water purification and personal protection gear. However, several challenges still limit the production of practical MOF composites, including the need for sophisticated reaction conditions, low MOF catalyst loadings in the resulting composites, and poor accessibility to MOF&#8208;based active sites. To overcome these limitations, a rapid synthesis method is developed to introduce Zr&#8208;MOF nanozyme coating into cellulose nanofibers, resulting in the formation of processable monolithic aerogel composites with high MOF loadings. These composites contain Zr&#8208;MOF nanozymes embedded in the structure, and hierarchical macro&#8208;micro porosity enables excellent accessibility to catalytic active sites. This multifaceted rational design strategy, including the selection of a MOF with many catalytic sites, fine&#8208;tuning the coating morphology, and the fabrication of a hierarchically structured monolithic aerogel, renders synergistic effects toward the efficient continuous hydrolytic detoxification of organophosphorus&#8208;based nerve agent simulants and pesticides from contaminated water.

         <title>A Defect&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme&#160;for Targeted NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of defect engineering, a tumor cell membrane coated redox nanozyme is developed for combinational second near&#8208;infrared photothermal immunotherapy of cancer. This controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long&#8208;term immunological memory.








Abstract
Multienzyme&#8208;mimicking redox nanozymes, curated by defect engineering, in synergy with immunotherapy offer promising prospects for safe and efficient cancer therapy. However, the spatiotemporally precise immune response often gets challenged by off&#8208;target adverse effects and insufficient therapeutic response. Herein, a tumor cell membrane coated redox nanozyme (CMO&#8208;R@4T1) is reported for combinational second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 consists of a Cu&#8208;doped MoOx (CMO) nanozyme as the core, which is cloaked with tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived fused membranes with immunostimulants immobilized in the membrane shell. In addition to the enhanced tumor accumulation, the nanozyme can cause oxidative damage to tumor cells by the production of reactive oxygen species and attenuation of the antioxidant mechanism. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 also mediates a photothermal effect under NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation to trigger tumor eradication and immunogenic cell death, where the liberated agonist elicits the immune activation. Such a controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long&#8208;term immunological memory. Thereby, this study takes advantage of defect engineering to illustrate a generic strategy to prepare cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;camouflaged nanozymes for targeted photo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer.

         <title>A Manganese&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Cold&#8208;Adapted Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme of manganese&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (nMnBTC) is designed and developed by mimicking the structural features of the natural counterparts. It exhibits extremely stable oxidase&#8208;like activity at both psychrophilic and mesophilic condition (0&#8211;45&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, a low&#8208;temperature antivirus strategy is innovatively established based on nMnBTC to inactive influenza virus H1N1 with high efficiency at &#8722;20 &#176;C.








Abstract
The development of cold&#8208;adapted enzymes with high efficiency and good stability is an advanced strategy to overcome the limitations of catalytic medicine in low and cryogenic temperatures. In this work, inspired by natural enzymes, a novel cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme based on a manganese&#8208;based nanosized metal&#8211;organic framework (nMnBTC) is designed and synthesized. The nMnBTC as an oxidase mimetic not only exhibits excellent activity at 0&#160;&#176;C, but also presents almost no observable activity loss as the temperature is increased to 45&#160;&#176;C. This breaks the traditional recognition that enzymes show maximum activity only under specific psychrophilic or thermophilic condition. The superior performance of nMnBTC as a cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme can be attributed to its high&#8208;catalytic efficiency at low temperature, good substrate affinity, and flexible conformation. Based on the robust performance of nMnBTC, a low&#8208;temperature antiviral strategy is developed to inactivate influenza virus H1N1 even at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. These results not only provide an important guide for the rational design of highly efficient artificial cold&#8208;adapted enzymes, but also pave a novel way for biomedical application in cryogenic fields.

         <title>Effect of Phosphorus Modulation in Iron Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Peroxidase Mimicking</title>

1D&#160;phosphorus&#8208;doped single&#8208;atom Fe nanowires are designed to mimic peroxidase&#8208;like activity. The mechanism of phosphorus modulation via long&#8208;range interaction for increasing catalytic activity is fully analyzed. The designed single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits good sensitivity in an enzyme&#8208;cascade sensor platform for colorimetric acetylcholine sensing. This work provides a strategy for creating enzyme&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts and replacing natural enzymes in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activity, owing to their well&#8208;defined isolated iron active sites on the carbon substrate, which effectively mimic the structure of natural peroxidase's active center. To further meet the requirements of diverse biosensing applications, SAC POD&#8208;like activity still needs to be continuously enhanced. Herein, a phosphorus (P) heteroatom is introduced to boost the POD&#8208;like activity of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs. A 1D&#160;carbon nanowire (FeNCP/NW) catalyst with enriched Fe&#8211;N4 active sites is designed and synthesized, and P atoms are doped in the carbon matrix to affect the Fe center through long&#8208;range interaction. The experimental results show that the P&#8208;doping process can boost the POD&#8208;like activity more than the non&#8208;P&#8208;doped one, with excellent selectivity and stability. The mechanism analysis results show that the introduction of P into SAC can greatly enhance POD&#8208;like activity initially, but its effect becomes insignificant with increasing amount of P. As a proof of concept, FeNCP/NW is employed in an enzyme cascade platform for highly sensitive colorimetric detection of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

         <title>A Thrombin&#8208;Activated Peptide&#8208;Templated Nanozyme for Remedying Ischemic Stroke via Thrombolytic and Neuroprotective Actions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;templated manganese dioxide nanozyme integrating thrombolytic and reactive oxygen species scavenging abilities is developed for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Through the self&#8208;assembled polypeptides that contain multiple functional motifs, the nanozyme binds fibrin in the thrombus, crosses the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and finally accumulates in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; by the action of thrombin.








Abstract
Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the most common causes of disability and death. Thrombolysis and neuroprotection are two current major therapeutic strategies to overcome ischemic and reperfusion damage. In this work, a novel peptide&#8208;templated manganese dioxide nanozyme (PNzyme/MnO2) is designed that integrates the thrombolytic activity of functional peptides with the reactive oxygen species scavenging ability of nanozymes. Through self&#8208;assembled polypeptides that contain multiple functional motifs, the novel peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme is able to bind fibrin in the thrombus, cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and finally accumulate in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; by the action of thrombin. In mice and rat IS models, the PNzyme/MnO2 prolongs the blood&#8208;circulation time and exhibits strong thrombolytic action, and reduces the ischemic damages in brain tissues. Moreover, this peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme also effectively inhibits the activation of astrocytes and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. These data indicate that the rationally designed PNzyme/MnO2 nanozyme exerts both thrombolytic and neuroprotective actions. Giving its long half&#8208;life in the blood and ability to target brain thrombi, the biocompatible nanozyme may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to improve the efficacy and prevent secondary thrombosis during the treatment of IS.

         <title>Bioinspired Hierarchical Self&#8208;Assembled Nanozyme for Efficient Antibacterial Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired by the antibacterial nanostructures on the wing&#160;surfaces&#160;of&#160;some insects, this work reports a biomimetic NiCo2O4 nanozyme with 3&#8208;level hierarchical architecture that can self&#8208;adaptively tune their hierarchical nanostructures to capture bacteria of various morphotypes. The intrinsic peroxidase&#8208;like activity of the nanozyme promotes the generation of highly toxic reactive oxygen species that disrupt bacterial membranes and induce bacterial apoptosis.








Abstract
Along with the rapid development and ever&#8208;deepening understanding of nanoscience and nanotechnology, nanomaterials hold promise to mimic the highly evolved biological exquisite nanostructures and sophisticated functions. Here, inspired by the ubiquitous antibacterial nanostructures on the wing&#160;surfaces&#160;of&#160;some insects, a NiCo2O4 nanozyme with self&#8208;adaptive hierarchical nanostructure is developed that can capture bacteria of various morphotypes via the physico&#8208;mechanical interaction between the nanostructure and bacteria. Moreover, the developed biomimetic nanostructure further exhibits superior peroxidase&#8208;like catalytic activity, which can catalytically generate highly toxic reactive oxygen species that disrupt bacterial membranes and induce bacterial apoptosis. Therefore, the mechano&#8208;catalytic coupling property of this NiCo2O4 nanozyme allows for an extensive and efficient antibacterial application, with no concerns of antimicrobial resistance. This work suggests a promising strategy for the rational design of advanced antibacterial materials by mimicking biological antibiosis.

         <title>Oxidized Activated Charcoal Nanozymes: Synthesis, and Optimization for In Vitro and In Vivo Bioactivity for Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes synthesized via the oxidation of coconut&#8208;derived activated charcoal afford markable protection against oxidative injury in an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury. By tuning the oxidation process, smaller, more homogeneous nanomaterials containing free&#8208;radical&#8208;quenching quinone active sites are targeted for enhanced bioactivity. Such findings highlight the features that drive the oxidative power of these nanozymes.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic nanozymes have recently been employed as promising antioxidant nanotherapeutics due to their distinct properties. The structural features responsible for the efficacy of these nanomaterials as antioxidants are, however, poorly understood. Here, the process&#8211;structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance properties of coconut&#8208;derived oxidized activated charcoal (cOAC) nano&#8208;SOD mimetics are studied by analyzing how modifications to the nanomaterial's synthesis impact the size, as well as the elemental and electrochemical properties of the particles. These properties are then correlated to the in vitro antioxidant bioactivity of poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;functionalized cOACs (PEG&#8208;cOAC). Chemical oxidative treatment methods that afford smaller, more homogeneous cOAC nanoparticles with higher levels of quinone functionalization show enhanced protection against oxidative damage in bEnd.3 murine endothelioma cells. In an in vivo rat model of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and oxidative vascular injury, PEG&#8208;cOACs restore cerebral perfusion rapidly to the same extent as the former nanotube&#8208;derived PEG&#8208;hydrophilic carbon clusters (PEG&#8208;HCCs) with a single intravenous injection. These findings provide a deeper understanding of how carbon nanozyme syntheses can be tailored for improved antioxidant bioactivity, and set the stage for translation of medical applications.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Based Robotics Approach for Targeting Fungal Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microrobotic platform is developed using iron oxide nanoparticle&#8208;based nanozymes to achieve precise spatial targeting and localized catalysis for rapid fungal killing. These nanozyme&#8208;microrobots demonstrate programmable motions, controllable catalysis, and selective binding to fungi. Using tissue infection models, localized delivery of nanozymes and targeted fungal eradication is shown, providing a unique antifungal modality for pathogen killing at the infection site.








Abstract
Fungal pathogens have been designated by the World Health Organization as microbial threats of the highest priority for global health. It remains a major challenge to improve antifungal efficacy at the site of infection while avoiding off&#8208;target effects, fungal spreading, and drug tolerance. Here, a nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotic platform is developed that directs localized catalysis to the infection site with microscale precision to achieve targeted and rapid fungal killing. Using electromagnetic field frequency modulation and fine&#8208;scale spatiotemporal control, structured iron oxide nanozyme assemblies are formed that display tunable dynamic shape transformation and catalysis activation. The catalytic activity varies depending on the motion, velocity, and shape providing controllable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Unexpectedly, nanozyme assemblies bind avidly to fungal (Candida albicans) surfaces to enable concentrated accumulation and targeted ROS&#8208;mediated killing in situ. By exploiting these tunable properties and selective binding to fungi, localized antifungal activity is achieved using in vivo&#8208;like cell spheroid and animal tissue infection models. Structured nanozyme assemblies are directed to Candida&#8208;infected sites using programmable algorithms to perform precisely guided spatial targeting and on&#8208;site catalysis resulting in fungal eradication within 10 min.

     alt="Nanozyme-Based Robotics Approach for Targeting Fungal Infection"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A microrobotic platform is developed using iron oxide nanoparticle-based nanozymes to achieve precise spatial targeting and localized catalysis for rapid fungal killing. These nanozyme-microrobots demonstrate programmable motions, controllable catalysis, and selective binding to fungi. Using tissue infection models, localized delivery of nanozymes and targeted fungal eradication is shown, providing a unique antifungal modality for pathogen killing at the infection site.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungal pathogens have been designated by the World Health Organization as microbial threats of the highest priority for global health. It remains a major challenge to improve antifungal efficacy at the site of infection while avoiding off-target effects, fungal spreading, and drug tolerance. Here, a nanozyme-based microrobotic platform is developed that directs localized catalysis to the infection site with microscale precision to achieve targeted and rapid fungal killing. Using electromagnetic field frequency modulation and fine-scale spatiotemporal control, structured iron oxide nanozyme assemblies are formed that display tunable dynamic shape transformation and catalysis activation. The catalytic activity varies depending on the motion, velocity, and shape providing controllable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Unexpectedly, nanozyme assemblies bind avidly to fungal (&lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt;) surfaces to enable concentrated accumulation and targeted ROS-mediated killing in situ. By exploiting these tunable properties and selective binding to fungi, localized antifungal activity is achieved using in vivo-like cell spheroid and animal tissue infection models. Structured nanozyme assemblies are directed to &lt;i&gt;Candida&lt;/i&gt;-infected sites using programmable algorithms to perform precisely guided spatial targeting and on-site catalysis resulting in fungal eradication within 10 min. This nanozyme-based microrobotics approach provides a uniquely effective and targeted therapeutic modality for pathogen elimination at the infection site.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Ligand Engineering Ruthenium Nanozyme Superior to Horseradish Peroxidase for Enhanced Immunoassay</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modification can engineer charge transfer between Ru and ligands and facilitate intermediate radicals to react with colorimetric substrate, which significantly improves the peroxidase&#8208;like activity of Ru nanozymes superior to horseradish peroxidase. Following such a mechanism, polystyrene&#8208;sulfonate&#8208;modified Ru nanozymes can be used as an enzyme alternative in enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay to improve detection sensitivity up to 140&#8208;fold, validated with human alpha&#8208;fetoprotein.








Abstract
Nanozymes have great potential to be used as an alternative to natural enzymes in a variety of fields. However, low catalytic activity compared with natural enzymes limits their practical use. It is still challenging to design nanozymes comparable to their natural counterparts in terms of the specific activity. In this study, a surface engineering strategy is employed to improve the specific activity of Ru nanozymes using charge&#8208;transferrable ligands such as polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). PSS&#8208;modified Ru nanozyme exhibits a peroxidase&#8208;like specific activity of up to 2820&#160;U&#160;mg&#8722;1, which is twice that of horseradish peroxidase (1305&#160;U&#160;mg&#8722;1). Mechanism studies suggest that PSS readily accepts negative charge from Ru, thus reducing the affinity between Ru and &#183;OH. Importantly, the modified Ru&#8208;peroxidase&#160;nanozyme is successfully used to develop an immunoassay for human alpha&#8208;fetoprotein and achieves a 140&#8208;fold increase in detection sensitivity compared with traditional horseradish&#8208;peroxidase&#8208;based enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay. Therefore, this work provides a feasible route to design nanozymes with high specific activity that meets the practical use as an alternative to natural enzymes.

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Based Therapeutic Antioxidants for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With their exceptional nature to quench reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, ceria nanoparticles have been investigated as therapeutic nanozymes to treat diseases in which the oxidative stress aggravates the pathological condition. This review introduces the mechanism behind the therapeutic effects of ceria nanoparticles and the exemplary studies that take advantage of it. Remaining challenges and future perspectives are also provided.








Abstract
The growing interest in nanomedicine over the last 20 years has carved out a research field called &#8220;nanocatalytic therapy,&#8221; where catalytic reactions mediated by nanomaterials are employed to intervene in disease&#8208;critical biomolecular processes. Among many kinds of catalytic/enzyme&#8208;mimetic nanomaterials investigated thus far, ceria nanoparticles stand out from others owing to their unique scavenging properties against biologically noxious free radicals, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), by exerting enzyme mimicry and nonenzymatic activities. Much&#160;effort has been made to utilize ceria nanoparticles as self&#8208;regenerating antioxidative and anti&#8208;inflammatory agents for various kinds of diseases, given the detrimental effects of ROS and RNS therein that need alleviation. In this context, this review is intended to provide an overview as to what makes ceria nanoparticles merit attention in disease therapy. The introductory part describes the characteristics of ceria nanoparticles as an oxygen&#8208;deficient metal oxide. The pathophysiological roles of ROS and RNS are then presented, as well as their scavenging mechanisms by ceria nanoparticles. Representative examples of recent ceria&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;based therapeutics are summarized by categorization into organ and disease types, followed by the discussion on the remaining challenges and future research directions.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials. However, the design of new nanozymes remains challenging. Here, recent advancements in ML&#8208;assisted discovery and design of materials and engineered enzymes is summarized, along with a discussion as to how these successful cases can be implicated in addressing the current problems facing the nanozyme field. The prospective design of nanozymes based on ML technology is also proposed.








Abstract
Nanozymes are nanomaterials that exhibit enzyme&#8208;like biomimicry. In combination with intrinsic characteristics of nanomaterials, nanozymes have broad applicability in materials science, chemical engineering, bioengineering, biochemistry, and disease theranostics. Recently, the heterogeneity of published results has highlighted the complexity and diversity of nanozymes in terms of consistency of catalytic capacity. Machine learning (ML) shows promising potential for discovering new materials, yet it remains challenging for the design of new nanozymes based on ML approaches. Alternatively, ML is employed to promote optimization of intelligent design and application of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes. Incorporation of the successful ML algorithms used in the intelligent design of catalytic materials and engineered enzymes can concomitantly facilitate the guided development of next&#8208;generation nanozymes with desirable properties. Here, recent progress in ML, its utilization in the design of catalytic materials and enzymes, and how emergent ML applications serve as promising strategies to circumvent challenges associated with time&#8208;expensive and laborious testing in nanozyme research and development are summarized. The potential applications of successful examples of ML&#8208;aided catalytic materials and engineered enzymes in nanozyme design are also highlighted, with special focus on the unified aims in enhancing design and recapitulation of substrate selectivity and catalytic activity.

         <title>Biosystem&#8208;Inspired Engineering of Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
The recent advances in the engineering of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes, by leveraging the refined catalytic structure of natural enzymes, simulating the behavior changes of natural enzymes in the catalytic process, mimicking the specific biological processes or living organisms, as well as their biomedical applications, are reviewed.








Abstract
Nanozymes with intrinsic enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities have shown great potential to become surrogates of natural enzymes in many fields by virtue of their advantages of high catalytic stability, ease of functionalization, and low cost. However, due to the lack of predictable descriptors, most of the nanozymes reported in the past have been obtained mainly through trial&#8208;and&#8208;error strategies, and the catalytic efficacy, substrate specificity, as well as practical application effect under physiological conditions, are far inferior to that of natural enzymes. To optimize the catalytic efficacies and functions of nanozymes in biomedical settings, recent studies have introduced biosystem&#8208;inspired strategies into nanozyme design. In this review, recent advances in the engineering of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes by leveraging the refined catalytic structure of natural enzymes, simulating the behavior changes of natural enzymes in the catalytic process, and mimicking the specific biological processes or living organisms, are introduced. Furthermore, the currently involved biomedical applications of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes are summarized. More importantly, the current opportunities and challenges of the design and application of biosystem&#8208;inspired nanozymes are discussed. It is hoped that the studies of nanozymes based on bioinspired strategies will be beneficial for constructing the new generation of nanozymes and broadening their biomedical applications.

         <title>Reaction Mechanisms and Kinetics of Nanozymes: Insights from Theory and Computation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A historic overview of how theory and computation promote the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms and kinetics of the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities of nanomaterials is provided. It is expected to spark future ideas for screening or designing more stable and efficient enzyme&#8208;like nanomaterials with fascinating application potential prior to experiments.








Abstract
&#8220;Nanozymes&#8221; usually refers to inorganic nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. The research into nanozymes is one of the hot topics on the horizon of interdisciplinary science involving materials, chemistry, and biology. Although great progress has been made in the design, synthesis, characterization, and application of nanozymes, the study of the underlying microscopic mechanisms and kinetics is still not straightforward. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations compute the potential energy surfaces along the reaction coordinates for chemical reactions, which can give atomistic&#8208;level insights into the micro&#8208;mechanisms and kinetics for nanozymes. Therefore, DFT calculations have been playing an increasingly important role in exploring the mechanisms and kinetics for nanozymes in the past years. The calculations either predict the microscopic details for the catalytic processes to complement the experiments or further develop theoretical models to depict the physicochemical rules. In this review, the corresponding research progress is summarized. Particularly, the review focuses on the computational studies that closely interplay with the experiments. The relevant experimental results without DFT calculations will be also briefly discussed to offer a historic overview of how the computations promote the understanding of the microscopic mechanisms and kinetics of nanozymes.

Multienzymic nanozymes are nanomaterials with more than one enzyme&#8208;like activity. Multienzymic nanozymes have unique advantages, including synergistic effects, cascaded reactions, and responsive selectivity. The catalytic mechanism of multienzymic nanozymes is more complicated and elusive than single&#8208;enzymic nanozymes. In this review, the classification, regulating factors, rational design, and application of multienzymic nanozymes are systematically discussed.








Abstract
Nanomaterials with more than one enzyme&#8208;like activity are termed multienzymic nanozymes, and they&#160;have received increasing attention in recent years and hold huge potential to be applied in diverse fields, especially for biosensing and therapeutics. Compared to single enzyme&#8208;like nanozymes, multienzymic nanozymes offer various unique advantages, including synergistic effects, cascaded reactions, and environmentally responsive selectivity. Nevertheless, along with these merits, the catalytic mechanism and rational design of multienzymic nanozymes are more complicated and elusive as compared to single&#8208;enzymic nanozymes. In this review, the multienzymic nanozymes classification scheme based on the numbers/types of activities, the internal and external factors regulating the multienzymatic activities, the rational design based on chemical, biomimetic, and computer&#8208;aided strategies, and recent progress in applications attributed to the advantages of multicatalytic activities are systematically discussed. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives regarding the development and application of multienzymatic nanozymes are suggested. This review aims to deepen the understanding and inspire the research in multienzymic nanozymes to a greater extent.

         <title>Surface Chemistry of Biologically Active Reducible Oxide Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducible metal oxide nanoparticles are increasingly being studied for biomedical and therapeutic applications. These materials are able to accomplish a broad range of catalytic surface reactions, as well as being amenable to designed enzyme&#8208;mimetic activities as nanozymes. Here, physicochemical properties and material compositions informing optimal nanozyme activities by reducible metal oxide nanomaterials are considered.








Abstract
Reducible metal oxide nanozymes (rNZs) are a subject of intense recent interest due to their catalytic nature, ease of synthesis, and complex surface character. Such materials contain surface sites which facilitate enzyme&#8208;mimetic reactions via substrate coordination and redox cycling. Further, these surface reactive sites are shown to be highly sensitive to stresses within the nanomaterial lattice, the physicochemical environment, and to processing conditions occurring as part of their syntheses. When administered in vivo, a complex protein corona binds to the surface, redefining its biological identity and subsequent interactions within the biological system. Catalytic activities of rNZs each deliver a differing impact on protein corona formation, its composition, and in turn, their recognition, and internalization by host cells. Improving the understanding of the precise principles that dominate rNZ surface&#8208;biomolecule adsorption raises the question of whether designer rNZs can be engineered to prevent corona formation, or indeed to produce &#8220;custom&#8221; protein coronas applied either in vitro, and preadministration, or formed immediately upon their exposure to body fluids. Here, fundamental surface chemistry processes and their implications in rNZ material performance are considered. In particular, material structures which inform component adsorption from the application environment, including substrates for enzyme&#8208;mimetic reactions are discussed.

         <title>Current Advances on the Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme and Its Bioapplications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis approaches including bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down strategies; catalysis modulation including central metal atom, coordination number, heteroatom doping, and the metal&#8208;support interaction for activity and selectivity modulation of single&#8208;atom nanozymes; and bioapplications in the biosensing, antibacterial, antiviral, and antitumor fields are reviewed.








Abstract
Nanozymes, a class of nanomaterials mimicking the function of enzymes, have aroused much attention as the candidate in diverse fields with the arbitrarily tunable features owing to the diversity of crystalline nanostructures, composition, and surface configurations. However, the uncertainty of their active sites and the lower intrinsic deficiencies of nanomaterial&#8208;initiated catalysis compared with the natural enzymes promote the pursuing of alternatives by imitating the biological active centers. Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) maximize the atom utilization with the well&#8208;defined structure, providing an important bridge to investigate mechanism and the relationship between structure and catalytic activity. They have risen as the new burgeoning alternative to the natural enzyme from in vitro bioanalytical tool to in vivo therapy owing to the flexible atomic engineering structure. Here, focus is mainly on the three parts. First, a detailed overview of single&#8208;atom catalyst synthesis strategies including bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches is given. Then, according to the structural feature of single&#8208;atom nanocatalysts, the influence factors such as central metal atom, coordination number, heteroatom doping, and the metal&#8211;support interaction are discussed and the representative biological applications (including antibacterial/antiviral performance, cancer therapy, and biosensing) are highlighted. In the end, the future perspective and challenge facing are demonstrated.

         <title>Modular Fabrication of Bioorthogonal Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal nanozymes facilitate in situ drug synthesis at disease sites through prodrug activation. This review investigates the role of nanomaterials in stabilizing and regulating transition metal catalysts (TMCs), emphasizing the modular design of nanomaterials and catalysts. It explores their synergistic engineering for efficient in situ uncaging of diagnostic and therapeutic agents.








Abstract
The incorporation of transition metal catalysts (TMCs) into nanoscaffolds generates nanocatalysts that replicate key aspects of enzymatic behavior. The TMCs can access bioorthogonal chemistry unavailable to living systems. These bioorthogonal nanozymes can be employed as in situ &#8220;factories&#8221; for generating bioactive molecules where needed. The generation of effective bioorthogonal nanozymes requires co&#8208;engineering of the TMC and the nanometric scaffold. This review presents an overview of recent advances in the field of bioorthogonal nanozymes, focusing on modular design aspects of both nanomaterial and catalyst and how they synergistically work together for in situ uncaging of imaging and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Based Regulation of Cellular Metabolism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 10, March 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of nanozymes in the metabolic regulation of diverse cells, including mammalian cells, microbial cells, and plant cells is reviewed, and the applications of nanozyme&#8208;based metabolic regulation in disease treatment, antimicrobial therapy, and sustainable agriculture are highlighted. Finally, the prospects and challenges of the future research are discussed.








Abstract
Metabolism is the sum of the enzyme&#8208;dependent chemical reactions, which produces energy in catabolic process and synthesizes biomass in anabolic process, exhibiting high similarity in mammalian cell, microbial cell, and plant cell. Consequently, the loss or gain of metabolic enzyme activity greatly affects cellular metabolism. Nanozymes, as emerging enzyme mimics with diverse functions and adjustable catalytic activities, have shown attractive potential for metabolic regulation. Although the basic metabolic tasks are highly similar for the cells from different species, the concrete metabolic pathway varies with the intracellular structure of different species. Here, the basic metabolism in living organisms is described and the similarities and differences in the metabolic pathways among mammalian, microbial, and plant cells and the regulation mechanism are discussed. The recent progress on regulation of cellular metabolism mainly including nutrient uptake and utilization, energy production, and the accompanied redox reactions by different kinds of oxidoreductases and their applications in the field of disease therapy, antimicrobial therapy, and sustainable agriculture is systematically reviewed. Furthermore, the prospects and challenges of nanozymes in regulating cell metabolism are also discussed, which broaden their application scenarios.

         <title>A Perspective on Uniform Plating Behavior of Mg Metal Anode: Diffusion Limited Theory versus Nucleation Theory</title>

This perspective points out the &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Buffer Zone&#8221; between &#8220;Kinetic&#8208;Control Region&#8221; and &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Region&#8221;, where the current density exceeds limited value, but time has not yet reached the Sand's time. In this buffer zone, dense and uniform Mg deposit layer is available, even the optimal deposit occurs in the vicinity of the boundary between &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Buffer Zone&#8221; and &#8220;Diffusion&#8208;Control Region&#8221;.








Abstract
Utilizing metal anode is the most attractive way to meet the urgent demand for rechargeable batteries with high energy density. Unfortunately, the formation of dendrites, which is caused by uneven plating behavior, always threaten the safety of the batteries. To explore the origin of different plating behavior and predict the plating morphology of anode under a variety of operating conditions, multifarious models have been developed. However, abuse of models has led to conflictive views. In this perspective, to clarify the controversial reports on magnesium (Mg) metal plating behavior, the previously proposed models are elaborated that govern the plating process. Through linking various models and clarifying their boundary conditions, a scheme is drawn to illustrate the strategy for achieving the most dense and uniform plating morphology, which also explains the seemingly contradictory of diffusion limited theory and nucleation theory on uniform plating. This perspective will undoubtedly enhance the understanding on the metal anode plating process and provide meaningful guidance for the development of metal anode batteries.

         <title>Mechanical Properties of Conducting Printed Nanosheet Network Thin Films Under Uniaxial Compression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printed thin film nanosheet networks show remarkable promise for a range of electrical applications. Their conductivity relies heavily on their morphology, which may be altered via compression. This work provides the first exploration of the compressive properties of printed networks of graphene and MoS2 to explore properties of elastic modulus, plastic yield, viscoelasticity, tensile failure, and sheet bending versus slippage.








Abstract
Thin film networks of solution processed nanosheets show remarkable promise for use in a broad range of applications including strain sensors, energy storage, printed devices, textile electronics, and more. While it is known that their electronic properties rely heavily on their morphology, little is known of their mechanical nature, a glaring omission given the effect mechanical deformation has on the morphology of porous systems and the promise of mechanical post processing for tailored properties. Here, this work employs a recent advance in thin film mechanical testing called the Layer Compression Test to perform the first in situ analysis of printed nanosheet network compression. Due to the well&#8208;defined deformation geometry of this unique test, this work is able to explore the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elastic, plastic, and creep deformation in these systems, extracting properties of elastic modulus, plastic yield, viscoelasticity, tensile failure and sheet bending vs. slippage under both out of plane uniaxial compression and tension. This work characterizes these for a range of networks of differing porosities and sheet sizes, for low and high compression, as well as the effect of chemical cross linking. This work explores graphene and MoS2 networks, from which the results can be extended to printed nanosheet networks as a whole.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening of Surface Engineered Cyanine Nanodots for Active Transport of Therapeutic Antibodies into Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;throughput fluorescent screening of a library of single&#8208;molecule Cy5 nanodots reveals that the nanoparticle&#8208;inducing cell transcytosis is highly related to the particles' surface structures and varies significantly with cell lines. The selected Cy5 nanodots with high transcytosis&#8208;inducing capability (G5&#8208;R) can carry &#945;PD&#8208;L1 to penetrate deep into&#160;solid tumor and generates potent antitumor activity through immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The successful delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules into solid tumor&#160;holds great challenge due to their high resistance to penetrate through the complex tumor microenvironments. Here, active&#8208;transporting nanoparticles are harnessed to efficiently deliver biomacromolecular drugs into solid tumors through cell transcytosis. A series of molecularly precise cyanine 5&#8208;cored polylysine G5 dendrimers (Cy5 nanodots) with different peripheral amino acids (G5&#8208;AA) is prepared. The capability of these positively charged nanodots to induce cell endocytosis, exocytosis, and transcytosis is evaluated via fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;throughput screen. The optimized nanodots (G5&#8208;R) are conjugated with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 (a therapeutic monoclonal antibody binding to programmed&#8208;death ligand 1) (&#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R) to demonstrate the nanoparticle&#8208;mediated tumor active transport. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R can greatly enhance the tumor&#8208;penetration capability through adsorption&#8208;mediated transcytosis (AMT). The effectiveness of &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R is tested in treating mice bearing partially resected CT26 tumors, mimicking the local immunotherapy of residual tumors post&#8208;surgery in clinic. The &#945;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;G5&#8208;R embedded in fibrin gel can efficiently mediate tumor cell transcytosis, and deliver &#945;PD&#8208;L1 throughout the tumor, thereby enhancing immune checkpoint blockade, reducing tumor recurrence, and significantly prolonging the survival time. The active&#8208;transporting nanodots are promising platforms for efficient tumor delivery of therapeutic biomacromolecules.

         <title>Ultraconfined Plasmons in Atomically Thin Crystalline Silver Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin crystalline silver structures of &lt;3 nm in thickness are fabricated by lighographically prepatterning a silicon wafer and subsequently depositing a few atomic layers of metal under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The method has great flexibility regarding the size and morphology of the structures, which are demonstrated to sustain plasmon resonances with quality factors as high as ten.








Abstract
The ability to confine light down to atomic scales is critical for the development of applications in optoelectronics and optical sensing as well as for the exploration of nanoscale quantum phenomena. Plasmons in metallic nanostructures with just a few atomic layers in thickness can achieve this type of confinement, although fabrication imperfections down to the subnanometer scale hinder actual developments. Here, narrow plasmons are demonstrated in atomically thin crystalline silver nanostructures fabricated by prepatterning silicon substrates and epitaxially depositing silver films of just a few atomic layers in thickness. Specifically, a silicon wafer is lithographically patterned to introduce on&#8208;demand lateral shapes, chemically process the sample to obtain an atomically flat silicon surface, and epitaxially deposit silver to obtain ultrathin crystalline metal films with the designated morphologies. Structures fabricated by following this procedure allow for an unprecedented control over optical field confinement in the near&#8208;infrared spectral region, which is here illustrated by the observation of fundamental and higher&#8208;order plasmons featuring extreme spatial confinement and high&#8208;quality factors that reflect the crystallinity of the metal. The present study constitutes a&#160;substantial improvement in the degree of spatial confinement and quality factor that should facilitate the design and exploitation of atomic&#8208;scale nanoplasmonic devices for optoelectronics, sensing, and quantum&#8208;physics&#160;applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Perception of Object's Deformability with Multiple Deformation Attributes Utilizing Biomimetic Mechanoreceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tactile sensor, which integrates biomimetic slow&#8208;adapting mechanoreceptors in a soft medium, enables self&#8208;decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at the contact surface. In robotic manipulation, the sensor can achieve the self&#8208;adaptive perception of material softness and enhance tactile perception by establishing two relevant deformation attributes (material softness and compliance) for an object.








Abstract
The perception of object's deformability in unstructured interactions relies on both kinesthetic and cutaneous cues to adapt the uncertainties of an object. However, the existing tactile sensors cannot provide adequate cutaneous cues to self&#8208;adaptively estimate the material softness, especially in non&#8208;standard contact scenarios where the interacting object deviates from the assumption of an elastic half&#8208;infinite body. This paper proposes an innovative design of a tactile sensor that integrates the capabilities of two slow&#8208;adapting mechanoreceptors within a soft medium, allowing self&#8208;decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at specific locations within the contact interface. By leveraging these localized cutaneous cues, the sensor can accurately and self&#8208;adaptively measure the material softness of an object, accommodating variations in thicknesses and applied forces. Furthermore, when combined with a kinesthetic cue from the robot, the sensor can enhance tactile expression by the synergy of two relevant deformation attributes, including material softness and compliance.&#160;It is demonstrated that the biomimetic fusion of tactile information can fully comprehend the deformability of an object, hence facilitating robotic decision&#8208;making and dexterous manipulation.

&lt;p&gt;The perception of object's deformability in unstructured interactions relies on both kinesthetic and cutaneous cues to adapt the uncertainties of an object. However, the existing tactile sensors cannot provide adequate cutaneous cues to self-adaptively estimate the material softness, especially in non-standard contact scenarios where the interacting object deviates from the assumption of an elastic half-infinite body. This paper proposes an innovative design of a tactile sensor that integrates the capabilities of two slow-adapting mechanoreceptors within a soft medium, allowing self-decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at specific locations within the contact interface. By leveraging these localized cutaneous cues, the sensor can accurately and self-adaptively measure the material softness of an object, accommodating variations in thicknesses and applied forces. Furthermore, when combined with a kinesthetic cue from the robot, the sensor can enhance tactile expression by the synergy of two relevant deformation attributes, including material softness and compliance.&#160;It is demonstrated that the biomimetic fusion of tactile information can fully comprehend the deformability of an object, hence facilitating robotic decision-making and dexterous manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Engineering of Inorganic&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphases via Anion Choice Enables Stable, Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tetrahydrofuran&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs). By employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB), it is demonstrated that electrolyte anions can improve the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI.








Abstract
The discovery of liquid battery electrolytes that facilitate the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) to mitigate dendrite formation is imperative to enable lithium anodes in next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;dense batteries. Compared to traditional electrolyte solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated great success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs. Herein, by employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB),&#160;it is&#160;demonstrated that electrolyte anions modulate the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI. Through novel analytical time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry&#160;methods, such as hierarchical clustering of depth profiles and compositional analysis using integrated yields,&#160;the chemical composition and morphology of the SEIs generated from each electrolyte system are examined. Notably, the LiDFOB electrolyte provides an exceptionally stable system to enable lithium anodes, delivering &gt;1500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 in symmetrical cells. Furthermore, Li//LFP cells using this electrolyte demonstrate high&#8208;rate, reversible lithium storage, supplying 139 mAh g(LFP)&#8722;1 at C/2 (&#8776;0.991 mAh cm&#8722;2, @ 0.61 mA cm&#8722;2) with 87.5% capacity retention over 300 cycles (average Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.86%).

         <title>Retarding Ion Migration for Stable Blade&#8208;Coated Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional molecule, p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA), increases ion migration barrier, induces (100) facet perovskite grain growth, and yields defect&#8208;reduced, homogeneous films. The blade&#8208;coated PABA&#8208;based inverted PSC achieves an impressive PCE of 23.32% and maintains 93.8% of its initial efficiency after 1000 hours under 1&#8208;sun illumination at 75 &#176;C and 10% relative humidity.








Abstract
The fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through blade coating is seen as one of the most viable paths toward commercialization. However, relative to the less scalable spin coating method, the blade coating process often results in more defective perovskite films with lower grain uniformity. Ion migration, facilitated by those elevated defect levels, is one of the main triggers of phase segregation and device instability. Here, a bifunctional molecule, p&#8208;aminobenzoic acid (PABA), which enhances the barrier to ion migration, induces grain growth along the (100) facet, and promotes the formation of homogeneous perovskite films with fewer defects, is reported. As a result, PSCs with PABA achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 23.32% and 22.23% for devices with active areas of 0.1 cm2 and 1 cm2, respectively. Furthermore, these devices maintain 93.8% of their initial efficiencies after 1&#160;000 h under 1&#8208;sun illumination, 75 &#176;C, and 10% relative humidity conditions.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Bone Repair through Multihierarchy Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Regulated Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multihierarchy reactive oxygen species regulated system, PEGS&#8208;PGA/SeSe/Rapa hydrogel (PSeR) for aged bone regeneration can effectively delay senescence and restore the regenerative function of senescent BMSCs by maintaining the levels of ROS intracellularly and extracellularly. Additionally, the PSeR hydrogel can be injected and rapidly crosslinked in the site of bone defects, presenting a novel therapeutic strategy for addressing age&#8208;related bone injuries.








Abstract
Aging exacerbates the dysfunction of tissue regeneration at multiple levels and gradually diminishes individual's capacity to withstand stress, damage, and disease. The excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered a hallmark feature of senescent stem cells, which causes oxidative stress, deteriorates the host microenvironment, and eventually becomes a critical obstacle for aged bone defect repair. Till now, the strategies cannot synchronously and thoroughly regulate intracellular and extracellular ROS in senescent cells. Herein, a multihierarchy ROS scavenging system for aged bone regeneration is developed by fabricating an injectable PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PEGS&#8208;NH2)/poly(&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid) (&#947;&#8208;PGA) hydrogel containing rapamycin&#8208;loaded poly(diselenide&#8208;carbonate) nanomicelles (PSeR). This PSeR hydrogel exhibits highly sensitive ROS responsiveness to the local aged microenvironment and dynamically releases drug&#8208;loaded nanomicelles to scavenge the intracellular ROS accumulated in senescent bone mesenchymal stem cells. The PSeR hydrogel effectively tunes the antioxidant function and delays senescence of bone mesenchymal stem cells by safeguarding DNA replication in an oxidative environment, thereby promoting the self&#8208;renewal ability and enhancing the osteogenic capacity for aged bone repair in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this multihierarchy ROS&#8208;regulated hydrogel provides a new strategy for treating degenerative diseases.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanorobot&#8208;Based Marsupial Robotic System for Intracranial Cross&#8208;Scale Targeting Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A marsupial robotic system combining a continuum robot (mother robot) with nanorobots (child robots) is developed for cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery. The robotic system improves the targeting rate and therapeutic efficacy in brain tumor treatment with the hierarchical targeting strategy spanning targeting scale from centimeters to nanometers.








Abstract
Nanorobots capable of active movement are an exciting technology for targeted therapeutic intervention. However, the extensive motion range and hindrance of the blood&#8211;brain barrier impeded their clinical translation in glioblastoma therapy. Here, a marsupial robotic system constructed by integrating chemical/magnetic hybrid nanorobots (child robots) with a miniature magnetic continuum robot (mother robot) for intracranial cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery is reported. For primary targeting on macroscale, the continuum robot enters the cranial cavity through a minimally invasive channel (e.g., Ommaya device) in the skull and transports the nanorobots to pathogenic regions. Upon circumventing the blood&#8211;brain barrier, the released nanorobots perform secondary targeting on microscale to further enhance the spatial resolution of drug delivery. In vitro experiments against primary glioblastoma cells derived from different patients are conducted for personalized treatment guidance. The operation feasibility within organisms is shown in ex vivo swine brain experiments. The biosafety of the treatment system is suggested in in vivo experiments. Owing to the hierarchical targeting method, the targeting rate, targeting accuracy, and treatment efficacy have improved greatly. The marsupial robotic system offers a novel intracranial local therapeutic strategy and constitutes a key milestone in the development of glioblastoma treatment platforms.

         <title>Water&#8208;Mediated Selectivity Control of CH3OH versus CO/CH4 in CO2 Photoreduction on Single&#8208;Atom Implanted Nanotube Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;TiO2/SrTiO3 nanotube arrays are constructed with both Fe single atom reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) for efficiently driving CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation. The amount of water can be facilely adjusted to selectively control CH3OH production from &#8776;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water.








Abstract
Controllable methanol production in artificial photosynthesis is highly desirable due to its high energy density and ease of storage. Herein, single atom Fe is implanted into TiO2/SrTiO3 (TSr) nanotube arrays by two&#8208;step anodization and Sr&#8208;induced crystallization. The resulting Fe&#8208;TSr with both single Fe reduction centers and dominant oxidation facets (001) contributes to efficient CO2 photoreduction and water oxidation for controlled production of CH3OH and CO/CH4. The methanol yield can reach to 154.20&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 98.90% selectivity by immersing all the catalyst in pure water, and the yield of CO/CH4 is 147.48&#160;&#181;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with &gt;99.99% selectivity when the catalyst completely outside water. This CH3OH yield is 50 and 3 times higher than that of TiO2 and TSr and stands among all the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. The facile gas&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid&#160;phase switch can selectively control CH3OH production from &#8776;0% (above H2O) to 98.90% (in H2O) via slowly immersing the catalyst into water, where abundant &#8226;OH and H2O around Fe sites play important role in selective CH3OH production. This work highlights a new insight for water&#8208;mediated CO2 photoreduction to controllably produce CH3OH.

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;Free and High&#8208;Rate Potassium Metal Batteries Sustained by an Inorganic&#8208;Rich SEI</title>

A 3D porous Al current collector decorated with N&#8208;doped graphene affording electronic structure modulation, giving rise to an inorganic&#8208;rich SEI architecture to expedite ion transport and guide dendrite&#8208;free potassium deposition.








Abstract
Potassium metal battery is an appealing candidate for future energy storage. However, its application is plagued by the notorious dendrite proliferation at the anode side, which entails the formation of vulnerable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and non&#8208;uniform potassium deposition on the current collector. Here, this work reports a dual&#8208;modification design of aluminum current collector to render dendrite&#8208;free potassium anodes with favorable reversibility. This work achieves to modulate the electronic structure of the designed current collector and accordingly attain an SEI architecture with robust inorganic&#8208;rich constituents, which is evidenced by detailed cryo&#8208;EM inspection and X&#8208;ray depth profiling. The thus&#8208;produced SEI manages to expedite ionic conductivity and guide homogeneous potassium deposition. Compared to the potassium metal cells assembled using typical aluminum current collector, cells based on the designed current collector realize improved rate capability (maintaining 400&#160;h under 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and low&#8208;temperature durability (stable operation at &#8722;50 &#176;C). Moreover, scalable production of the current collector allows for the sustainable construction of high&#8208;safety potassium metal batteries, with the potential for reducing the manufacturing cost.

         <title>Intelligent Size&#8208;Switchable Iron Carbide&#8208;Based Nanocapsules with Cascade Delivery Capacity for Hyperthermia&#8208;Enhanced Deep Tumor Ferroptosis</title>

Killing tumor cells in deep tumor regions with ferroptosis agents is still challenging because of distinct size requirements for intratumoral accumulation and deep tumor penetration.

Abstract
The ferroptosis pathway is recognized as an essential strategy for tumor treatment. However, killing tumor cells in deep tumor regions with ferroptosis agents is still challenging because of distinct size requirements for intratumoral accumulation and deep tumor penetration. Herein, intelligent nanocapsules with size&#8208;switchable capability that responds to acid/hyperthermia stimulation to achieve deep tumor ferroptosis are developed. These nanocapsules are constructed using poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic) acid and Pluronic F127 as carrier materials, with Au&#8211;Fe2C Janus nanoparticles serving as photothermal and ferroptosis agents, and sorafenib (SRF) as the ferroptosis enhancer. The PFP@Au&#8211;Fe2C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules, designed with an appropriate size, exhibit superior intratumoral accumulation compared to free Au&#8211;Fe2C nanoparticles, as evidenced by photoacoustic and magnetic resonance imaging. These nanocapsules can degrade within the acidic tumor microenvironment when subjected to laser irradiation, releasing free Au&#8211;Fe2C nanoparticles. This enables them to penetrate deep into tumor regions and disrupt intracellular redox balance. Under the guidance of imaging, these PFP@Au&#8211;Fe2C&#8211;SRF nanocapsules effectively inhibit tumor growth when exposed to laser irradiation, capitalizing on the synergistic photothermal and ferroptosis effects. This study presents an intelligent formulation based on iron carbide for achieving deep tumor ferroptosis through size&#8208;switchable cascade delivery, thereby advancing the comprehension of ferroptosis in the context of tumor theranostics.

         <title>Functionalized MXene Films with Substantially Improved Low&#8208;Voltage Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple tetrabutylammonium (TBA)&#8208;functionalization of MXene improves the in&#8208;plane actuation strain over three times and enhances the mechanical property and stability in air. In situ and ex situ characterizations reveal that the co&#8208;insertion/de&#8208;insertion of TBA ions with Li ions into/from MXene interlayer galleries and inter&#8208;edge gaps&#160;causes a large in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene sheets under negative/positive polarizations.








Abstract
Ti3C2Tx MXene film is promising for low&#8208;voltage electrochemical actuators (ECAs) due to its excellent electrical conductivity, volumetric capacitance, and mechanical properties. However, its in&#8208;plane actuation is limited to little intralayer strain of MXene sheets under polarization. Here it is demonstrated that a simple tetrabutylammonium (TBA) functionalization of MXene improves the in&#8208;plane actuation strain by 337% and also enhances the mechanical property and stability in air and the electrolyte. Various in situ characterizations reveal that the improved actuation is ascribed to the co&#8208;insertion/desertion of TBA and Li ions into/from MXene interlayer galleries and inter&#8208;edge gaps that causes a large in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene sheets under negative/positive polarizations. The assembled bending actuator has a high strength and modulus and generates a peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain difference of 0.771% and a blocking force up to 51.5 times its own weight under 1&#160;V. The designed soft robotic tweezer can grasp an object under 1&#160;V and hold it firmly under 0&#160;V. The novel sheet sliding mechanism resembling the filament sliding theory in skeletal muscles may inspire the design of high&#8208;performance actuators with other nanomaterials.

         <title>Mid&#8208;IR Light&#8208;Activatable Full Spectrum LaB6 Plasmonic Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasmonic LaB6 photocatalyst can be excited by mid&#8208;IR (3900 nm) light and thermal radiation from hot/warm objects to generate reactive oxygen species and exert photodegradation of organic pollutants, as well as disinfection of multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria.








Abstract
Photocatalysts as long&#8208;lasting, benign reagents for disinfection of bacteria in hospitals and public areas/facilities/transportation vehicles are strongly needed. A common limitation for all existing semiconductor photocatalysts is the requirement of activation by external UV&#8211;vis&#8208;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light with wavelengths shorter than &#8776;1265 nm. None of the existing photocatalysts can function during nighttime in the absence of external light. Herein, an unprecedented LaB6 plasmonic photocatalyst is reported, which can absorb UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR light and mid&#8208;IR (3900 nm) light to split water and generate hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals for the decomposition of organic pollutants, as well as kill multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli bacteria. Mid&#8208;IR light (&#8776;2&#8211;50 &#181;m) is readily available from the natural environments via thermal radiation of warm/hot objects on the earth including human bodies, animals, furnances,&#160;hot/warm electrical devices, and buildings.

         <title>Deformation&#8208;Induced Photoprogrammable Pattern of Polyurethane Elastomers Based on Poisson Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns with high aspect ratio on polyurethane elastomers is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and the distribution of internal stress. This technology integrates the characteristics of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in stretchable strain sensors, anticounterfeiting devices, and functional systems.








Abstract
Elastomers with high aspect ratio surface patterns are a promising class of materials for designing soft machines in the future. Here, a facile method for fabricating surface patterns on polyurethane elastomer by subtly utilizing the Poisson effect and gradient photocrosslinking is demonstrated. By applying uniaxial tensile strains, the aspect ratio of the surface patterns can be optionally manipulated. At prestretched state, the pattern on the polyurethane elastomer can be readily constructed through compressive stress, resulting from the gradient photocrosslinking via selective photodimerization of an anthracene&#8208;functionalized polyurethane elastomer (referred to as ANPU). The macromolecular aggregation structures during stretching deformation significantly contribute to the fabrication of high aspect ratio surface patterns. The insightful finite element analysis well demonstrates that the magnitude and distribution of internal stress in the ANPU elastomer can be regulated by selectively gradient crosslinking, leading to polymer chains migrate from the exposed region to the unexposed region, thereby generating a diverse array of surface patterns. Additionally, the periodic surface patterns exhibit tunable structural color according to the different stretching states and are fully reversible over multiple cycles, opening up avenues for diverse applications such as smart displays, stretchable strain sensors, and anticounterfeiting devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Standing Metal Foam Catalysts for Cathodic Electro&#8208;Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops leaded foam&#8208;type electrodes through the dynamic hydrogen bubble template (DHBT) method and tests them in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation for synthesis of fine chemicals. All developed catalysts outperformed both Pb and CuSn7Pb15 in terms of chemical yields and energy efficiency. The latter material is deemed the best replacement for Pb in reductive organo&#8208;electrosynthesis.








Abstract
Although electro&#8208;organic synthesis is currently receiving renewed interest because of its potential to enable sustainability in chemical processes to value&#8208;added products, challenges in process development persist: For reductive transformations performed in protic media, an inherent issue is the limited choice of metallic cathode materials that can effectively suppress the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) while maintaining a high activity toward the targeted electro&#8208;organic reaction. Current development trends are aimed at avoiding the previously used HER&#8208;suppressing elements (Cd, Hg, and Pb) because of their toxicity. Here, this work reports the rational design of highly porous foam&#8208;type binary and ternary electrocatalysts with reduced Pb content. Optimized cathodes are tested in electro&#8208;organic reductions using an oxime to nitrile transformation as a model reaction relevant for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Their electrocatalytic performance is compared with that of the model CuSn7Pb15 bronze alloy that has recently been endorsed as the best cathode replacement for bare Pb electrodes. All developed metal foam catalysts outperform both bare Pb and the CuSn7Pb15 benchmark in terms of chemical yield and energetic efficiency. Moreover, post&#8208;electrolysis analysis of the crude electrolyte mixture and the cathode's surfaces through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively, reveal the foam catalysts&#8217; elevated resistance to cathodic corrosion.

         <title>Rejoint of Carbon Nitride Fragments into Multi&#8208;Interfacial Order&#8208;Disorder Homojunction for Robust Photo&#8208;Driven Generation of H2O2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a directed healing process is employed to splice carbon nitride pieces into a carbon nitride homojunction with multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces. The resultant catalyst exhibits boosted charge dynamics and more spatially and orderly separated redox centers, resulting in a remarkable yield, an excellent selectivity, and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency in photosynthesis of H2O2.








Abstract
Photocatalytic technology based on carbon nitride (C3N4) offers a sustainable and clean approach for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, but the yield is severely limited by the sluggish hot carriers due to the weak internal electric field. In this study, a novel approach is devised by fragmenting bulk C3N4&#160;into smaller pieces (CN&#8208;NH4) and then subjecting it to a directed healing process to create multiple order&#8208;disorder interfaces (CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK).&#160;The resulting junctions in CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK significantly boost charge dynamics and facilitate more spatially and orderly separated redox centers. As a result, CN&#8208;NH4&#8208;NaK demonstrates outstanding photosynthesis of H2O2 via both two&#8208;step single&#8208;electron and one&#8208;step double&#8208;electron oxygen reduction pathways, achieving a remarkable yield of 16675&#160;&#181;mol h&#8211;1&#160;g&#8211;1, excellent selectivity (&gt;&#160;91%), and a prominent solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency exceeding 2.3%. These remarkable results surpass pristine C3N4 by 158 times and outperform previously reported C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work represents a significant advancement in catalyst design and modification technology, inspiring the development of more efficient metal&#8208;free photocatalysts for the synthesis of highly valued fuels.

         <title>A Soft, Adhesive Self&#8208;Healing Naked&#8208;Eye Strain/Stress Visualization Patch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel naked&#8208;eye strain/stress visualization (NSV) patch is developed based on a bio&#8208;inspired force&#8208;responsive hydrogel. Reversible generation of light scattering mechano&#8208;iridophore is regulated by local deformations, serving as the sensing mechanism. NSV patches feature fast response, high resolution, wide dynamic range, great adhesiveness, and self&#8208;healing material capability. Their optical output can be directly read by naked eyes or smartphone apps.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A novel naked-eye strain/stress visualization (NSV) patch is developed based on a bio-inspired force-responsive hydrogel. Reversible generation of light scattering mechano-iridophore is regulated by local deformations, serving as the sensing mechanism. NSV patches feature fast response, high resolution, wide dynamic range, great adhesiveness, and self-healing material capability. Their optical output can be directly read by naked eyes or smartphone apps.

         <title>Crystallization Control Based on the Regulation of Solvent&#8211;Perovskite Coordination for High&#8208;Performance Ambient Printable FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A weak coordination solvent strategy is developed to tailor solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination. This strategy promotes the direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3),&#160;leads to more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics, and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. The corresponding ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%.








Abstract
The critical requirement for ambient&#8208;printed formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) lies in the control of nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and defect formation behavior, which are extensively influenced by interactions between the solvent and perovskite. Here, a strategy is developed that combines a cosolvent and an additive to efficiently tailor the coordination between the solvent and perovskite. Through in situ characterizations, the direct crystallization from the sol&#8211;gel phase to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is illustrated. When the solvent exhibits strong interactions with the perovskite, the sol&#8211;gel phases cannot effectively transform into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, resulting in a lower nucleation rate and confined crystal growth directions. Consequently, it becomes challenging to fabricate high&#8208;quality void&#8208;free perovskite films. Conversely, weaker solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination promotes direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This process exhibits more balanced nucleation&#8211;growth kinetics and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. This strategy leads to improved structural and optoelectronic properties within the FAPbI3 films, characterized by more compact grain stacking, smoother surface morphology, released lattice strain, and fewer defects. The ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells fabricated using this strategy exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%, with significantly reduced efficiency deviation and negligible decreases in the stabilized output.

         <title>Industrial Kraft Lignin Based Binary Cathode Interface Layer Enables Enhanced Stability in High Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost kraft lignin (KL) in highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) by binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy, which can significantly improve the stability of both binary and ternary photoactive layer (PAL) OSC, owing to the passivation of diffusion and reaction between bathocuproine (BCP) and nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). The results combine sustainable wood&#8208;based material with classic interface materials in advance NFA&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
Herein, a binary cathode interface layer (CIL) strategy based on the industrial solvent fractionated LignoBoost kraft lignin (KL) is adopted for fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs). The uniformly distributed phenol moieties in KL enable it to easily form hydrogen bonds with commonly used CIL materials, i.e., bathocuproine (BCP) and PFN&#8208;Br, resulting in binary CILs with tunable work function (WF). This work shows that the binary CILs work well in OSCs with large KL ratio compatibility, exhibiting equivalent or even higher efficiency to the traditional CILs in state of art OSCs. In addition, the combination of KL and BCP significantly enhanced OSC stability, owing to KL blocking the reaction between BCP and nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). This work provides a simple and effective way to achieve high&#8208;efficient OSCs with better stability and sustainability by using wood&#8208;based materials.

         <title>A Generic Strategy to Stabilize Wide Bandgap Perovskites for Efficient Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key cause of phase segregation in WBG perovskites is identified as residual PbI2 at the interface, creating electrical potential variations between domain surfaces and boundaries, inducing ion migration and subsequent phase segregation. Applying a surface reaction strategy to eliminate surface PbI2 residue enhances bandgap stability and mitigates photovoltage deficits in complete devices.








Abstract
Efficient wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are essential for fully maximizing the potential of tandem solar cells. However, these cells currently face challenges such as high photovoltage losses and the presence of phase segregation, which impede the attainment of their expected efficiency and stability. Herein, the root cause of halide segregation is investigated, uncovering a close association with the presence of locally aggregated lead iodide (PbI2), particularly at the perovskite/C60 interface. Kelvin&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy results indicate that the remaining PbI2 at the interface leads to potential electrical differences between the domain surface and boundaries, which drives the formation of halide segregation. By reacting the surface PbI2 residue with ethanediamine dihydroiodide (EDAI2) at proper temperature, it is possible to effectively mitigate the phase segregation. By applying this surface reaction strategy in WBG inverted cells, a notable improvement of &#8776;100&#160;mV is achieved in photovoltage over a wide range of WBG cells (1.67&#8211;1.78&#160;eV), resulting in a champion efficiency of 23.1% (certified 22.95%) for 1.67&#160;eV cells and 19.7% (certified 18.81%) for 1.75&#160;eV cells. Furthermore, efficiency of 26.1% is demonstrated in a monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem cell.

         <title>Diagnosing the Electrostatic Shielding Mechanism for Dendrite Suppression in Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal anode for aqueous zinc batteries is highly susceptible to dendrites and side reactions. Engineering the electrolyte with additives can combat these negative traits. Operando transmission electron microscopy is used to explore how the inclusion of LiCl additive encourages the formation of blocky Zn electroplated deposits, which it is proposed is due to an electrostatic shielding mechanism.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc electrolytes offer the potential for cheaper rechargeable batteries due to their safe compatibility with the high capacity metal anode; yet, they are stymied by irregular zinc deposition and consequent dendrite growth. Suppressing dendrite formation by tailoring the electrolyte is a proven approach from lithium batteries; yet, the underlying mechanistic understanding that guides such tailoring does not necessarily directly translate from one system to the other. Here, it is shown that the electrostatic shielding mechanism, a fundamental concept in electrolyte engineering for stable metal anodes, has different consequences for the plating morphology in aqueous zinc batteries. Operando electrochemical transmission electron microscopy is used to directly observe the zinc nucleation and growth under different electrolyte compositions and reveal that electrostatic shielding additive suppresses dendrites by inhibiting secondary zinc nucleation along the (100) edges of existing primary deposits and encouraging preferential deposition on the (002) faces, leading to a dense and block&#8208;like zinc morphology. The strong influence of the crystallography of Zn on the electrostatic shielding mechanism is further confirmed with Zn||Ti cells and density functional theory modeling. This work demonstrates the importance of considering the unique aspects of the aqueous zinc battery system when using concepts from other battery chemistries.

Operando electrochemical transmission electron microscopy is used to directly observe the zinc nucleation and growth under different electrolyte compositions and reveal that electrostatic shielding additive suppresses dendrites by inhibiting secondary zinc nucleation along the (100) edges of existing primary deposits and encouraging preferential deposition on the (002) faces, leading to a dense and block-like zinc morphology. The strong influence of the crystallography of Zn on the electrostatic shielding mechanism is further confirmed with Zn||Ti cells and density functional theory modeling. This work demonstrates the importance of considering the unique aspects of the aqueous zinc battery system when using concepts from other battery chemistries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>RuOx Quantum Dots Loaded on Graphdiyne for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strengthened d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based catalyst (RuOxQDs/GDY) and lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is achieved through the strong Ru&#8208;to&#8208;alkyne &#960; backdonation, which significantly enhances the catalytic performance of RuOxQDs/GDY for LiPSs conversion. RuOxQDs/GDY also enable ultrastable lithium metal anodes. Thus, the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur full cells are realized.








Abstract
Here, a strategy to strengthen d&#8211;p orbital hybridization by fabricating &#960; backbonding in the catalyst for efficient lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion is reported. A special interface structure of RuOx quantum dots (QDs) anchored on graphdiyne (GDY) nanoboxes (RuOxQDs/GDY) is prepared to enable strong Ru&#8208;to&#8208;alkyne &#960; backdonation, which effectively regulates the d&#8208;electron structures of Ru centers to promote the d&#8211;p orbital hybridization between the catalyst and LiPSs and significantly boosts the catalytic performance of RuOxQDs/GDY. The strong affinity with Li ions and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion of RuOxQDs/GDY also enable ultrastable Li metal anodes. Thus, S@RuOxQDs/GDY cathodes exhibit excellent cycling performance under harsh conditions, and Li@RuOxQDs/GDY anodes show an ultralong cycling life over 8800&#160;h without Li dendrite growth. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) full cells with S@RuOxQDs/GDY cathodes and Li@RuOxQDs/GDY anodes can deliver an impressive areal capacity of 17.8&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 and good cycling stability under the practical conditions of low negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio (N/P = 1.4), lean electrolyte (E/S = 3&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1), and high S mass loading (15.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Advanced Additive Manufacturing of Structurally&#8208;Colored Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;yield stress colloidal inks for 3D printing of structurally&#8208;colored objects are created through destabilization of ultra&#8208;stable silica suspensions with polar molecules. These inks form dense, uniform colloidal networks and swiftly transition from liquid to solid upon nozzle discharge, facilitating rapid, shrinkage&#8208;free printing. The resulting prints display structural colors and enhanced mechanical properties due to the dense network.








Abstract
Direct ink writing (DIW) stands out as a facile additive manufacturing method, minimizing material waste. Nonetheless, developing homogeneous Bingham inks with high yield stress and swift liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transitions for versatile 3D printing remains a challenge. In this study, high&#8208;performance Bingham inks are formulated by destabilizing silica particle suspensions in acrylate&#8208;based resin. A colloidal network forms in the shear&#8208;free state through interparticle attraction, achieved by disrupting the solvation layer of large resin molecules using polar molecules. The network is highly dense, with evenly distributed linkage strength as monodisperse particles undergo gelation at an ultra&#8208;high fraction. Crucially, the strength is calibrated to ensure a sufficiently large yield stress, while still allowing the network to reversibly melt under shear flow. The inks immediately undergo a liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition upon discharge, while maintaining fluidity without nozzle clogging. The dense colloidal networks develop structural colors due to the short&#8208;range order. This enables the rapid and sophisticated drawing of structurally&#8208;colored 3D structures, relying solely on rheological properties. Moreover, the printed composite structures exhibit high mechanical stability due to the presence of the colloidal network, which expands the range of potential applications.

         <title>Photocatalytic H2O2 Generation Reaction with a Benchmark Rate at Air&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Solid Joint Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid three&#8208;phase photocatalytic interface effectively enhances the interfacial oxygen concentration and results in largely enhanced performance in photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in water. This is attributed to an enhanced oxygen diffusion rate and high O2 concentration in triphase interface.








Abstract
The rapid charge recombination, low selectivity for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and limited O2 diffusion rate hinder the practical applications of photocatalytic H2O2 generation. Herein, a triphase photocatalytic system in which the H2O2 generation occurs at the air&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid joint interfaces is developed, using polymeric carbon nitride (PCN). The introduction of pyrrole units and cyano group into PCN can promote the activation of oxygen molecules and facilitate the spatial separation of HOMO and LUMO orbits, hence improving the charge carrier separation efficiency and enhancing the formation of H2O2. Importantly, the gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triphase interface system allows for the rapid transport of oxygen from the air to the reaction interface, overcoming the low solubility and slow diffusion of oxygen in the water in conventional liquid reaction systems. The triphase system shows a benchmark H2O2 generation rate over PCN&#8208;based materials in pure water (2063.21&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), which is an approximate tenfold enhancement as compared to powder photocatalyst (215.44&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Simulation and electrochemical tests reveal that the rapid oxygen diffusion rate of triphase interface can promote charge separation and provide more O2 to generate H2O2. This work provides a promising strategy for constructing an efficient and sustainable H2O2 production system.

         <title>Switchable Chemical&#8208;Bond Reorganization for the Stable Charge Trapping in Amorphous Silicon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors suggest a novel atomistic mechanism for stable charge storage in amorphous silicon nitride in charge trap flash memory. Through ab initio molecular dynamics and orbital interaction analysis, it is demonstrated that stable charge trapping involves chemical bond reorganization and large trap level shifts, resulting in charges being trapped in multicenter bonding states.








Abstract
Despite the widespread use of charge&#8208;trap flash (CTF) memory, the atomistic mechanism behind the exceptionally stable charge storage at the localized trap sites is still controversial. Herein, by combining first&#8208;principles calculations and orbital interaction analysis, a charge&#8208;dependent switchable chemical&#8208;bond reorganization is elucidated as the underpinning chemistry in the working mechanism of CTF. Especially, positively charged fourfold&#8208;coordinated nitrogen (dubbed N+ center), unappreciated until now, is the decisive component of the entire process; once an electron occupies this site, the N+ center disappears by breaking one N&#9472;Si bond, simultaneously forming a new Si&#9472;Si bond with a nearby Si atom which, in turn, creates fivefold coordinated Si. As a result, the electron is stored in a multi&#8208;center orbital belonging to multiple atoms including the newly formed Si&#9472;Si bond. It is also observed that hole trapping accompanies the creation of an N+ center by forming a new N&#9472;Si bond, which represents the reverse process. To further support and validate this model by means of core&#8208;level calculations, it is also shown that an N+ center's 1s core level is 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;eV deeper in energy than those of the threefold coordinated N atoms, in harmony with experimental X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy data.

Especially, positively charged fourfold-coordinated nitrogen (dubbed N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; center), unappreciated until now, is the decisive component of the entire process; once an electron occupies this site, the N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; center disappears by breaking one N&#9472;Si bond, simultaneously forming a new Si&#9472;Si bond with a nearby Si atom which, in turn, creates fivefold coordinated Si. As a result, the electron is stored in a multi-center orbital belonging to multiple atoms including the newly formed Si&#9472;Si bond. It is also observed that hole trapping accompanies the creation of an N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; center by forming a new N&#9472;Si bond, which represents the reverse process. To further support and validate this model by means of core-level calculations, it is also shown that an N&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; center's 1&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; core level is 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;eV deeper in energy than those of the threefold coordinated N atoms, in harmony with experimental X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment Modulating CaCO3&#8208;Based Colloidosomal Microreactors Can Generally Reinforce Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor microenvironment (TME) modulating CaCO3&#8208;based colloidosomal microreactors are constructed via encapulating catalase within CaCO3 nanoparticles assembled colloidsome. The obtained CCaP CSs can simultaneously neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and deplete immunosuppressive lactate, collectively leading to activated anticancer immunity. As a result, CCaP CSs treatment can remarkably reinforce the therapeutic potency of both anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 immunotherapy and EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapy in different tumor models.








Abstract
Tumor hypoxia and acidity, two general features of solid tumors, are known to have negative effect on cancer immunotherapy by directly causing dysfunction of effector immune cells and promoting suppressive immune cells inside tumors. Herein, a multifunctional colloidosomal microreactor is constructed by encapsulating catalase within calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticle&#8208;assembled colloidosomes (abbreviated as CaP CSs) via the classic double emulsion method. The yielded CCaP CSs exhibit well&#8208;retained proton&#8208;scavenging and hydrogen peroxide decomposition performances and can thus neutralize tumor acidity, attenuate tumor hypoxia, and suppress lactate production upon intratumoral administration. Consequently, CCaP CSs treatment can activate potent antitumor immunity and thus significantly enhance the therapeutic potency of coloaded anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) antibodies in both murine subcutaneous CT26 and orthotopic 4T1 tumor xenografts. In addition, such CCaP CSs treatment also markedly reinforces the therapeutic potency of epidermal growth factor receptor expressing chimeric antigen receptor T (EGFR&#8208;CAR&#8208;T) cells toward a human triple&#8208;negative breast cancer xenograft by promoting their tumor infiltration and effector cytokine secretion. Therefore, this study highlights that chemical modulation of tumor acidity and hypoxia can collectively reverse tumor immunosuppression and thus significantly potentiate both immune checkpoint blockade and CAR&#8208;T cell immunotherapies toward solid tumors.

         <title>Reconstruction of Vesicle Assemblies with DNA Nanorulers for Resolving Heterogeneity of Vesicles in Live Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a vitro system composed of synaptic vesicle&#8208;sized vesicles coupled to double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) nanorulers, which enables to selectively connect isolated vesicles to generate vesicle assemblies with controlled lateral distance (from 3 to 10 nm). Moreover, this work analyzes the state heterogeneity of vesicles (individual vesicle or vesicle clusters) in cells and vesicle release heterogeneity in different positions across the cell.








Abstract
Nanoscale vesicles such as synaptic vesicles play a pivotal role in efficient interneuronal communications in vivo. However, the coexistence of single vesicle and vesicle clusters in living cells increases the heterogeneity of vesicle populations, which largely complicates the quantitative analysis of the vesicles. The high spatiotemporal monitoring of vesicle assemblies is currently incompletely resolved. Here, this work uses synthetic vesicles and DNA nanorulers to reconstruct in vitro the vesicle assemblies that mimic vesicle clusters in living cells. DNA nanorulers program the lateral distance of vesicle assemblies from 3 to 10 nm. This work uses the carbon fiber nanoelectrode (CFNE) to amperometric monitor artificial vesicle assemblies with sub&#8208;10 nm interspaces, and obtain a larger proportion of complex events. This work resolves the heterogeneity of individual vesicle release kinetics in PC12 cells with the temporal resolution down to &#8776;0.1 ms. This work further analyzes the aggregation state of intracellular vesicles and the exocytosis of living cells with electrochemical vesicle cytometry. The results indicate that the exocytosis of vesicle clusters is critically dependent on the size of clusters. This technology has the potential as a tool to shed light on the heterogeneity analysis of vesicle populations.

         <title>Structure Engineered High Piezo&#8208;Photoelectronic Performance for Boosted Sono&#8208;Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design of watermelon&#8208;like ZnSnO3@UCNPs (upconversion nanoparticles) heterostructure can effectively prevent the degradation of piezoelectric ZnSnO3 quantum dots in tumor environment, fully utilizing its piezoelectric catalytic effect as an antitumor carrier. Combined with the photodynamic therapy effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO3, a satisfactory therapeutic efficacy is realized.








Abstract
Sono&#8208;photodynamic therapy is hindered by the limited tissue penetration depth of the external light source and the quick recombination of electron&#8211;hole owing to the random movement of charge carriers. In this study, orthorhombic ZnSnO3 quantum dots (QDs) with piezo&#8208;photoelectronic effects are successfully encapsulated in hexagonal upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) using a one&#8208;pot thermal decomposition method to form an all&#8208;in&#8208;one watermelon&#8208;like structured sono&#8208;photosensitizer (ZnSnO3@UCNPs). The excited near&#8208;infrared light has high penetration depth, and the watermelon&#8208;like structure allows for full contact between the UCNPs and ZnSnO3 QDs, achieving ultrahigh F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer efficiency of up to 80.30%. Upon ultrasonic and near&#8208;infrared laser co&#8208;activation, the high temperature and pressure generated lead to the deformation of the UCNPs, thereby driving the deformation of all ZnSnO3 QDs inside the UCNPs, forming many small internal electric fields similar to isotropic electric domains. This piezoelectric effect not only increases the internal electric field intensity of the entire material but also prevents random movement and rapid recombination of charge carriers, thereby achieving satisfactory piezocatalytic performance. By combining the photodynamic effect arising from the energy transfer from UCNPs to ZnSnO3, synergistic efficacy is realized. This study proposes a novel strategy for designing highly efficient sono&#8208;photosensitizers through structural design.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Electron Synchronization Excitation for Photochemical Synthesis and Patterning Graphene&#8208;Based Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a novel approach for synthesizing and patterning electrodes using multi&#8208;point electron synchronization excitation. It not only significantly enhances the processing efficiency for micro&#8208;supercapacitors but also circumvents the influence of electrode morphology during the traditional laser direct writing. This strategy leads to enhanced electrochemical performance&#160;and better processing efficiency and quality of micro&#8208;supercapacitors.








Abstract
Micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) represent a pressing requirement for powering the forthcoming generation of micro&#8208;electronic devices. The simultaneous realization of high&#8208;efficiency synthesis of electrode materials and precision patterning for MSCs in a single step presents an ardent need, yet it poses a formidable challenge. Herein, a unique shaped laser&#8208;induced patterned electron synchronization excitation strategy has been put forward to photochemical synthesis RuO2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrode and simultaneously manufacture the micron&#8208;scale high&#8208;performance MSCs with ultra&#8208;high resolution. Significantly, the technique represents a noteworthy advancement over traditional laser direct writing (LDW) patterning and photoinduced synthetic electrode methods. It not only improves the processing efficiency for MSCs and the controllability of laser&#8208;induced electrode material but also enhances electric fields and potentials at the interface for better electrochemical performance. The resultant MSCs exhibit excellent area and volumetric capacitance (516&#160;mF&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1720&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3), and ultrahigh energy density (0.41&#160;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;3) and well&#8208;cycle stability (retaining 95% capacitance after 12000 cycles). This investigation establishes a novel avenue for electrode design and underscores substantial potential in the fabrication of diverse microelectronic devices.

         <title>Ultrastrong and High&#8208;Tough Thermoset Epoxy Resins from Hyperbranched Topological Structure and Subnanoscaled Free Volume</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the preparation of high&#8208;performance epoxy thermosets from hyperbranched epoxy, overcoming the two conflicts between strength and toughness and between high performance and highly efficient degradation. The in&#8208;situ simultaneous reinforcing and toughening mechanism is well investigated, being attributed to a synergistic effect of high crosslinking density, minimization of free volume, narrow free volume distribution, and hyperbranched structure.








Abstract
The strength and toughness of thermoset epoxy resins are generally mutually exclusive, as are the high performance and rapid recyclability. Experimentally determined mechanical strength values are usually much lower than their theoretical values. The preparation of thermoset epoxy resins with high modulus, high toughness, ultrastrong strength, and highly efficient recyclability is still a challenge. Here, novel hyperbranched epoxy resins (Bn, n = 6, 12, 24)&#160;with imide structures by a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction. Bn shows an excellent comprehensive function in simultaneously improving the strength, modulus, toughness, low&#8208;temperature resistance, and degradability of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol&#8208;A (DGEBA). All the mechanical properties first increase and then decrease with minimization of the free volume properties. The improvement is attributable to uniform molecular holes or free volume by a molecular mixture of linear and hyperbranched topological structures. The precise measurement and controllability of the molecular free volume properties of epoxy resins is first discovered, as well as the imide structure degradation of crosslinked epoxy resins. The two conflicts are successfully resolved between strength and toughness and between high performance during service and high efficiency during degradation. These findings provide a route for designing ultrastrong, tough, and recyclable thermoset epoxy resins.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature, Current&#8208;Induced Magnetization Self&#8208;Switching in A Van Der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In conventional switching heterostructures based on spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT), a spin source material with strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling or broken inversion symmetry is typically required to generate SOT when a charge current is applied. In this study, we achieved current&#8208;induced self&#8208;switching of magnetization at room temperature using a layered polar magnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2, thereby greatly simplifying the structure for magnetization switching.








Abstract
2D layered materials with broken inversion symmetry are being extensively pursued as &#160;spin&#160;source layers to realize high&#8208;efficiency magnetic switching. Such low&#8208;symmetry layered systems are, however, scarce. In addition, most layered magnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy show a low Curie temperature. Here, the experimental observation of spin&#8211;orbit torque magnetization self&#8208;switching at room temperature in a layered polar ferromagnetic metal, Fe2.5Co2.5GeTe2 is reported. The spin&#8211;orbit torque is generated from the broken inversion symmetry along the c&#8208;axis of the crystal. These results provide a direct pathway toward applicable 2D spintronic devices.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Photothermal CO2 Methanation over Greenhouse&#8208;Like Plasmonic Superstructures of Ultrasmall Cobalt Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic approach to enhance the efficiency of photothermal conversion while maintaining the excellent intrinsic catalytic reactivity for ultrasmall Co nanoparticles is demonstrated by integrating the &#8220;nano&#8208;greenhouse effect&#8221; with plasmonic coupling. This work reveals the great potential of nanoscale greenhouse effect in enhancing photothermal conversions through the combination with conventional promoting strategies.








Abstract
Improving the solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal energy conversion efficiency of photothermal nanomaterials at no expense of other physicochemical properties, e.g., the catalytic reactivity of metal nanoparticles, is highly desired for diverse applications but remains a big challenge. Herein, a synergistic strategy is developed for enhanced photothermal conversion by a greenhouse&#8208;like plasmonic superstructure of 4 nm cobalt nanoparticles while maintaining their intrinsic catalytic reactivity. The silica shell plays a key role in retaining the plasmonic superstructures for efficient use of the full solar spectrum, and reducing the heat loss of cobalt nanoparticles via the nano&#8208;greenhouse effect. The optimized plasmonic superstructure catalyst exhibits supra&#8208;photothermal CO2 methanation performance with a record&#8208;high rate of 2.3 mol gCo&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, close to 100% CH4 selectivity, and desirable catalytic stability. This work reveals the great potential of nanoscale greenhouse effect in enhancing photothermal conversions through the combination with conventional promoting strategies, shedding light on the design of efficient photothermal nanomaterials for demanding applications.

Inspired by the poison dart frog's skin with venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injects into the silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SLIPS)&#8212;the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS) for neritic marine antifouling.








Abstract
Slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have received widespread attention in the antifouling field. However, the reduction in antifouling performance caused by lubricant loss limits their application in marine antifouling. Herein, inspired by the skin of a poison dart frog which contains venom glands and mucus, a porous liquid (PL) based on ZIF&#8208;8 is prepared as a lubricant and injected into a silicone polyurethane (SPU) matrix to construct a new type of SLIPS for marine antifouling applications: the slippery porous&#8208;liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SPIPS). The SPIPS consists of a responsive antifoulant&#8208;releasing switch between &#8220;defensive&#8221; and &#8220;offensive&#8221; antifouling modes to intelligently enhance the antifouling effect after lubricant loss. The SPIPS can adjust antifouling performance to meet the antifouling requirements under different light conditions. The wastage of antifoulants is reduced, thereby effectively maintaining the durability and service life of SLIPS materials. The SPIPS exhibits efficient lubricant self&#8208;replenishment, self&#8208;cleaning, anti&#8208;protein, anti&#8208;bacterial, anti&#8208;algal, and self&#8208;healing (97.48%) properties. Furthermore, it shows satisfactory 360&#8208;day antifouling performance in actual marine fields during boom seasons, demonstrating the longest antifouling lifespan in the field tests of reported SLIPS coatings. Hence, the SPIPS can effectively promote the development of SLIPS for neritic antifouling.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Based Optical Logic Operators Driven by Diffractive Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;compact optical quantum logic operator based on multifunctional metasurfaces is implemented under a spatial&#8208; and polarization&#8208;multiplexed strategy. Such a novel program for optical quantum computing is experimentally validated to achieve high fidelities (99.88%) for all four classical quantum logical gates at ultra&#8208;high operating speeds.








Abstract
In this paper, a novel optical logic operator based on the multifunctional metasurface driven by all&#8208;optical diffractive neural network is reported, which can perform four principal quantum logic operations (Pauli&#8208;X, Pauli&#8208;Y, Pauli&#8208;Z, and Hadamard gates). The two ground states |0&#10217;$|0 \rangle $ and |1&#10217;$|1 \rangle $&#8197;are characterized by two orthogonal linear polarization states. The proposed spatial&#8208; and polarization&#8208;multiplexed all&#8208;optical diffractive neural network only contains a hidden layer physically mapped as a metasurface with simple and compact unit cells, which dramatically reduces the volume and computing resources required for the system. The designed optical quantum operator is proven to achieve high fidelities for all four quantum logical gates, up to 99.96% numerically and 99.88% experimentally. The solution will facilitate the construction of large&#8208;scale optical quantum computing systems and scalable optical quantum devices.

&lt;p&gt;An ultra-compact optical quantum logic operator based on multifunctional metasurfaces is implemented under a spatial- and polarization-multiplexed strategy. Such a novel program for optical quantum computing is experimentally validated to achieve high fidelities (99.88%) for all four classical quantum logical gates at ultra-high operating speeds.

         <title>Molecular Masking of Synthetic Immunomodulator Evokes Antitumor Immunity With Reduced Immune Tolerance and Systemic Toxicity by Temporal Activity Recovery and Sustained Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinical application of toll&#8208;like receptor agonist (TLR7/8a)&#160;therapy is limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal activity recovery&#160;of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposomes (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) in a macroscale depot is designed.








Abstract
Activation of the innate immune system counteracts tumor&#8208;induced immunosuppression. Hence, small molecule&#8208;based toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonists (TLR7/8a), which can modulate immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment along with the activation of innate immunity, are emerging as essential components of cancer immunotherapy. However, the clinical application of synthetic TLR7/8a therapies is limited by systemic immune&#8208;associated toxicity and immune tolerance induced by uncontrolled stimulatory activities and repeated treatments. To address these limitations, a dynamic immunomodulation strategy incorporating masking and temporal recovery of the activity of TLR7/8a through prodrug&#8208;like TLR7/8a (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) at the molecular level and a sustained and controlled release of active TLR7/8a from nanoliposome (pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) (NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8)) in a macroscale depot are designed. Immunization with cationic NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8) and anionic antigens triggers robust activation of innate immune cells as well as antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses, eliciting reprogramming of immunosuppressive cells into tumor&#8208;suppressive cells, with decreased systemic adverse effects and immune tolerance. Combination treatment with NL(pro&#8208;TLR7/8a) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 plus anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) or nanoliposomes (Doxorubicin) has synergistic effects on antitumor immunity in various tumor models. The concept of pro&#8208;TLR7/8a suggested herein may facilitate the advancement of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based immunomodulators for clinical translation and safe and effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Free&#8208;Standing Film with Versatility: From Heterogeneous CTCs Programed Isolating to Breast Cancer Molecular Typing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A free&#8208;standing film composed of titanium dioxide nanotube/silk fibroin is developed by an eco&#8208;friendly way. It is an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use platform for capturing and profiling heterogeneous circular tumor cells (CTCs) effectively and accurately from the unprocessed blood samples of patients, discriminating the CTCs with different surface biomarkers, showing the potential in molecular typing of breast cancer.








Abstract
Developing a robust strategy for profiling heterogeneous circular tumor cells specifically, distinguishing the phenotypes of which in blood sample of cancer patient precisely, and releasing them sequentially, is significant for cancer management by liquid biopsy. Herein, a bio&#8208;inspired free&#8208;standing and flexible film composed of TiO2 nanotube and silk fibroin, fabricated with multiply dynamic bioactive surface (TSF/MDBS) by a simple and eco&#8208;friendly way including using polydopamine chemistry and dual dynamic covalent chemistry, is reported. The as&#8208;prepared TSF/MDBS binds specific peptides toward cells with epithelial biomarker and human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) biomarker, and antifouling agents bovine serum albumin for obviating platelets and proteins adhering of blood, can capture heterogeneous CTCs with enhanced capability due to the cytocompatible soft film and exquisite surface design, and further release the captured cells as program, by specifically breaking down the covalent bonds in sequence via the action of adding biocompatible molecules fructose and glutathione. By applying the TSF/MDBS, it can be tailored into desired pieces for identifying CTCs with different phenotypes (HER2&#8208;high and HER2&#8208;low) from the unprocessed blood samples of breast cancer patients, and finally profiling these heterogeneous CTCs, to discriminate HER2 positive or negative of breast cancer patients in clinical applications.

         <title>Smart&#8208;Responsive HOF Heterostructures with Multiple Spatial&#8208;Resolved Emission Modes toward Photonic Security Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smart&#8208;responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) heterostructure is first realized based on the differentiated design on high&#8208;electronegative atoms of building blocks, which exhibit dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;controlled spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes, facilitating the construction of responsive photonic barcodes with multiple convert states. These results provide enlightenment on the function&#8208;oriented design of smart&#8208;responsive HOF heterosystem for advanced anticounterfeiting and information security applications.








Abstract
Luminescent hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) with the unique dynamics and versatile functional sites hold great potential application in information security, yet most of responsive HOFs focus on the single&#8208;component framework with restrained emission control, limiting further applications in advanced confidential information protection. Herein, the first smart&#8208;responsive HOF heterostructure with multiple spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes for covert photonic security platform is reported. The HOF heterostructures are prepared by integrating different HOFs into a single microwire based on a hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth method. The distinct responsive behaviors of HOFs permit the heterostructure to simultaneously display the thermochromism via the framework transformation and the acidichromism via the protonation effect, thus generating multiple emission modes. The dual stimuli&#8208;controlled spatial&#8208;resolved emission modes constitute the fingerprint of a heterostructure, and enable the establishment of the smart&#8208;responsive photonic barcode with multiple convert states, which further demonstrate the dynamic coding capability and enhanced security in anticounterfeiting label applications. These results offer a promising route to design function&#8208;oriented smart responsive HOF microdevices toward advanced anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Adaptable Optothermal Nanotweezers for Trapping, Sorting, and Assembling across Diverse Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly&#8208;adaptable optothermal nanotweezer (HAONT) is a universal optothermal manipulation scheme with sub&#8208;10 nm precision, enabling trapping, sorting, assembling, and novel doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex trapping across diverse nanoparticles. Its versatility expands its functionality to a broad spectrum of nanoparticles, making it a useful tool for versatile nano&#8208;fabrication across various materials, charges, shapes, sizes, and beyond.








Abstract
Optical manipulation of various kinds of nanoparticles is vital in biomedical engineering. However, classical optical approaches demand higher laser power and are constrained by diffraction limits, necessitating tailored trapping schemes for specific nanoparticles. They lack a universal and biocompatible tool to manipulate nanoparticles of diverse sizes, charges, and materials. Through precise modulation of diffusiophoresis and thermo&#8208;osmotic flows in the boundary layer of an optothermal&#8208;responsive gold film, highly adaptable optothermal nanotweezers (HAONTs) capable of manipulating a single nanoparticle as small as sub&#8208;10&#160;nm are designed. Additionally, a novel optothermal doughnut&#8208;shaped vortex (DSV) trapping strategy is introduced, enabling a new mode of physical interaction between cells and nanoparticles. Furthermore, this versatile approach allows for the manipulation of nanoparticles in organic, inorganic, and biological forms. It also offers versatile function modes such as trapping, sorting, and assembling of nanoparticles. It is believed that this approach holds the potential to be a valuable tool in fields such as synthetic biology, optofluidics, nanophotonics, and colloidal science.

         <title>Artificial Photosynthetic System with Spatial Dual Reduction Site Enabling Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Step&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, recognized for their efficient charge transport and high redox capacity, are considered a viable approach to improve photocatalytic hydrogen production. In this study, a double S&#8208;scheme heterojunction featuring spatial dual reduction sites is developed. This design enhances solar hydrogen production and yields a high apparent quantum efficiency. This work contributes a significant approach to the development of more effective S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthetic systems.








Abstract
Although S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthesis shows promise for photocatalytic hydrogen production, traditional methods often overly concentrate on a single reduction site. This limitation results in inadequate redox capability and inefficient charge separation, which hampers the efficiency of the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. To overcome this limitation, a double S&#8208;scheme system is proposed that leverages dual reduction sites, thereby preserving energetic photo&#8208;electrons and holes to enhance apparent quantum efficiency. The design features a double S&#8208;scheme junction consisting of CdS nanospheres decorated with anatase TiO2 nanoparticles coupled with graphitic C3N4. The as&#8208;prepared catalyst exhibits a hydrogen evolution rate of 26.84&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and an apparent quantum efficiency of 40.2% at 365 nm. This enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is ascribed to the efficient charge separation and transport induced by the double S&#8208;scheme. Both theoretical calculations and comprehensive spectroscopy tests (both in&#160;situ and ex&#160;situ) affirm the efficient charge transport across the catalyst interface. Moreover, substituting the reduction&#8208;type catalyst CdS with other similar sulfides like ZnIn2S4, ZnS, MoS2 and In2S3 further confirms the feasibility of the proposed double S&#8208;scheme configuration. The findings provide a pathway to designing more effective double S&#8208;scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, opening up fresh perspectives in enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.

         <title>Highly Potent and Low&#8208;Volume Concentration Additives for Durable Aqueous Zinc Batteries: Machine Learning&#8208;Enabled Performance Rationalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,2&#8208;alkanediols with an optimal chain length are unveiled as highly potent low&#8208;volume concentration electrolyte additives to address the zinc anode rechargeability for the practical development of aqueous zinc batteries. A machine learning&#8208;based model that maps the performance relative to critical additive physicochemical descriptors is presented, which can lead the way for a rational approach to additive design and discoveries.








Abstract
The essential virtues of aqueous zinc battery chemistry stem from the energy&#8208;dense zinc metal anode and mild aqueous electrolytes. Yet, their incompatibility &#8211; as exposed by zinc's corrosion and associated dendrite problem &#8211; poses a challenge to achieving improved cycle life under practically relevant parameters. While electrolyte additives are a scalable strategy, additives that can function at low volume concentrations remain elusive. Here, through screening alkanol and alkanediol chemistries, 1,2&#8208;butanediol and pentanediol are unveiled as highly potent additives, which operate at a practical 1 volume% concentration owing to their ability to furnish dynamic solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase through pronounced interfacial filming. This unique mechanistic action renders effective corrosion and dendrite mitigation, resulting in up to five to twenty&#8208;fold zinc cyclability enhancement with a high Coulombic efficiency (up to 99.9%) and improved full&#8208;cell performance under demanding conditions, including at elevated temperatures. A machine learning&#8208;based analysis is presented to rationalize the additive performance relative to critical physicochemical descriptors, which can pave the way for a rational approach to efficient additive discoveries.

         <title>Epitaxial Ultrathin Pt Atomic Layers on CrN Nanoparticle Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt atomic layers catalysts with electron&#8208;deficient Pt sites and epitaxial strain are successfully grown on low&#8208;cost CrN nanoparticles via a facile thermal ammonlysis method. The Pt atomic layers on CrN electrocatalyst deliver outstanding activity and durability for the formic acid oxidation reaction, guiding the development of low&#8208;cost Pt&#8208;based catalysts for various applications.








Abstract
The construction of platinum (Pt) atomic layers is an effective strategy to improve the utilization efficiency of Pt atoms in electrocatalysis, thus is important for reducing the capital costs of a wide range of energy storage and conversion devices. However, the substrates used to grow Pt atomic layers are largely limited to noble metals and their alloys, which is not conducive to reducing catalyst costs. Herein, low&#8208;cost chromium nitride (CrN) is utilized as a support for the loading of epitaxial ultrathin Pt atomic layers via a simple thermal ammonolysis method. Owing to the strong anchoring and electronic regulation of Pt atomic layers by CrN, the obtained Pt atomic layers&#160;catalyst (containing electron&#8208;deficient Pt sites) exhibits excellent activity and endurance for the formic acid oxidation reaction, with a mass activity of 5.17&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 that is 13.6 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C catalyst. This novel strategy demonstrates that CrN can replace noble metals as a low&#8208;cost substrate for constructing Pt atomic layers catalysts.

         <title>Engineering Semicarbazide&#8208;Bearing Polypeptide Conjugates for Efficient Tumor Chemotherapy and Imaging of Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of well&#8208;defined polypeptides containing semicarbazide moieties via direct polymerization of N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acid (NPCA) based monomers. These polypeptides can be further decorated with ketone/aldehyde&#8208;containing agents with the formation of pH&#8208;cleavable semicarbazone linkages. The intracellular acidic pH&#8208;triggered release promotes drug escape from endolysosomes and enhances anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, which can be also employed for highly sensitive detection of tumor lesions.








Abstract
Polypeptide materials offer scalability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, rendering them an ideal platform for biomedical applications. However, the preparation of polypeptides with specific functional groups, such as semicarbazide moieties, remains challenging. This work reports, for the first time, the straightforward synthesis of well&#8208;defined methoxy&#8208;terminated poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;b&#8208;polypeptide hybrid block copolymers (HBCPs) containing semicarbazide moieties. This synthesis involves implementing the direct polymerization of environment&#8208;stable N&#8208;phenoxycarbonyl&#8208;functionalized &#945;&#8208;amino acid (NPCA) precursors, thereby avoiding the handling of labile N&#8208;carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers. The resulting HBCPs containing semicarbazide moieties enable facile functionalization with aldehyde/ketone derivatives, forming pH&#8208;cleavable semicarbazone linkages for tailored drug release. Particularly, the intracellular pH&#8208;triggered hydrolysis of semicarbazone moieties restores the initial semicarbazide residues, facilitating endo&#8208;lysosomal escape and thus improving therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, the integration of the hypoxic probe (Ir(btpna)(bpy)2) into the pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicines allows sequential responses to acidic and hypoxic tumor microenvironments, enabling precise detection of metastatic tumors. The innovative approach for designing bespoke functional polypeptides holds promise for advanced drug delivery and precision therapeutics.

         <title>Polyester Nanofiltration Membranes for Efficient Cations Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyester nanofiltration membrane for cation separation is prepared by interfacial polymerization of TET with TMC. The &#8220;hydroxyl&#8208;ammonium&#8221; entities in the TET confer the TET&#8208;TMC membrane with dense structures and positive surface charge, leading to MgCl2 retention (95.5%) significantly higher than other polyester nanofiltration membranes (&lt;50%).








Abstract
Polyester nanofiltration membranes highlight beneficial chlorine resistance, but their loose structures and negative charge result in poor cations retention precluding advanced use in cations separation. This work designs a new monomer (TET) containing &#8220;hydroxyl&#8208;ammonium&#8221; entities that confer dense structures and positive charge to polyester nanofiltration membranes. The TET monomer undergoes efficient interfacial polymerization with the trimesoyl chloride (TMC) monomer, and the resultant TET&#8208;TMC membranes feature one of the lowest molecular weight cut&#8208;offs (389&#160;Da) and the highest zeta potential (4&#160;mv, pH: 7) among all polyester nanofiltration membranes. The MgCl2 rejection of the TET&#8208;TMC membrane is 95.5%, significantly higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polyester nanofiltration membranes (&lt;50%). The Li+/Mg2+ separation performance of TET&#8208;TMC membrane is on par with cutting&#8208;edge polyamide membranes, while additionally, the membrane is stable against NaClO though polyamide membranes readily degrade. Thus the TET&#8208;TMC is the first polyester nanofiltration membrane for efficient cations separation.

         <title>High Output Power and High Quantum Efficiency in Novel NIR Phosphor MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ with Profound FWHM Variation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel ultra&#8208;broadband near&#8208;infrared phosphor MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:0.05Cr3+ exhibits impressive external quantum efficiency and output power. MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ undergoes a transition from ultra&#8208;narrowband to ultra&#8208;broadband emission as the Cr3+ concentration increased, driven by energy transfer between the three emitting centers.








Abstract
There is strong demand for ultraefficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors with adjustable emission properties for next&#8208;generation intelligent NIR light sources. Designing phosphors with large full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) variations is challenging. In this study, novel near&#8208;ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diode&#160;(LED)&#8208;excited NIR phosphors, MgAlGa0.7B0.3O4:Cr3+ (MAGBO:Cr3+), with three emission centers achieve ultra&#8208;narrowband (FWHM = 29&#160;nm) to ultra&#8208;broadband (FWHM = 260&#160;nm) emission with increasing Cr3+ concentration. Gaussian fitting and decay time analysis reveal the alteration in the FWHM, which is attributed to the energy transfer occurring between the three emission centers. The distinct thermal quenching behaviors of the three emission centers are revealed through the temperature&#8208;dependent decay times. The ultra&#8208;broadband NIR phosphor MAGBO:0.05Cr3+ exhibits high thermal stability (85%, 425 K) and exceptional external quantum efficiency of 68.5%. An NIR phosphor&#8208;converted LED (pc&#8208;LED) is fabricated using MAGBO:0.05Cr3+ phosphor, exhibiting a remarkable NIR output power of 136&#160;mW at 600&#160;mA in ultra&#8208;broadband NIR pc&#8208;LEDs. This study describes the preparation of highly efficient phosphors and provides a further understanding of the tunable FWHM, which is vital for high&#8208;performance NIR phosphors with versatile applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Wearable Organic Photodetectors by Molecular Design and Green Solvent Processing for Pulse Oximetry and Photoplethysmography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic photodetectors processed from a biomass&#8208;derived solvent, namely 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran, which simultaneously exhibits a remarkably high detectivity and surpasses the performances of devices processed from conventional chlorinated solvents, are developed. Furthermore, such devices can also be used as smart wearable devices for medical applications, such as heart pulse rate monitoring and blood oxygen saturation assessment.








Abstract
White&#8208;light detection from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared region is central to many applications such as high&#8208;speed cameras, autonomous vehicles, and wearable electronics. While organic photodetectors (OPDs) are being developed for such applications, several challenges must be overcome to produce scalable high&#8208;detectivity OPDs. This includes issues associated with low responsivity, narrow absorption range, and environmentally friendly device fabrication. Here, an OPD system processed from 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran (2&#8208;MeTHF) sets a record in light detectivity, which is also comparable with commercially available silicon&#8208;based photodiodes is reported. The newly designed OPD is employed in wearable devices to monitor heart rate and blood oxygen saturation using a flexible OPD&#8208;based finger pulse oximeter. In achieving this, a framework for a detailed understanding of the structure&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationship in these OPDs is also developed. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) thin films processed from 2&#8208;MeTHF are characterized at different length scales with advanced techniques. The BHJ morphology exhibits optimal intermixing and phase separation of donor and acceptor moieties, which facilitates the charge generation and collection process. Benefitting from high charge carrier mobilities and a low shunt leakage current, the newly developed OPD exhibits a specific detectivity of above 1012&#160;Jones over 400&#8211;900&#160;nm, which is higher than those of reference devices processed from chlorobenzene and&#160;ortho&#8208;xylene.

         <title>A &#8220;One Arrow Three Eagle&#8221; Strategy to Improve CM&#8208;272 Primed Bladder Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 cannot only promote the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated SDT but also reduce the high level of GSH to enhance the reactive oxygen species, inducing ferroptosis and apoptosis. Significantly, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 actives ICD to enhance T&#8208;cell receptor activation to better respond to ICI (&#945;PD&#8208;1). Hence, this effective &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; strategy improves CM&#8208;272 primed bladder cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy using an immune&#8208;checkpoint blockade has significantly improved its therapeutic effects. CM&#8208;272, which is a novel epigenetic inhibitor of G9a, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) for recovering the sensitivity to anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies; however, the efficacy of CM&#8208;272 is greatly limited by promoting the transcription activity of HIF&#8208;1&#945; to form a hypoxic environment. Here, a Fe3+&#8208;based nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework (MIL&#8208;53) is used to load CM&#8208;272 (ultra&#8208;high loading rate of 56.4%) for realizing an MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 nanoplatform. After entering bladder cancer cells, Fe3+ not only promotes the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 for O2&#8208;compensated sonodynamic therapy but reduces the high level of glutathione in the tumor microenvironment (TME) for enhancing reactive oxygen species, including ferroptosis and apoptosis. MIL&#8208;53 carriers can be degraded in response to the TME, accelerating the release of CM&#8208;272, which helps achieve the maximum effectiveness in an O2&#8208;sufficient TME by attenuating drug resistance. Furthermore, MIL&#8208;53@CM&#8208;272 enhances dendritic cell maturation and synergistically combines it with an anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 antibody during the study of immune&#8208;related pathways in the transcriptomes of bladder cancer cells using RNA&#8208;seq. This study presents the first instance of amalgamating nanomedicine with CM&#8208;272, inducing apoptosis, ferroptosis, and ICD to achieve the &#8220;one arrow three eagle&#8221; effect.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Nanophosphors Based on CuInSe2 Quantum Dots with Near&#8208;Unity Photoluminescence Quantum Yield for Micro&#8208;LEDs Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphors based on CuInSe2 quantum dots (QDs) with tunable emission peaking from 750 to 1150&#160;nm and a high absolute photoluminescence quantum yield of 92.8% are reported. Notably, NIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with an output power of 88.7mW@350&#160;mA and bright micro&#8208;LEDs arrays with diameters less than 5&#160;&#181;m are achieved based on these QDs.








Abstract
Highly efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescent nanomaterials are urgently required for portable mini or micro phosphors&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes (pc&#8208;LEDs). However, most existing NIR&#8208;emitting phosphors are generally restricted by their low photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) or large particle size. Herein, a kind of highly efficient NIR nanophosphors is developed based on copper indium selenide quantum dots (CISe QDs). The PL peak of these QDs can be exquisitely manipulated from 750 to 1150&#160;nm by altering the stoichiometry of Cu/In and doping with Zn2+. Their absolute PLQY can be significantly improved from 28.6% to 92.8% via coating a ZnSe shell. By combining the phosphors with a commercial blue chip, an NIR pc&#8208;LED is fabricated with remarkable photostability and a record&#8208;high radiant flux of 88.7 mW@350&#160;mA among the Pb/Cd&#8208;free QDs&#8208;based NIR pc&#8208;LEDs. Particularly, such QDs&#8208;based nanophosphors acted as excellent luminescence converter for NIR micro&#8208;LEDs with microarray diameters below 5&#160;&#181;m, which significantly exceeds the resolutions of current commercial inkjet display pixels. The findings may open new avenues for the exploration of highly efficient NIR micro&#8208;LEDs in a variety of applications.

         <title>Synchronous Diagnosis of Respiratory Viruses Variants via Receptonics Based on Modeling Receptor&#8210;Ligand Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A receptor&#8211;ligand binding reaction based receptonics platform is presented as a facile diagnostic device to discriminate numerous strains of respiratory viruses. Diagnosis of respiratory viruses and their variants indicate its potential as on&#8208;site screening platform for fatal diseases without the need for complex additional equipment. The newly developed receptonics shows the possibility for the application of clinical samples and samples from primate model.








Abstract
The transmission and pathogenesis of highly contagious fatal respiratory viruses are increasing, and the need for an on&#8208;site diagnostic platform has arisen as an issue worldwide. Furthermore, as the spread of respiratory viruses continues, different variants have become the dominant circulating strains. To prevent virus transmission, the development of highly sensitive and accurate on&#8208;site diagnostic assays is urgently needed. Herein, a facile diagnostic device is presented for multi&#8208;detection based on the results of detailed receptor&#8210;ligand dynamics simulations for the screening of various viral strains. The novel bioreceptor&#8208;treated electronics (receptonics) device consists of a multichannel graphene transistor and cell&#8208;entry receptors conjugated to N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene (NHC). An ultrasensitive multi&#8208;detection performance is achieved without the need for sample pretreatment, which will enable rapid diagnosis and prevent the spread of pathogens. This platform can be applied for the diagnosis of variants of concern in clinical respiratory virus samples and primate models. This multi&#8208;screening platform can be used to enhance surveillance and discriminate emerging virus variants before they become a severe threat to public health.

         <title>Engineered Bio&#8208;Heterojunction Confers Extra&#8208; and Intracellular Bacterial Ferroptosis and Hunger&#8208;Triggered Cell Protection for Diabetic Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise ferroptosis bio&#8208;heterojunction (F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ) consisting of Fe2O3, Ti3C2&#8208;MXene, and glucose oxidase is developed to induce extra&#8208;intracellular bacteria&#8208;targeted ferroptosis for infected diabetic cutaneous regeneration. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ induces extracellular bacterial ferroptosis via photothermal, photodynamic, and chemodynamic properties and assists macrophages against intracellular bacteria via ferroportin&#8208;mediated bacterial ferroptosis and hunger&#8208;triggered AMPK pathway&#8208;mediated cell protection, elevating the biocompatibility of ferroptosis&#8208;mediated therapeutic strategies.








Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;mediated ferroptosis has garnered considerable interest in the antibacterial field, as it invokes the disequilibrium of ion homeostasis and boosts lipid peroxidation in extra&#8208; and intracellular bacteria. However, current ferroptosis&#8208;associated antibacterial strategies indiscriminately pose damage to healthy cells, ultimately compromising their biocompatibility. To address this daunting issue, this work has designed a precise ferroptosis bio&#8208;heterojunction (F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ) consisting of Fe2O3, Ti3C2&#8208;MXene, and glucose oxidase (GOx) to induce extra&#8208;intracellular bacteria&#8208;targeted ferroptosis for infected diabetic cutaneous regeneration. Fe2O3/Ti3C2&#8208;MXene@GOx (FMG) catalytically generates a considerable amount of ROS which assaults the membrane of extracellular bacteria, facilitating the permeation of synchronously generated Fe2+/Fe3+ into bacteria under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, causing planktonic bacterial death via ferroptosis, Fe2+ overload, and lipid peroxidation. Additionally, FMG facilitates intracellular bacterial ferroptosis by transporting Fe2+ into intracellular bacteria via inward ferroportin (FPN). With GOx consuming glucose, FMG creates hunger protection which helps macrophages escape cell ferroptosis by activating the adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. In vivo results authenticate that FMG boosts diabetic infectious cutaneous regeneration without triggering ferroptosis in normal cells. As envisaged, the proposed tactic provides a promising approach to combat intractable infections by precisely terminating extra&#8208;intracellular infection via steerable ferroptosis, thereby markedly elevating the biocompatibility of therapeutic ferroptosis&#8208;mediated strategies.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Based Macrophage&#8208;Like Nanoparticles for Targeted Photothermal Therapy and Virus Transmission Blockage in Monkeypox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise therapeutic, prevention, and control strategy for monkeypox, based on an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) loaded macrophage&#8208;like biomimetic nanoparticle (TBD@M NPs), is developed. TBD@M NPs achieve NIR&#8208;II fluorescent tracking of the monkeypox lesions and photothermal eradication of monkeypox virus after intravenous injection followed by 808&#160;nm laser stimulation, thus accomplishing monkeypox treatment, wound healing promoting, and virus transmission blockage.








Abstract
The recent prevalence of monkeypox has led to the declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Monkeypox lesions are typically ulcers or pustules (containing high titers of replication&#8208;competent virus) in the skin and mucous membranes, which allow monkeypox virus to transmit predominantly through intimate contact. Currently, effective clinical treatments for monkeypox are lacking, and strategies for blocking virus transmission are fraught with drawbacks. Herein, this work constructs a biomimetic nanotemplate (termed TBD@M NPs) with macrophage membranes as the coat and polymeric nanoparticles loading a versatile aggregation&#8208;induced emission featured photothermal molecule TPE&#8208;BT&#8208;DPTQ as the core. In a surrogate mouse model of monkeypox (vaccinia&#8208;virus&#8208;infected tail scarification model), intravenously injected TBD@M NPs show precise tracking and near&#8208;infrared region II fluorescence imaging of the lesions. Upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, the virus is eliminated by the photothermal effect and the infected wound heals rapidly. More importantly, the inoculation of treated lesion tissue suspensions does not trigger tail infection or inflammatory activation in healthy mice, indicating successful blockage of virus transmission. This study demonstrates for the first time monkeypox theranostics using nanomedicine, and may bring a new insight into the development of a viable strategy for monkeypox management in clinical trials.

Asymmetric &#960;&#8208;bridge engineering is proposed to improve the permittivity of polymer donors without impairing their miscibility with acceptor materials. Asymmetric &#960;&#8208;bridge benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran (BDF)&#8208;based polymer PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz demonstrates larger permittivity, smaller exciton binding energy, and more favorable molecular packing than its counterparts, leading to proficient charge dynamics and a promising power conversion efficiency of 18.10% with a remarkable fill factor of 80.11% for derived devices.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit complex charge dynamics, which are closely correlated with the dielectric constant (&#603;r) of photovoltaic materials. In this work, a series of novel conjugated copolymers based on benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran (BDF) and benzotriazole (BTz) is designed and synthesized, which differ by the nature of &#960;&#8208;bridge from one another. The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz with asymmetric furan and thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge demonstrates a larger &#603;r of 4.22 than PBDF&#8208;dT&#8208;BTz with symmetric thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.15) and PBDF&#8208;dF&#8208;BTz with symmetric furan &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.90). The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz also offers more favorable molecular packing and appropriate miscibility with non&#8208;fullerene acceptor Y6 than its counterparts. The corresponding PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6 OSCs display efficient exciton dissociation, fast charge transport and collection, and reduced charge recombination, eventually leading to a power conversion efficiency of 17.01%. When introducing a fullerene derivative (PCBO&#8208;12) as a third component, the PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6:PCBO&#8208;12 OSCs yield a remarkable FF of 80.11% with a high efficiency of 18.10%, the highest value among all reported BDF&#8208;polymer&#8208;based OSCs. This work provides an effective approach to developing high&#8208;permittivity photovoltaic materials, showcasing PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz as a promising polymer donor for constructing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Catalyzed Hydrogenation of Black Barium Titanate for Multienzyme&#8208;Piezoelectric Synergetic Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich black barium titanate nanoparticles for amplified piezocatalytic tumor therapy based on the narrowing of the bandgap and the suppression of carrier recombination processes through the introduction of the Pd component.








Abstract
Piezocatalytic tumor therapy is an emerging reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;generating therapeutic approach that relies on piezoelectric polarization under ultrasound (US) irradiation. Optimizing ROS production is a primary objective for enhancing treatment efficiency. In this study, oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich Pd&#8208;integrated black barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticles are rationally engineered to boost the ROS generation efficiency via the introduction of Pd. Pd&#8208;catalyzed hydrogenation at low temperatures narrows the bandgap of BTO and reduces the recombination rate of electron&#8208;hole pairs. Furthermore, Pd has dual&#8208;enzyme&#8208;mimicking characteristics, including peroxidase&#8208; and catalase&#8208;mimicking activities, which further heighten the therapeutic efficacy by enhancing ROS production and reversing the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Importantly, the dual enzymatic activity of Pd can be amplified by multiple redox processes sparked by the piezoelectric potential under US stimulation, resulting in bilaterally enhanced multienzyme&#8208;piezoelectric synergetic therapy. In vitro and in vivo results confirm high tumor inhibition in murine breast cancer cells. This work stresses the critical effects of defect engineering&#8208;optimized piezodynamic tumor therapy.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Magnesium Deposition Induced by Paper&#8208;Based Triple&#8208;Gradient Scaffolds toward Flexible Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible paper&#8208;based scaffold exhibiting gradient conductivity, magnesiophilicity, and pore size is fabricated using an industrially compatible papermaking process. This triple&#8208;gradient design controls the Mg ion flux for bottom&#8208;up deposition, facilitating superior cyclability. The high flexibility and minimal thickness of the scaffold align well with the emerging demand for flexible and wearable electronics, signaling a robust pathway for their advancement.








Abstract
The development of advanced magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) has been hindered by longstanding challenges, such as the inability to induce uniform magnesium (Mg) nucleation and the inefficient utilization of Mg foil. This study introduces a novel solution in the form of a flexible, lightweight, paper&#8208;based scaffold that incorporates gradient conductivity, magnesiophilicity, and pore size. This design is achieved through an industrially adaptable papermaking process in which the ratio of carboxylated multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes to softwood cellulose fibers is meticulously adjusted. The triple&#8208;gradient structure of the scaffold enables the regulation of Mg ion flux, promoting bottom&#8208;up Mg deposition. Owing to its high flexibility, low thickness, and reduced density, the scaffold has potential applications in flexible and wearable electronics. Accordingly, the triple&#8208;gradient electrodes exhibit stable operation for over 1200&#160;h at 3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 in symmetrical cells, markedly outperforming the non&#8208;gradient and metallic Mg alternatives. Notably, this study marks the first successful fabrication of a flexible MMB pouch full cell, achieving an impressive volumetric energy density of 244&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1. The simplicity and scalability of the triple&#8208;gradient design, which uses readily available materials through an industrially compatible papermaking process, open new doors for the production of flexible, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

         <title>Ultrathin Clay Nanoparticles&#8208;Mediated Mutual Reinforcement of Ferroptosis and Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mutual reinforcement of ferroptosis and antitumor immunity is a promising strategy to overcome the drawbacks of current immunotherapy. Effective interferon &#947; (IFN&#947;)&#160;delivery sensitizes tumor cells to ferroptosis induced by an ultrathin Mn&#8208;based clay nanocarrier. Immunogenic cancer cell death and tumor microenvironment modulation evoke strong immune response. Meanwhile, cytotoxic T cells released IFN&#947; in turn promotes ferroptosis occurrence.








Abstract
Ferroptosis&#8208;triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD) is widely adopted to potentiate the body's antitumor immunity by catalyzing the production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the efficacy of ferroptosis and immunotherapy is greatly restricted by intracellular abundant glutathione (GSH) and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a facile bottom&#8208;up method for solvent&#8208;free synthesis of ultrathin manganese (Mn)&#8208;based layered double hydroxide nanosheets with high loading efficiency for pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interferon (IFN&#947;) (IFN&#947;/uMn&#8208;LDHs) is proposed to mutually reinforce the ferroptosis and systemic immunity. The introduction of manganese ions significantly contributes to GSH depletion and hydroxyl radical generation, which can be further enhanced by IFN&#947; delivery&#8208;induced SLC7A11 downregulation. The ICD effect after cell ferroptosis cooperates with the intrinsic immunomodulatory property of IFN&#947;/uMn&#8208;LDHs to facilitate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and the priming of T cells. IFN&#947; secretion from activated CD8+ T cells in turn involves cascade immunogenic ferroptosis, thus constructing a closed&#8208;loop therapy. Remarkably, a potent abscopal effect is observed in the growth inhibition of both primary and distant tumors. Overall, the ultrathin Mn&#8208;based clay nanoplatform provides a simple approach for mutual regulation between ferroptosis and antitumor immune response, overcoming the obstacles of current cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Robust Ru&#8208;VO2 Bifunctional Catalysts for All&#8208;pH Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;VO2 catalysts containing Ru&#8208;doped VO2 and Ru nanoparticles are synthesized, and it shows excellent water splitting performance in all&#8208;pH range. The in&#8208;situ characterizations and Theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that synergy of Ru Nanoparticles and Ru&#8208;doped VO2 breaks the hydrogen bond network formed by *OH adsorbed on the Ru single&#8208;atom site, and thereby significantly boosts the acidic oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Designing robust bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction in all&#8208;pH conditions for overall water splitting (OWS) is an effective way to achieve sustainable development. Herein, a composite Ru&#8208;VO2 containing Ru&#8208;doped VO2 and Ru nanoparticles (NPs) is synthesized, and it shows a high OWS performance in full&#8208;pH range due to their synergist effect. In particular, the OER mass activities of Ru&#8208;VO2 at 1.53 V (vs RHE) in acidic, alkaline, and PBS solutions are &#8776;65, 36, and 235 times of commercial RuO2 in the same conditions. The &#8220;Ru&#8208;VO2 || Ru&#8208;VO2&#8221; two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer only needs a voltage of 1.515 V (at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) in acidic water splitting, which can operate stably for 125 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 without significant voltage decay. In situ Raman spectra and in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry prove that the OER of Ru&#8208;VO2 in acid follows the adsorption evolution mechanism. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the synergistic effect between Ru NP and Ru&#8208;doped VO2, which breaks the hydrogen bond network formed by *OH adsorbed on the Ru single&#8208;atom site, and thereby significantly enhances the OER activity. This work provides new insights into the design of novel bifunctional pH&#8208;universal catalysts for OWS.

Ultraconfined Plasmons
In article number 2302520, J. Enrique Ortega, F. Javier Garc&#237;a de Abajo, and co&#8208;workers present a new approach to fabricating ultrathin crystalline silver films consisting of a few atomic layers in thickness and featuring collective electron oscillations&#8212;plasmons&#8212;with an unprecedented combination of spatial confinement and long lifetimes. The image illustrates one of those structures, where bowtie pillars are carved from a silicon wafer, followed by a chemical and physical treatment that flattens the upper surface, and subsequent epitaxial deposition of a controlled number of silver (111) atomic layers. The resulting silver bowtie structures present confined plasmons at the gap region with a quality factor (spectral frequency&#8208;to&#8208;width ratio) approaching ten and a spatial footprint of a few tens of nanometers.

Intracranial Drug Delivery
In article number 2306876 by Niandong Jiao, Anhua Wu, Lianqing Liu, and co&#8208;workers, a marsupial robotic system combining a continuum robot (mother robot) with nanorobots (child robots) is developed for cross&#8208;scale targeting drug delivery. A magnetic catheter robot goes through a minimally invasive channel on the skull and enters deep into the brain along a curved path. The hollow catheter robot releases nanorobots when reaching the location of the brain tumor. Then the nanorobots further advance to the tumor and release the loaded drugs to kill the brain tumor.

Vesicle Assemblies with DNA Nanorulers
In article number 2308344, Min Li, Xiaolei Zuo, and co&#8208;workers used synthetic vesicles and DNA nanorulers to reconstruct in vitro the vesicle assemblies that mimic vesicle clusters in living cells. They demonstrate the amperometric monitoring of vesicle assemblies using nanoelectrode with high precision. The further application in vivo enables to analyze the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of vesicle clusters in cells and release events heterogeneity in different positions across the cell.

Abstract
This review article presents a comprehensive overview of the latest advances in the field of 3D printable structures with self&#8208;healing properties. Three&#8208;dimensional printing (3DP) is a versatile technology that enables the rapid manufacturing of complex geometric structures with precision and functionality not previously attainable. However, the application of 3DP technology is still limited by the availability of materials with customizable properties specifically designed for additive manufacturing. The addition of self&#8208;healing properties within 3D printed objects is of high interest as it can improve the performance and lifespan of structural components, and even enable the mimicking of living tissues for biomedical applications, such as organs printing. The review will discuss and analyze the most relevant results reported in recent years in the development of self&#8208;healing polymeric materials that can be processed via 3D printing. After introducing the chemical and physical self&#8208;healing mechanism that can be exploited, the literature review here reported will focus in particular on printability and repairing performances. At last, actual perspective and possible development field will be critically discussed.

Optoelectronic memristors (OMs) can emulate neurological functions within a bionic computing architecture, enabling energy&#8208;efficient in&#8208;memory computing. Identifying suitable techniques for integrating materials into integrated circuit platforms is imperative to advance the field. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental performance, mechanism, structures, applications, and integration roadmap of OMs aiming to establish a connection between materials and OM systems.








Abstract
Optoelectronic memristors (OMs) have emerged as a promising optoelectronic Neuromorphic computing paradigm, opening up new opportunities for neurosynaptic devices and optoelectronic systems. These OMs possess a range of desirable features including minimal crosstalk, high bandwidth, low power consumption, zero latency, and the ability to replicate crucial neurological functions such as vision and optical memory. By incorporating large&#8208;scale parallel synaptic structures, OMs are anticipated to greatly enhance high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power in&#8208;memory computing, effectively overcoming the limitations of the von Neumann bottleneck. However, progress in this field necessitates a comprehensive understanding of suitable structures and techniques for integrating low&#8208;dimensional materials into optoelectronic integrated circuit platforms. This review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the fundamental performance, mechanisms, design of structures, applications, and integration roadmap of optoelectronic synaptic memristors. By establishing connections between materials, multilayer optoelectronic memristor units, and monolithic optoelectronic integrated circuits, this review seeks to provide insights into emerging technologies and future prospects that are expected to drive innovation and widespread adoption in the near future.

&lt;p&gt;Optoelectronic memristors (OMs) have emerged as a promising optoelectronic Neuromorphic computing paradigm, opening up new opportunities for neurosynaptic devices and optoelectronic systems. These OMs possess a range of desirable features including minimal crosstalk, high bandwidth, low power consumption, zero latency, and the ability to replicate crucial neurological functions such as vision and optical memory. By incorporating large-scale parallel synaptic structures, OMs are anticipated to greatly enhance high-performance and low-power in-memory computing, effectively overcoming the limitations of the von Neumann bottleneck. However, progress in this field necessitates a comprehensive understanding of suitable structures and techniques for integrating low-dimensional materials into optoelectronic integrated circuit platforms. This review aims to offer a comprehensive overview of the fundamental performance, mechanisms, design of structures, applications, and integration roadmap of optoelectronic synaptic memristors. By establishing connections between materials, multilayer optoelectronic memristor units, and monolithic optoelectronic integrated circuits, this review seeks to provide insights into emerging technologies and future prospects that are expected to drive innovation and widespread adoption in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Synthetic Matrices for Human Intestinal Organoid Culture and Therapeutic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from pluripotent stem cells or adult stem cell biopsies represent a powerful platform to study human development, drug testing, and disease modeling, and serve as a cell source for tissue regeneration. Synthetic hydrogels can be engineered to serve as analogs of the extracellular matrix to support HIO growth and delivery vehicles in therapeutic applications. 








Abstract
Human intestinal organoids (HIOs) derived from pluripotent stem cells or adult stem cell biopsies represent a powerful platform to study human development, drug testing, and disease modeling in vitro, and serve as a cell source for tissue regeneration and therapeutic advances in vivo. Synthetic hydrogels can be engineered to serve as analogs of the extracellular matrix to support HIO growth and differentiation. These hydrogels allow for tuning the mechanical and biochemical properties of the matrix, offering an advantage over biologically derived hydrogels such as Matrigel. Human intestinal organoids have been used for repopulating transplantable intestinal grafts and for in vivo delivery to an injured intestinal site. The use of synthetic hydrogels for in vitro culture and for in vivo delivery is expected to significantly increase the relevance of human intestinal organoids for drug screening, disease modeling, and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Interfacial Assembly of 2D Graphene&#8208;Derived Ion Channels for Water&#8208;Based Green Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational materials selection/design and thorough mechanism research in water&#8208;based green energy conversion are essential scientific issues to be imminently discussed for future development of 2D graphene&#8208;derived ion channels (2D&#8208;GDICs) through interfacial assembly. Such review and prospects about 2D&#8208;GDIC from synthesis to applications including stability and functionalization would also provide a reference for other 2D materials to fabricate sophisticated ion channels.








Abstract
The utilization of sustained and green energy is believed to alleviate increasing menace of global environmental concerns and energy dilemma. Interfacial assembly of 2D graphene&#8208;derived ion channels (2D&#8208;GDICs) with tunable ion/fluid transport behavior enables efficient harvesting of renewable green energy from ubiquitous water, especially for osmotic energy harvesting. In this review, various interfacial assembly strategies for fabricating diverse 2D&#8208;GDICs are summarized and their ion transport properties are discussed. This review analyzes how particular structure and charge density/distribution of 2D&#8208;GDIC can be modulated to minimize internal resistance of ion/fluid transport and enhance energy conversion efficiency, and highlights stimuli&#8208;responsive functions and stability of 2D&#8208;GDIC and further examines the possibility of integrating 2D&#8208;GDIC with other energy conversion systems. Notably, the presented preparation and applications of 2D&#8208;GDIC also inspire and guide other 2D materials to fabricate sophisticated ion channels for targeted applications. Finally, potential challenges in this field is analyzed and a prospect to future developments toward high&#8208;performance or large&#8208;scale real&#8208;word applications is offered.

         <title>Engineering Kirigami Frameworks Toward Real&#8208;World Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines the basic deformation mechanisms inherent to kirigami design, summarizes the most distinguished properties of kirigami induced by cutting and folding, and overviews how each property can be leveraged to tackle challenges across various domains. It envisions that this work will inspire further innovation in metamaterials and encourage the community to address the challenges posed by real&#8208;world&#160;applications.








Abstract
The surge in advanced manufacturing techniques has led to a paradigm shift in the realm of material design from developing completely new chemistry to tailoring geometry within existing materials. Kirigami, evolved from a traditional cultural and artistic craft of cutting and folding, has emerged as a powerful framework that endows simple 2D sheets with unique mechanical, thermal, optical, and acoustic properties, as well as shape&#8208;shifting capabilities. Given its flexibility, versatility, and ease of fabrication, there are significant efforts in developing kirigami algorithms to create various architectured materials for a wide range of applications. This review summarizes the fundamental mechanisms that govern the transformation of kirigami structures and elucidates how these mechanisms contribute to their distinctive properties, including high stretchability and adaptability, tunable surface topography, programmable shape morphing, and characteristics of bistability and multistability. It then highlights several promising applications enabled by the unique kirigami designs and concludes with an outlook on the future challenges and perspectives of kirigami&#8208;inspired metamaterials toward real&#8208;world&#160;applications.

         <title>Strain Engineering in Perovskites: Mutual Insight on Oxides and Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxide and halide perovskites play a key role in various energy conversion devices such as piezoelectric devices, catalysts, light emitting diodes, and photodetectors. This review covers the latest studies on strain engineering in both oxide and halide perovskites for energy conversion devices. The work provides a new insight that can lead breakthroughs for high performance energy conversion devices.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have garnered significant attention over the past decades due to their applications, not only in electronic materials, such as dielectrics, piezoelectrics, ferroelectrics, and superconductors but also in optoelectronic devices like solar cells and light emitting diodes. This interest arises from their versatile combinations and physiochemical tunability. While strain engineering is a recognized powerful tool for tailoring material properties, its collaborative impact on both oxides and halides remains understudied. Herein, strain engineering in perovskites for energy conversion devices, providing mutual insight into both oxides and halides is discussed. The various experimental methods are presented for applying strain by using thermal mismatch, lattice mismatch, defects, doping, light illumination, and flexible substrates. In addition, the main factors that are influenced by strain, categorized as structure (e.g., symmetry breaking, octahedral distortion), bandgap, chemical reactivity, and defect formation energy are described. After that, recent progress in strain engineering for perovskite oxides and halides for energy conversion devices is introduced. Promising methods for enhancing the performance of energy conversion devices using perovskites through strain engineering are suggested.

         <title>Active Materials for Functional Origami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Origami has emerged as a popular design strategy for engineering structures. Further, active materials can be integrated with origami for lightweight, programmable, self&#8208;deployable structures relevant to numerous aerospace, metamaterial, and biomedical applications. This review details active material actuation mechanisms, active origami applications, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication methods, as well as origami modeling, and provides insights into the future of active origami research.








Abstract
In recent decades, origami has been explored to aid in the design of engineering structures. These structures span multiple scales and have been demonstrated to be used toward various areas such as aerospace, metamaterial, biomedical, robotics, and architectural applications. Conventionally, origami or deployable structures have been actuated by hands, motors, or pneumatic actuators, which can result in heavy or bulky structures. On the other hand, active materials, which reconfigure in response to external stimulus, eliminate the need for external mechanical loads and bulky actuation systems. Thus, in recent years, active materials incorporated with deployable structures have shown promise for remote actuation of light weight, programmable origami. In this review, active materials such as shape memory polymers (SMPs) and alloys (SMAs), hydrogels, liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), magnetic soft materials (MSMs), and covalent adaptable network (CAN) polymers, their actuation mechanisms, as well as how they have been utilized for active origami and where these structures are applicable is discussed. Additionally, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication methods to construct active origami are highlighted. The existing structural modeling strategies for origami, the constitutive models used to describe active materials, and the largest challenges and future directions for active origami research are summarized.

In this review, active materials such as shape memory polymers (SMPs) and alloys (SMAs), hydrogels, liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), magnetic soft materials (MSMs), and covalent adaptable network (CAN) polymers, their actuation mechanisms, as well as how they have been utilized for active origami and where these structures are applicable is discussed. Additionally, the state-of-the-art fabrication methods to construct active origami are highlighted. The existing structural modeling strategies for origami, the constitutive models used to describe active materials, and the largest challenges and future directions for active origami research are summarized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Review&#8212;Extremely Thin Amorphous Indium Oxide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing the thickness of indium oxide, enabled by atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, can tune its material properties to achieve high performance devices beyond the capabilities of conventional oxide semiconductors. In this work, the history leading to the re&#8208;emergence of indium oxide, its fundamental material properties, growth techniques with a focus on ALD, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art indium oxide device research are reviewed.








Abstract
Amorphous oxide semiconductor transistors have been a mature technology in display panels for upward of a decade, and have recently been considered as promising back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible channel materials for monolithic 3D applications. However, achieving high&#8208;mobility amorphous semiconductor materials with comparable performance to traditional crystalline semiconductors has been a long&#8208;standing problem. Recently it has been found that greatly reducing the thickness of indium oxide, enabled by an atomic layer deposition (ALD) process, can tune its material properties to achieve high mobility, high drive current, high on/off ratio, and enhancement&#8208;mode operation at the same time, beyond the capabilities of conventional oxide semiconductor materials. In this work, the history leading to the re&#8208;emergence of indium oxide, its fundamental material properties, growth techniques with a focus on ALD, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art indium oxide device research, and the bias stability of the devices are reviewed.

         <title>Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics Utilizing Intrinsic Charge Generation in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 9, March 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) can generate charges without a donor&#8211;acceptor interface. This is shown using transient absorption measurements and confirmed using computational methods. A small amount of donor material significantly enhances exciton splitting into free charges, resulting in well&#8208;performing donor&#8208;dilute OPVs. Semitransparent OPV modules with 2.2% light utilization efficiency are achieved by employing the optimized donor&#8208;dilute device concept.








Abstract
In organic semiconductors, a donor/acceptor heterojunction is typically required for efficient dissociation of excitons. Using transient absorption spectroscopy to study the dynamics of excited states in non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), it is shown that NFAs can generate charges without a donor/acceptor interface. This is due to the fact that dielectric solvation provides a driving force sufficient to dissociate the excited state and form the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state. The CT state is further dissociated into free charges at interfaces between polycrystalline regions in neat NFAs. For IEICO&#8208;4F, incorporating just 9 wt% donor polymer PTB7&#8208;Th in neat films greatly boosts charge generation, enhancing efficient exciton separation into free charges. This property is utilized to fabricate donor&#8208;dilute organic photovoltaics (OPV) delivering a power conversion efficiency of 8.3% in the case of opaque devices with a metal top&#8208;electrode and an active layer average visible transmittance (AVT) of 75%. It is shown that the intrinsic charge generation in low&#8208;bandgap NFAs contributes to the overall photocurrent generation. IEICO&#8208;4F&#8208;based OPVs with limited PTB7&#8208;Th content have high thermal resilience demonstrating little drop in performance over 700&#160;h. PTB7&#8208;Th:IEICO&#8208;4F semitransparent OPVs are leveraged to fabricate an 8&#8208;series connected semitransparent module, demonstrating light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 2.2% alongside an AVT of 63%.
