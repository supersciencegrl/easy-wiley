         <title>Robust Fiber&#8208;Shaped Flexible Temperature Sensors for Safety Monitoring with Ultrahigh Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber&#8208;shaped flexible temperature sensors with outstanding deformability and temperature sensing characteristics (broad working range and high sensitivity) are achieved through a two&#8208;step synthetic method. The temperature sensors can effectively capture diverse thermal signals in various applications. Notably, a temperature monitoring and warning system is developed to prevent fire accidents resulting from abnormal thermal runaway in electronic devices.








Abstract
Flexible temperature sensors capable of detecting and transmitting temperature data from the human body, environment, and electronic devices hold significant potential for applications in electronic skins, human&#8211;machine interactions, and disaster prevention systems. Nonetheless, fabricating flexible temperature sensors with exceptional sensing performance remains a formidable task, primarily due to the intricate process of constructing an intrinsically flexible sensing element with high sensitivity. In this study, a facile in situ two&#8208;step synthetic method is introduced for fabricating flexible fiber&#8208;shaped NiO/carbon nanotube fiber (CNTF) composites. The resulting NiO/CNTF flexible temperature sensors demonstrate outstanding deformability and temperature sensing characteristics, encompassing a broad working range (&#8722;15 to 60&#160;&#176;C) and high sensitivity (maximum TCR of &#8722;20.2%&#160;&#176;C&#8722;1 and B value of 3332 K). Importantly, the mechanical and thermal behaviors of the sensor in various application conditions are thoroughly examined using finite element analysis simulations. Moreover, the temperature sensors can effectively capture diverse thermal signals in wearable applications. Notably, a temperature monitoring and warning system is developed to prevent fire accidents resulting from abnormal thermal runaway in electronic devices.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Multicolor Emissions of the Coumarin&#8208;Modified Cs3LnCl6 Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanocrystals and LED Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing coumarin molecule, various Cs3LnCl6 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) emitting light across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum are systemically prepared. The Cs3EuCl6 NC can achieve an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional energy transfer efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, the lanthanide&#8208;based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue are successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based lead&#8208;free perovskite materials hold great promise for the development of high&#8208;resolution full&#8208;color displays in the future. Here, various Cs3LnCl6 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) emitting light across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum with remarkably high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are systemically prepared. Especially, by introducing multifunctional coumarin small molecules into Cs3EuCl6 NCs as an intermediate state, Cs3EuCl6 NCs can achieve an impressive PLQY of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional energy transfer efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, the lanthanide&#8208;based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue are successfully fabricated. Among them, the Cs3EuCl6&#8208;NC&#8208;based red light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) demonstrates a FWHM of 18&#160;nm at 617&#160;nm, an external quantum efficiency up to 5.17%, and a maximum brightness of 2373&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which is the most excellent reported for lead&#8208;free narrowband (within 20&#160;nm) emission devices. Notably, these devices exhibit an operating half&#8208;life of 440 h at a brightness level of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, surpassing the performance of most reported lead&#8208;free perovskite LEDs (PLEDs). This work opens up exciting possibilities for the future commercialization of lanthanide&#8208;based PLEDs in the display industry, paving the way for more vibrant, energy&#8208;efficient, and long&#8208;lasting display technologies.

         <title>Solid Additive Dual&#8208;Regulates Spectral Response Enabling High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid additive is proposed to dual&#8208;regulate donor/acceptor diffusion and molecular stacking, thus tuning the spectral response of resulting semi&#8208;transparent devices. The weakened visible light absorption intensity and extended utilization of NIR light enable ST&#8208;OSCs to simultaneously possess high average visible transmittance and high photocurrent, which results in a record&#8208;breaking light utilization efficiency in the AVT range of 40&#8211;50%.








Abstract
Semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) possess significant potential for applications in vehicles and buildings due to their distinctive visual transparency. Conventional device engineering strategies are typically used to optimize photon selection and utilization at the expense of power conversion efficiency (PCE); moreover, the fixed spectral utilization range always imposes an unsatisfactory upper limit to its light utilization efficiency (LUE). Herein, a novel solid additive named&#160;1,3&#8208;diphenoxybenzene (DB) is employed to dual&#8208;regulate donor/acceptor molecular aggregation and crystallinity, which effectively broadens the spectral response of ST&#8208;OSCs&#160;in near&#8208;infrared region. Besides, more visible light is allowed to pass through the devices, which enables ST&#8208;OSCs to possess satisfactory photocurrent and high average visible transmittance (AVT) simultaneously. Consequently, the optimal ST&#8208;OSC based on PP2+DB/BTP&#8208;eC9+DB achieves a superior LUE of 4.77%, representing the highest value within AVT range of 40&#8211;50%, which also correlates with the formation of multi&#8208;scale phase&#8208;separated morphology. Such results indicate that the ST&#8208;OSCs can simultaneously meet the requirements for minimum commercial efficiency and plant photosynthesis when integrated with the roofs of agricultural greenhouses. This work emphasizes the significance of additives to tune the spectral response in ST&#8208;OSCs, and charts the way for organic photovoltaics in economically sustainable agricultural development.

         <title>Myeloid Cell&#8208;Triggered In Situ Cell Engineering for Robust Vaccine&#8208;Based Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable scaffold for in situ myeloid cell engineering and antigen loading is designed. Antigens are modified on the scaffold, thus cells can effectively load antigens through cell membrane thiol groups. Additionally, various adjuvants are screened to promote the migration and activation of myeloid cells. Activated myeloid cells then function as antigen&#8208;presenting cells to stimulate anti&#8208;tumor response.








Abstract
Following the success of the dendritic cell (DC) vaccine, the cell&#8208;based tumor vaccine shows its promise as a vaccination strategy. Except for DC cells, targeting other immune cells, especially myeloid cells, is expected to address currently unmet clinical needs (e.g., tumor types, safety issues such as cytokine storms, and therapeutic benefits). Here, it is shown that an in situ injected macroporous myeloid cell adoptive scaffold (MAS) not only actively delivers antigens (Ags) that are triggered by scaffold&#8208;infiltrating cell surface thiol groups but also releases granulocyte&#8211;macrophage colony&#8208;stimulating factor and other adjuvant combos. Consequently, this promotes cell differentiation, activation, and migration from the produced monocyte and DC vaccines (MASVax) to stimulate antitumor T&#8208;cell immunity. Neoantigen&#8208;based MASVax combined with immune checkpoint blockade induces rejection of established tumors and long&#8208;term immune protection. The combined depletion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells further enhances the efficacy of MASVax, indicating the potential of myeloid cell&#8208;based therapies for immune enhancement and normalization treatment of cancer.

The sluggish ions&#8208;transfer and inhomogeneous ions&#8208;nucleation induce the formation of randomly&#8208;oriented dendrites on Zn anode, while the chemical instability at anode&#8208;electrolyte interface triggers detrimental side reactions. Herein, we in&#8208;situ design a multifunctional hybrid interphase of Bi/Bi2O3, for the first time resulting in a novel synergistic regulation mechanism involving: (i) chemically&#8208;inert interface protection mechanism suppresses side&#8208;reactions; and more fantastically, (ii) innovative thermodynamically&#8208;favorable Zn atomic clusters dissociation mechanism impedes dendrites formation. Assisted by collaborative modulation behavior, the Zn@Bi/Bi2O3 symmetry&#8208;cell delivers an ultrahigh cumulative plating capacity of 1.88 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and ultralong lifetimes of 300&#160;h even at high current density and depth of discharge (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, DODZn: 60%). Furthermore, under a low E/C (electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio: 45&#160;&#956;L mAh&#8722;1) and N/P (negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive capacity ratio: 6.3), Zn@Bi/Bi2O3||MnO2 full cell exhibits a superior capacity retention of 86.7% after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, which outperforms most existing interphases. The scaled&#8208;up Zn@Bi/Bi2O3||MnO2 battery module (6&#160;V, 1 Ah), combined with the photovoltaic panel, presents excellent renewable&#8208;energy&#8208;storage ability and long output lifetime (12&#160;h). This work provides a fantastic synergistic mechanism to achieve the ultrastable Zn anode and can be greatly promised to apply it into other metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Engineered Microchannel Scaffolds with Instructive Niches Reinforce Endogenous Bone Regeneration by Regulating Csf&#8208;1/Csf&#8208;1r Pathway</title>

Abstract
Structural and physiological cues provide guidance for the directional migration and spatial organization of endogenous cells. Here, we developed a microchannel scaffold with instructive niches using a circumferential freeze&#8208;casting technique with an alkaline salting&#8208;out strategy. Thereinto, polydopamine&#8208;coated nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite (nHAp@PDA) was employed as a functional inorganic linker to participate in the entanglement and crystallization of chitosan molecules. This scaffold orchestrates the advantage of an oriented porous structure for rapid cell infiltration and satisfactory immunomodulatory capacity to promote stem cell recruitment, retention, and subsequent osteogenic differentiation. Transcriptomic analysis as well as its in vitro and in vivo verification demonstrated that essential CSF&#8208;1 factor was induced by this scaffold, and effectively bound to the target receptor of CSF&#8208;1R on the macrophage surface to activate the M2 phenotype, achieving substantial endogenous bone regeneration. This strategy provides a simple and efficient approach for engineering inducible bone regenerative biomaterials.

         <title>Engineering and Targeting Neutrophils for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells in the circulation and act as the first line of defense against infections. Increasing evidence suggests that neutrophils possess heterogeneous phenotypes and functional plasticity in human health and diseases, including cancer. Neutrophils play multifaceted roles in cancer development and progression, and an N1/N2 paradigm of neutrophils in cancer has been proposed, where N1 neutrophils exert anti&#8208;tumor properties while N2 neutrophils display tumor&#8208;supportive and immune&#8208;suppressive functions. Selective activation of beneficial neutrophil population and targeted inhibition or re&#8208;polarization of tumor&#8208;promoting neutrophils has shown an important potential in tumor therapy. In addition, due to the natural inflammation&#8208;responsive and physical barrier&#8208;crossing abilities, neutrophils and their derivatives (membranes and extracellular vesicles) are regarded as advanced drug delivery carriers for enhanced tumor targeting and improved therapeutic efficacy. In this review, we comprehensively presented the recent advances in engineering neutrophils for drug delivery and targeting neutrophils for remodeling tumor microenvironment. This review will provide a broad understanding of the potential of neutrophils in cancer therapy.

         <title>Optical monitoring of water side permeation in thin film encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The stability of long&#8208;term microfabricated implants is hindered by the presence of multiple water diffusion paths within artificially patterned thin&#8208;film encapsulations. Side permeation, defined as infiltration of molecules through the lateral surface of the thin structure, becomes increasingly critical with the trend of developing high&#8208;density and miniaturized neural electrodes. However, current permeability measurement methods do not account for side permeation accurately nor quantitatively. Here, we propose a novel optical, magnesium (Mg)&#8208;based method to quantify the side water transmission rate (SWTR) through thin film encapsulation and validate the approach using micrometric polyimide (PI) and polyimide&#8208;silicon carbide (PI&#8208;SiC) multilayers. Through computed digital grayscale images collected with corroding Mg film microcells coated with the thin encapsulation, side and surface WTRs are quantified. A 4.5&#8208;fold ratio between side and surface permeation is observed, highlighting the crucial role of the PI&#8208;PI interface in lateral diffusion. Universal guidelines for the design of flexible, hermetic neural interfaces are proposed. Increasing encapsulation's width (interelectrode spacing), creating stronger interfacial interactions, and integrating high&#8208;barrier interlayers such as SiC significantly enhance the lateral hermeticity.

         <title>Three&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy Enables Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells with Record Efficiency and High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with covalently bonding donor and acceptor are becoming increasingly attractive because of their superior stability over traditional multi&#8208;component blend OSCs. Nevertheless, the efficiency of SCOSCs is far behind the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multi&#8208;component OSCs. Herein, by combination of the advantages of three&#8208;component and single&#8208;component devices, we report an innovative three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy to boost the performance of SCOSCs. In this three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy, three independent components (PM6, D18, and PYIT) are covalently linked together to create a new single&#8208;component active layer based on ternary conjugated block copolymer (TCBC) PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT by a facile polymerization. Precisely manipulating the component ratios in the polymer chains of PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT is able to broaden light utilization, promote charge dynamics, optimize and stabilize film morphology, contributing to the simultaneously enhanced efficiency and stability of the SCOSCs. Ultimately, the PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based device exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.89%, which is the highest efficiency of the reported SCOSCs. Thanks to the aggregation restriction of each component and chain entanglement in the three&#8208;in&#8208;one system, the PM6&#8208;D18&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT&#8208;based SCOSC displays significantly higher stability than the corresponding two&#8208;component (PM6&#8208;D18:PYIT) and three&#8208;component (PM6:D18:PYIT). These results demonstrate that the three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy is facile and promising for developing SCOSCs with superior efficiency and stability.

         <title>A Spiking Artificial Vision Architecture Based on Fully Emulating the Human Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intelligent vision necessitates the deployment of detectors that are always&#8208;on and low&#8208;power, mirroring the continuous and uninterrupted responsiveness characteristic of human vision. Nonetheless, contemporary artificial vision systems attain this goal by the continuous processing of massive image frames and executing intricate algorithms, thereby expending substantial computational power and energy. In contrast, biological data processing, based on event&#8208;triggered spiking, has higher efficiency and lower energy consumption. Here, we propose an artificial vision architecture consisting of spiking photodetectors and artificial synapses, closely mirroring the intricacies of the human visual system. Distinct from previously reported techniques, the photodetector is self&#8208;powered and event&#8208;triggered, outputting light&#8208;modulated spiking signals directly, thereby fulfilling the imperative for always&#8208;on with low&#8208;power consumption. With the spiking signals processing through the integrated synapse units, recognition of graphics, gestures, and human action has been implemented, illustrating the potent image processing capabilities inherent within this architecture. The results prove the 90% accuracy rate in human action recognition within a mere 5 epochs utilizing a rudimentary artificial neural network. This novel architecture, grounded in spiking photodetectors, offers a viable alternative to the extant models of always&#8208;on low&#8208;power artificial vision system.

         <title>Carboxylating Elastomer via Thiol&#8208;Ene Click Reaction to Improve Miscibility with Conjugated Polymers for Mechanically Robust Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19%</title>

Abstract
Incorporating flexible insulating polymers is a straightforward strategy to enhance the mechanical properties of rigid conjugated polymers, enabling their use in flexible electronic devices. However, maintaining electronic characteristics simultaneously is challenging due to the poor miscibility between insulating polymers and conjugated polymers. This study introduces the carboxylation of insulating polymers as an effective strategy to enhance miscibility with conjugated polymers via surface energy modulation and hydrogen bonding. The carboxylated elastomer, synthesized via a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, closely matches the surface energy of the conjugated polymer. This significantly improves the mechanical properties, achieving a high crack&#8208;onset strain of 21.48%, surpassing that (5.93%) of the unmodified elastomer:conjugated polymer blend. Upon incorporating the carboxylated elastomer into PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based organic solar cells, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.04% is attained, which top&#8208;performs among insulating polymer&#8208;incorporated devices and outperforms devices with unmodified elastomer or neat PM6:L8&#8208;BO. The superior efficiency is attributed to the optimized microstructures and enhanced crystallinity for efficient and balanced charge transport, and suppressed charge recombination. Furthermore, flexible devices with 5% carboxylated elastomer exhibit superior mechanical stability, retaining &#8764;88.9% of the initial efficiency after 40,000 bending cycles at a 1&#160;mm radius, surpassing &#8764;83.5% for devices with 5% unmodified elastomer.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanocarbons: From Synthesis and Structure to Cancer Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively highlights recent breakthroughs and critical milestones regarding the controllable synthesis processes, fluorescence origins, and cancer imaging or therapy applications of different families of nanocarbons: zero&#8208;dimensional carbon nanodots, nanodiamonds, carbon nanoonions, and two&#8208;dimensional carbon nanohorns.








Abstract
Nanocarbons are emerging at the forefront of nanoscience, with diverse carbon nanoforms emerging over the past two decades. Early cancer diagnosis and therapy, driven by advanced chemistry techniques, play a pivotal role in mitigating mortality rates associated with cancer. Nanocarbons, with an attractive combination of well&#8208;defined architectures, biocompatibility, and nanoscale dimension, offer an incredibly versatile platform for cancer imaging and therapy. This paper aims to review the underlying principles regarding the controllable synthesis, fluorescence origins, cellular toxicity, and surface functionalization routes of several classes of nanocarbons: carbon nanodots, nanodiamonds, carbon nanoonions, and carbon nanohorns. This review also highlights recent breakthroughs regarding the green synthesis of different nanocarbons from renewable sources. It also presents a comprehensive and unified overview of the latest cancer&#8208;related applications of nanocarbons and how they can be designed to interface with biological systems and work as cancer diagnostics and therapeutic tools. The commercial status for large&#8208;scale manufacturing of nanocarbons is also presented. Finally, it proposes future research opportunities aimed at engendering modifiable and high&#8208;performance nanocarbons for emerging applications across medical industries. This work is envisioned as a cornerstone to guide interdisciplinary teams in crafting fluorescent nanocarbons with tailored attributes that can revolutionize cancer diagnostics and therapy.

         <title>Uncovering the Network Modifier for Highly Disordered Amorphous Li&#8208;Garnet Glass&#8208;Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work examines the hypothesis of whether La, as a network modifier in amorphous Li7La3Zr2O12 (aLLZO), can be used to modulate the structure of aLLZO. The results suggest, within the solubility limit of La in aLLZO, a higher La concentration can lead to a more disordered medium&#8208; and long&#8208;range order structure in LLZO.








Abstract
Highly disordered amorphous Li7La3Zr2O12 (aLLZO) is a promising class of electrolyte separators and protective layers for hybrid or all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to its grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free nature and wide electrochemical stability window. Unlike low&#8208;entropy ionic glasses such as LixPOyNz (LiPON), these medium&#8208;entropy non&#8208;Zachariasen aLLZO phases offer a higher number of stable structure arrangements over a wide range of tunable synthesis temperatures, providing the potential to tune the LBU&#8208;Li+ transport relation. It is revealed that lanthanum is the active &#8220;network modifier&#8221; for this new class of highly disordered Li+ conductors, whereas zirconium and lithium serve as &#8220;network formers&#8221;. Specifically, within the solubility limit of La in aLLZO, increasing the La concentration can result in longer bond distances between the first nearest neighbors of Zr&#9472;O and La&#9472;O within the same local building unit (LBU) and the second nearest neighbors of Zr&#9472;La across two adjacent network&#8208;former and network&#8208;modifier LBUs, suggesting a more disordered medium&#8208; and long&#8208;range order structure in LLZO. These findings open new avenues for future designs of amorphous Li+ electrolytes and the selection of network&#8208;modifier dopants. Moreover, the wide yet relatively low synthesis temperatures of these glass&#8208;ceramics make them attractive candidates for low&#8208;cost and more sustainable hybrid&#8208; or all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries for energy storage.

         <title>Colloidal Synthesis of P&#8208;Type Zn3As2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal Zn3As2 nanocrystals with high crystallinity and accurate stoichiometry are synthesized using a solution&#8208;based approach by adjusting the precursor concentration. The synthesized colloidal Zn3As2 nanocrystals are successfully employed for the first time in p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistors, resulting in enhanced p&#8208;type characteristics and increased hole mobility via phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange.








Abstract
Zinc pnictides, particularly Zn3As2, hold significant promise for optoelectronic applications owing to their intrinsic p&#8208;type behavior and appropriate bandgaps. However, despite the outstanding properties of colloidal Zn3As2 nanocrystals, research in this area is lacking because of the absence of suitable precursors, occurrence of surface oxidation, and intricacy of the crystal structures. In this study, a novel and facile solution&#8208;based synthetic approach is presented for obtaining highly crystalline p&#8208;type Zn3As2 nanocrystals with accurate stoichiometry. By carefully controlling the feed ratio and reaction temperature, colloidal Zn3As2 nanocrystals are successfully obtained. Moreover, the mechanism underlying the conversion of As precursors in the initial phases of Zn3As2 synthesis is elucidated. Furthermore, these nanocrystals are employed as active layers in field&#8208;effect transistors that exhibit inherent p&#8208;type characteristics with native surface ligands. To enhance the charge transport properties, a dual passivation strategy is introduced via phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange, leading to enhanced hole mobilities as high as 0.089 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This study not only contributes to the advancement of nanocrystal synthesis, but also opens up new possibilities for previously underexplored p&#8208;type nanocrystal research.

         <title>AI&#8208;Enabled Materials Design of Non&#8208;Periodic 3D Architectures With Predictable Direction&#8208;Dependent Elastic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework that combines artificial intelligence (AI) and two&#8208;photon lithography (TPL) to design and fabricate 3D porous scaffolds with the prescribed elastic properties is presented. A machine learning algorithm is used to predict architecture and stiffness tensor of a porous, spinodal decomposition&#8208;inspired (spinodoid) shape, similar to trabecular bone. Scaffolds are then fabricated with predicted geometries using TPL, and in situ nanomechanical experiments are conducted to measure stiffnesses along each axis.








Abstract
Natural porous materials have exceptional properties&#8212;for example, light weight, mechanical resilience, and multi&#8208;functionality. Efforts to imitate their properties in engineered structures have limited success. This, in part, is caused by the complexity of multi&#8208;phase materials composites and by the lack of quantified understanding&#160;of each component's role in overall hierarchy.

     alt="AI-Enabled Materials Design of Non-Periodic 3D Architectures With Predictable Direction-Dependent Elastic Properties"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A framework that combines artificial intelligence (AI) and two-photon lithography (TPL) to design and fabricate 3D porous scaffolds with the prescribed elastic properties is presented. A machine learning algorithm is used to predict architecture and stiffness tensor of a porous, spinodal decomposition-inspired (spinodoid) shape, similar to trabecular bone. Scaffolds are then fabricated with predicted geometries using TPL, and in situ nanomechanical experiments are conducted to measure stiffnesses along each axis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural porous materials have exceptional properties&#8212;for example, light weight, mechanical resilience, and multi-functionality. Efforts to imitate their properties in engineered structures have limited success. This, in part, is caused by the complexity of multi-phase materials composites and by the lack of quantified understanding&#160;of each component's role in overall hierarchy. This challenge is twofold: 1) computational. because non-periodicity and defects render constructing design guidelines between geometries and mechanical properties complex and expensive and 2) experimental. because the fabrication and characterization of complex, often hierarchical and non-periodic 3D architectures is non-trivial.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pre&#8208;endcapping of Hyperbranched Polymers toward Intrinsically Stretchable Semiconductors with Good Ductility and Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The advancement of semiconducting polymers stands as a pivotal milestone in the quest to realize wearable electronics. Nonetheless, endowing semiconductor polymers with stretchability without compromising their carrier mobility remains a formidable challenge. This study proposes a &#8220;pre&#8208;endcapping&#8221; strategy for synthesizing hyperbranched semiconducting polymers (HBSPs), aiming to achieve the balance between carrier mobility and stretchability for organic electronics. The findings unveil that the aggregates formed by the endcapped hyperbranched network structure not only ensure efficient charge transport, but also demonstrate superior tensile resistance. In comparison to linear conjugated polymers, HBSPs exhibit substantially larger crack onset strains and notably diminished tensile moduli. It is evident that the HBSPs surpass their linear counterparts in terms of both their semiconducting and mechanical properties. Among HBSPs, HBSP&#8208;72h&#8208;2.5 stands out as the preeminent candidate within the field of inherently stretchable semiconducting polymers, maintaining 93% of its initial mobility even when subjected to 100% strain (1.41&#177;0.206 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1). Furthermore, thin film devices of HBSP&#8208;72h&#8208;2.5 remain stable after undergoing repeated stretching and releasing cycles. Notably, the mobilities are independent of the stretching directions, showing isotropic charge transport behavior. The preliminary study makes this &#8220;pre&#8208;endcapping&#8221; strategy a potential candidate for future design of organic materials for flexible electronic devices.

         <title>Atomic Engineering of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) showcase not only uniformly dispersed active sites but also meticulously engineered coordination structures. These intricate architectures bestow upon them an exceptional catalytic prowess, thereby captivating numerous minds and heralding a new era of possibilities in the biomedical landscape. Tuning the microstructure of SAzymes on the atomic scale is a key factor in designing targeted SAzymes with desirable functions. In this review, we firstly discuss and summarize three strategies for designing SAzymes and their impact on reactivity in biocatalysis. The effects of choices of carrier, different synthesis method, coordination modulation of first/second shell, and the type and number of metal active centers on the enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity are unraveled. Next, we make a first attempt to summarize the biological applications of SAzymes in tumor therapy, biosensing, antimicrobial, anti&#8208;inflammatory and other biological applications from different mechanisms. Finally, how SAzymes are designed and regulated for further realization of diverse biological applications is reviewed and prospected. We envisage that the comprehensive review presented within this exegesis will furnish novel perspectives and profound revelations regarding the biomedical applications of SAzymes.

         <title>Giant Negative Photoresponse in van der Waals Graphene/AgBiP2Se6/Graphene Trilayer Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is employed to achieve a giant negative photoconductance (NPC) effect in a graphene/AgBiP2Se6/graphene van der Waals vertical heterostructure device by applying a high drain&#8208;source voltage bias. Remarkably, this device demonstrates an exceptionally high negative responsivity (R) of 4.9&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, surpassing the previous records for NPC photodetectors.








Abstract
The positive photoconductive (PPC) effect is a well&#8208;established primary detection mechanism employed by photodetectors. In contrast, the negative photoconductive (NPC) effect is not extensively investigated thus far, and research on the NPC effect is still in its early stage. Herein, a quaternary van der Waals material, AgBiP2Se6 atomic layers, is discovered to achieve a giant NPC effect. Through experimental observations in a Graphene/AgBiP2Se6/ Graphene&#8208;based vertical photodetector, an irreversible conversion is identified from common PPC photoresponse to atypical NPC photoresponse. Notably, this device demonstrates an exceptionally high negative responsivity (R) of 4.9&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, surpassing the previous records for NPC photodetectors. Additionally, it exhibits remarkable optoelectronic performances, including an external quantum efficiency of 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;108% and a detectivity (D) of 3.60&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;Jones. The exceptionally high NPC photoresponse observed in this device can be attributed to the swift suppression of photogenerated free carriers at robust recombination centers situated at significant depths, induced by the elevated drain&#8208;source voltage bias. The remarkably high NPC photoresponse also positions AgBiP2Se6 as a promising 2D material for multifunctional optoelectronic devices and an excellent platform for systematic exploration of the NPC effect.

         <title>Orderly Arranged Dipoles Regulate Anion&#8208;Derived Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphase for Stable Lithium Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
After thermal reduction, BaTiO3 with surface oxygen vacancies (BTOV) exhibits stimulative adsorption and polarization for TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; due to enhanced dipoles. With the BTOV on the polypropylene separator, a locally anion&#8208;rich and Li+&#8208;rich region is formed at the electrolyte&#8211;anode interface, which will promote the transport of Li+. Moreover, polarized anions are reduced promotively to form an expected SEI film.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries are considered the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical energy storage devices of the next generation. However, the unstable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) derived from electrolytes usually leads to high impedance, Li dendrites growth, and poor cyclability. Herein, the ferroelectric BaTiO3 with orderly arranged dipoles (BTOV) is integrated into the polypropylene separator as a functional layer. Detailed characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that surface oxygen vacancies drive the phase transition of BaTiO3 materials and promote the ordered arrangement of dipoles. The strong dipole moments in BTOV can adsorb TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; anions selectively and promote their preferential reduction to form a SEI film enriched with inorganic LiF and LiNxOy species, thus facilitating the rapid transfer of Li+ and restraining the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, the Li&#8211;Li cell with the BTOV functional layer exhibits enhanced Li plating/stripping cycling with an ultra&#8208;long life of over 7000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The LiFePO4 || Li (50&#160;&#181;m) full cells display excellent cycling performance exceeding 1760 cycles and superior rate performance. This work provides a new perspective for regulating SEI chemistry by introducing ordered dipoles to control the distribution and reaction of anions.

Abstract
Cancer cells can upregulate the MYC expression to repair the radiotherapy&#8208;triggered DNA damage, aggravating therapeutic resistance and tumor immunosuppression. Epigenetic treatment targeting the MYC&#8208;transcriptional abnormality may intensively solve this clinical problem. Herein, we engineered 5&#8208;Aza (a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) and ITF&#8208;2357 (a histone deacetylase inhibitor) into a tungsten&#8208;based nano&#8208;radiosensitizer (PWAI), to suppress MYC rising and awaken robust radiotherapeutic antitumor immunity. Individual 5&#8208;Aza depletes MYC expression but cannot efficiently awaken radiotherapeutic immunity. This drawback can be overcome by the addition of ITF&#8208;2357, which triggers cancer cellular type I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) signaling. Coupling 5&#8208;Aza with ITF&#8208;2357 ensures that PWAI does not evoke the treated model with high MYC&#8208;related immune resistance while amplifying the radiotherapeutic tumor killing, and more importantly promotes the generation of IFN&#8208;I signal&#8208;related proteins involving IFN&#8208;&#945; and IFN&#8208;&#946;. Unlike the radiation treatment alone, PWAI&#8208;triggered immuno&#8208;radiotherapy remarkably enhances anti&#8208;tumor immune responses involving the tumor antigen presentation by dendritic cells, and improves intratumoral recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and their memory&#8208;phenotype formation in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Downgrading the radiotherapy&#8208;induced MYC overexpression via the dual&#8208;epigenetic reprogramming strategy may elicit a robust immuno&#8208;radiotherapy.

         <title>Sensing, Imaging and Therapeutic Strategies Endowing by Conjugate Polymers for Precision Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Conjugated polymers (CPs) have promising applications in biomedical fields, such as disease monitoring, real&#8208;time imaging diagnosis and disease treatment. As a promising luminescent material with tunable emission, high brightness and excellent stability, CPs are widely used as fluorescent probes in biological detection and imaging. Rational molecular design and structural optimization have broadened absorption/emission range of CPs, which are more conductive for disease diagnosis and precision therapy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the application of CPs, aiming to elucidate their structural and functional relationships. The fluorescence properties of CPs and the mechanism of detection signal amplification are firstly discussed, followed by an elucidation of their emerging applications in biological detection. Subsequently, CPs&#8208;based imaging systems and therapeutic strategies are illustrated systematically. Finally, recent advancements in utilizing CPs as electroactive materials for bioelectronic devices are also investigated. Moreover, the challenges and outlooks of CPs for precision medicine are discussed. Through this systematic review, we hope to highlight the frontier progress of CPs and promote new breakthroughs in fundamental research and clinical transformation.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy Tellurium Redox&#8208;Amphoteric Conversion Cathode Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries are potential candidates for sustainable energy storage systems at a grid&#8208;scale, owing to their high safety and low cost. However, the existing cathode chemistries exhibit restricted energy density, which hinders their extensive applications. Here, we present a tellurium redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion cathode chemistry for aqueous zinc batteries, which delivers a specific capacity of 1223.9 mAh gTe&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 1028.0&#160;Wh kgTe&#8722;1. A highly concentrated electrolyte (30&#160;mol kg&#8722;1 ZnCl2) is revealed crucial for initiating the Te redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion, as it suppresses the H2O reactivity and inhibits undesirable hydrolysis of the Te4+ product. By carrying out multiple operando/ex&#8208;situ characterizations, we identify the reversible six&#8208;electron Te2&#8722;/Te0/Te4+ conversion with TeCl4 as the fully charged product and ZnTe as the fully discharged product. This finding not only enriches the conversion&#8208;type battery chemistries but also establishes a critical step in exploring redox&#8208;amphoteric materials for aqueous zinc batteries and beyond.

         <title>HLCT&#8208;type Acceptor Molecule&#8208;Based Exciplex System for Highly Efficient Solution&#8208;Processable OLEDs with Suppressed Efficiency Roll&#8208;offs</title>

Abstract
Exciplex systems are promising candidates for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules because of the small energy difference between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states (&#916;EST). However, realizing high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;external&#8208;quantum&#8208;efficiency (EQE) roll&#8208;off in solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) using an exciplex system remains a formidable challenge. In this study, two hybridized local and charge transfer (HLCT)&#8208;type isomers with a spiro skeleton, 2&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ and 10&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ, were designed and synthesized as acceptors of exciplexes, where tert&#8208;butylspirofluorene indole was regarded as a donor and the triazine unit as an acceptor. Green exciplex emissions were observed for the 2&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ:TAPC and 10&#8208;tBuspoCz&#8208;TRZ:TAPC exciplexes, indicating distinct TADF characteristics with a very small &#916;EST of 35&#177;5 meV. By employing the TADF exciplex system based on the HLCT acceptor as an emitter, solution&#8208;processable OLEDs achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.8%. Furthermore, a high EQEmax &gt; 25% with a very low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off (ca. 3.5% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2) was obtained for solution&#8208;processable phosphorescent devices using HLCT&#8208;based exciplexes as the host matrix of phosphors. This study paves the way for a novel strategy for designing acceptor exciplex molecules for effective TADF molecules and host matrices in solution&#8208;processable OLEDs.

         <title>Improve the Charge Carrier Transporting in Two&#8208;Dimensional Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Conventional 3D organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskite materials have shown substantial potential in the field of optoelectronics, enabling the power conversation efficiency of solar cells beyond 26%. A key challenge limiting the further commercial application of 3D perovskite solar cells is their inherent instability over outer oxygen, humidity, light, and heat. By contrast, 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (2DRP) perovskites with bulky organic cations can effectively stabilize the inorganic slabs, yielding excellent environmental stability. However, the efficiencies of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are much lower than those of the 3D counterparts due to poor charge carrier transporting property of insulating bulky organic cations. Their inner structural, dielectric, optical, and excitonic properties remain to be primarily studied. In this review, the main reasons for the low efficiency of 2DRP perovskite solar cells are first analyzed. Next, we provide a detailed description of various strategies for improving the charge carrier transporting of 2DRP perovskites, such as bandgap regulation, perovskite crystal phase orientation and distribution, energy level matching, interfacial modification, etc. Finally, a summary is given, and the possible future research directions and methods to achieve high&#8208;efficiency and stable 2DRP perovskite solar cells are rationalized.

         <title>In Situ Mitochondrial Biomineralization for Drug&#8208;Free Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The common clinical chemotherapy often brings serious side effects to patients, mainly due to the off&#8208;target and leakage of toxic drugs. However, this is fatal for some specific clinical tumors, such as brain tumors and neuroma. In this study, we performed a drug&#8208;free approach by encapsulating black phosphorus (BP) and calcium peroxide (CaO2) in liposomes with surface&#8208;modified triphenylphosphonium (BCLT) to develop mitochondria targeting calcification for cancer therapy without damaging normal cells. BCLT preferentially accumulated inside tumor mitochondria and then was activated by NIR laser irradiation to produce abundant PO43&#8722; and Ca2+ to accelerate in situ mitochondrial mineralization, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer cell death. More importantly, both PO43&#8722; and Ca2+ are essential components of metabolism in the body, and random gradient diffusion or premature leakage does not cause damage to adjacent normal cells. This achievement promises to be an alternative to conventional chemotherapy in clinical practice for many specific tumor types.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common clinical chemotherapy often brings serious side effects to patients, mainly due to the off-target and leakage of toxic drugs. However, this is fatal for some specific clinical tumors, such as brain tumors and neuroma. In this study, we performed a drug-free approach by encapsulating black phosphorus (BP) and calcium peroxide (CaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in liposomes with surface-modified triphenylphosphonium (BCLT) to develop mitochondria targeting calcification for cancer therapy without damaging normal cells. BCLT preferentially accumulated inside tumor mitochondria and then was activated by NIR laser irradiation to produce abundant PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices have been extensively developed as potentially transformative in vitro models to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of human organs. The latest developments toward intelligent organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems where sensing, data processing, and modulating units are integrated and coordinated to fine&#8208;tune the in vitro models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications are reviewed.








Abstract
In vitro models are essential to a broad range of biomedical research, such as pathological studies,&#160;drug development, and personalized medicine. As a potentially transformative paradigm for 3D in vitro models, organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OOC) technology has been extensively developed to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of human organs by applying the principles of life sciences and leveraging micro&#8208; and nanoscale engineering capabilities. A pivotal function of OOC devices is to support multifaceted and timely characterization&#160;of cultured cells&#160;and their microenvironments. However, in&#8208;depth analysis of OOC models&#160;typically requires biomedical assay procedures that are labor&#8208;intensive and interruptive. Herein,&#160;the latest advances toward intelligent OOC (iOOC) systems, where sensors integrated with OOC devices continuously report cellular and microenvironmental information for comprehensive in situ bioanalysis, are examined. It is proposed that the multimodal data in iOOC systems can support closed&#8208;loop control of the in vitro&#160;models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications. Essential techniques for establishing iOOC systems are surveyed, encompassing in situ sensing, data processing, and dynamic modulation. Eventually, the future development of iOOC systems featuring cross&#8208;disciplinary strategies is discussed.

         <title>Quantifying Dielectric Material Charge Trapping and De&#8208;Trapping Ability via Ultra&#8208;Fast Charge Self&#8208;Injection Technique</title>

Abstract
Recently, utilizing the air breakdown effect in the charge excitation strategy has been proved as an efficient charge injection technique to increase the surface charge density of dielectric polymers for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, quantitative characterization of the ability of dielectric polymers to trap reverse charges and the effect on the startup time of secondary self&#8208;charge excitation (SSCE) are essential for extensive applications. Here, we propose an ultra&#8208;fast charge self&#8208;injection technique based on a self&#8208;charge excitation strategy and introduce a standard method to quantify the charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping abilities of 23 traditional tribo&#8208;materials. Furthermore, the relationship between the distribution of dielectric intrinsic deep, shallow trap states and transportation of trapped charges is systematically analyzed in this article. It shows that the de&#8208;trapping rate of charges directly determines the reactivation and failure of SSCE. Finally, independent of TENG contact efficiency, an ultra&#8208;high charge density of 2.67 mC m&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;fast startup time of SSCE is obtained using a 15&#160;&#949;m poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) film, breaking the historical record for material modification. As a standard for material selection, this work quantifies the charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping ability of the triboelectric dielectric series and provides insights for understanding the charge transport in dielectrics

         <title>Programmed Targeting Pyruvate Metabolism Therapy&#8208;Amplified Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme&#8208;Activated Pyroptosis for Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Increasing cellular immunogenicity and reshaping the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) are crucial for anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy. Herein, we developed a novel single&#8208;atom nanozyme pyroptosis initiator: UK5099 and pyruvate oxidase (POx)&#8208;co&#8208;loaded Cu&#8208;NS single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Cu&#8208;NS@UK@POx), that not only triggers pyroptosis through cascade biocatalysis to boost the immunogenicity of tumor cells, but also remodels the immunosuppressive TME by targeting pyruvate metabolism. By replacing N with weakly electronegative S, we changed the original spatial symmetry of the Cu&#8208;N4 electron distribution and effectively regulated the enzyme&#8208;catalyzed process. Compared to spatially symmetric Cu&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atom nanozymes (Cu&#8208;N4 SA), the S&#8208;doped spatially asymmetric single&#8208;atom nanozymes (Cu&#8208;NS SA) exhibit stronger oxidase activities, including peroxidase (POD), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOx), L&#8208;cysteine oxidase (LCO) and glutathione oxidase (GSHOx), which can cause enough reactive oxygen species (ROS) storms to trigger pyroptosis. Moreover, the synergistic effect of Cu&#8208;NS SA, UK5099, and POx can target pyruvate metabolism, which not only improves the immune TME but also increases the degree of pyroptosis. This study provides a two&#8208;pronged treatment strategy that can significantly activate antitumor immunotherapy effects via ROS storms, NADH/glutathione/L&#8208;cysteine consumption, pyruvate oxidation, and lactic acid/ATP depletion, triggering pyroptosis and regulating metabolism. This work provides a broad vision for expanding antitumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Visualization of Multiferroicity in Monolayer NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in monolayer NiI2. Its type&#8208;II multiferroic order arises from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling. These results on magnetoelectric effects at the atomic scale suggest new ways to engineer multiferroic orders in van der Waals materials and their heterostructures.








Abstract
Progress in layered van der Waals materials has resulted in the discovery of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials down to the monolayer limit. Recently, evidence of the first purely 2D multiferroic material was&#160;reported in monolayer NiI2. However, probing multiferroicity with scattering&#8208;based and optical bulk techniques is challenging on 2D materials, and experiments on the atomic scale are needed to fully characterize the multiferroic order at the monolayer limit. Here, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in monolayer NiI2. It is demonstrated that the type&#8208;II multiferroic order displayed by NiI2, arising from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, allows probing the multiferroic order in the STM experiments. Moreover, the magnetoelectric coupling of NiI2 is directly probed by external electric field manipulation of the multiferroic domains. The findings establish a novel point of view to analyze magnetoelectric effects at the microscopic level, paving the way toward engineering new multiferroic orders in van der Waals materials and their&#160;heterostructures.

Recently, evidence of the first purely 2D multiferroic material was&#160;reported in monolayer NiI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, probing multiferroicity with scattering-based and optical bulk techniques is challenging on 2D materials, and experiments on the atomic scale are needed to fully characterize the multiferroic order at the monolayer limit. Here, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in monolayer NiI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is demonstrated that the type-II multiferroic order displayed by NiI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, arising from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a strong spin-orbit coupling, allows probing the multiferroic order in the STM experiments. Moreover, the magnetoelectric coupling of NiI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is directly probed by external electric field manipulation of the multiferroic domains. The findings establish a novel point of view to analyze magnetoelectric effects at the microscopic level, paving the way toward engineering new multiferroic orders in van der Waals materials and their&#160;heterostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Activated Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow from Transparent and Flexible Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hour&#8208;long afterglow polymer films are fabricated using a facile molecular doping strategy. They emit an afterglow that lasts longer than 11&#160;h at room temperature in air and can be activated by sunlight. The color of the afterglow polymers can be tuned from cyan to red. Efficient information display and storage applications of these materials have been demonstrated.








Abstract
Afterglow materials featuring long emission durations ranging from milliseconds to hours have garnered increasing interest owing to their potential applications in sensing, bioimaging, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Unfortunately, polymeric materials rarely exhibit afterglow properties under ambient conditions because of the rapid nonradiative decay rate of triplet excitons. In this study, hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymer films are fabricated using a facile molecular doping strategy. Flexible and transparent polymer films emitted a bright afterglow lasting over 11&#160;h at room temperature in air, which is one of the best performances among the organic afterglow materials reported to date. Intriguingly, HLA polymer films can be activated by sunlight, and their cyan afterglow in air can be readily observed by the naked eye. Moreover, the HLA color of the polymer films could be tuned from cyan to red through the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer mechanism. Their application in flexible displays and information storage has also been demonstrated. With remarkable advantages, including an hour&#8208;long and bright afterglow, tunable afterglow colors, superior flexibility and transparency, and ease of fabrication, the HLA polymer paves the way for the practical application of afterglow materials in the engineering sector.

         <title>Nonlocal Acoustic Moir&#233; Hyperbolic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological transition in twisted bilayer materials has attracted considerable attention in nano&#8208;optics. In the analogue of acoustics, however, no such topological transition has been found experimentally due to the inherent scalar property of sound pressure. In this work, by using a nonlocal design, the in&#8208;plane acoustic pressure is transformed into a spatially distributed vector field using twisted multilayer metasurfaces.








Abstract
The discovery of the topological transition in twisted bilayer (tBL) materials has attracted considerable attention in nano&#8208;optics. In the analogue of acoustics, however, no such topological transition has been found due to the inherent nondirectional scalar property of acoustic pressure. In this work, by using a theory&#8208;based nonlocal anisotropic design, the in&#8208;plane acoustic pressure is transformed into a spatially distributed vector field using twisted multilayer metasurfaces. So&#8208;called &#8220;acoustic magic angle&#8221;&#8208;related acoustic phenomena occur, such as nonlocal polariton hybridization and the topological Lifshitz transition. The dispersion becomes flat at the acoustic magic angle, enabling polarized excitations to propagate in a single direction. Moreover, the acoustic topological transition (from hyperbolic to elliptic dispersion) is experimentally observed for the first time as the twist angle continuously changes. This unique characteristic facilitates low&#8208;loss tunable polariton hybridization at the subwavelength scale. A twisted trilayer acoustic metasurface is also experimentally demonstrated, and more possibilities for manipulating acoustic waves are found. These discoveries not only enrich the concepts of moir&#233; physics and topological acoustics but also provide a complete framework of theory and methodologies for explaining the phenomena that are observed.

         <title>Enhancing Purely Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence via Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of purely organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is presented. RTP can be achieved by small molecular self&#8208;assembly, cocrystal, the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic host and guest, and multi&#8208;stage supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The constructions, RTP properties, and applications of supramolecular assembly systems are discussed in detail. This review lays the foundation for developing RTP supramolecular materials.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lived and highly efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are in high demand for practical applications in lighting and display, security signboards, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Achieving RTP in aqueous solutions, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence emission, and NIR&#8208;excited RTP are crucial for applications in bio&#8208;imaging, but these goals pose significant challenges. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly provides an effective strategy to address the above problems. This review focuses on the recent advances in the enhancement of RTP via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, covering four key aspects: small molecular self&#8208;assembly, cocrystals, the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic hosts and guests, and multi&#8208;stage supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. This review not only highlights progress in these areas but also underscores the prominent challenges associated with developing supramolecular RTP materials. The resulting strategies for the development of high&#8208;performance supramolecular RTP materials are discussed, aiming to satisfy the practical applications of RTP materials in biomedical science.

         <title>Towards Negative Emissions: Hydrothermal Carbonization of Biomass for Sustainable Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon materials from hydrothermal carbonization of biomass have great potential for carbon emission reduction. This review covers the fundamental properties of biomass and the hydrothermal environment, the intrinsic mechanisms and regulation methods of biomass hydrothermal carbonization, the wide range of applications of derived carbon materials, and the sustainability potential of carbon materials.








Abstract
The contemporary production of carbon materials heavily relies on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to the greenhouse effect. Biomass is a carbon&#8208;neutral resource whose organic carbon is formed from atmospheric CO2. Employing biomass as a precursor for synthetic carbon materials can fix atmospheric CO2 into solid materials, achieving negative carbon emissions. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) presents an attractive method for converting biomass into carbon materials, by which biomass can be transformed into materials with favorable properties in a distinct hydrothermal environment, and these carbon materials have made extensive progress in many fields. However, the HTC of biomass is a complex and interdisciplinary problem, involving simultaneously the physical properties of the underlying biomass and sub/supercritical water, the chemical mechanisms of hydrothermal synthesis, diverse applications of resulting carbon materials, and the sustainability of the entire technological routes. This review starts with the analysis of biomass composition and distinctive characteristics of the hydrothermal environment. Then, the factors influencing the HTC of biomass, the reaction mechanism, and the properties of resulting carbon materials are discussed in depth, especially the different formation mechanisms of primary and secondary hydrochars. Furthermore, the application and sustainability of biomass&#8208;derived carbon materials are summarized, and some insights into future directions are provided.

         <title>Highly Flexible, High&#8208;Performance, and Stretchable Piezoelectric Sensor Based on a Hierarchical Droplet&#8208;Shaped Ceramics with Enhanced Damage Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic showing the development of stretchable hierarchical ceramic sensors through a novel soft&#8208;rigid hybrid strategy, whose configuration ensures excellent mechanical flexibility, high piezoelectric activity and structural robustness, including a linear response, wide&#8208;angle twisting, and wide range of stretching. This new sensor is successfully used for both wireless gesture recognition and the assessment of the progression of knee osteoarthritis.








Abstract
Stretchable self&#8208;powered sensors are of significant interest in next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, current strategies for creating stretchable piezoelectric sensors based on piezoelectric polymers or 0&#8211;3 piezoelectric composites face several challenges such as low piezoelectric activity, low sensitivity, and poor durability. In this paper, a biomimetic soft&#8208;rigid hybrid strategy is used to construct a new form of highly flexible, high&#8208;performance, and stretchable piezoelectric sensor. Inspired by the hinged bivalve Cristaria plicata, hierarchical droplet&#8208;shaped ceramics are manufactured and used as rigid components, where computational models indicate that the unique arched curved surface and rounded corners of this bionic structure can alleviate stress concentrations. To ensure electrical connectivity of the piezoelectric phase during stretching, a patterned liquid metal acts as a soft circuit and a silicone polymer with optimized wettability and stretchability serves as a soft component that forms a strong mechanical interlock with the hierarchical ceramics. The novel sensor design exhibits excellent sensitivity and durability, where the open circuit voltage remains stable after 5000 stretching cycles at 60% strain and 5000 twisting cycles at 180&#176;. To demonstrate its potential in heathcare applications, this new stretchable sensor is successfully used for wireless gesture recognition and assessing the progression of knee osteoarthritis.

To demonstrate its potential in heathcare applications, this new stretchable sensor is successfully used for wireless gesture recognition and assessing the progression of knee osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Ray Irradiation Significantly Enhances Capacitive Energy Storage Performance of Polymer Dielectric Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is proposed to improve dielectric energy storage performance of polymers by &#947;&#8208;ray irradiation. Utilizing this strategy to the biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP), a record&#8208;high energy density of 10.4 J cm&#8722;3 with &gt;95% efficiency is achieved, surpassing commercial polymers, reported all&#8208;organic polymers and PP&#8208;based composites. Substantial improvements are also achieved for &#947;&#8208;irradiated cycloolefin copolymer at 150&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Polymer dielectric capacitors are fundamental in advanced electronics and power grids but suffer from low energy density, hindering miniaturization of compact electrical systems. It is shown that high&#8208;energy and strong penetrating &#947;&#8208;irradiation significantly enhances capacitive energy storage performance of polymer dielectrics. &#947;&#8208;irradiated biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films exhibit an extraordinarily high energy density of 10.4 J cm&#8722;3 at 968 MV m&#8722;1 with an efficiency of 97.3%. In particular, an energy density of 4.06 J cm&#8722;3 with an ultrahigh efficiency of 98% is reliably maintained through 20&#160;000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles under 600 MV m&#8722;1. At 125&#160;&#176;C, the &#947;&#8208;irradiated BOPP film still delivers a high discharged energy density of 5.88 J cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency of 90% at 770 MV m&#8722;1. Substantial improvements are also achieved for &#947;&#8208;irradiated cycloolefin copolymers at a high temperature of 150&#160;&#176;C, verifying the strategy generalizability. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the excellent performance should be related to the &#947;&#8208;irradiation induced polar functional groups with high electron affinity in the molecular chain, which offer deep energy traps to impede charge transport. This work provides a simple and generally applicable strategy for developing high&#8208;performance polymer dielectrics.

         <title>Mechanical Stimulation of Anti&#8208;Inflammatory and Antioxidant Hydrogels for Rapid Re&#8208;Epithelialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel with natural anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant properties is reported. The hydrogel possesses outstanding mechanical properties and can be further enhanced by water. In a long urethral injury model in vivo, and the hydrogels achieve effective functional replacement and ultimately accurate remodeling of the epithelium combining mechanical stimulation and immunoregulation.








Abstract
The epithelium, an essential barrier to protect organisms against infection, exists in many organs. However, rapid re&#8208;epithelialization to restore tissue integrity and function in an adverse environment is challenging. In this work, a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant hydrogel with mechanical stimulation for rapid re&#8208;epithelialization, mainly composed of the small molecule thioctic acid, biocompatible glycine, and &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanoparticles is reported. Glycine&#8208;modified supramolecular thioctic acid is stable and possesses outstanding mechanical properties. The incorporating &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 providing the potential contrast function for magnetic resonance imaging observation, can propel hydrogel reconfiguration to enhance the mechanical properties of the hydrogel underwater due to water&#8208;initiated release of Fe3+. In vitro experiments show that the hydrogels effectively reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species, guided macrophages toward M2 polarization, and alleviated inflammation. The effect of rapid re&#8208;epithelialization is ultimately demonstrated in a long urethral injury model in vivo, and the mechanical stimulation of hydrogels achieves effective functional replacement and ultimately accurate remodeling of the epithelium. Notably, the proposed strategy provides an advanced alternative treatment for patients in need of large&#8208;area epithelial reconstruction.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Lateral Heterojunction Arrays with Tailored Interface Band Bending</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) lateral heterojunction arrays, characterized by well&#8208;defined electronic interfaces, hold significant promise for advancing next&#8208;generation electronic devices. Despite this potential, the efficient synthesis of high&#8208;density lateral heterojunctions with tunable interfacial band alignment remains a challenging. Here, a novel strategy is reported for the fabrication of lateral heterojunction arrays between monolayer Si2Te2 grown on Sb2Te3 (ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3) and one&#8208;quintuple&#8208;layer Sb2Te3 grown on monolayer Si2Te2 (1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2) on a p&#8208;doped Sb2Te3 substrate. The site&#8208;specific formation of numerous periodically arranged 2D ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3/1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2 lateral heterojunctions is realized solely through three epitaxial growth steps of thick&#8208;Sb2Te3, ML&#8208;Si2Te2, and 1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3 films, sequentially. More importantly, the precisely engineering of the interfacial band alignment is realized, by manipulating the substrate's p&#8208;doping effect with lateral spatial dependency, on each ML&#8208;Si2Te2@Sb2Te3/1QL&#8208;Sb2Te3@ML&#8208;Si2Te2 junction. Atomically sharp interfaces of the junctions with continuous lattices are observed by scanning tunneling microscopy. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements directly reveal the tailored type&#8208;II band bending at the interface. This reported strategy opens avenues for advancing lateral epitaxy technology, facilitating practical applications of 2D in&#8208;plane heterojunctions.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Silk Fibroin/Cryogel Hybrid Dual Fiber Scaffold with Hierarchical Structure Promotes Healing of Chronic Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The AP1 peptide conjugated&#8208;silk fibroin/cryogel hybrid dual fiber scaffold exhibits superior granulation tissue formation, angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and re&#8208;epithelialization during the proliferative phase compared to the commercial product PELNAC.








Abstract
Chronic wounds resulting from diabetes, pressure, radiation therapy, and other factors continue to pose significant challenges in wound healing. To address this, this study introduces a novel hybrid fibroin fibrous scaffold (FFS) comprising randomly arranged fibroin fibers and vertically aligned cryogel fibers (CFs). The fibroin scaffold is efficiently degummed at room temperature and simultaneously formed a porous structure. The aligned CFs are produced via directional freeze&#8208;drying, achieved by controlling solution concentration and freezing polymerization temperature. The incorporation of aligned CFs into the expanded fibroin fiber scaffold leads to enhanced cell infiltration both in vitro and in vivo, further elevating the hybrid scaffold's tissue compatibility. The anti&#8208;inflammatory peptide 1 (AP&#8208;1) is also conjugated to the hybrid fibrous scaffold, effectively transforming the inflammatory status of chronic wounds from pro&#8208;inflammatory to pro&#8208;reparative. Consequently, the FFS&#8208;AP1+CF group demonstrates superior granulation tissue formation, angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and re&#8208;epithelialization during the proliferative phase compared to the commercial product PELNAC. Moreover, the FFS&#8208;AP1+CF group displays epidermis thickness, number of regenerated hair follicles, and collagen density closer to normal skin tissue. These findings highlight the potential of random fibroin fibers/aligned CFs hybrid fibrous scaffold as a promising approach for skin tissue filling and tissue regeneration.

         <title>Interlayer Biatomic Pair Bridging the van der Waals Gap for 100% Activation of 2D Layered Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to achieve 100% activation is reported of atoms on the basal plane of 2D layered materials by constructing an interlayer biatomic bridge. New gap states at the Fermi level are introduced and interlayer conductivity is enhanced in this catalyst. Exposed basal plane atoms are optimized to a state favorable for adsorbing catalytic intermediates.








Abstract
2D layered materials are regarded as prospective catalyst candidates due to their advantageous atomic exposure ratio. Nevertheless, the predominant population of atoms residing on the basal plane with saturated coordination, exhibit inert behavior, while a mere fraction of atoms located at the periphery display reactivity. Here, a novel approach is reported to attain complete atom activation in 2D layered materials through the construction of an interlayer biatomic pair bridge. The atoms in question have been strategically optimized to achieve a highly favorable state for the adsorption of intermediates. This optimization results from the introduction of new gap states around the Fermi level. Moreover, the presence of the interlayer bridge facilitates the electron transfer across the van der Waals gap, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics. The hydrogen evolution reaction exhibits an impressive ultrahigh current density of 2000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 397&#160;mV, surpassing the pristine MoS2 by approximately two orders of magnitude (26&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 397&#160;mV). This study provides new insights for enhancing the efficacy of 2D layered catalysts.

         <title>Enhancing Photosynthesis Efficiency of Hydrogen Peroxide by Modulating Side Chains to Facilitate Water Oxidation at Low&#8208;Energy Barrier Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linked electron donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers are constructed alternately and introduce electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into the side chains of electron donors to mediate the active sites responsible for water oxidation. Under anaerobic conditions, its H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency via water oxidation reaction reaches an impressive 1365&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1. Remarkably, the photocatalyst achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 0.64%, the highest reported in natural water.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial oxidant in advanced oxidation processes. In situ, photosynthesis of it in natural water holds the promise of practical application for water remediation. However, current photosynthesis of H2O2 systems primarily relies on oxygen reduction, leading to limited performance in natural water with low dissolved oxygen or anaerobic conditions found in polluted water. Herein, a novel photocatalyst based on conjugated polymers with alternating electron donor&#8211;acceptor structures and electron&#8208;withdrawing side chains on electron donors is introduced. Specifically, carbazole functions as the electron donor, triazine serves as the electron acceptor, and cyano acts as the electron&#8208;withdrawing side chain. Notably, the photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 0.64%, the highest reported in natural water. Furthermore, even in anaerobic conditions, it achieves an impressive H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of 1365&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing all the reported photosynthetic systems of H2O2. This remarkable improvement is attributed to the effective relocation of the water oxidation active site from a high&#8208;energy carbazole to a low&#8208;energy acetylene site mediated by the side chains, resulting in enhanced O2 or H2O2 generation from water. This breakthrough offers a new avenue for efficient water remediation using advanced oxidation technologies in oxygen&#8208;limited environments, holding significant implications for environmental restoration.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Optical Multiclassification Platform for Minimizing Occasional Inaccuracy in Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Biomarker Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;mode multiclassification diagnostic platform enhances anti&#8208;interference ability in rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests (POCTs) with multivariable disturbances, and reduces the occasional inaccuracy mathematically. By validating 501 unprocessed clinical samples in serum and nasopharyngeal/anal swabs, the platform achieves a &#8776;99% accuracy at 100% statistical power and a sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer time of 5 min, realizing on&#8208;site diagnosis with accuracy similar to routine laboratory tests.








Abstract
On&#8208;site diagnostic tests that accurately identify disease biomarkers lay the foundation for self&#8208;healthcare applications. However, these tests routinely rely on single&#8208;mode signals and suffer from insufficient accuracy, especially for multiplexed point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests (POCTs) within a few minutes. Here, this work develops a dual&#8208;mode multiclassification diagnostic platform that integrates an electrochemiluminescence sensor and a field&#8208;effect transistor sensor in a microfluidic chip. The microfluidic channel guides the testing samples to flow across electro&#8208;optical sensor units, which produce dual&#8208;mode readouts by detecting infectious biomarkers of tuberculosis (TB), human rhinovirus (HRV), and group B streptococcus. Then, machine&#8208;learning classifiers generate three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hyperplanes to diagnose different diseases (GBS). Dual&#8208;mode readouts derived from distinct mechanisms enhance the anti&#8208;interference ability physically, and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;aided diagnosis in high&#8208;dimensional space reduces the occasional inaccuracy mathematically. Clinical validation studies with 501 unprocessed samples indicate that the platform has an accuracy approaching 99%, higher than the 77%&#8211;93% accuracy of rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing technologies at 100% statistical power (&gt;150 clinical tests). Moreover, the diagnosis time is 5&#160;min without a trade&#8208;off of accuracy. This work solves the occasional inaccuracy issue of rapid on&#8208;site diagnosis, endowing POCT systems with the same accuracy as laboratory tests and holding unique prospects for complicated scenes of personalized healthcare.

         <title>Breaking&#8208;Down Tumoral Physical Barrier by Remotely Unwrapping Metal&#8208;Polyphenol&#8208;Packaged Hyaluronidase for Optimizing Photothermal/Photodynamic Therapy&#8208;Induced Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the treatment of iron poisoning, here, the authors propose a remotely unwrapping strategy of metal&#8208;polyphenol&#8208;packaged hyaluronidase (named PPFH) by sequentially injecting PPFH and a clinically used iron&#8208;chelator deferoxamine. Such a cost&#8208;effective HAase delivery strategy memorably improves the subsequent photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT)&#8208;induced intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells and the cross&#8208;talk between tumor and tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes.








Abstract
The therapy of solid tumors is often hindered by the compact and rigid tumoral extracellular matrix (TECM). Precise reduction of TECM by hyaluronidase (HAase) in combination with nanotechnology is promising for solid tumor therapeutics, yet remains an enormous challenge. Inspired by the treatment of iron poisoning, here a remotely unwrapping strategy is proposed of metal&#8208;polyphenol&#8208;packaged HAase (named PPFH) by sequentially injecting PPFH and a clinically used iron&#8208;chelator deferoxamine (DFO). The in situ dynamic disassembly of PPFH can be triggered by the intravenously injected DFO, resulting in the release, reactivation, and deep penetration of encapsulated HAase inside tumors. Such a cost&#8208;effective HAase delivery strategy memorably improves the subsequent photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT)&#8208;induced intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells and the cross&#8208;talk between tumor and tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLN), thereby decreasing the immunosuppression and optimizing tumoricidal immune response that can efficiently protect mice from tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence in multiple mouse cancer models. Overall, this work presents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the dynamic disassembly of metal&#8208;polyphenol nanoparticles for extracellular drug delivery as well as the modulation of TECM and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Mechanically Strengthened Aerogels through Multiscale, Multicompositional, and Multidimensional Approaches: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It has already been &#8776;90 years since the first development of aerogels, and many researchers have devoted tremendous efforts to enhance&#160;their mechanical properties, which is yet completely achieved. This review presents multiscale, multicompositional and multidimensional strategies, resulting from flexible synthesis techniques for 0D&#8211;1D, 0D&#8211;2D, 1D&#8211;2D, and 0D&#8211;1D&#8211;2D combined aerogels.








Abstract
In recent decades, aerogels have attracted tremendous&#160;attention&#160;in academia and industry as a class of lightweight and porous multifunctional nanomaterial. Despite their wide application range, the low mechanical&#160;durability hinders their processing and handling, particularly in applications requiring complex physical structures. &#8220;Mechanically strengthened aerogels&#8221; have emerged as a potential solution to address this drawback. Since the first report on aerogels in 1931, various modified synthesis processes have been introduced in the last few decades to enhance the aerogel mechanical strength, further advancing their multifunctional scope. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments of mechanically strengthened aerogels through multicompositional and multidimensional approaches.

     alt="Mechanically Strengthened Aerogels through Multiscale, Multicompositional, and Multidimensional Approaches: A Review"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has already been &#8776;90 years since the first development of aerogels, and many researchers have devoted tremendous efforts to enhance&#160;their mechanical properties, which is yet completely achieved. This review presents multiscale, multicompositional and multidimensional strategies, resulting from flexible synthesis techniques for 0D&#8211;1D, 0D&#8211;2D, 1D&#8211;2D, and 0D&#8211;1D&#8211;2D combined aerogels.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent decades, aerogels have attracted tremendous&#160;attention&#160;in academia and industry as a class of lightweight and porous multifunctional nanomaterial. Despite their wide application range, the low mechanical&#160;durability hinders their processing and handling, particularly in applications requiring complex physical structures. &#8220;Mechanically strengthened aerogels&#8221; have emerged as a potential solution to address this drawback. Since the first report on aerogels in 1931, various modified synthesis processes have been introduced in the last few decades to enhance the aerogel mechanical strength, further advancing their multifunctional scope. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art developments of mechanically strengthened aerogels through multicompositional and multidimensional approaches. Furthermore, new trends and future directions for&#160;as&#160;prevailed commercialization of aerogels as plastic materials are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions above Room Temperature in a van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature N&#233;el skyrmions in Fe3GaTe2 are observed through Lorentz transmission electron microscopy . Upon an optimized field cooling procedure, zero&#8208;field skyrmion lattices are successfully generated in nanoflakes with an extended thickness range. Significantly, these skyrmion lattices remain stable up to 355 K, setting a new record for the highest temperature at which skyrmions can be hosted.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic crystals are a promising platform for innovative spintronic devices based on magnetic skyrmions, thanks to their high flexibility and atomic thickness stability. However, room&#8208;temperature skyrmion&#8208;hosting vdW materials are scarce, which poses a challenge for practical applications. In this study, a chemical vapor transport (CVT) approach is employed to synthesize Fe3GaTe2 crystals and room&#8208;temperature N&#233;el skyrmions are observed in Fe3GaTe2 nanoflakes above 58&#160;nm in thickness through in situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (L&#8208;TEM). Upon an optimized field cooling procedure, zero&#8208;field hexagonal skyrmion lattices are successfully generated in nanoflakes with an extended thickness range (30&#8211;180&#160;nm). Significantly, these skyrmion lattices remain stable up to 355 K, setting a new record for the highest temperature at which skyrmions can be hosted. The research establishes Fe3GaTe2 as an emerging above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature skyrmion&#8208;hosting vdW material, holding great promise for future spintronics.

         <title>Expanding the Horizons of Machine Learning in Nanomaterials to Chiral Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review analyzes machine learning methods for studying achiral nanomaterials and offers guidance for adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. An overview of chiral nanomaterials in the context of synthesis&#8208;structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships is presented, offering insights on leveraging machine learning for these complex relationships. Key achievements, challenges, and outlook for machine learning in chiral nanomaterials research are discussed.








Abstract
Machine learning holds significant research potential in the field of nanotechnology, enabling nanomaterial structure and property predictions, facilitating materials design and discovery, and reducing the need for time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive experiments and simulations. In contrast to their achiral counterparts, the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials is still in its infancy, with a limited number of publications to date. This is despite the great potential of machine learning to advance the development of new sustainable chiral materials with high values of optical activity, circularly polarized luminescence, and enantioselectivity, as well as for the analysis of structural chirality by electron microscopy. In this review, an analysis of machine learning methods used for studying achiral nanomaterials is provided, subsequently offering guidance on adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. An overview of chiral nanomaterials within the framework of synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships is presented and insights on how to leverage machine learning for the study of these highly complex relationships are provided. Some key recent publications are reviewed and discussed on the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials. Finally, the review captures the key achievements, ongoing challenges, and the prospective outlook for this very important research field.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Chiral Hole Transport Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of hole transport enantiomers are applied in fabrication of circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes first time with achiral luminescent materials as emitters, where the chiral hole transport enantiomers act as the organic circularly polarizers in principle. All devices exhibit symmetric circularly polarized electroluminescent spectra with dissymmetry factors ranging from 8.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4 to 3.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3.








Abstract
The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) demonstrate promising application in 3D display due to the direct generation of circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). But the chiral luminescence materials face challenges as intricated synthetic route, enantiomeric separation, etc. Herein, fresh CP&#8208;OLEDs are designed based on chiral hole transport material instead of chiral emitters. A pair of hole transport enantiomers (R/S&#8208;NPACZ) exhibit intense dissymmetry factors (|gPL|) about 5.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3. With R/S&#8208;NPACZ as hole transport layers, CP&#8208;OLEDs are fabricated employing six achiral phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with different wavelengths, in consistence with the generated CPEL spectra. The CP&#8208;OLEDs based on achiral red, green, and blue iridium(III) complexes exhibit external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 14.9%, 30.7%, and 14.1% with |gEL| factors of 8.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4, 2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. Moreover, the devices using achiral blue, blueish&#8208;green, and green TADF materials display EQEs of 24.1%, 17.9%, and 25.4% with |gEL| factors of 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3, 3.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. As far as known, it is the first example of CP&#8208;OLEDs based on chiral hole transport materials, which act as the organic circularly polarizers and have potential to generate CPEL from achiral luminescence materials.

Abstract
The anion&#8208;specific effects of the salting&#8208;in and salting&#8208;out phenomena have been extensively observed in hydrogels, whereas the cation specificity of hydrogels has rarely been reported. Herein, a multi&#8208;step strategy including borax pre&#8208;gelation, saline soaking, freeze&#8208;drying, and rehydrating is developed to fabricate polyvinyl alcohol gels with cation specificity, exhibiting the specific ordering of effects on the mechanical properties of gels as Ca2+ &gt; Li+ &gt; Mg2+ &gt;&gt; Fe3+ &gt; Cu2+ &#8776; Co2+ &#8776; Ni2+ &#8776; Zn2+. The multiple effects of the fabrication strategy, including the electrostatic repulsion among cations, skeleton support function of graphene oxide nanosheets, and water absorption and retention of ions, endow the gels with the dual characteristics of hydrogels and aerogels (i.e., hydro&#8208;aerogels). The hydro&#8208;aerogels prepared with the cationic salting&#8208;out effect display attractive pressure sensing performance with excellent stability over 90 days and enable continuous monitoring of ambient humidity in real time and effective work in seawater to detect various parameters (e.g., depth, salinity, and temperature). The hydro&#8208;aerogels prepared using the cationic salting&#8208;in effect can serve as quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes in supercapacitors, with 99.59% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles. This study realizes cation specificity in hydrogels and designs multifunctional hydro&#8208;aerogels for promising applications in various fields.

         <title>Anchoring Charge Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAMs) in perovskite solar cells has made the performance of p&#8211;i&#8211;n structure devices develop rapidly, while the relationship of function group, anchor groups, and spacers often is neglected. It is found that anchoring groups and spacers can affect the coordination between SAMs and perovskite. This work demonstrates different components of perovskites are selective to SAMs.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have displayed great potential for improving efficiency and stability in p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The anchoring of SAMs at the conductiv metal oxide substrates and their interaction with perovskite materials must be rationally tailored to ensure efficient charge carrier extraction and improved quality of the perovskite films. Herein, SAMs molecules with different anchoring groups and spacers to control the interaction with perovskite in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n mixed Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs are selected. It is found that the monolayer with the carboxylate group exhibits appropriate interaction and has a more favorable orientation and arrangement than that of the phosphate group. This results in reduced nonradiative recombination and enhanced crystallinity. In addition, the short chain length leads to an improved energy level alignment of SAMs with perovskite, improving hole extraction. As a result, the narrow bandgap (&#8776;1.25&#160;eV) Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs show efficiencies of up to 23.1% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of up to 0.89&#160;V. Unencapsulated devices retain 93% of their initial efficiency after storage in N2 atmosphere for over 2500 h. Overall, this work highlights the underexplored potential of SAMs for perovskite photovoltaics and provides essential findings on the influence of their structural modification.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds&#8208;Pinned Entanglement Blunting the Interfacial Crack of Hydrogel&#8211;Elastomer Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a universal strategy to blunt the interfacial crack propagation by bonding a hydrogen bonds&#8208;pinned entanglement (Hb&#8211;En) structure of amorphous hydrogel on engineering elastomer. Such a unique strategy fulfills the hydrogel coating with excellent interfacial toughness and interfacial fatigue threshold, ensuring long&#8208;term durable aqueous lubrication with a low friction coefficient.








Abstract
Anchoring a layer of amorphous hydrogel on an antagonistic elastomer holds potential applications in surface aqueous lubrication. However, the interfacial crack propagation usually occurs under continuous loads for amorphous hydrogel, leading to the failure of hydrogel interface. This work presents a universal strategy to passivate the interfacial cracks by designing a hydrogen bonds&#8208;pinned entanglement (Hb&#8211;En) structure of amorphous hydrogel on engineering elastomers. The unique Hb&#8211;En structure is created by pinning well&#8208;tailored entanglements via covalent&#8208;like hydrogen bonds, which can amplify the delocalization of interfacial stress concentration and elevate the necessary fracture energy barrier within hydrogel interface. Therefore, the interfacial crack propagation can be suppressed under single and cyclic loads, resulting in a high interfacial toughness over 1650 J m&#8722;2 and an excellent interfacial fatigue threshold of 423 J m&#8722;2. Such a strategy universally works on blunting the interfacial crack between hydrogel coating and various elastomer materials with arbitrary shapes. The superb fatigue&#8208;crack insensitivity at the interface allows for durable aqueous lubrication of hydrogel coating with low friction.

         <title>Multifunctional Conductive and Electrogenic Hydrogel Repaired Spinal Cord Injury via Immunoregulation and Enhancement of Neuronal Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a refractory neurological disorder. Due to the complex pathological processes, especially the secondary inflammatory cascade and the lack of intrinsic regenerative capacity, it is difficult to recover neurological function after SCI. Meanwhile, simulating the conductive microenvironment of the spinal cord promises to reconstruct electrical neural signal transmission interrupted by SCI and facilitates the neural repair. A double&#8208;crosslinked conductive hydrogel (BP@Hydrogel) containing black phosphorus nanoplates (BP) is synthesized. When placed in a rotating magnetic field (RMF), the BP@Hydrogel can generate stable electrical signals and exhibit electrogenic characteristic. In vitro, the BP@Hydrogel shows satisfactory biocompatibility and can alleviate the activation of microglia. When placed in the RMF, it enhances the anti&#8208;inflammatory effects. Meanwhile, the wireless electrical stimulation promotes the differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) to neurons, which is associated with the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. In vivo, the BP@Hydrogel is injectable and could elicit behavioral and electrophysiological recovery in complete transected SCI mice by alleviating the inflammation and facilitating endogenous NSCs to form functional neurons and synapses under the RMF. The present research develops a multifunctional conductive and electrogenic hydrogel for SCI repair by targeting multiple mechanisms including immunoregulation and enhancement of neuronal differentiation.

         <title>Sticky and Strain&#8208;Gradient Artificial Epineurium for Sutureless Nerve Repair in Rodents and Nonhuman Primates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A key feature in the materials design of wet adhesive, &#8220;a sticky and strain&#8208;gradient artificial epineurium (SSGAE) with skin&#8208;inspired hierarchical structure entailing strain&#8208;gradient layers, Janus hydrophilic/hydrophobic surfaces, and even self&#8208;healing property&#8221;, which enables immediate and stable neurorrhaphy, is reported.








Abstract
The need for the development of soft materials capable of stably adhering to nerve tissues without any suturing followed by additional damages is at the fore at a time when success in postoperative recovery depends largely on the surgical experience and/or specialized microsuturing skills of the surgeon. Despite fully recognizing such prerequisite conditions, designing the materials with robust adhesion to wet nerves as well as acute/chronic anti&#8208;inflammation remains to be resolved. Herein, a sticky and strain&#8208;gradient artificial epineurium (SSGAE) that overcomes the most critically challenging aspect for realizing sutureless repair of severely injured nerves is presented. In this regard, the SSGAE with a skin&#8208;inspired hierarchical structure entailing strain&#8208;gradient layers, anisotropic Janus layers including hydrophobic top and hydrophilic bottom surfaces, and synergistic self&#8208;healing capabilities enables immediate and stable neurorrhaphy in both rodent and nonhuman primate models, indicating that the bioinspired materials strategy significantly contributes to translational medicine for effective peripheral nerve repair.

         <title>Ln&#8208;MOF&#8208;Based Hydrogel Films with Tunable Luminescence and Afterglow Behavior for Visual Detection of Ofloxacin and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite lanthanide MOF &#8211; carrageenan hydrogel material is prepared and its luminescent sensing properties towards ofloxacin antibiotic in raw meat are demonstrated. Hydrogel films based on bimetallic MOFs demonstrate tunable multicolor luminescence with the afterglow effect suitable for anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Highly selective and sensitive quantitative detection of ofloxacin (OFX) at ultralow concentrations in aqueous media and development of new afterglow materials remains a challenge. Herein, a new 2D water&#8208;stable lanthanide metal&#8211;organic framework (NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb) is proposed, which exhibits high selectivity towards OFX through the luminescence quenching with the lowest detection limit (1.1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;9 M) reported to date and a fast response within 6 s. In addition, the luminescent detection of OFX by NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb is not affected by typical components of blood plasma and urine. The excellent sensing effect of NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb is further utilized to prepare a composite functional sensing carrageenan hydrogel material for the rapid detection of OFX in meat in real time and the first discovery of impressive afterglow in MOF&#8208;based hydrogels. This study not only presents novel Ln&#8208;MOF materials and Ln&#8208;MOF&#8208;based hydrogel films for luminescent sensing of OFX, but also demonstrates color&#8208;tunable luminescent films with afterglow, which expands the application of composite luminescent materials for detection and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Vertical Morphology and Energy Loss in Efficient Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A relationship between the molecular structure and the vertical phase separation (VPS) morphology of PPHJ OSCs by using molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a bridge is first established. A ternary PPHJ device with an appropriate &#8710;ESP is elaborately constructed to achieve better VPS morphology and lower &#916;E3, resulting in impressive efficiency of 19.09%.








Abstract
Although a suitable vertical phase separation (VPS) morphology is essential for improving charge transport efficiency, reducing charge recombination, and ultimately boosting the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs), there is a lack of theoretical guidance on how to achieve the ideal morphology. Herein, a relationship between the molecular structure and the VPS morphology of pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) OSCs is established by using molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a bridge. The morphological evolution mechanism is revealed by studying four binary systems with vary electrostatic potential difference (&#8710;ESP) between donors (Ds) and acceptors (As). The findings manifest that as &#8710;ESP increases, the active layer is more likely to form a well&#8208;mixed phase, while a smaller &#8710;ESP favors VPS morphology. Interestingly, it is also observed that a larger &#8710;ESP leads to enhanced miscibility between Ds and As, resulting in higher non&#8208;radiative energy losses (&#916;E3). Based on these discoveries, a ternary PPHJ device is meticulously designed with an appropriate &#8710;ESP to obtain better VPS morphology and lower &#916;E3, and an impressive efficiency of 19.09% is achieved. This work demonstrates that by optimizing the &#916;ESP, not only the formation of VPS morphology can be controlled, but also energy losses can be reduced, paving the way to further boost OSC performance.

         <title>Functional Amyloids: The Biomaterials of Tomorrow?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional amyloid from bacteria, particularly CsgA and FapC, are emerging as promising new biomaterials with applications within areas as diverse as gastrointestinal colonization, tissue engineering, water purification, CO2 fixation, biosensing, and more recently biocatalysis. This is thanks to their high stability, efficient and controllable formation, easy and scalable availability and ready engineering opportunities.








Abstract
Functional amyloid (FAs), particularly the bacterial proteins CsgA and FapC, have many useful properties as biomaterials: high stability, efficient, and controllable formation of a single type of amyloid, easy availability as extracellular material in bacterial biofilm and flexible engineering to introduce new properties. CsgA in particular has already demonstrated its worth in hydrogels for stable gastrointestinal colonization and regenerative tissue engineering, cell&#8208;specific drug release, water&#8208;purification filters, and different biosensors. It also holds promise as catalytic amyloid; existing weak and unspecific activity can undoubtedly be improved by targeted engineering and benefit from the repetitive display of active sites on a surface. Unfortunately, FapC remains largely unexplored and no application is described so far. Since FapC shares many common features with CsgA, this opens the window to its development as a functional scaffold. The multiple imperfect repeats in CsgA and FapC form a platform to introduce novel properties, e.g., in connecting linkers of variable lengths. While exploitation of this potential is still at an early stage, particularly for FapC, a thorough understanding of their molecular properties will pave the way for multifunctional fibrils which can contribute toward solving many different societal challenges, ranging from CO2 fixation to hydrolysis of plastic nanoparticles.

         <title>Boosting the Performances of Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics via Synergetic Near&#8208;Infrared Light Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;bishell PdCu@Au@SiO2&#160;nanotripods significantly enhance photon absorption in the NIR range for semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells. An optical coupling&#160;multilayer&#160;consisting of ZnS(130&#160;nm)/Na3AlF6(60&#160;nm)/WO3(100&#160;nm)/LaF3(50&#160;nm) enhances the NIR light utilization and the visible transparency. These strategies&#160;result in a record&#8208;high PCE of 16.14% along with an excellent AVT of over 30%, correspond to the record LUE of 5.33%.









Abstract
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) offer promising prospects for application in building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic systems and greenhouses, but further improvement of their performance faces a delicate trade&#8208;off between the two competing indexes of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). Herein, the authors take advantage of coupling plasmonics with the optical design of ST&#8208;OPVs to enhance near&#8208;infrared absorption and hence simultaneously improve efficiency and visible transparency to the maximum extent. By integrating core&#8211;bishell PdCu@Au@SiO2 nanotripods that act as optically isotropic Lambertian sources with near&#8208;infrared&#8208;customized localized surface plasmon resonance in an optimal ternary PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based ST&#8208;OPV, it is shown that their interplay with a multilayer optical coupling layer, consisting of ZnS(130&#160;nm)/Na3AlF6(60&#160;nm)/WO3(100&#160;nm)/LaF3(50&#160;nm) identified from high&#8208;throughput optical screening, leads to a record&#8208;high PCE of 16.14% (certified as 15.90%) along with an excellent AVT of 33.02%. The strong enhancement of the light utilization efficiency by &#8776;50% as compared to the counterpart device without optical engineering provides an encouraging and universal pathway for promoting breakthroughs in ST&#8208;OPVs from meticulous optical design.

         <title>Steering CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products via Enhancing Localized *CO Coverage and Local Pressure in Conical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful construction of open and deep conical cavities (OD&#8208;CCs) imparts structural confinement to the catalysts, enabling concentrated carbon intermediates and facilitating smooth efflux of products along the curved sides. The nanosheet&#8208;stacked Cu2O sphere (NS&#8208;Cu2O) achieves an enhanced selectivity toward C2+ products with a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81.7% at a partial current density of 286 mA cm&#8211;2.








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) involves a multistep proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process that generates a variety of intermediates, making it challenging to transform them into target products with high activity and selectivity. Here, a catalyst featuring a nanosheet&#8208;stacked sphere structure with numerous open and deep conical cavities (OD&#8208;CCs) is reported. Under the guidance of the finite&#8208;element method (FEM) simulations and theoretical analysis, it is shown that exerting control over the confinement space results in diffusion limitation of the carbon intermediates, thereby increasing local pressure and subsequently enhancing localized *CO coverage for dimerization. The nanocavities exhibit a structure&#8208;driven shift in selectivity of multicarbon (C2+) product from 41.8% to 81.7% during the CO2RR process.

         <title>Solid Electrolyte Bimodal Grain Structures for Improved Cycling Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the low critical current density obstacle facing Li7La3Zr2O12 solid&#8208;state electrolytes, a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy is validated by obtaining a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure. By tuning the ratio and spatial distribution of coarse and fine grains, the optimized bimodal microstructure allows cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density is ramped from 1.0 up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The application of solid&#8208;state electrolytes in Li batteries is hampered by the occurrence of Li&#8208;dendrite&#8208;caused short circuits. To avoid cell failure, the electrolytes can only be stressed with rather low current densities, severely restricting their performance. As grain size and pore distributions significantly affect dendrite growth in ceramic electrolytes such as Li7La3Zr2O12 and its variants; here, a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy to bring the superiority of both coarse and fine grains into play, is proposed. To validate the mechanism, a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure is obtained by seeding unpulverized large particles in the green body. The rearrangement of coarse grains and fine pores is fine&#8208;tuned by changing the ratio of pulverized and unpulverized powders. The optimized bimodal microstructure, obtained when the two powders are equally mixed, allows, without extra interface decoration, cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density is increased from 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, and gradually, up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. The &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; effects are confirmed from postmortem analysis. The complex grain boundaries formed by fine grains discourage the direct infiltration of Li. Simultaneously, the coarse grains further increase the tortuosity of the Li path. This study sheds light on the microstructure optimization for the polycrystalline solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;To overcome the low critical current density obstacle facing Li&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; solid-state electrolytes, a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy is validated by obtaining a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure. By tuning the ratio and spatial distribution of coarse and fine grains, the optimized bimodal microstructure allows cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density is ramped from 1.0 up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of solid-state electrolytes in Li batteries is hampered by the occurrence of Li-dendrite-caused short circuits. To avoid cell failure, the electrolytes can only be stressed with rather low current densities, severely restricting their performance. As grain size and pore distributions significantly affect dendrite growth in ceramic electrolytes such as Li&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and its variants; here, a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy to bring the superiority of both coarse and fine grains into play, is proposed. To validate the mechanism, a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure is obtained by seeding unpulverized large particles in the green body. The rearrangement of coarse grains and fine pores is fine-tuned by changing the ratio of pulverized and unpulverized powders. The optimized bimodal microstructure, obtained when the two powders are equally mixed, allows, without extra interface decoration, cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density is increased from 1.0 mA&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and gradually, up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; effects are confirmed from postmortem analysis. The complex grain boundaries formed by fine grains discourage the direct infiltration of Li. Simultaneously, the coarse grains further increase the tortuosity of the Li path. This study sheds light on the microstructure optimization for the polycrystalline solid-state electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase Selection Rules of Multi&#8208;Principal Element Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase selection rules and physical understanding are formed based on a comprehensive data set including 378 binary, 3276 ternary, and 20475 quaternary equal&#8208;molar alloys. A global phenomenological descriptor &#964; = &#8197;VEC&#8197; &#215; &#8197;(VECstd + VEC) + log(&#967;ave)3$\sqrt[3]{{{\mathrm{log}}( {{\chi }_{{\mathrm{ave}}}} )}}$ is developed which is more effective than VEC in both accuracy and predicting HCP phase and offers insights for MPEA design.








Abstract
Computational prediction of phase stability of multi&#8208;principal element alloys (MPEAs) holds a lot of promise for rapid exploration of the enormous design space and autonomous discovery of superior structural and functional properties. Regardless of many plausible works that rely on phenomenological theory and machine learning, precise prediction is still limited by insufficient data and the lack of interpretability of some machine learning algorithms, e.g., convolutional neural network. In this work, a comprehensive approach is presented, encompassing the development of a complete dataset that contains 72&#160;387 density functional theory calculations, as well as a predictive global phenomenological descriptor. The phase selection descriptor, based on atomic electronegativity and valence electron concentration, significantly outperforms the widely used valence electron concentration, excelling in both accuracy (with an f1 score of 63% compared to 47%) and its ability to predict the HCP phase (0.48 recall compared to 0). The comprehensive data mining on the global design space of 61&#160;425 quaternary MPEAs made from 28 possible metals, together with the phenomenological theory and physical interpretation, will set up a solid computational science foundation for data&#8208;driven exploration of MPEAs.

         <title>Ultrathin Magnesium&#8208;Based Coating as an Efficient Oxygen Barrier for Superconducting Circuit Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a combined experimental and computational study, it is demonstrated that an ultrathin Mg capping layer effectively suppresses the oxidation of tantalum (Ta), a promising material for superconducting qubits. With Mg acting as an oxygen barrier and getter, the superconducting properties of the underlaying Ta thin films are improved, exhibiting sharper transition to the Meissner state at higher critical temperature.








Abstract
Scaling up superconducting quantum circuits based on transmon qubits necessitates substantial enhancements in qubit coherence time. Over recent years, tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a promising candidate for transmon qubits, surpassing conventional counterparts in terms of coherence time. However, amorphous surface Ta oxide layer may introduce dielectric loss, ultimately placing a limit on the coherence time. In this study, a novel approach for suppressing the formation of tantalum oxide using an ultrathin magnesium (Mg) capping layer is presented. Synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies demonstrate that oxide is confined to an extremely thin region directly beneath the Mg/Ta interface. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the superconducting properties of thin Ta films are improved following the Mg capping, exhibiting sharper and higher&#8208;temperature transitions to superconductive and magnetically ordered states. Moreover, an atomic&#8208;scale mechanistic understanding of the role of the capping layer in protecting Ta from oxidation is established based on computational modeling. This work provides valuable insights into the formation mechanism and functionality of surface tantalum oxide, as well as a new materials design principle with the potential to reduce dielectric loss in superconducting quantum materials. Ultimately, the findings pave the way for the realization of large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;performance quantum computing systems.

         <title>Direct Observation of Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Skyrmion Motion Driven by Ultra&#8208;Low Current Density in Van Der Waals Ferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current&#8208;induced magnetic skyrmion motion is directly visualized in 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT) at room temperature. The electrical pulse can thermally generate the skyrmions under an external magnetic field. In addition, magnetic skyrmions are effectively driven by electrical current. The results demonstrate the feasibility of operating skyrmion devices at room temperature using 2D materials.








Abstract
The recent discovery of room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism in 2D van der Waals (vdW) materials, such as Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), has garnered significant interest in offering a robust platform for 2D spintronic applications. Various fundamental operations essential for the realization of 2D spintronics devices are experimentally confirmed using these materials at room temperature, such as current&#8208;induced magnetization switching or tunneling magnetoresistance. Nevertheless, the potential applications of magnetic skyrmions in FGaT systems at room temperature remain unexplored. In this work, the current&#8208;induced generation of magnetic skyrmions in FGaT flakes employing high&#8208;resolution magnetic transmission soft X&#8208;ray microscopy is introduced, supported by a feasible mechanism based on thermal effects. Furthermore, direct observation of the current&#8208;induced magnetic skyrmion motion at room temperature in FGaT flakes is presented with ultra&#8208;low threshold current density. This work highlights the potential of FGaT as a foundation for room&#8208;temperature&#8208;operating 2D skyrmion device applications.

         <title>External Field&#8208;Responsive Ternary Non&#8208;Noble Metal Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>

Abstract
Despite the increasing effort in advancing oxygen electrocatalysts for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs), the performance development gradually reaches a plateau via only ameliorating the electrocatalyst materials. Herein, a new class of external field&#8208;responsive electrocatalyst comprising Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 stably dispersed on N&#8208;doped Ketjenblack (Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/N&#8208;KB) was developed via polymer&#8208;assisted strategy for practical ZABs. Briefly, the activity indicator &#916;E was significantly decreased to 0.618&#160;V upon photothermal assistance, far exceeding most reported electrocatalysts (generally &gt;0.680&#160;V). As a result, the photothermal electrocatalyst possessed comprehensive merits of excellent power density (319&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), ultralong lifespan (5163 cycles at 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and outstanding rate performance (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) for liquid ZABs, and superb temperature and deformation adaptability for flexible ZABs. Such improvement was attributed to the photothermal&#8208;heating&#8208;enabled synergy of promoted electrical conductivity, reactant&#8208;molecule motion, active area and surface reconstruction, as revealed by operando Raman and simulation. The findings open vast possibilities toward more&#8208;energy&#8208;efficient energy applications.

Abstract
Hypoxia and infection are urgent clinical problems in chronic diabetic wounds. Herein, living Chlorella&#8208;loaded poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;based microneedles (PILMN&#8208;Chl) were constructed for microacupuncture oxygen and antibacterial therapy against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)&#8208;infected chronic diabetic wounds. The PILMN&#8208;Chl can stably and continuously produce oxygen for more than 30&#160;h due to the photosynthesis of the loaded self&#8208;supported Chlorella. By combining the barrier penetration capabilities of microneedles, the continuous and sufficient oxygen supply of Chlorella and the sterilization activities of PIL, the PILMN&#8208;Chl can accelerate chronic diabetic wounds in vivo by topical targeted sterilization and hypoxia relief in deep parts of wounds. Thus, the self&#8208;oxygen produced microneedles modality may provide a promising and facile therapeutic strategy for treating chronic, hypoxic, and infected diabetic wounds.

         <title>A Fluoride&#8208;Rich Solid&#8208;Like Electrolyte Stabilizing Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
To address the problems associated with Li metal anodes, we present a fluoride&#8208;rich solid&#8208;like electrolyte (SLE) that combines the benefits of solid&#8208;state and liquid electrolytes. Its unique triflate&#8208;group&#8208;enhanced frame channels facilitate the formation of a functional inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which not only improves the reversibility and interfacial charge transfer of Li anodes but also ensures uniform and compact Li deposition. Furthermore, these triflate groups contribute to the decoupling of Li+ and provide hopping sites for rapid Li+ transport, enabling a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.17&#160;eV, making it comparable to conventional liquid electrolytes. Consequently, Li symmetric cells using such SLE achieve extremely stable plating/stripping cycling over 3500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and support a high critical current up to 2.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled Li||LiFePO4 solid&#8208;like batteries exhibit exceptional cyclability for over one year and a half, even outperforming liquid cells. Additionally, high&#8208;voltage cylindrical cells and high&#8208;capacity pouch cells are demonstrated, corroborating much simpler processibility in battery assembly compared to all solid&#8208;state batteries. These findings highlight the potential of the SLE approach in building a desirable SEI, offering practical solutions for the widespread adoption of rechargeable LMBs.

         <title>Rapid Generation of Hpsc&#8208;Derived High Endothelial Venule Organoids with In Vivo Ectopic Lymphoid Tissue Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bioengineering strategies for the fabrication of implantable lymphoid structures mimicking lymph nodes (LNs) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) could amplify the adaptive immune response for therapeutic applications such as cancer immunotherapy. No method to date has resulted in the consistent formation of high endothelial venules (HEVs), which is the specialized vasculature responsible for na&#239;ve T cell recruitment and education in both LNs and TLS. Here we used orthogonal induced differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) carrying a regulatable ETV2 allele, to rapidly and efficiently induce endothelial differentiation. Assembly of embryoid bodies combining primitive inducible endothelial cells (iEndos) and primary human lymph node fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) resulted in the formation of HEV&#8208;like structures that can aggregate into three dimensional organoids (HEVOs). Upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice, HEVOs successfully engrafted and formed lymphatic structures that recruited both antigen&#8208;presenting cells and adoptively&#8208;transferred lymphocytes, therefore displaying basic TLS capabilities. Our results further show that functionally, HEVOs can organize an immune response and promote anti&#8208;tumor activity by adoptively transferred T lymphocytes. Collectively, our experimental approaches represent an innovative and scalable proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy for the fabrication of bioengineered tertiary lymphoid structures that can be deployed in vivo to enhance adaptive immune responses.

         <title>Interlayer Engineering of Layered Materials for Efficient Ion Separation and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layered materials are characterized by strong in&#8208;plane covalent chemical bonds within each atomic layer and weak out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions between adjacent layers. The non&#8208;bonding nature between neighboring layers naturally results in a vdW gap, which enables the insertion of guest species into the interlayer gap. Rational design and regulation of interlayer nanochannels are crucial for converting these layered materials and their two&#8208;dimensional derivatives into ion separation membranes or battery electrodes. Herein, based on the latest progress in layered materials and their derivative nanosheets, various interlayer engineering methods are briefly introduced, along with the effects of intercalated species on the crystal structure and interlayer coupling of the host layered materials. Their applications in the ion separation and energy storage fields are then summarized, with the focus on interlayer engineering to improve selective ion transport and ion storage performance. Finally, future research opportunities and challenges in this emerging field are comprehensively discussed.

         <title>Topological Spin Textures in an Insulating van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Generation and control of topological spin textures constitutes one of the most exciting challenges of modern spintronics given their potential applications in information storage technologies. Of particular interest are magnetic insulators, which due to low damping, absence of Joule heating and reduced dissipation could provide energy&#8208;efficient spin&#8208;textures platform. Here we&#160;demonstrate that the interplay between sample thickness, external magnetic fields and optical excitations can generate a prolific paramount of spin textures, and their coexistence in insulating CrBr3 van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets. Using high&#8208;resolution magnetic force microscopy and large&#8208;scale micromagnetic simulation methods, we&#160;demonstrate the existence of a large region in T&#8208;B phase diagram where different stripe domains, skyrmion crystals and magnetic domains exist and can be intrinsically selected or transformed to each&#8208;other via a phase&#8208;switch mechanism. Lorentz transmission electron microscopy unveiled the mixed chirality of the magnetic textures which are of Bloch&#8208;type at given conditions but can be further manipulated into N&#233;el&#8208;type or hybrid&#8208;type via thickness&#8208;engineering. The topological phase transformation between the different magnetic objects could be further inspected by standard photoluminescence optical probes resolved by circular polarization indicative of an existance of exciton&#8208;skyrmion coupling mechanism. Our&#160;findings identified vdW magnetic insulators as a promising framework of materials for the manipulation and generation of highly ordered skyrmion lattices relevant for device integration at the atomic level.

         <title>Kinetically Controlled Synthesis of Metallic Glass Nanoparticles with Expanded Composition Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanoscale metallic glasses offer opportunities for investigating fundamental properties of amorphous solids and technological applications in biomedicine, microengineering, and catalysis. However, their top&#8208;down fabrication is limited by bulk counterpart availability, and bottom&#8208;up synthesis remains underexplored due to strict formation conditions. Here, we developed a kinetically controlled flash carbothermic reaction, featuring ultrafast heating (&gt;105 K s&#8722;1) and cooling rates (&gt;104 K s&#8722;1), for synthesizing metallic glass nanoparticles within milliseconds. Nine compositional permutations of noble metals, base metals, and metalloid (M1&#8208;M2&#8208;P, M1 = Pt/Pd, M2 = Cu/Ni/Fe/Co/Sn) were synthesized with widely tunable particle sizes and substrates. Through combinatorial development, we discovered a substantially expanded composition space for nanoscale metallic glass compared to bulk counterpart, revealing the nanosize effect enhanced glass forming ability. Leveraging this, we synthesized several nanoscale metallic glasses with composition that have never, to our knowledge, been synthesized in bulk. The metallic glass nanoparticles exhibited high activity in heterogeneous catalysis, outperforming crystalline metal alloy nanoparticles.

         <title>Isomerization of Benzothiadiazole Yields A Promising Polymer Donor and Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19.0%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The exploration of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donors remains critical to achieve high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) beyond current thresholds. Herein, the 1,2,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (iBT), which is an isomer of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BT), is used to design wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor PiBT. The PiBT&#8208;based solar cells reach efficiency of 19.0%, which is one of the highest efficiencies in binary OSCs. Systemic studies show that isomerization of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BT) to 1,2,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (iBT) can finely regulate the polymers&#8217; photoelectric properties including (i) increase the extinction coefficient and photon harvest, (ii) down&#8208;shift the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, (iii) improve the coplanarity of polymer backbones, (vi) offer good thermodynamic miscibility with acceptors. Consequently, the PiBT:Y6 BHJ device simultaneously reaches advantageous nanoscale morphology, efficient exciton generation and dissociation, fast charge transportation, and suppressed charge recombination, leading to larger VOC of 0.87&#160;V, higher JSC of 28.2 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, greater FF of 77.3%, and thus higher efficiency of 19.0%, while the analogue PBT&#8208;based OSCs reach efficiency of only 12.9%. Moreover, the key intermediate 1,2,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (iBT) can be easily afforded from industry chemicals via two&#8208;step procedure. Overall, this contribution highlights that 1,2,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (iBT) is a promising motif for designing high&#8208;performance polymer donors.

         <title>Bioengineered Ionic Liquid for Catheter&#8208;Directed Tissue Ablation, Drug Delivery And Embolization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Delivery of therapeutics to solid tumors with high bioavailability remains a challenge and is likely the main contributor to the ineffectiveness of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Here, a catheter&#8208;directed ionic liquid embolic (ILE) was bioengineered to achieve durable vascular embolization, uniform tissue ablation, and drug delivery in non&#8208;survival and survival porcine models of embolization, outperforming the clinically used embolic agents. To simulate the clinical scenario, rabbit VX2 orthotopic liver tumors were treated showing successful trans&#8208;arterial delivery of Nivolumab and effective tumor ablation. Furthermore, similar results were also observed in human ex&#8208;vivo tumor tissue as well as significant susceptibility of highly resistant patient&#8208;derived bacteria was seen to ILE, suggesting that ILE could prevent abscess formation in embolized tissue. ILE represents a new class of liquid embolic agents that can treat tumors, improve the delivery of therapeutics, prevent infectious complications, and potentially increase chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy response in solid tumors.

         <title>Multimodal Soft Robotic Actuation and Locomotion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Diverse and adaptable modes of complex motion observed at different scales in living creatures are challenging to reproduce in robotic systems. Achieving dexterous movement in conventional robots can be difficult due to the many limitations of applying rigid materials. Robots based on soft materials are inherently deformable, compliant, adaptable, and adjustable, making soft robotics conducive to creating machines with complicated actuation and motion gaits. This review examines the mechanisms and modalities of actuation deformation in materials that respond to various stimuli. Then, strategies based on composite materials are considered to build toward actuators that combine multiple actuation modes for sophisticated movements. Examples across literature illustrate the development of soft actuators as free&#8208;moving, entirely soft&#8208;bodied robots with multiple locomotion gaits via careful manipulation of external stimuli. We further highlight how the application of soft functional materials into robots with rigid components further enhances their locomotive abilities. Finally, taking advantage of the shape&#8208;morphing properties of soft materials, reconfigurable soft robots have shown the capacity for adaptive gaits that enable transition across environments with different locomotive modes for optimal efficiency. Overall, soft materials enable varied multimodal motion in actuators and robots, positioning soft robotics to make real&#8208;world applications for intricate and challenging tasks.

         <title>Wearable Sensors for Breath Monitoring Based on Water&#8208;Based Hexagonal Boron Nitride Inks Made with Supramolecular Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable sensor able to monitor in real time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals, associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, is demonstrated. The device is based on hexagonal boron nitride inks made by non&#8208;covalent functionalization with pyrene derivatives, enabling to strongly enhance the sensitivity to water molecules, and device stability.








Abstract
Wearable humidity sensors are attracting strong attention as they allow for real&#8208;time and continuous monitoring of important physiological information by enabling activity tracking as well as air quality assessment. Amongst 2Dimensional (2D) materials, graphene oxide (GO) is very attractive for humidity sensing due to its tuneable surface chemistry, high surface area, processability in water, and easy integration onto flexible substrates. However, strong hysteresis, low sensitivity, and cross&#8208;sensitivity issues limit the use of GO in practical applications, where continuous monitoring is preferred. Herein, a wearable and wireless impedance&#8208;based humidity sensor made with pyrene&#8208;functionalized hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets is demonstrated. The device shows enhanced sensitivity towards relative humidity (RH) (&gt;1010 Ohms/%RH in the range from 5% to 100% RH), fast response (0.1&#160;ms), no appreciable hysteresis, and no cross&#8208;sensitivity with temperature&#160;in the range of 25&#8211;60 &#176;C. The h&#8208;BN&#8208;based sensor is able to monitor the whole breathing cycle process of exhaling and inhaling, hence enabling to record in real&#8208;time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, without requiring any direct contact with the individual.

         <title>Ultrathin, Transferred Layers of Silicon Oxynitrides as Tunable Biofluid Barriers for Bioresorbable Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In addition to their potential for reducing solid waste streams associated with discarded consumer gadgetry, bio/ecoresorbable electronic systems create unique opportunities in implantable medical devices that serve a need over a finite time period and then disappear naturally to eliminate the need for extraction surgeries. A critical challenge in the development of this type of technology is in materials that can serve as thin, stable barriers to surrounding ground water or biofluids, yet ultimately dissolve completely and in a well&#8208;defined manner to biologically and environmentally benign end products. Here, we describe a class of inorganic material (silicon oxynitride, SiON) that can be formed in thin films by plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) for this purpose. In vitro studies suggest that SiON and its dissolution products are biocompatible, indicating the potential for its use in implantable devices. A facile process to fabricate flexible, wafer&#8208;scale multilayer films bypasses limitations associated with the mechanical fragility of inorganic thin films. Systematic computational, analytical and experimental studies highlight the essential materials aspects. Demonstrations in wireless light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) both in vitro and in vivo illustrate the practical use of these materials strategies. The ability to select degradation rates and water permeability through fine tuning of chemical compositions and thicknesses provides the opportunity to obtain a range of functional lifetimes to meet different application requirements.

         <title>Engineered Surfaces That Promote Capture of Latent Proteins to Facilitate Integrin&#8208;Mediated Mechanical Activation of Growth Factors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An osteogenic platform that functions by capturing inactive growth factor molecules is engineered to overcome conventional challenges associated with the use of active growth factors. The platform triggers capture of inactive transforming growth factor beta&#8208;1 for its subsequent integrin&#8208;mediated activation which activates osteogenic downstream signaling in vitro and fully repairs critical&#8208;sized bone defect in vivo.








Abstract
Conventional osteogenic platforms utilize active growth factors to repair bone defects that are extensive in size, but they can adversely affect patient health. Here, an unconventional osteogenic platform is reported that functions by promoting capture of inactive osteogenic growth factor molecules to the site of cell growth for subsequent integrin&#8208;mediated activation, using a recombinant fragment of latent transforming growth factor beta&#8208;binding protein&#8208;1 (rLTBP1). It is shown that rLTBP1 binds to the growth&#8208;factor&#8208; and integrin&#8208;binding domains of fibronectin on poly(ethyl acrylate) surfaces, which immobilizes rLTBP1 and promotes the binding of latency associated peptide (LAP), within which inactive transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1) is bound. rLTBP1 facilitates the interaction of LAP with integrin &#946;1 and the subsequent mechanically driven release of TGF&#8208;&#946;1 to stimulate canonical TGF&#8208;&#946;1 signaling, activating osteogenic marker expression in vitro and complete regeneration of a critical&#8208;sized bone defect in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;An osteogenic platform that functions by capturing inactive growth factor molecules is engineered to overcome conventional challenges associated with the use of active growth factors. The platform triggers capture of inactive transforming growth factor beta-1 for its subsequent integrin-mediated activation which activates osteogenic downstream signaling in vitro and fully repairs critical-sized bone defect in vivo.

Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is an ultrasensitive surface analysis technique that is widely used in chemical sensing, bioanalysis, and environmental monitoring. The design of the SERS substrates is crucial for obtaining high&#8208;quality SERS signals. Recently, two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) have emerged as high&#8208;performance SERS substrates due to their superior stability, ease of fabrication, biocompatibility, controllable doping, and tunable bandgaps and excitons. In this review, we provide a systematic overview of the latest advancements in 2D TMDs SERS substrates. This review comprehensively summarizes the candidate 2D TMDs SERS materials, elucidates their working principles for SERS, explores the strategies to optimize their SERS performance, and highlights their practical applications. We particularly delve into the material engineering strategies, including defect engineering, alloy engineering, thickness engineering, and heterojunction engineering. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and future prospects associated with the development of 2D TMDs SERS substrates, outlining potential directions that may lead to significant breakthroughs in practical applications.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix Scaffold&#8208;Assisted Tumor Vaccines Induce Tumor Regression And Long&#8208;Term Immune Memory</title>

Abstract
Injectable scaffold delivery is a strategy to enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccine immunotherapy. The choice of scaffold biomaterial is crucial, impacting both vaccine release kinetics and immune stimulation via the host response. Extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds prepared from decellularized tissues facilitate a pro&#8208;healing inflammatory response that promotes local cancer immune surveillance. Here, we engineered an ECM scaffold&#8208;assisted therapeutic cancer vaccine that maintained an immune microenvironment consistent with tissue reconstruction. Several immune&#8208;stimulating adjuvants were screened to develop a cancer vaccine formulated with decellularized small intestinal submucosa ECM scaffold co&#8208;delivery. We found that the STING pathway agonist CDA most effectively induced cytotoxic immunity in an ECM scaffold vaccine, without compromising key IL&#8208;4 mediated immune pathways associated with healing. ECM scaffold delivery enhanced therapeutic vaccine efficacy, curing 50&#8211;75% of established EG.7 lymphoma tumors in mice, while none were cured with soluble vaccine. SIS&#8208;ECM scaffold&#8208;assisted vaccination prolonged antigen exposure, was dependent on CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, and generated long&#8208;term antigen&#8208;specific immune memory for at least 10 months post&#8208;vaccination. This study shows that an ECM scaffold is a promising delivery vehicle to enhance cancer vaccine efficacy while being orthogonal to characteristics of pro&#8208;healing immune hallmarks.

         <title>Intergrating Hollow Multishelled Structure and High Entropy Engineering Towards Enhanced Mechano&#8208;Electrochemical Properties in Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hollow multishelled structures (HoMS) have been attracting great interest in lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the conversion anodes, owing to their superior buffering effect and mechanical stability. Given the synthetic challenges, especially elemental diffusion barrier in the multi&#8208;metal combinations, this complex structure design has been realized in low&#8208; and medium&#8208;entropy compounds so far. It means that poor reaction reversibility and low intrinsic conductivity remain largely unresolved. Here, we develop a hollow multishelled (LiFeZnNiCoMn)3O4 high entropy oxide (HEO) through integrating molecule and microstructure engineering. As expected, the HoMS design exhibits significant targeting functionality, yielding satisfactory structure and cycling stability. Meanwhile, the abundant oxygen defects and optimized electronic structure of HEO accelerate the lithiation kinetics, while the retention of the parent lattice matrix enables reversible lithium storage, which is validated by rigorous in&#8208;situ tests and theoretical simulations. Benefiting from these combined properties, such hollow multishelled HEO anode can deliver a specific capacity of 967 mAh g&#8722;1 (89% capacity retention) after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. The synergistic lattice and volume stability showcased in this work holds great promise in guiding the material innovations for the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Improving Charge Storage of Biaxially&#8208;Oriented Polypropylene Under Extreme Electric Fields by Excimer Uv Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Biaxially&#8208;oriented polypropylene (BOPP) is one of the most commonly used materials for film&#8208;based capacitors for power electronics and pulsed power systems. To address the pressing issue of performance&#8208;limiting loss under extreme electric&#8208;fields, here we demonstrate a one&#8208;step, high&#8208;throughput, and environment&#8208;friendly process based on very low&#8208;dose ultra&#8208;violet irradiation from KrCl (222&#160;nm) and Xe2 (172&#160;nm) excimer. The performance of commercial BOPP is boosted in terms of withstanding electric&#8208;field extremes (Weibull breakdown strength 694 to 811&#160;V &#956;m&#8722;1 by 17% at 25&#160;&#176;C and 428 to 651&#160;V &#956;m&#8722;1 by 52% at 120&#160;&#176;C), discharged energy density, and conduction losses. Importantly, the depth profile of space charge is precisely measured in&#8208;situ with a high resolution of 500&#160;nm by laser induced pressure pulse. Consequently, the space charge effect and electric&#8208;field distortion are reduced and related to the improved polymer films. It is demonstrated that energetic UV photons act as scissors for BOPP chains and dissociate oxygen molecules leading to the more thermally stable oxygen&#8208;containing structures, as deep traps to impede charge migration. This work provides a promising approach to produce polymers with customized microscopic characteristics that is compatible with the assembly lines of polymer&#8208;based capacitors.

         <title>Targeted Macrophage CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 Mrna Editing in Immunotherapy for Tendon Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 holds substantial promise for tissue repair through its RNA editing capabilities and swift catabolism. However, conventional delivery methods fall short in addressing the heightened inflammatory response orchestrated by macrophages during the acute stages of tendon injury. In this investigation, we systematically screened macrophage&#8208;targeting cationic polymers to facilitate the entry of Cas13 ribonucleic&#8208;protein complex (Cas13 RNP) into macrophages. Notably, SPP1 (OPN encoding)&#8208;producing macrophages are recognized as a profibrotic subtype that emerges during the inflammatory stage. Employing ROS&#8208;responsive release mechanisms tailored for macrophage&#8208;targeted Cas13 RNP editing systems, we curbed the overactivation of SPP1 in the face of an acute immune microenvironment. Upon encapsulating this composite membrane around the tendon injury site, the macrophage&#8208;targeted Cas13 RNP effectively curtailed the emergence of injury&#8208;induced SPP1&#8208;producing macrophages in the acute phase, leading to diminished fibroblast activation and mitigated peritendinous adhesion. Consequently, our study furnishes a swift RNA editing strategy for macrophages in the inflammatory phase triggered by ROS in tendon injury, along with a pioneering macrophage&#8208;targeted carrier proficient in delivering Cas13 into macrophages efficiently.

         <title>Spatial Photo&#8208;Patterning of Nematic Liquid Crystal Pretilt and its Application in Fabricating Flat Gradient&#8208;Index Lenses</title>

Abstract
Liquid crystals offer a dynamic platform for developing advanced photonics and soft actuation systems due to their unique and facile tunability and reconfigurability. Achieving precise spatial patterning of the liquid crystal alignment is critical to developing electro&#8208;optical devices, programmable origami, directed colloidal assembly, and controlling active matter. Here, we&#160;demonstrate a simple method to achieve continuous three&#8208;dimensional control of the directions of liquid crystal mesogens using a two&#8208;step photo&#8208;exposure process. In the first step, polarized light sets the orientation in the plane of confining substrates; the second step uses unpolarized light of a prescribed dose to set the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation. The method enables smoothly varying orientational patterns with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. As a demonstration, we&#160;design gradient&#8208;index lenses with parabolic refractive index profiles that remain stable without external electric fields. We&#160;characterize the lenses' focal length and sensitivity to light polarization through experimental and numerical methods. Our&#160;findings pave the way for developing next&#8208;generation photonic devices and actuated materials, with potential applications in molecular self&#8208;assembly, re&#8208;configurable optics, and responsive&#160;matter.

         <title>A Nanoscale Trans&#8208;platinum(II)&#8208;Based Supramolecular Coordination Self&#8208;assembly with a Distinct Anticancer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Drug resistance significantly hampers the clinical application of existing platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs. New platinum medications that possess distinct mechanisms of action are highly desired for the treatment of Pt&#8208;resistant cancers. Herein, we prepare a nanoscale trans&#8208;platinum(II)&#8208;based supramolecular coordination self&#8208;assembly (Pt&#8208;TCPP&#8208;BA) via using trans&#8208;[PtCl2(Pyridine)(NH3)] (transpyroplatin), tetracarboxylporphyrin (TCPP) and benzoic acid (BA) as building blocks to combat drug resistance in platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy. Mechanistic studies indicate that Pt&#8208;TCPP&#8208;BA shows a H2O2&#8208;responsive dissociation behavior along with the generation of bioactive trans&#8208;Pt(II) and TCPP&#8208;Pt species. Different from cisplatin, these degradation products interact with DNA via interstrand cross&#8208;links and small groove binding, and induce significant upregulation of cell death related proteins such as p53, cleaved caspase 3, p21 and phosphorylated H2A histone family member X in cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells. As a result, Pt&#8208;TCPP&#8208;BA exhibits potent killing effects against Pt&#8208;resistant tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our work not only provides a new platinum drug for combating drug&#8208;resistant cancer but also offers a new paradigm for the development of platinum&#8208;based supramolecular anticancer drugs.

         <title>Molecular Motor&#8208;Driven Light&#8208;Controlled Logic&#8208;Gated K+ Channel for Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>

Abstract
Developing artificial ion transport systems, which process complicated information and step&#8208;wise regulate properties, is essential for deeply comprehending the subtle dynamic behaviors of natural channel proteins (NCPs). Here we report a photo&#8208;controlled logic&#8208;gated K+ channel based on single&#8208;chain random heteropolymers (RHPs) containing molecular motors, exhibiting multi&#8208;core processor&#8208;like properties to step&#8208;wise control ion transport. Designed with oxygen, deoxygenation, and different wavelengths of light as input signals, complicated logical circuits comprising &#8220;YES&#8221;, &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221; and &#8220;NOT&#8221; gate components are established. Implementing these logical circuits with K+ transport efficiencies as output signals, we realize multiple state transitions including &#8220;ON&#8221;, &#8220;Partially OFF&#8221; and &#8220;Totally OFF&#8221; in liposomes and cancer cells, further causing step&#8208;wise anticancer treatments. Dramatic K+ efflux in &#8220;ON&#8221; state (decrease by 50% within 7 minutes) significantly induces cancer cell apoptosis. We expect this integrated logic&#8208;gated strategy will be expanded toward understanding the delicate mechanism underlying NCPs and treating cancer or other diseases.

         <title>Achieving Clearance of Drug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Infection and Rapid Cutaneous Wound Regeneration Using An ROS&#8208;Balancing&#8208;Engineered Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Intractable infected microenvironments caused by drug&#8208;resistant bacteria stalls the normal course of wound healing. Sono&#8208;piezodynamic therapy (SPT) has been extensively harnessed to combat pathogenic bacteria, but the superabundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during SPT inevitably provoke severe inflammatory response from the host as well, hindering tissue regeneration. To address this issue, we devise an intelligent nanocatalytic membrane composed of poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) and black phosphorus /V2C MXene bio&#8208;heterojunctions (2D2&#8208;bioHJs) that can modulate ROS levels during and after SPT for the efficient remediation of cutaneous infected wounds. Under ultrasonication, 2D2&#8208;bioHJs eliminate effectively drug&#8208;resistant bacteria by disrupting metabolism and electron transport chain. When ultrasonication ceases, they enable the elimination of SPT&#8208;generated ROS which alleviate subsequent inflammation of wound tissue. The 2D2&#8208;bioHJs act as a &#8220;lever&#8221; that effectively achieves balance between ROS generation and annihilation, delivering both antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties to the engineered membrane. More importantly, in vivo assays corroborate that the nanocatalytic membranes transform the stalled chronic wound environment into a regenerative one by eradicating the bacterial population, dampening the NF&#8208;&#954;B inflammatory pathway and promoting angiogenesis. As envisaged, this work demonstrates a novel tactic to arm membranes with programmed antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory effects to remedy refractory infected wounds from drug&#8208;fast bacteria.

         <title>Growth Control of InP/ZnSe Heterostructured Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The morphology of heterostructured semiconductor nanocrystals (h&#8208;NCs) dictates spatial distribution of charge carriers and their recombination dynamics and/or transport, which are the main performance indicators of photonic applications utilizing h&#8208;NCs. The inability to control the morphology of heterovalent III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs composed of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free elements hinders their practical use. As a case study of III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs, we demonstrate here the growth control of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs. The anisotropic morphology in InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs is attributed to the facet&#8208;dependent energy costs for the growth of ZnSe epilayers on different facets of InP NCs, and we demonstrate effective chemical means for controlling the growth rates of ZnSe on different surface planes. Ultimately, we capitalize on the controlled morphology of InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs to expand their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive one, which will facilitate their use in a variety of photonic applications.

         <title>A Universal Perovskite/C60 Interface Modification via Atomic Layer Deposited Aluminum Oxide for Perovskite Solar Cells And Perovskite&#8208;Silicon Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The primary performance limitation in inverted perovskite&#8208;based solar cells is the interface between the fullerene&#8208;based electron transport layers and the perovskite. We developed atomic layer deposited thin AlOX interlayers that reduce nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface, resulting in &gt; 60 millivolts improvement in open&#8208;circuit voltage and 1% absolute improvement in power conversion efficiency.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary performance limitation in inverted perovskite-based solar cells is the interface between the fullerene-based electron transport layers and the perovskite. We developed atomic layer deposited thin AlO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; interlayers that reduce nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; interface, resulting in &amp;gt; 60 millivolts improvement in open-circuit voltage and 1% absolute improvement in power conversion efficiency. Surface-sensitive characterizations indicate the presence of a thin, conformally deposited AlO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; layer, functioning as a passivating contact. These interlayers work universally using different lead-halide-based absorbers with different compositions where the 1.55 electron volts bandgap single junction devices reach &amp;gt;23% power conversion efficiency. We find a reduction of metallic Pb&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and the compact layer prevents in- &amp;amp; egress of volatile species, synergistically improving the stability. AlO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;-modified wide-bandgap perovskite absorbers as a top cell in a monolithic perovskite-silicon tandem enable a certified power conversion efficiency of 29.9% and open-circuit voltages above 1.92 volts for 1.17 square centimeters device area.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Downsizing Porphyrin Covalent Organic Framework Particles Using Protected Precursors for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising electrocatalyst platforms owing to their designability, porosity, and stability. Recently, COFs with various chemical structures were developed as efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysts. However, controlling the morphology of COF catalysts remains a challenge, which can limit their electrocatalytic performance. Especially, while porphyrin COFs show promising catalytic properties, their particle size is mostly large and uncontrolled because of the severe aggregation of crystallites. In this work, we report a new synthetic methodology for rationally downsized COF catalyst particles, where a tritylated amine is employed as a novel protected precursor for COF synthesis. Trityl protection provides high solubility to a porphyrin precursor, while its deprotection proceeds in situ under typical COF synthesis conditions. Subsequent homogeneous nucleation and colloidal growth yield smaller COF particles than a conventional synthesis, owing to suppressed crystallite aggregation. The downsized COF particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction, with higher CO production rate and faradaic efficiency compared to conventional COF particles. The improved performance is attributed to the higher contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals particle size as an important factor for the evaluation of COF electrocatalysts and provides a strategy to control it.

         <title>Stabilizing Top Interface by Molecular Locking Strategy with Polydentate Chelating Biomaterials towards Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells in Ambient Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The instability of top interface induced by interfacial defects and residual tensile strain hinders the realization of long&#8208;term stable n&#8208;i&#8208;p regular perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, we report one molecular locking strategy to stabilize top interface by adopting polydentate ligand green biomaterial 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;D&#8208;erythro&#8208;pentafuranous&#8208;1&#8208;ulose&#8208;3,5&#8208;dibenzoate (DDPUD) to manipulate the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films. Both experimental and theoretical evidences collectively uncover that the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, halide vacancy and/or I&#8208;Pb anti&#8208;site defects can be effectively healed and locked by firm chemical anchoring on the surface of perovskite films. The ingenious polydentate ligand chelating is translated into reduced interfacial defects, increased carrier lifetimes, released interfacial stress and enhanced moisture resistance, which should be liable for strengthened top interface stability and inhibited interfacial nonradiative recombination. The universality of the molecular locking strategy is certified by employing different perovskite compositions. The DDPUD modification achieves an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 23.17% to 24.47%, which is one of the highest PCEs ever reported for the devices prepared in ambient air. The unsealed DDPUD&#8208;modified devices maintain 98.18% and 88.10%of their initial PCEs after more than 3000&#160;h under a relative humidity of 10&#8211;20% and after 1728&#160;h at 65&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Multi&#8208;functional Spirobifluorene Phosphonate Based Exciplex Interface Enables Voc Reaching 95% of Theoretical Limit for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown significant advancements in power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs has been limited by interfacial factors such as defect&#8208;induced recombination, energy band mismatch, and non&#8208;intimate interface contact. Here, an exciplex interface is first developed based on the strategically designed and synthesized two spirobifluorene phosphonate molecules to mitigate VOC loss in PSCs. The exciplex interface constructed by the intimate contact between the multi&#8208;functional molecules and hole transport layer, takes the roles to promote the hole extraction by donor&#8208;acceptor interaction, passivate coordination&#8208;unsaturated Pb2+ defects by equipped phosphonate groups, and optimize the energy level alignment. As a result, a record VOC of 1.26&#160;V with a perovskite bandgap of 1.61&#160;eV is achieved, representing over 95% of theoretical limit. This advancement has led to an increase in PCE from 21.29% to 24.12% and improved stability. The exciplex interface paves the way for addressing the long&#8208;standing challenge of VOC loss and promotes the wider application of PSCs.

         <title>Giant Blue Energy Harvesting in Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Membranes with Spatially Aligned Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Blue energy between seawater and river water is attracting increasing interest, as one of the sustainable and renewable energy resources that can be harvested from water. Within the reverse electrodialysis applied in blue energy conversion, novel membranes with nanoscale confinement that function as selective ion transport mediums are currently in high demand for realizing higher power density. The primary challenge lies in constructing well&#8208;defined nanochannels that allow for low&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier transport. In this work, we propose a concept for nanofluidic channels with a simultaneous dual electrostatic effect that can enhance both ion selectivity and flux. To actualize this, we have synthesized propidium iodide&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional polymer (PI&#8208;2DP) membranes possessing both skeleton charge and intrinsic space charge, which are spatially aligned along the ion transport pathway. The dual charge design of PI&#8208;2DP significantly enhances the electrostatic interaction between the translocating anions and the cationic polymer framework, and a high anion selectivity coefficient (&#8764;0.8) is reached. When mixing standard artificial seawater and river water, we achieve a considerable power density of 48.4&#160;W m&#8722;2, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanofluidic membranes. Moreover, when applied between the Mediterranean Sea and the Elbe River, an output power density of 42.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 is achieved by the PI&#8208;2DP. This nanofluidic membrane design with dual&#8208;layer charges will inspire more innovative development of ion&#8208;selective channels for blue energy conversion that will contribute to global energy consumption.

         <title>Catalytic Nanodots&#8208;Driven Pyroptosis Suppression in Nucleus Pulposus for Antioxidant Intervention of Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Low back pain resulting from intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a prevalent global concern; however, its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Single&#8208;cell sequencing analyses revealed the critical involvement of pyroptosis in IVDD. Considering the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the primary instigator of pyroptosis and lack of an efficient intervention approach, this study developed carbonized Mn&#8208;containing nanodots (MCDs) as ROS&#8208;scavenging catalytic biomaterials to suppress pyroptosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells to efficiently alleviate IVDD. Catalytic MCDs have superior efficacy in scavenging intracellular ROS and rescuing homeostasis in the NP microenvironment compared with N&#8208;acetylcysteine, a classical antioxidant. The data validates that pyroptosis plays a vital role in mediating the protective effects of catalytic MCDs against oxidative stress. Systematic in vivo assessments substantiate the effectiveness of MCDs in rescuing a puncture&#8208;induced IVDD rat model, further demonstrating their ability to suppress pyroptosis. This study highlights the potential of antioxidant catalytic nanomedicine as a pyroptosis inhibitor and mechanistically unveils an efficient strategy for the treatment of IVDD.

         <title>Mitocytosis Mediated by an Enzyme&#8208;activable Mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing Polymer&#8208;drug Conjugate Enhances Active Penetration in Glioblastoma Therapy</title>

Abstract
The application of nanomedicines for glioblastoma (GBM) therapy is hampered by the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and the dense glioblastoma tissue. To achieve efficient BBB crossing and deep GBM penetration, we demonstrated a strategy of active transcellular transport of a mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine, GBEPPT, in the GBM tissue through mitocytosis. GBEPPT was computer&#8208;aided designed and prepared by self&#8208;assembling a conjugate of an amphiphilic block polymer and a drug podophyllotoxin (PPT). When GBEPPT was delivered to the tumor site, overexpressed &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) on the brain&#8208;blood endothelial cell or the GBM cell triggered enzymatic hydrolysis of &#947;&#8208;glutamylamide on GBEPPT to reverse its charge. Positively&#8208;charged GBEPPT rapidly entered into the cell and targeted the mitochondria. These GBEPPT disturbed the homeostasis of mitochondria, inducing mitocytosis&#8208;mediated extracellular transport of GBEPPT to the neighboring cells via mitosomes. This intracellular&#8208;to&#8208;intercellular delivery cycle allowed GBEPPT to penetrate deeply into the GBM parenchyma, and exert sustainable action of PPT released from GBEPPT on the tumor cells along its penetration path at the tumor site, thus improving the anti&#8208;GBM effect. The process of mitocytosis mediated by the mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine may offer great potential in enhancing drug penetration through malignant tissues, especially poorly permeable solid tumors.

         <title>Ultrasound Imaging of Tumor Vascular CD93 with MMRN2 Modified Microbubbles for Immune Microenvironment Prediction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor endothelial expression of CD93 inversely correlates with the tumor vasculature normalization and immune activation. Ultrasound molecular imaging CD93 using targeted MBs armed with MMRN2, an endogenous ligand of CD93, provides a noninvasive and accurate strategy to evaluate the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and predict immunotherapy response.








Abstract
Vascular microenvironment is found to be closely related to immunotherapy efficacy. Identification and ultrasound imaging of the unique vascular characteristics, able to predict immune microenvironment, is important for immunotherapy decision&#8208;making. Herein, it is proved that high CD93 expression in the tumor vessels is closely related to the poor immune response of prostate cancer. For ultrasound molecular imaging of CD93, CD93&#8208;targeted microbubbles (MBs) consist a gaseous core and the MMRN2 (Multimerin&#8208;2) containing cell membrane (CM) /lipid hybrid membrane is then synthesized. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that these MBs can recognize CD93 efficiently and then accumulate within tumor regions highly expressing CD93. Contrast&#8208;enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging with CD93&#8208;targeted MBs demonstrates that targeted ultrasound intensity is negatively related to inflammatory tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Together, endothelial expression of CD93 in tumor is a unique predictor of immunosuppressive microenvironment and CD93&#8208;targeted MBs have a great potential to evaluate tumor immune status.

         <title>Development of Inverse&#8208;Opal&#8208;Structured Charge&#8208;Deficient Co9S8@nitrogen&#8208;Doped&#8208;Carbon to Catalytically Enable High Energy and High Power for the Two&#8208;Electron Transfer I+/I&#8722; Electrode</title>

         <dc:description>
An inverse&#8208;opal&#8208;structured cobalt sulfide@nitrogen&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon (Co9S8@NC) is developed as a catalytic host of the iodine electrode, specifically targeting improved reaction kinetics for the two&#8208;electron transfer cascade reaction. The inherent charge&#8208;deficient nature of Co9S8@NC effectively lowers the activation energy required for the conversion reaction and enhances the physicochemical adsorption of active iodine species, leading to superior electrochemical performance even at sub&#8208;zero temperatures.








Abstract
The iodine (I) electrode involving two&#8208;electron transfer chemistry by converting between I+ and I&#8722;, has the potential to deliver theoretically doubled capacity and higher working voltage platforms, thus achieving higher energy density. However, owing to the slow kinetics of the cascade two&#8208;electron transfer reactions, the system suffers from large overpotentials and low power density, especially at high working currents and low temperatures. Here, an inverse&#8208;opal&#8208;structured cobalt sulfide@nitrogen&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon (Co9S8@NC) catalyst with unique charge&#8208;deficient states is developed to promote the reaction kinetics of the I&#8722;/I+ electrode. The charge&#8208;deficient Co9S8@NC catalyst not only enables strong physicochemical adsorption with the iodine species but also significantly reduces the activation energy and interfacial charge transfer resistance of the cascade I+/I0/I&#8722; conversion reaction. Consequently, the prototypical Zn&#8214;I+/I0/I&#8722; battery equipped with the Co9S8@NC catalyst can deliver a high energy density of 554 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a stable cycle life of 5000 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, at a subzero temperature of &#8722;30 &#176;C, the battery can exhibit enhanced kinetics and a high power density of 1514 W kg&#8722;1, high energy density of 485 Wh kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Injectable Microgels with Hybrid Exosomes of Chondrocyte&#8208;Targeted FGF18 Gene&#8208;Editing and Self&#8208;Renewable Lubrication for Osteoarthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel injectable microgel system (CAP/++FGF18&#8208;hyEXO@HMs) is developed by employing chondrocyte&#8208;specific targeting hybrid exosomes loaded with a CRISPR&#8208;based FGF18&#8208;targeting gene&#8208;editing tool, encapsulated in methacrylic anhydride&#8208;modified hyaluronic hydrogel microspheres via microfluidics and photopolymerization to provide a cell&#8208;free Osteoarthritis (OA) treatment that combines the dual effects of chondrocyte&#8208;targeted in vivo gene activation of FGF18 and persistent lubrication in response to frictional wear.








Abstract
Abnormal silencing of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling significantly contributes to joint dysplasia and osteoarthritis (OA); However, the clinical translation of FGF18&#8208;based protein drugs is hindered by their short half&#8208;life, low delivery efficiency and the need for repeated articular injections. This study proposes a CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;based approach to effectively activate the FGF18 gene of OA chondrocytes at the genome level in vivo, using chondrocyte&#8208;affinity peptide (CAP) incorporated hybrid exosomes (CAP/FGF18&#8208;hyEXO) loaded with an FGF18&#8208;targeted gene&#8208;editing tool. Furthermore, CAP/FGF18&#8208;hyEXO are encapsulated in methacrylic anhydride&#8208;modified hyaluronic (HAMA) hydrogel microspheres via microfluidics and photopolymerization to create an injectable microgel system (CAP/FGF18&#8208;hyEXO@HMs) with self&#8208;renewable hydration layers to provide persistent lubrication in response to frictional wear. Together, the injectable CAP/FGF18&#8208;hyEXO@HMs, combined with in vivo FGF18 gene editing and continuous lubrication, have demonstrated their capacity to synergistically promote cartilage regeneration, decrease inflammation, and prevent ECM degradation both in vitro and in vivo, holding great potential for clinical translation.

         <title>The Unique Fe3Mo3N Structure Bestowed Efficient Fenton&#8208;Like Performance of the Iron&#8208;Based Catalysts: The Double Enhancement of Radicals and Nonradicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of the unique Fe3Mo3N structure not only ensures efficient Fe cycle in Fenton&#8208;like process, but also promotes the production of various reactive species, especially nonradical pathways (such as electron transport process and Fe(IV)). The system has made remarkable progress in catalytic activity, multireaction mechanism system, adaptability, and catalytic sustainability.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts are widely used in Fenton&#8208;like water pollution control technology due to their high efficiency, but their practical applications are limited by complex preparation conditions and strong blockage of Fe2+/Fe3+ cycle during the reaction. Here, a new iron&#8211;molybdenum bimetallic carbon&#8208;based catalyst is designed and synthesized using cellulose hydrogel for adsorption of Fe and Mo bimetals as a template, and the effective iron cycle in water treatment is realized. The integrated materials (Fe2.5Mo@CNs) with &#8220;catalytic/cocatalytic&#8221; performance have higher Fenton&#8208;like activation properties and universality than the equivalent quantity iron&#8211;carbon&#8208;based composite catalysts (Fe@CNs). Through the different characterization methods, experimental verifications and theoretical calculations show that the unique Fe3Mo3N structure promotes the adsorption of persulfate and reduces the energy barrier of the reaction, further completing the double enhancement of radicals (such as SO4&#183;&#8722;) and nonradicals (1O2 and electron transport process).

&lt;p&gt;The formation of the unique Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N structure not only ensures efficient Fe cycle in Fenton-like process, but also promotes the production of various reactive species, especially nonradical pathways (such as electron transport process and Fe(IV)). The system has made remarkable progress in catalytic activity, multireaction mechanism system, adaptability, and catalytic sustainability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron-based catalysts are widely used in Fenton-like water pollution control technology due to their high efficiency, but their practical applications are limited by complex preparation conditions and strong blockage of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; cycle during the reaction. Here, a new iron&#8211;molybdenum bimetallic carbon-based catalyst is designed and synthesized using cellulose hydrogel for adsorption of Fe and Mo bimetals as a template, and the effective iron cycle in water treatment is realized. The integrated materials (Fe&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;Mo@CNs) with &#8220;catalytic/cocatalytic&#8221; performance have higher Fenton-like activation properties and universality than the equivalent quantity iron&#8211;carbon-based composite catalysts (Fe@CNs). Through the different characterization methods, experimental verifications and theoretical calculations show that the unique Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N structure promotes the adsorption of persulfate and reduces the energy barrier of the reaction, further completing the double enhancement of radicals (such as SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and nonradicals (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and electron transport process). The integrated &#8220;catalytic/cocatalytic&#8221; combined material is expected to provide a new promotion strategy for Fenton-like water pollution control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Discovering a New Drug Against Acute Kidney Injury by Using a Tailored Photoacoustic Imaging Probe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the revelation of myeloperoxidase overexpression and redox imbalance of ClO&#8722;/GSH in acute kidney injury (AKI), a tailored photoacoustic (PA) probe is developed that enables real&#8208;time, noninvasive monitoring of AKI levels through PA imaging. Leveraging this probe, this work has established a drug screening approach and has discovered, for the first time, the therapeutic potential of astragalin in treating AKI.








Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has become an increasing concern for patients due to the widespread clinical use of nephrotoxic drugs. Currently, the early diagnosis of AKI is still challenging and the available therapeutic drugs cannot meet the clinical demand. Herein, this work has investigated the key redox couple involved in AKI and develops a tailored photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe (AB&#8208;DiOH) which can reversibly respond to hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;)/glutathione (GSH) with high specificity and sensitivity. This probe enables the real&#8208;time monitoring of AKI by noninvasive PA imaging, with better detection sensitivity than the blood test. Furthermore, this probe is utilized for screening nephroprotective drugs among natural products. For the first time, astragalin is discovered to be a potential new drug for the treatment of AKI. After oral administration, astragalin can be efficiently absorbed by the animal body, alleviate kidney injury, and meanwhile induce no damage to other normal tissues. The treatment mechanism of astragalin has also been revealed to be the simultaneous inhibition of oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and cuproposis. The developed PA imaging probe and the discovered drug candidate provide a promising new tool and strategy for the early diagnosis and effective treatment of AKI.

         <title>Enabling Self&#8208;Adaptive Water&#8208;Energy&#8208;Balance of Photothermal Water Diode Evaporator: Dynamically Maximizing Energy Utilization Under the Ever&#8208;Changing Sunlight</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal water diode (WD) evaporator concept by an integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic absorber is proposed to address the critical issue of low energy utilization. Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, the WD evaporator can bring dynamic management and self&#8208;regulation on water supply when encountering different suns, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization.








Abstract
Maintaining a match between input solar energy and required energy by water supply management is key to achieving efficient interfacial solar&#8208;driven evaporation (ISDE). In practice, the solar radiation flux is constantly changing throughout the day, so keeping a dynamic water&#8208;energy&#8208;balance of ISDE is a big challenge. Herein, a photothermal water diode (WD) evaporator concept is proposed by an integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic Janus absorber to overcome the issue. Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, a self&#8208;adaptive balance between photothermal energy input and water uptake is established, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization. The experimental and simulation results exhibit that with the increase of sunlight intensity, the water supply speed is significantly accelerated due to the dynamic management and self&#8208;regulation on water replenishment. Therefore, an excellent evaporation rate of up to 2.14&#160;kg&#160;m&#8211;2&#160;h&#8211;1 with a high efficiency of 93.7% under 1&#160;sun illumination is achieved. This water diode engineering with Janus wettability provides a novel strategy and extends the path for designing solar evaporation systems with diverse water supply properties, which shows great potential in different environmental conditions.

         <title>Soft&#8208;Hard Janus Nanoparticles Triggered Hierarchical Conductors with Large Stretchability, High Sensitivity, and Superior Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical conductor for decoupling the mechanical/electrical module is developed based on the soft&#8208;hard Janus nanoparticles (JNPs). Its mechanically stretchable layer can evenly disperse stress and dissipate energy, and a flexible conductive network layer can impede the crack propagation and achieve local reconstruction, giving the carbon&#8208;based sensor a wide strain range, high sensitivity, and excellent mechanical properties.








Abstract
There is a long&#8208;standing conflict between the large stretchability and high sensitivity for strain sensors, a strategy of decoupling the mechanical/electrical module by constructing the hierarchical conductor has been developed in this study. The hierarchical conductor, consisting of a mechanically stretchable layer, a conductive network layer, and a strongly bonded interface, can be produced in a simple one&#8208;step process with the aid of soft&#8208;hard Janus nanoparticles (JNPs). The introduction of JNPs in the stretchable layer can evenly distribute stress and dissipate energy due to forming the rigid&#8208;flexible homogeneous networks. Specifically, JNPs can drive graphene nanosheets (GNS) to fold or curl, creating the unique JNPs&#8208;GNS building block that can further construct the conductive network. Due to its excellent deformability to hinder crack propagation, the flexible conductive network could be stretched continuously and the local conductive pathways could be reconstructed. Consequently, the hierarchical conductor could detect both subtle strain of 0&#8722;2% and large strain of up to 370%, with a gauge factor (GF) from 66.37 to 971.70, demonstrating outstanding stretchability and sensitivity. And it also owns large tensile strength (5.28&#160;MPa) and high deformation stability. This hierarchical design will give graphene&#8208;based sensors a major boost in emerging applications.

         <title>Monolithic 2D Perovskites Enabled Artificial Photonic Synapses for Neuromorphic Vision Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new persistent photocurrent mechanism based on ion motion and ion&#8208;exciton coupling is proposed in two dimensional perovskites. The special charge carrier dynamics lead to the bio&#8208;plausible synaptic characteristics of the photodetectors. The light&#8208;tunable synaptic plasticity enables not only to realize image preprocessing, but also effectively recognizes target images by learning critical features.








Abstract
Neuromorphic visual sensors (NVS) based on photonic synapses hold a significant promise to emulate the human visual system. However, current photonic synapses rely on exquisite engineering of the complex heterogeneous interface to realize learning and memory functions, resulting in high fabrication cost, reduced reliability, high energy consumption and uncompact architecture, severely limiting the up&#8208;scaled manufacture, and on&#8208;chip integration. Here a photo&#8208;memory fundamental based on ion&#8208;exciton coupling is innovated to simplify synaptic structure and minimize energy consumption. Due to the intrinsic organic/inorganic interface within the crystal, the photodetector based on monolithic 2D perovskite exhibits a persistent photocurrent lasting about 90&#160;s, enabling versatile synaptic functions. The electrical power consumption per synaptic event is estimated to be&#8776;1.45&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;16&#160;J, one order of magnitude lower than that in a natural biological system. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept image preprocessing using the neuromorphic vision sensors enabled by photonic synapse demonstrates 4 times enhancement of classification accuracy. Furthermore, getting rid of the artificial neural network, an expectation&#8208;based thresholding model is put forward to mimic the human visual system for facial recognition. This conceptual device unveils a new mechanism to simplify synaptic structure, promising the transformation of the NVS and fostering the emergence of next generation neural networks.

The study presents phase and interface engineering to design piezoionic elastomers with integrated microphase&#8208;separated structures and an intermediate phase. It addresses the significant challenges associated with harmonizing the structural requirements for voltage generation, current conduction, and mechanical adaptability in piezoionic and piezoelectric materials, which are crucial for energy&#8208;harvesting ionotronics and human&#8211;machine interaction.








Abstract
Piezoionic materials play a pivotal role in energy&#8208;harvesting ionotronics. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing the structural requirements for voltage generation, current conduction, and mechanical adaptability. The conventional approach of employing crystalline heterostructures for stress concentration and localized charge separation, while effective for voltage generation, often compromises the stretchability and long&#8208;range charge transport found in homogeneous quasisolid states. Herein, phase and interface engineering strategy is introduced to address this dilemma and a piezoionic elastomer is presented that seamlessly integrates ionic liquids and ionic plastic crystals, forming a finely tuned microphase&#8208;separated structure with an intermediate phase. This approach promotes charge separation via stress concentration among hard phases while leveraging the high ionic charge mobility in soft and intermediate phases. Impressively, the elastomer achieves an extraordinary piezoionic coefficient of about 6.0&#160;mV kPa&#8722;1, a more than threefold improvement over current hydrogels and ionogels. The resulting power density of 1.3 &#181;W cm&#8722;3 sets a new benchmark, exceeding that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezoionic gels. Notably, this elastomer combines outstanding stretchability, remarkable toughness, and rapid self&#8208;healing capability, underscoring its potential for real&#8208;world applications. This work may represent a stride toward mechanically robust energy harvesting systems and provide insights into ionotronic systems for human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the factors that affect the stability of anodes and discusses the corresponding strategies for prolonging the anode lifetime, including designing catalytic materials, electrolyte optimization, and electrolyzer design. Furthermore, several methods for rapid stability assessment are proposed for the fast screening of both highly active and stable catalysts/electrodes.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production is a sustainable and economical approach that can mitigate the energy crisis and global warming issues. Although various catalysts/electrodes with excellent activities have been developed for high&#8208;efficiency seawater electrolysis, their unsatisfactory durability, especially for anodes, severely impedes their industrial applications. In this review, attention is paid to the factors that affect the stability of anodes and the corresponding strategies for designing catalytic materials to prolong the anode's lifetime. In addition, two important aspects&#8212;electrolyte optimization and electrolyzer design&#8212;with respect to anode stability improvement are summarized. Furthermore, several methods for rapid stability assessment are proposed for the fast screening of both highly active and stable catalysts/electrodes. Finally, perspectives on future investigations aimed at improving the stability of seawater electrolysis systems are outlined.

         <title>Triboelectric Energy Harvesting from Highly Conjugated Fused Aromatic Ladder Structure Under Extreme Environmental Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Practical application of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) has been challenging, particularly, under harsh environmental conditions. This work proposes a novel three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#8208;fused aromatic ladder (FAL) structure as a tribo&#8208;positive material for TENGs, to address these challenges. The 3D&#8208;FAL offers a unique materials engineering platform for tailored properties, such as high specific surface area and porosity, good thermal and mechanical stability, and tunable electronic properties. The fabricated 3D&#8208;FAL based TENG reached a maximum peak power density of 451.2 &#956;W cm&#8722;2 at 5 Hz frequency. More importantly, the 3D&#8208;FAL based TENG maintained stable output performance under harsh operating environments, over wide temperature (&#8722;45 to 100&#176;C) and humidity ranges (8.3 to 96.7% RH), representing the development of novel FAL for sustainable energy generation under challenging environmental conditions. Furthermore, the 3D&#8208;FAL based TENG proved to be a promising device for a speed monitoring system engaging reconstruction in virtual reality in snowy environment.

         <title>Self&#8208;Disassembling and Oxygen&#8208;Generating Porphyrin&#8208;Lipoprotein Nanoparticle for Targeted Glioblastoma Resection and Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The dismal prognosis for glioblastoma multiform (GBM) patients is primarily attributed to the highly invasive tumor residual that remained after surgical intervention. The development of precise intraoperative imaging and postoperative residual removal techniques will facilitate the gross total elimination of GBM. Here, we developed a self&#8208;disassembling porphyrin lipoprotein&#8208;coated calcium peroxide nanoparticles (PLCNP) to target GBM via macropinocytosis, allowing for fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery of GBM and improving photodynamic treatment (PDT) of GBM residual by alleviating hypoxia. By reducing self&#8208;quenching and enhancing lysosome escape efficiency, the incorporation of calcium peroxide (CaO2) cores in PLCNP amplified the fluorescence intensity of porphyrin&#8208;lipid. Furthermore, the CaO2 core has diminished tumor hypoxia and improved the PDT efficacy of PLCNP, enabling low&#8208;dose PDT and reversing tumor progression induced by hypoxia aggravation following PDT. Taken together, this self&#8208;disassembling and oxygen&#8208;generating porphyrin&#8208;lipoprotein nanoparticle may serve as a promising all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanotheranostic platform for guiding precise GBM excision and empowering post&#8208;operative PDT, providing a clinically applicable strategy to combat GBM in a safe and effective manner.

The utilization of a microstructural&#8208;informed thermodynamic model enables the creation of pseudoelastic Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni shape&#8208;memory alloys with enhanced reversibility. The feasibility of the proposed alloy&#8208;design strategy is proven by complementary spherical nanoindentation and in situ compression tests. The innovative computational&#8208;thermodynamics approach allows a direct composition design for improved functional properties, marking a substantial advance in shape&#8208;memory alloy research.








Abstract
A microstructural informed thermodynamic model is utilized to tailor the pseudoelastic performance of a series of Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni shape&#8208;memory alloys. Following this approach, the influence of the stability and the amount of the B2&#8208;ordered precipitates on the stability of the austenitic state and the pseudoelastic response is revealed. This is assessed by a combination of complementary nanoindentation measurements and incremental&#8208;strain tests under compressive loading. Based on these investigations, the applicability of the proposed models for the prediction of shape&#8208;memory capabilities of Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni alloys is confirmed. Eventually, these thermodynamic considerations enable the guided enhancement of functional properties in this alloy system through the direct design of alloy compositions. The procedure proposed renders a significant advancement in the field of shape&#8208;memory alloys.

         <title>Maximizing Triboelectric Nanogenerators by Physics&#8208;Informed AI Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing triboelectric nanogenerators with specific output remains a challenge mainly due to the uncertainties associated with their complex designs. This paper provides insights into the current challenges of designing and optimizing triboelectric nanogenerators and presents physics&#8208;informed artificial intelligence inverse design strategies to tackle these challenges. The potential of physics&#8208;informed inverse design to propel triboelectric nanogenerators to intelligent systems is discussed.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators offer an environmentally friendly approach to harvesting energy from mechanical excitations. This capability has made them widely sought&#8208;after as an efficient, renewable, and sustainable energy source, with the potential to decrease reliance on traditional fossil fuels. However, developing triboelectric nanogenerators with specific output remains a challenge mainly due to the uncertainties associated with their complex designs for real&#8208;life applications. Artificial intelligence&#8208;enabled inverse design is a powerful tool to realize performance&#8208;oriented triboelectric nanogenerators. This is an emerging scientific direction that can address the concerns about the design and optimization of triboelectric nanogenerators leading to a next generation nanogenerator systems. This perspective paper aims at reviewing the principal analysis of triboelectricity, summarizing the current challenges of designing and optimizing triboelectric nanogenerators, and highlighting the physics&#8208;informed inverse design strategies to develop triboelectric nanogenerators.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triboelectric nanogenerators offer an environmentally friendly approach to harvesting energy from mechanical excitations. This capability has made them widely sought-after as an efficient, renewable, and sustainable energy source, with the potential to decrease reliance on traditional fossil fuels. However, developing triboelectric nanogenerators with specific output remains a challenge mainly due to the uncertainties associated with their complex designs for real-life applications. Artificial intelligence-enabled inverse design is a powerful tool to realize performance-oriented triboelectric nanogenerators. This is an emerging scientific direction that can address the concerns about the design and optimization of triboelectric nanogenerators leading to a next generation nanogenerator systems. This perspective paper aims at reviewing the principal analysis of triboelectricity, summarizing the current challenges of designing and optimizing triboelectric nanogenerators, and highlighting the physics-informed inverse design strategies to develop triboelectric nanogenerators. Strategic inverse design is particularly discussed in the contexts of expanding the four-mode analytical models by physics-informed artificial intelligence, discovering new conductive and dielectric materials, and optimizing contact interfaces. Various potential development levels of artificial intelligence-enhanced triboelectric nanogenerators are delineated. Finally, the potential of physics-informed artificial intelligence inverse design to propel triboelectric nanogenerators from prototypes to multifunctional intelligent systems for real-life applications is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Mesoscopic 3D Tumor Models with a Self&#8208;Organizing Vascularized Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D bioprinting and bioengineering approaches are combined to cultivate 3D vascularized tumors, including patient&#8208;derived ones, at the mesoscopic scale. Functional connections between self&#8208;evolved vascular networks and bioprinted endothelium enable the spontaneous migration of cancer cells from tumor spheroids to the fluid flow. This work opens new avenues for exploring the metastatic cascade in vitro at physiologically relevant spatial and temporal scales.








Abstract
Advanced in vitro systems such as multicellular spheroids and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices have been developed, but often fall short in reproducing the tissue scale and self&#8208;organization of human diseases. A bioprinted artificial tumor model is introduced with endothelial and stromal cells self&#8208;organizing into perfusable and functional vascular structures. This model uses 3D hydrogel matrices to embed multicellular tumor spheroids, allowing them to grow to mesoscopic scales and to interact with endothelial cells. It is shown that angiogenic multicellular tumor spheroids promote the growth of a vascular network, which in turn further enhances the growth of cocultivated tumor spheroids. The self&#8208;developed vascular structure infiltrates the tumor spheroids, forms functional connections with the bioprinted endothelium, and can be perfused by erythrocytes and polystyrene microspheres. Moreover, cancer cells migrate spontaneously from the tumor spheroid through the self&#8208;assembled vascular network into the fluid flow. Additionally, tumor type specific characteristics of desmoplasia, angiogenesis, and metastatic propensity are preserved between patient&#8208;derived samples and tumors derived from this same material growing in the bioreactors. Overall, this modular approach opens up new avenues for studying tumor pathophysiology and cellular interactions in vitro, providing a platform for advanced drug testing while reducing the need for in vivo experimentation.

         <title>Highly Robust Conductive Organo&#8208;Hydrogels with Powerful Sensing Capabilities Under Large Mechanical Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly robust conductive organo&#8208;hydrogels are fabricated via self&#8208;assembly assisted stretch training. The fabricated conductive organo&#8208;hydrogels exhibit remarkable strength and toughness, as well as impressive sensitivity even when subjected to significant stress. This study addresses the mechanical limitations of traditional conductive hydrogels, making them suitable for facing the practical complex conditions in motion monitoring of strenuous activities and the soft robotics.








Abstract
The low mechanical strength of conductive hydrogels (&lt;1&#160;MPa) has been a significant hurdle in their practical application, as they are prone to fracturing under complex conditions, limiting their effectiveness. Here, this work fabricates a strong and tough conductive hierarchical poly(vinyl alcohol) (PEDOT:PSS/PVA) organo&#8208;hydrogel (PPS organo&#8208;hydrogel) via a facile combining strategy of self&#8208;assembly and stretch training. With PVA/PEDOT:PSS microlayers and aligned PVA/PEDOT:PSS nanofibers, PVA and PEDOT:PSS nanocrystalline domains, and semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer networks, PPS organo&#8208;hydrogels display outstanding mechanical performances (strength: 54.8&#160;MPa, toughness: 153.97&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). Additionally, PPS organo&#8208;hydrogels also exhibit powerful sensing capabilities (gauge factor (GF): 983) due to the aligned hierarchical structures and organic liquid phase of DMSO. Notably, with the synergy of such mechanical and sensing properties, organo&#8208;hydrogels can even detect objects as light as 1 gram, despite bearing a tensile strength of &#8776;23&#160;MPa. By incorporating these materials into human&#8208;machine interfaces, such as controlling artificial arms for grabbing objects and monitoring sport behaviors in soccer training, this work has unlocked a new realm of possibilities for these high&#8208;performance hierarchical organo&#8208;hydrogels. This approach to designing hierarchical structures has the potential to lead to even more high&#8208;performance hydrogels in the future.

         <title>High Thermoelectric Power Factors in Plastic/Ductile Bulk SnSe2&#8208;Based Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a power factor of 18.0 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 in plastic/ductile bulk SnSe2&#8208;based crystals is reported. The origin of such high power factor is from the modulation of material's stacking forms and polymorph crystal structures via simultaneously doping Cl/Br at Se&#8208;site and intercalating Cu inside the van der Waals gap, which significantly enhances the carrier concentration and mobility.








Abstract
The recently discovered plastic/ductile inorganic thermoelectric (TE) materials open a new avenue for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiently flexible TE devices, which can utilize the small temperature difference between human body and environment to generate electricity. However, the maximum power factor (PF) of current plastic/ductile TE materials is usually around or less than 10 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, much lower than the classic brittle TE materials. In this work, a record&#8208;high PF of 18.0 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 375 K in plastic/ductile bulk SnSe2&#8208;based crystals is reported, superior to all the plastic inorganic TE materials and flexible organic TE materials reported before. The origin of such high PF is from the modulation of material's stacking forms and polymorph crystal structures via simultaneously doping Cl/Br at Se&#8208;site and intercalating Cu inside the van der Waals gap, leading to the significantly enhanced carrier concentrations and mobilities. An in&#8208;plane fully flexible TE device made of the plastic/ductile SnSe2&#8208;based crystals is successfully developed to show a record&#8208;high normalized maximum power density to 0.18&#160;W m&#8722;1 under a temperature difference of 30 K. This work indicates that the plastic/ductile material can realize high TE power factor to achieve large output electric power density in flexible TE technology.

         <title>Engineering Clinically Relevant Probiotics with Switchable &#8220;Nano&#8208;Promoter&#8221; and &#8220;Nano&#8208;Effector&#8221; for Precision Tumor Therapy</title>

Dynamic regulation of the metabolism of probiotics for precise colorectal cancer therapy by using inducible artificial enzymes as switchable &#8220;nano&#8208;promoter&#8221; to upregulate the expression of acidic metabolites in probiotics and &#8220;nano&#8208;effector&#8221; to produce a great deal of lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) to combat the tumors.








Abstract
Probiotics have the potential as biotherapeutic agents for cancer management in preclinical models and human trials by secreting antineoplastic or immunoregulatory agents in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, current probiotics lack the ability to dynamically respond to unique TME characteristics, leading to limited therapeutic accuracy and efficacy. Although progress has been made in customizing controllable probiotics through synthetic biology, the engineering process is complex and the predictability of production is relatively low. To address this, here, for the first time, this work adopts pH&#8208;dependent peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) artificial enzymes as both an inducible &#8220;nano&#8208;promoter&#8221; and &#8220;nano&#8208;effector&#8221; to engineer clinically relevant probiotics to achieve switchable control of probiotic therapy. The nanozyme initially serves as an inducible &#8220;nano&#8208;promoter,&#8221; generating trace amounts of nonlethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress to upregulate acidic metabolites in probiotics. Once metabolites acidify the TME to a threshold, the nanozyme switches to a &#8220;nano&#8208;effector,&#8221; producing a great deal of lethal ROS to fight cancer. This approach shows promise in subcutaneous, orthotopic, and colitis&#8208;associated colorectal cancer tumors, offering a new methodology for modulating probiotic metabolism in a pathological environment.

Although progress has been made in customizing controllable probiotics through synthetic biology, the engineering process is complex and the predictability of production is relatively low. To address this, here, for the first time, this work adopts pH-dependent peroxidase-like (POD-like) artificial enzymes as both an inducible &#8220;nano-promoter&#8221; and &#8220;nano-effector&#8221; to engineer clinically relevant probiotics to achieve switchable control of probiotic therapy. The nanozyme initially serves as an inducible &#8220;nano-promoter,&#8221; generating trace amounts of nonlethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress to upregulate acidic metabolites in probiotics. Once metabolites acidify the TME to a threshold, the nanozyme switches to a &#8220;nano-effector,&#8221; producing a great deal of lethal ROS to fight cancer. This approach shows promise in subcutaneous, orthotopic, and colitis-associated colorectal cancer tumors, offering a new methodology for modulating probiotic metabolism in a pathological environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Highly&#8208;Efficient Boron Interstitially Inserted Ru Anode Catalyst for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron interstitially inserted Ru catalyst (B&#8208;Ru/C) is synthesized and used as an anode catalyst for anion exchange membrane fuel cell, achieving a peak power density of 1.37&#160;W cm&#8722;2. Moreover, an inflection point behavior in the pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics on B&#8208;Ru is observed, showing an anomalous behavior that the HOR activity under alkaline electrolyte surpasses acidic electrolyte.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is crucial for the commercialization of anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, boron interstitially inserted ruthenium (B&#8208;Ru/C) is synthesized and used as an anode catalyst for AEMFC, achieving a peak power density of 1.37&#160;W cm&#8722;2, close to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial PtRu catalyst. Unexpectedly, instead of the monotonous decline of HOR kinetics with pH as generally believed, an inflection point behavior in the pH&#8208;dependent HOR kinetics on B&#8208;Ru/C is observed, showing an anomalous behavior that the HOR activity under alkaline electrolyte surpasses acidic electrolyte. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal that the upshifted d&#8208;band center of Ru after the intervention of interstitial boron can lead to enhanced adsorption ability of OH and H2O, which together with the reduced energy barrier of water formation, contributes to the outstanding alkaline HOR performance with a mass activity of 1.716&#160;mA &#181;gPGM&#8722;1, which is 13.4&#8208;fold and 5.2&#8208;fold higher than that of Ru/C and commercial Pt/C, respectively.

         <title>Indoor Self&#8208;Powered Perovskite Optoelectronics with Ultraflexible Monochromatic Light Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultraflexible self&#8208;powered perovskite sensors are developed by integrating high&#8208;performance solar cells and monochromatic light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). These ultraflexible perovskite solar cell modules power ultraflexible perovskite nanocrystal LEDs (PNC&#8208;LEDs) even with the indoor light, with excellent power&#8208;conversion and current efficiencies of 18.2% and 15.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, respectively. The narrowband electroluminescence (EL) of PNC&#8208;LED eliminates Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) interference, resulting selective photo&#8208;plethysmography with a signal selectivity of 98.2%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;powered skin optoelectronics fabricated on ultrathin polymer films is emerging as one of the most promising components for the next&#8208;generation Internet of Things (IoT) technology. However, a longstanding challenge is the device underperformance owing to the low process temperature of polymer substrates. In addition, broadband electroluminescence (EL) based on organic or polymer semiconductors inevitably suffers from periodic spectral distortion due to Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) interference upon substrate bending, preventing advanced applications. Here, ultraflexible skin optoelectronics integrating high&#8208;performance solar cells and monochromatic light&#8208;emitting diodes using solution&#8208;processed perovskite semiconductors is presented. n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells and perovskite nanocrystal light&#8208;emitting diodes (PNC&#8208;LEDs), with power&#8208;conversion and current efficiencies of 18.2% and 15.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, respectively, are demonstrated on ultrathin polymer substrates with high thermal stability, which is a record&#8208;high efficiency for ultraflexible perovskite solar cell. The narrowband EL with a full width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm successfully eliminates FP interference, yielding bending&#8208;insensitive spectra even under 50% of mechanical compression. Photo&#8208;plethysmography using the skin optoelectronic device demonstrates a signal selectivity of 98.2% at 87&#160;bpm pulse. The results presented here pave the way to inexpensive and high&#8208;performance ultrathin optoelectronics for self&#8208;powered applications such as wearable displays and indoor IoT sensors.

         <title>Reversible Ultrafast Chiroptical Responses in Planar Plasmonic Nano&#8208;Oligomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a comprehensive analysis of ultrafast chiroptical responses in planar plasmonic nano&#8208;oligomers with facile reversibility. The polarimetric measurements demonstrate the transient helicity&#8208;resolved optical transitions in chiral nanoplasmonics in an all&#8208;optical setting, providing a framework for future applications of ultrafast switching and optical logic circuits in nanophotonics and quantum optics.








Abstract
Ultracompact chiral plasmonic nanostructures with unique chiral light&#8211;matter interactions are vital for future photonic technologies. However, previous studies are limited to reporting their steady&#8208;state performance, presenting a fundamental obstacle to the development of high&#8208;speed optical devices with polarization sensitivity. Here, a comprehensive analysis of ultrafast chiroptical response of chiral gold nano&#8208;oligomers using time&#8208;resolved polarimetric measurements is provided. Significant differences are observed in terms of the absorption intensity, thus hot electron generation, and hot carrier decay time upon polarized photopumping, which are explained by a phenomenological model of the helicity&#8208;resolved optical transitions. Moreover, the chiroptical signal is switchable by reversing the direction of the pump pulse, demonstrating the versatile modulation of polarization selection in a single device. The results offer fundamental insights into the helicity&#8208;resolved optical transitions in photoexcited chiral plasmonics and can facilitate the development of high&#8208;speed polarization&#8208;sensitive flat optics with potential applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics.

         <title>p&#8208;Phenylenediamine&#8208;Bridged Binder&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Unified Supramolecules for Versatile Lithium Secondary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binder&#8208;electrolyte integrated solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) system exploiting a new synergistic ionic conduction mechanism through supramolecular bridging with p&#8208;phenylenediamine molecules is proposed. As such, the contact issue in SSBs can be minimized, enabling the implementation of high loading SSB systems. These achievements are expected to provide a strong foundation for the development of SSB systems with exceptional energy density.








Abstract
The binder is an essential component in determining the structural integrity and ionic conductivity of Li&#8208;ion battery electrodes. However, conventional binders are not sufficiently conductive and durable to be used with solid&#8208;state electrolytes. In this study, a novel system is proposed for a Li secondary battery that combines the electrolyte and binder into a unified structure, which is achieved by employing para&#8208;phenylenediamine (pPD) moiety to create supramolecular bridges between the parent binders. Due to a partial crosslinking effect and charge&#8208;transferring structure of pPD, the proposed strategy improves both the ionic conductivity and mechanical properties by a factor of 6.4 (achieving a conductivity of 3.73 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 for poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;pPD) and 4.4 (reaching a mechanical strength of 151.4&#160;kPa for poly(acrylic acid)&#8208;pPD) compared to those of conventional parent binders. As a result, when the supramolecules of pPD are used as a binder in a pouch cell with a lean electrolyte loading of 2&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1, a capacity retention of 80.2% is achieved even after 300 cycles. Furthermore, when it is utilized as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte, an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% and capacity retention of 98.7% are attained under operations at 50&#160;&#176;C without external pressure or a pre&#8208;aging process.

         <title>Scalable Photochromic Film for Solar Heat and Daylight Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochromic (PC) film that simultaneously regulates solar heat and visible light entrance is introduced. On a sunny day, the film tints and blocks sunlight, which reduces energy consumption for cooling and&#160;preventing excessive brightness and glare. With weak sunlight intensity, the photochromic film becomes transparent to let sunlight enter the room, which prevents additional heating and lighting energy use.








Abstract
The adaptive control of sunlight through photochromic smart windows could have a huge impact on the energy efficiency and daylight comfort in buildings. However, the fabrication of inorganic nanoparticle and polymer composite photochromic films with a high contrast ratio and high transparency/low haze remains a challenge. Here, a solution method is presented for the in situ growth of copper&#8208;doped tungsten trioxide nanoparticles in polymethyl methacrylate, which allows a low&#8208;cost preparation of photochromic films with a high luminous&#160;transparency (luminous transmittance Tlum = 91%) and scalability (30 &#215; 350 cm2). High modulation of visible light (&#916;Tlum = 73%) and solar heat (modulation of solar transmittance &#916;Tsol = 73%, modulation of solar heat gain coefficient &#916;SHGC = 0.5) of the film improves the indoor daylight comfort and energy efficiency. Simulation results show that low&#8208;e windows with the photochromic film applied can greatly enhance the energy efficiency and daylight comfort. This photochromic film presents an attractive strategy for achieving more energy&#8208;efficient buildings and carbon neutrality to combat global climate change.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Current 10 nm Spin Hall Nano&#8208;Oscillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin Hall nano&#8208;oscillators as narrow as 10 nm, with auto&#8208;oscillation threshold currents below 30 &#956;$\umu$A, are experimentally demonstrated and studied using electrical microwave measurements and optical micro&#8208;Brillouin light scattering microscopy. The current shunting issue through the Si substrate is successfully addressed using different insulating seed layers, with ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 showing the best performance and SiO2 the worst.








Abstract
Nano&#8208;constriction based spin Hall nano&#8208;oscillators (SHNOs) are at the forefront of spintronics research for emerging technological applications, such as oscillator&#8208;based neuromorphic computing and Ising Machines. However, their miniaturization to the sub&#8208;50 nm width regime results in poor scaling of the threshold current. Here, it shows that current shunting through the Si substrate is the origin of this problem and studies how different seed layers can mitigate it. It finds that an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 seed layer and SiN (200 nm) coated p&#8208;Si substrates provide the best improvement, enabling us to scale down the SHNO width to a truly nanoscopic dimension of 10 nm, operating at threshold currents below 30 &#956;$\umu$A. In addition, the combination of electrical insulation and high thermal conductivity of the Al2O3 seed will offer the best conditions for large SHNO arrays, avoiding any significant temperature gradients within the array. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultra&#8208;low operational current SHNOs hence pave an energy&#8208;efficient route to scale oscillator&#8208;based computing to large dynamical neural networks of linear chains or 2D&#160;arrays.

         <title>Cascade Catalytic Nanoparticles Selectively Alkalize Cancerous Lysosomes to Suppress Cancer Progression and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade catalytic nanoparticle with high biocompatibility is reported, serving as a potent lysosomal alkalizer capable of converting excessive hydrogen peroxide and H+ into hydroxide ions only in cancerous lysosomes, leading to lysosomal alkalization and consequent suppression of tumor progression and metastasis.








Abstract
Lysosomes are critical in modulating the progression and metastasis for various cancers. There is currently an unmet need for lysosomal alkalizers that can selectively and safely alter the pH and inhibit the function of cancer lysosomes. Here an effective, selective, and safe lysosomal alkalizer is reported that can inhibit autophagy and suppress tumors in mice. The lysosomal alkalizer consists of an iron oxide core that generates hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) in the presence of excessive H+ and hydrogen peroxide inside cancer lysosomes and cerium oxide satellites that capture and convert &#8226;OH into hydroxide ions. Alkalized lysosomes, which display impaired enzyme activity and autophagy, lead to cancer cell apoptosis. It is shown that the alkalizer effectively inhibits both local and systemic tumor growth and metastasis in mice. This work demonstrates that the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles can be harnessed to build effective lysosomal alkalizers that are both selective and safe.

         <title>Spin Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by 2D Chiral Perovskite with Spin&#8208;Dependent Carrier Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin quantum dot light emitting diode emitting circularly polarized light is achieved by introducing chiral perovskite with chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. The spin polarized holes generated by the CISS effect of chiral perovskite recombine with correspondent electrons according to the optical selective rules and directly emit left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light.








Abstract
Chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect provides innovative approach to spintronics and quantum&#8208;based devices for chiral materials. Different from the conventional ferromagnetic devices, the application of CISS effect is potential to operate under room temperature and zero applied magnetic field. Low dimensional chiral perovskites by introducing chiral amines are beginning to show significant CISS effect for spin injection, but research on chiral perovskites is still in its infancy, especially on spin&#8208;light emitting diode (spin&#8208;LED) construction. Here, the spin&#8208;QLEDs enabled by 2D chiral perovskites as CISS layer for spin&#8208;dependent carrier injection and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) as light emitting layer are reported. The regulation pattern of the chirality and thickness of chiral perovskites, which affects the circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) emission of spin&#8208;QLED, is discovered. Notably, the spin injection polarization of 2D chiral perovskites is higher than 80% and the CP&#8208;EL asymmetric factor (gCP&#8208;EL) achieves up to 1.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. Consequently, this work opens up a new and effective approach for high&#8208;performance spin&#8208;LEDs.

         <title>Deep Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Metamaterials with Heat&#8208;Enhanced Thermal Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing parallels from nonlinear optics, artificial intelligence assists a configurable nonlinear thermal material whose effective thermal conductivity being responsive to its temperature gradient. Such deep learning&#8208;assisted nonlinear thermal material promotes two typical self&#8208;adaptive devices, which can perceive their environment deeply.

Heat management is crucial for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications such as passive radiative cooling, thermally adjustable wearables, and camouflage systems. Their adaptive versions, to cater to varied requirements, lean on the potential of adaptive metamaterials. Existing efforts, however, feature with highly anisotropic parameters, narrow working&#8208;temperature ranges, and the need for manual intervention, which remain long&#8208;term and tricky obstacles for the most advanced self&#8208;adaptive metamaterials. To surmount these barriers, heat&#8208;enhanced thermal diffusion metamaterials powered by deep learning is introduced. Such active metamaterials can automatically sense ambient temperatures and swiftly, as well as continuously, adjust their thermal functions with a high degree of tunability. They maintain robust thermal performance even when external thermal fields change direction, and both simulations and experiments demonstrate exceptional results. Furthermore, two metadevices with on&#8208;demand adaptability, performing distinctive features with isotropic materials, wide working temperatures, and spontaneous response are designed. This work offers a framework for the design of intelligent thermal diffusion metamaterials and can be expanded to other diffusion fields, adapting to increasingly complex and dynamic environments.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Mediated Recombination Dynamics in Perovskite&#8208;Based Memory Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes for Neuromorphic Control Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;pixel perovskite&#8208;organic tandem light&#8208;emitting diode capable of changing colors is demonstrated. The distinctive dual time constants (fast organic emission and slow perovskite emission) are analogous to a biological synapse. High dynamic range and color&#8208;switching capabilities in pulsed emission are used in neuromorphic computing to improve the efficiencies of applications that are conventionally memory&#8208;intensive.








Abstract
Neuromorphic devices can help perform memory&#8208;heavy tasks more efficiently due to the co&#8208;localization of memory and computing. In biological systems, fast dynamics are necessary for rapid communication, while slow dynamics aid in the amplification of signals over noise and regulatory processes such as adaptation&#8208; such dual dynamics are key for neuromorphic control systems. Halide perovskites exhibit much more complex phenomena than conventional semiconductors due to their coupled ionic, electronic, and optical properties which result in modulatable drift, diffusion of ions, carriers, and radiative recombination dynamics. This is exploited to engineer a dual&#8208;emitter tandem device with the requisite dual slow&#8208;fast dynamics. Here, a perovskite&#8208;organic tandem light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) capable of modulating its emission spectrum and intensity owing to the ion&#8208;mediated recombination zone modulation between the green&#8208;emitting quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layer and the red&#8208;emitting organic layer is introduced. Frequency&#8208;dependent response and high dynamic range memory of emission intensity and spectra in a LED are demonstrated. Utilizing the emissive read&#8208;out, image contrast enhancement as a neuromorphic pre&#8208;processing step to improve pattern recognition capabilities is illustrated. As proof of concept using the device's slow&#8208;fast dynamics, an inhibition of the return mechanism is physically emulated.

         <title>Air&#8208;Working Electrochromic Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes the first electrochemical artificial muscle that can realize color&#8208;changing and actuation dual responses in air, which effectively solves the problem of connection of the electrolyte with the active layer during the operation of independently operating electrochemically actuated devices in air by hot pouring of the rapidly cooling electrolyte layer.








Abstract
Artificial muscles are indispensable components for next&#8208;generation robotics to mimic the sophisticated movements of living systems and provide higher output energies when compared with real muscles. However, artificial muscles actuated by electrochemical ion injection have problems with single actuation properties and difficulties in stable operation in air. Here, air&#8208;working electrochromic artificial muscles (EAMs) with both color&#8208;changing and actuation functions are reported, which are constructed based on vanadium pentoxide nanowires and carbon tube yarn. Each EAM can generate a contractile stroke of &#8776;12% during stable operation in the air with multiple color changes (yellow&#8208;green&#8208;gray) under &#177;4&#160;V actuation voltages. The reflectance contrast is as high as 51%, demonstrating the excellent versatility of the EAMs. In addition, a torroidal EAM arrangement with fast response and high resilience is constructed. The EAM's contractile stroke can be displayed through visual color changes, which provides new ideas for future artificial muscle applications in soft robots and artificial limbs.

         <title>Nanoscale Chemical Diversity of Coke Deposits on Nanoprinted Metal Catalysts Visualized by Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coke formation is a prime cause of catalyst deactivation, where undesired carbon products block the catalytic active sites and impede further reaction. Herein, the nanofabrication of metal catalysts is synergized with advanced coke characterization via tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This approach reveals the chemical diversity of coke deposits at the nanoscale, opening novel routes for extending the catalyst's lifespan.








Abstract
Coke formation is the prime cause of catalyst deactivation, where undesired carbon wastes block the catalyst surface and hinder further reaction in a broad gamut of industrial chemical processes. Yet, the origins of coke formation and their distribution across the catalyst remain elusive, obstructing the design of coke&#8208;resistant catalysts. Here, the first&#8208;time application of tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is demonstrated as a nanoscale chemical probe to localize and identify coke deposits on a post&#8208;mortem metal nanocatalyst. Monitoring coke at the nanoscale circumvents bulk averaging and reveals the local nature of coke with unmatched detail. The nature of coke is chemically diverse and ranges from nanocrystalline graphite to disordered and polymeric coke, even on a single nanoscale location of a top&#8208;down nanoprinted SiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst. Surprisingly, not all Pt is an equal producer of coke, where clear isolated coke &#8220;hotspots&#8221; are present non&#8208;homogeneously on Pt which generate large amounts of disordered coke. After their formation, coke shifts to the support and undergoes long&#8208;range transport on the surrounding SiO2 surface, where it becomes more graphitic. The presented results provide novel guidelines to selectively free&#8208;up the coked metal surface at more mild rejuvenation conditions, thus securing the long&#8208;term catalyst stability.

         <title>Construct Robust Epitaxial Growth of (101) Textured Zinc Metal Anode for Long Life and High Capacity in Mild Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel (101) epitaxial growth model that enables robust epitaxial growth at high capacity is proposed here. Additionally, side reactions are effectively suppressed due to the low grain boundary area. The constructed texture zinc achieves excellent stability, which provides an effective and feasible approach for the protection and practical application of zinc metal.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries are considered to have the potential for energy storage due to their high safety and low cost. However, the practical applications of zinc batteries are limited by dendrite growth and side reactions. Epitaxial growth is considered an effective method for stabilizing Zn anode, especially for manipulating the (002) plane of deposited zinc. However, (002) texture zinc is difficult to achieve stable cycle at high capacity due to its large lattice distortion and uneven electric field distribution. Here, a novel zinc anode with highly (101) texture (denoted as (101)&#8208;Zn) is constructed. Due to unique directional guidance and strong bonding effect, (101)&#8208;Zn can achieve dense vertical electroepitaxy in near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. In addition, the low grain boundary area inhibits the occurrence of side reactions. The resultant (101)&#8208;Zn symmetric cells exhibit excellent stability over 5300 h (4 mA cm&#8722;2 for 2 mAh cm&#8722;2) and 330 h (15 mA cm&#8722;2 for 10 mAh cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the cycle life of Zn//MnO2 full cell is meaningfully improved over 1000 cycles.

         <title>Lowering the Temperature of Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells Using Triple&#8208;Doped Bismuth Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceptionally conductive and stable bismuth oxides are developed through the rational doping of isovalent and aliovalent elements for low&#8208;temperature applications. The triple&#8208;doped bismuth oxides are incorporated into composite oxygen electrodes and bilayer electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells, resulting in unprecedentedly high performance in both fuel cell and electrolysis cell modes.








Abstract
Despite the great potential of solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) as highly efficient energy conversion devices, the undesirable high operating temperature limits their wider applicability. Herein, a novel approach to developing high&#8208;performance low&#8208;temperature SOCs (LT&#8208;SOCs) is presented through the use of an Er, Y, and Zr triple&#8208;doped bismuth oxide (EYZB). This study demonstrates that EYZB exhibits &gt; 147 times higher ionic conductivity of 0.44 S cm&#8722;1 at 600 &#176;C compared to commercial Y&#8208;stabilized zirconia electrolyte with excellent stability over 1000&#160;h. By rationally incorporating EYZB in composite electrodes and bilayer electrolytes, the zirconia&#8208;based electrolyte LT&#8208;SOC achieves the unprecedentedly high performance of 3.45 and 2.02&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in the fuel cell mode and 2.08 and 0.95 A cm&#8722;2 in the electrolysis cell mode at 700 &#176;C and 600 &#176;C, respectively. Further, a distinctive microstructural feature of EYZB that largely extends triple phase boundary at the interface is revealed through digital twinning. This work provides insights for developing high&#8208;performance LT&#8208;SOCs.

         <title>Phosphorescent Carbene&#8208;Gold&#8208;Arylacetylide Materials as Emitters for Near UV&#8208;OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene&#8208;gold&#8208;acetylide (CMAc) complexes are bright deep&#8208;blue and green phosphorescent emitters with quantum yields up to 43% which also show UV prompt&#8208;fluorescence. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on CMAc emitters show near&#8208;UV electroluminescence with a device efficiency of 1% and a device lifetime LT50 up to 20&#160;min at practical brightness.








Abstract
A series of carbene&#8208;gold&#8208;acetylide complexes [(BiCAAC)AuCC]nC6H5&#8722;n (n = 1, Au1; n = 2, Au2; n = 3, Au3; BiCAAC = bicyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) have been synthesized in high yields. Compounds Au1&#8211;Au3 exhibit deep&#8208;blue to blue&#8208;green phosphorescence with good quantum yields up to 43% in all media. An increase of the (BiCAAC)Au moieties in gold complexes Au1&#8211;Au3 increases the extinction coefficients in the UV&#8211;vis spectra and stronger oscillator strength coefficients supported by theoretical calculations. The luminescence radiative rates decrease with an increase of the (BiCAAC)Au moieties. The time&#8208;dependent density functional theory study supports a charge&#8208;transfer nature of the phosphorescence due to the large (0.5&#8211;0.6&#160;eV) energy gap between singlet excited (S1) and triplet excited (T1) states. Transient luminescence study reveals the presence of both nonstructured UV prompt&#8208;fluorescence and vibronically resolved long&#8208;lived phosphorescence 428&#160;nm. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) are fabricated by physical vapor deposition with 2,8&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphoryl)dibenzo[b,d]furan (PPF) as a host material with complex Au1. The near&#8208;UV electroluminescence is observed at 405&#160;nm with device efficiency of 1% while demonstrating OLED device lifetime LT50 up to 20&#160;min at practical brightness of 10 nits, indicating a highly promising class of materials to develop stable UV&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>A Data&#8208;Driven Approach to Molten Salt Synthesis of N&#8208;Rich Carbon Adsorbents for Selective CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of experiments and response surface methodology applied to molten salt synthesis enable inverse design of N&#8208;rich nanoporous carbons for selective CO2 adsorption. Mapping the phase space of accessible N&#8208;rich turbostratic carbons reveals that a combination of moderate porosity with tuned interlayer d&#8208;spacing enables highly selective CO2 adsorption (even from dilute streams with only 4% CO2) due to molecular sieving.








Abstract
Applying a design of experiments methodology to the molten salt synthesis of nanoporous carbons enables inverse design and optimization of nitrogen (N)&#8208;rich carbon adsorbents with excellent CO2/N2 selectivity and appreciable CO2 capacity for carbon capture via swing adsorption from dilute gas mixtures such as natural gas combined cycle flue gas. This data&#8208;driven study reveals fundamental structure&#8208;function relationships between the synthesis conditions, physicochemical properties, and achievable selective adsorption performance of N&#8208;rich nanoporous carbons derived from molten salt synthesis for CO2 capture. Taking advantage of size&#8208;sieving separation of CO2 (3.30 &#197;) from N2 (3.64 &#197;) within the turbostratic nanostructure of these N&#8208;rich carbons, while limiting deleterious N2 adsorption in a weaker adsorption site that harms selectivity, enables a large CO2 capacity (0.73&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 30.4&#160;Torr and 30 &#176;C) with noteworthy concurrent CO2/N2 selectivity as predicted by the ideal adsorbed solution theory&#160;(SIAST = 246) with an adsorbed phase purity of 91% from a simulated gas stream containing only 4% CO2. Optimized N&#8208;rich porous carbons, with good physicochemical stability, low cost, and moderate regeneration energy, can achieve performance for selective CO2 adsorption that competes with other classes of advanced porous materials such as chemisorbing zeolites and functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks.

         <title>Large Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoresistance in a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable high&#8208;spin donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymer provides large negative magnetoresistance (MR) at low temperatures and positive MR at room temperature that correlates with its electronic and spin structure. The performance of a simple, monolithic device exceeds other organic materials including those utilized in conjunction with ferromagnetic electrodes or complex device architectures. These materials open new opportunities for emerging spin&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
Open&#8208;shell conjugated polymers (CPs) offer new opportunities for the development of emerging technologies that utilize the spin degree of freedom. Their light&#8208;element composition, weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling, synthetic modularity, high chemical stability, and solution&#8208;processability offer attributes that are unavailable from other semiconducting materials. However, developing an understanding of how electronic structure correlates with emerging transport phenomena remains central to their application. Here, the first connections between molecular, electronic, and solid&#8208;state transport in a high&#8208;spin donor&#8211;acceptor CP, poly(4&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,5&#8208;didodecylbenzylidene)&#8208;4H&#8208;cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;[1,2,5]&#8208;thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinoxaline), are provided. At low temperatures (T &lt; 180 K), a giant negative magnetoresistance (MR) is achieved in a thin&#8208;film device with a value of &#8722;98% at 10 K, which surpasses the performance of all other organic materials. The thermal depopulation of the high&#8208;spin manifold and negative MR decrease as temperature increases and at T &gt; 180 K, the MR becomes positive with a relatively large MR of 13.5% at room temperature. Variable temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements demonstrate that modulation of both the sign and magnitude of the MR correlates with the electronic and spin structure of the CP. These results indicate that donor&#8211;acceptor CPs with open&#8208;shell and high&#8208;spin ground states offer new opportunities for emerging spin&#8208;based applications.

Here, the first connections between molecular, electronic, and solid-state transport in a high-spin donor&#8211;acceptor CP, poly(4-(4-(3,5-didodecylbenzylidene)-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-cyclopenta[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;:3,4-&lt;i&gt;b&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;]dithiophen-2-yl)-6,7-dimethyl-[1,2,5]-thiadiazolo[3,4-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;]quinoxaline), are provided. At low temperatures (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 180 K), a giant negative magnetoresistance (MR) is achieved in a thin-film device with a value of &#8722;98% at 10 K, which surpasses the performance of all other organic materials. The thermal depopulation of the high-spin manifold and negative MR decrease as temperature increases and at &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 180 K, the MR becomes positive with a relatively large MR of 13.5% at room temperature. Variable temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements demonstrate that modulation of both the sign and magnitude of the MR correlates with the electronic and spin structure of the CP. These results indicate that donor&#8211;acceptor CPs with open-shell and high-spin ground states offer new opportunities for emerging spin-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Amorphous Silicon Carbide for Nanomechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented amorphous silicon carbide (a&#8208;SiC) thin film exhibits the highest ultimate tensile strength recorded for any nanostructured amorphous material, surpassing 10 GPa. This study showcases the fabrication of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio a&#8208;SiC strings with quality factors exceeding 108, revealing significant potential for diverse high&#8208;performance applications, from nanomechanical sensors to space exploration, and offering newfound prospects for employing amorphous materials where strength and stability are crucial.








Abstract
For decades, mechanical resonators with high sensitivity have been realized using thin&#8208;film materials under high tensile loads. Although there are remarkable strides in achieving low&#8208;dissipation mechanical sensors by utilizing high tensile stress, the performance of even the best strategy is limited by the tensile fracture strength of the resonator materials. In this study, a wafer&#8208;scale amorphous thin film is uncovered, which has the highest ultimate tensile strength ever measured for a nanostructured amorphous material. This silicon carbide (SiC) material exhibits an ultimate tensile strength of over 10 GPa, reaching the regime reserved for strong crystalline materials and approaching levels experimentally shown in graphene nanoribbons. Amorphous SiC strings with high aspect ratios are fabricated, with mechanical modes exceeding quality factors 108 at room temperature, the highest value achieves among SiC resonators. These performances are demonstrated faithfully after characterizing the mechanical properties of the thin film using the resonance behaviors of free&#8208;standing resonators. This robust thin&#8208;film material has significant potential for applications in nanomechanical sensors, solar cells, biological applications, space exploration, and other areas requiring strength and stability in dynamic environments. The findings of this study open up new possibilities for the use of amorphous thin&#8208;film materials in high&#8208;performance&#160;applications.

         <title>UV&#8208;Curing Assisted Direct Ink Writing of Dense, Crack&#8208;Free, and High&#8208;Performance Zirconia&#8208;Based Composites With Aligned Alumina Platelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid 3D printing by coupling UV&#8208;curing with direct ink writing is proposed to fabricate dense and crack&#8208;free ceramics. Non&#8208;reactive diluent relieves polymerization&#8208;induced stress, avoiding warpage and cracking, and facilitates de&#8208;binding. Benefiting from aligned platelets, this work highlights the possibilities of additively fabricating ceramics that are stronger than conventionally manufactured ceramics, along with the unprecedented potentials of locally tunable compositions.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) of high&#8208;performance structural ceramic components with comparative strength and toughness as conventionally manufactured ceramics remains challenging. Here, a UV&#8208;curing approach is integrated in direct ink writing (DIW), taking advantage from DIW to enable an easy use of high solid&#8208;loading pastes and multi&#8208;layered materials with compositional changes; while, avoiding drying problems. UV&#8208;curable opaque zirconia&#8208;based slurries with a solid loading of 51 vol% are developed to fabricate dense and crack&#8208;free alumina&#8208;toughened zirconia (ATZ) containing 3 wt% alumina platelets. Importantly, a non&#8208;reactive diluent is added to relieve polymerization&#8208;induced internal stresses, avoid subsequent warping and cracking, and facilitate the de&#8208;binding. For the first time, UV&#8208;curing assisted DIW&#8208;printed ceramic after sintering reveals even better mechanical properties than that processed by a conventional pressing. This is attributed to the aligned alumina platelets, enhancing crack deflection and improving the fracture toughness from 6.8 &#177; 0.3&#160;MPa m0.5 (compacted) to 7.4 &#177; 0.3&#160;MPa m0.5 (DIW). The four&#8208;point bending strength of the DIW ATZ (1009 &#177; 93&#160;MPa) is also higher than that of the conventionally manufactured equivalent (861 &#177; 68&#160;MPa). Besides homogeneous ceramic, laminate structures are demonstrated. This work provides a valuable hybrid approach to additively manufacture tough and strong ceramic components.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reconstruction of Highly Degraded LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 toward Stable Single&#8208;Crystalline Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple but effective LiOH&#8208;NaCl molten salt strategy is developed for recycling of highly degraded Ni&#8208;rich cathode (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) to performance&#8208;enhanced single&#8208;crystalline cathodes. The structural and chemical evolution during the recycling process is revealed. Meanwhile, this approach can also be successfully extended to recycle other cathode materials with varied Li and Ni compositions.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing demand for resources sustainability has promoted the recycle of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries to a strategic position. Direct recycle outperforms either hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical approaches due to the high added value and facile treatment processes. However, the traditional direct recycling technologies are only applicable for Ni&#8208;poor/middle cathodes. Herein, spent Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (S&#8208;NCM) to performance&#8208;enhanced single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials is directly recycled using a simple but effective LiOH&#8208;NaCl molten salt. The evolution process of the Li&#8208;supplement and grain&#8208;recrystallization during regeneration is systematically investigated, and the successful recovery of the highly degraded microstructure is comprehensively proven, including significant elimination of Ni2+ and O vacancies. Beneficial from the favorable reconstructed single&#8208;crystalline particles, the regenerated NCM (R&#8208;NCM) represents remarkably enhanced structural stability, electrochemical activity, O2 and cracks suppression during charge/discharge, thus achieving the excellent performances in long&#8208;term cycling and high&#8208;rate tests. As a result, R&#8208;NCM maintains the 86.5% reversible capacity at 1&#160;C after 200 cycles. Instructively, the present molten salt can be successfully applied for recycling spent NCMs with various Li and Ni compositions (e.g., LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2).

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Single&#8208;Nucleotide&#8208;Variation Detection Enabled by Argonaute&#8208;Mediated Transistor Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Argonaute&#8208;mediated transistor platform monitors single nucleotide variation (SNV) in &#8776;20 copies mL&#8722;1 microRNA, ctDNA, viral RNA, and cDNA samples and achieves the fastest SNV detection in 5&#160;min with comprehensive advantages of specificity, sensitivity, easy operation, portability, and generality, benefiting efficient disease prevention and control as well as point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnoses for timely, precise, and convenient healthcare.








Abstract
&#8220;Test&#8208;and&#8208;go&#8221; single&#8208;nucleotide variation (SNV) detection within several minutes remains challenging, especially in low&#8208;abundance samples, since existing methods face a trade&#8208;off between sensitivity and testing speed. Sensitive detection usually relies on complex and time&#8208;consuming nucleic acid amplification or sequencing. Here, a graphene field&#8208;effect transistor (GFET) platform mediated by Argonaute protein that enables rapid, sensitive, and specific SNV detection is developed. The Argonaute protein provides a nanoscale binding channel to preorganize the DNA probe, accelerating target binding and rapidly recognizing SNVs with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution in unamplified tumor&#8208;associated microRNA, circulating tumor DNA, virus RNA, and reverse transcribed cDNA when a mismatch occurs in the seed region. An integrated microchip simultaneously detects multiple SNVs in agreement with sequencing results within 5&#160;min, achieving the fastest SNV detection in a &#8220;test&#8208;and&#8208;go&#8221; manner without the requirement of nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification.

An integrated microchip simultaneously detects multiple SNVs in agreement with sequencing results within 5&#160;min, achieving the fastest SNV detection in a &#8220;test-and-go&#8221; manner without the requirement of nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>B&#8208;N Covalent Bond Embedded Double Hetero&#8208;[n]helicenes for Pure Red Narrowband Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence with High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the first pair of pure&#8208;red circularly polarized (CP) multiple resonance emitters is presented using a boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond to lower the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the boron atom, and devices possessing maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6% are constructed, circularly polarizing electroluminescence with dissymmetry factor of 1.91 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and a long operational lifetime of &gt; 400 h.








Abstract
Chiral B/N embedded multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters&#160;open a new paradigm of circularly polarized (CP) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their unique narrowband spectra. However, pure&#8208;red CP&#8208;MR emitters and devices remain exclusive in literature. Herein, by introducing a B&#8208;N covalent bond to lower the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the para&#8208;positioned B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B motif, the first&#160;pair of pure&#8208;red double hetero&#8208;[n]helicenes (n = 6 and 7) CP&#8208;MR emitter peaking 617&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 38&#160;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8776;100% in toluene is developed. The intense mirror&#8208;image CP light produced by the enantiomers is characterized by high photoluminescence dissymmetry factors (gPL) of +1.40/&#8722;1.41 &#215; 10&#8722;3 from their stable helicenes configuration. The corresponding devices using these enantiomers afford impressive CP electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +1.91/&#8722;1.77 &#215; 10&#8722;3, maximum external quantum efficiencies of 36.6%/34.4% and Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.67, 0.33), exactly satisfying the red&#8208;color requirement specified by National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. Notably a remarkable long LT95 (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of &#8776;400 h at an initial brightness of 10,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 is also observed for the same device, representing the most stable CP&#8208;OLED up to date.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Wide&#8208;Narrow Bandgap&#8208;Laminated Perovskite Photodetector with Bipolar Photoresponse for Secure Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bipolar photoresponse based on spontaneously formed wide&#8208;narrow bandgap&#8208;laminated perovskite films by BiI3&#160;doping is demonstrated. Under the visible/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, corresponding electrons are easier to be separated and transported by the SnO2/PC61BM to the bottom/top electrodes. Benefiting from the wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar response, the signal secure optical communication (SOC) system is realized based on hidden properties of the bipolar signals.








Abstract
Perovskite photodetectors with bipolar photoresponse characteristics are expected to be applied in the field of secure optical communication (SOC). However, how to realize the perovskite photodetector with bipolar response remains challenging. Herein, by introducing bismuth iodide (BiI3) into Sn&#8208;Pb mixed perovskite precursor solution, 2D perovskite FA3Bi2I9 is spontaneously formed at the bottom to realize a wide&#8208;narrow bandgap&#8208;laminated perovskite film. Wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar response is realized based on the absorption difference of the photoactive region with different bandgap combined with the carrier competition of the homotypic transport layer adopted in the as&#8208;fabricated photodetector. Under the visible/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, the bottom/top of the film generates a higher carrier concentration, where electrons are easier to be separated and transported by the SnO2/PC61BM to the bottom/top electrodes, respectively, resulting in a negative and positive bipolar response. Finally, based on positive NIR signal as the effective signal and negative visible signal as the interference signal, the SOC system is realized, where the positive NIR signal is well hidden by the negative visible signal. This work provides a simple and feasible strategy for fabrication of laminated perovskite films to achieve bipolar response.

         <title>Understanding the Heterointerfaces in Perovskite Solar Cells via Hole Selective Layer Surface Functionalization</title>

         <dc:description>
ODPA self&#8208;assembly monolayer (SAM) modifies HTL&#8208;Perovskite interface without altering crystallography. It highlights film and device quality improvements through interfacial defect reduction, followed by a detailed analysis of efficiency, stability, and charge carrier dynamics. Increased band&#8208;to&#8208;band recombination in photoluminescence and electroluminescence indicates enhanced effective photogenerated carrier density, supporting the use of phosphonic acid&#8208;based SAMs for surface passivation in perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play a pivotal role in determining device performance by influencing charge transport and recombination. Understanding the physical processes at these interfaces is essential for achieving high&#8208;power conversion efficiency in PSCs. Particularly, the interfaces involving oxide&#8208;based transport layers are susceptible to defects like dangling bonds, excess oxygen, or oxygen deficiency. To address this issue, the surface of NiOx is passivated using octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA), resulting in improved charge transport across the perovskite hole transport layer (HTL) interface. This surface treatment has led to the development of hysteresis&#8208;free devices with an impressive &#8776;13% increase in power conversion efficiency. Computational studies have explored the halide perovskite architecture of ODPA&#8208;treated HTL/Perovskite, aiming to unlock superior photovoltaic performance. The ODPA surface functionalization has demonstrated enhanced device performance, characterized by superior charge exchange capacity. Moreover, higher band&#8208;to&#8208;band recombination in photoluminescence and electroluminescence indicates presence of lower mid&#8208;gap energy states, thereby increasing the effective photogenerated carrier density. These findings are expected to promote the utilization of various phosphonic acid&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly monolayers for surface passivation of oxide&#8208;based transport layers in perovskite solar cells. Ultimately, this research contributes to the realization of efficient halide PSCs by harnessing the favorable architecture of NiOx interfaces.

         <title>Selective Interfacial Excited&#8208;State Carrier Dynamics and Efficient Charge Separation in Borophene&#8208;Based Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoexcited carrier dynamics are demonstrated in the heterostructures comprising borophene allotropes and MoS2 layers. The diverse borophenes exhibit distinct and selective carrier transfer behaviors with an ultrafast timescale, enabling efficient charge separation and opening doors to potential applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.








Abstract
Borophene&#8208;based van der Waals heterostructures have demonstrated enormous potential in the realm of optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, which has sparked a wide range of interest. However, a thorough understanding of the microscopic excited&#8208;state electronic dynamics at interfaces is lacking, which is essential for determining the macroscopic optoelectronic and photovoltaic performance of borophene&#8208;based devices. In this study, photoexcited carrier dynamics of &#946;12, &#967;3, and &#945;&#900; borophene/MoS2 heterostructures are systematically studied based on time&#8208;domain nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Different Schottky contacts are found in borophene/semiconductor heterostructures. The interplay between Schottky barriers, electronic coupling, and the involvement of different phonon modes collectively contribute to the unique carrier dynamics in borophene&#8208;based heterostructures. The diverse borophene allotropes within the heterostructures exhibit distinct and selective carrier transfer behaviors on an ultrafast timescale: electrons tunnel into &#945;&#900; borophene with an ultrafast transfer rate (&#8776;29&#160;fs) in &#945;&#900;/MoS2 heterostructures, whereas &#946;12 borophene only allows holes to migrate with a lifetime of 176&#160;fs. The feature enables efficient charge separation and offers promising avenues for applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. This study provides insight into the interfacial carrier dynamics in borophene&#8208;based heterostructures, which is helpful in further design of advanced 2D boron&#8208;based optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.

&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#900; borophene/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures are systematically studied based on time-domain nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Different Schottky contacts are found in borophene/semiconductor heterostructures. The interplay between Schottky barriers, electronic coupling, and the involvement of different phonon modes collectively contribute to the unique carrier dynamics in borophene-based heterostructures. The diverse borophene allotropes within the heterostructures exhibit distinct and selective carrier transfer behaviors on an ultrafast timescale: electrons tunnel into &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#900; borophene with an ultrafast transfer rate (&#8776;29&#160;fs) in &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#900;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures, whereas &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; borophene only allows holes to migrate with a lifetime of 176&#160;fs. The feature enables efficient charge separation and offers promising avenues for applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. This study provides insight into the interfacial carrier dynamics in borophene-based heterostructures, which is helpful in further design of advanced 2D boron-based optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Separator Enables High&#8208;Performance Sodium Metal Batteries in Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional separator is designed for sodium metal batteries (SMBs) with the carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. Thanks to abundant functional groups and solid mechanical strength, the separator can enable high&#8208;performance SMBs with reduced electrolyte volume. Besides, the lightweight, thinness, and high&#8208;utilization electrolyte properties of the separator can further increase mass and volumetric energy densities.








Abstract
Sodium metal has become one of the most promising anodes for next&#8208;generation cheap and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries; however, challenges caused by the uncontrollable sodium dendrite growth and fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) restrict their large&#8208;scale practical applications in low&#8208;cost and wide&#8208;voltage&#8208;window carbonate electrolytes. Herein, a novel multifunctional separator with lightweight and high thinness is proposed, assembled by the cobalt&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework nanowires (Co&#8208;NWS), to replace the widely applied thick and heavy glass fiber separator. Benefitting from its abundant sodiophilic functional groups and densely stacked nanowires, Co&#8208;NWS not only exhibits outstanding electrolyte wettability and effectively induces uniform Na+ ion flux as a strong ion redistributor but also favors constructing the robust N,F&#8208;rich SEI layer. Satisfactorily, with 10&#160;&#181;L carbonate electrolyte, a Na|Co&#8208;NWS|Cu half&#8208;cell delivers stable cycling (over 260 cycles) with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 98%, and the symmetric cell shows a long cycle life of more than 500&#160;h. Remarkably, the full cell shows a long&#8208;term life span (over 1500 cycles with 92% capacity retention) at high current density in the carbonate electrolyte. This work opens up a strategy for developing dendrite&#8208;free, low&#8208;cost, and long&#8208;life&#8208;span sodium metal batteries in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Activating Tumor&#8208;Selective Liquid Metal Nanomedicine through Galvanic Replacement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic anticancer bioactivity of liquid metal nanodroplets (&lt;30&#160;nm) can be activated via the galvanic replacement reaction with endogenous Cu2+ ions. This chemotherapy strategy, which leverages endogenous nutrients and features tumor&#8208;selective carrier&#8208;to&#8208;drug conversion, dual anticancer pathways (Ga3+ release and Cu2+ depletion), along with abundant reactive oxygen species generation, provides a new tool for synthesizing drugs in biological environments.








Abstract
Advanced chemotherapeutic strategies including prodrug and nanocatalytic medicine have significantly advanced tumor&#8208;selective theranostics, but delicate prodrug screening, tedious synthesis, low degradability/biocompatibility of inorganic components, and unsatisfied reaction activity complicate treatment efficacies. Here, the intrinsic anticancer bioactivity of liquid metal nanodroplets (LMNDs) is explored through galvanic replacement. By utilizing a mechano&#8208;degradable ligand, the resultant size of the aqueous LMND is unexpectedly controlled as small as &#8776;20&#160;nm (LMND20). It is demonstrated that LMND20 presents excellent tumor penetration and biocompatibility and activates tumor&#8208;selective carrier&#8208;to&#8208;drug conversion, synchronously depleting Cu2+ ions and producing Ga3+ ions through galvanic replacement. Together with abundant generation of reactive oxygen species, multiple anticancer pathways lead to selective apoptosis and anti&#8208;angiogenesis of breast cancer cells. Compared to the preclinical/clinical anticancer drugs of tetrathiomolybdate and Ga(NO3)3, LMND20 administration significantly improves the therapeutic efficacy and survival in a BCap&#8208;37 xenograft mouse model, yet without obvious side effects.

         <title>Complete Suppression of Phase Segregation in Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals under Periodic Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When mixed&#8208;halide CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals are periodically heated with a temperature change of &#8776;10&#160;&#176;C, the phase&#8208;segregation effect can be completely suppressed even under strong light illumination. The above finding marks the emergence of a practical solution to the detrimental phase&#8208;segregation problem, given that a small temperature modulation is readily available in various fundamental and practical studies of mixed&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals.








Abstract
Under continuous light illumination, it is known that localized domains with segregated halide compositions form in semiconducting mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, thus severely limiting their optoelectronic applications due to the negative changes in bandgap energies and charge&#8208;carrier characteristics. Here mixed&#8208;halide perovskite CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals are deposited onto an indium tin oxide substrate, whose temperature can be rapidly changed by &#8776;10&#160;&#176;C in a few seconds by applying or removing an external voltage. Such a sudden temperature change induces a temporary transition of CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals from the segregated phase to the mixed phase, the latter of which can be permanently maintained when the light illumination is coupled with periodic heating cycles. These findings mark the emergence of a practical solution to the detrimental phase&#8208;segregation problem, given that a small temperature modulation is readily available in various fundamental studies and practical devices of mixed&#8208;halide perovskites.

         <title>Sensitive and Selective Dual&#8208;Mode Responses to Reactive Oxygen Species by Chiral Manganese Dioxide Nanoparticles for Antiaging Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral MnO2 NPs are constructed for the quantitative analysis of ROS. The redox reaction between H2O2 and chiral MnO2 NPs lead to decreased signals on CD and T1&#8208;weighted images, thus achieving ultrasensitive and dual&#8208;mode detection of H2O2. Noticeably, in vivo data show that scavenging ROS inhibits skin oxidative damage and prevents skin aging.








Abstract
Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to oxidative stress and oxidative damage, which is one of the important factors for aging and age&#8208;related diseases. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring and the moderate elimination of ROS is extremely important. In this study, a ROS&#8208;responsive circular dichroic (CD) at 553&#160;nm and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dual&#8208;signals chiral manganese oxide (MnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) are designed and synthesized. Both the CD and MRI signals show excellent linear ranges for intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations, with limits of detection (LOD) of 0.0027&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.016&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The lower LOD achieved with CD detection may be attributable to its higher anti&#8208;interference capability from the intracellular matrix. Importantly, ROS&#8208;induced cell aging is intervened by chiral MnO2 NPs via redox reactions with excessive intracellular ROS. In vivo experiments confirm that chiral MnO2 NPs effectively eliminate ROS in skin tissue, reduce oxidative stress levels, and alleviate skin aging. This approach provides a new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of age&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Suppressing Buried Interface Nonradiative Recombination Losses Toward High&#8208;Efficiency Antimony Triselenide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, buried interface and heterojunction engineering are synergistically employed to regulate the film growth and optimize the band alignment. Thus, the interfacial trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination loss has been successfully minimized, and heterojunction band alignment has been optimized. Hence, the champion device presents a power conversion efficiency of 9.24%, representing the highest efficiency in sputtered&#8208;derived Sb2Se3 solar cells.








Abstract
Antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) has possessed excellent optoelectronic properties and has gained interest as a light&#8208;harvesting material for photovoltaic technology over the past several years. However, the severe interfacial and bulk recombination obviously contribute to significant carrier transport loss thus leading to the deterioration of power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, buried interface and heterojunction engineering are synergistically employed to regulate the film growth kinetic and optimize the band alignment. Through this approach, the orientation of the precursor films is successfully controlled, promoting the preferred orientational growth of the (hk1) of the Sb2Se3 films. Besides, interfacial trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination loss and heterojunction band alignment are successfully minimized and optimized. As a result, the champion device presents a PCE of 9.24% with short&#8208;circuit density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of 29.47&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 63.65%, respectively, representing the highest efficiency in sputtered&#8208;derived Sb2Se3 solar cells. This work provides an insightful prescription for fabricating high&#8208;quality Sb2Se3 thin film and enhancing the performance of Sb2Se3 solar cells.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Activatable Heterostructured Nanoadjuvant CoP/NiCoP Executing Lactate Metabolism Interventions for Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Therapy and Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;activated immunomodulatory nanoadjuvant based on the yolk&#8211;shell CoP/NiCoP heterostructure is developed to potentiate photoimmunotherapy through modulating lactic acid (LA) metabolism. Meanwhile, nanotherapeutic platform also has the potential for LA metabolic intervention to improve the effectiveness of Photocatalytic therapy and mild photothermal therapy, providing new insights into more advanced oncotherapy with optimal efficacy, precision, and safety.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser&#8208;induced photoimmunotherapy has aroused great interest due to its intrinsic noninvasiveness and spatiotemporal precision, while immune evasion evoked by lactic acid (LA) accumulation severely limits its clinical outcomes. Although several metabolic interventions have been devoted to ameliorate immunosuppression, intracellular residual LA still remains a potential energy source for oncocyte proliferation. Herein, an immunomodulatory nanoadjuvant based on a yolk&#8211;shell CoP/NiCoP (CNCP) heterostructure loaded with the monocarboxylate transporter 4 inhibitor fluvastatin sodium (Flu) is constructed to concurrently relieve immunosuppression and elicit robust antitumor immunity. Under NIR irradiation, CNCP heterojunctions exhibit superior photothermal performance and photocatalytic production of reactive oxygen species and hydrogen. The continuous heat then facilitates Flu release to restrain LA exudation from tumor cells, whereas cumulative LA can be depleted as a hole scavenger to improve photocatalytic efficiency. Subsequently, potentiated photocatalytic therapy can not only initiate systematic immunoreaction, but also provoke severe mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupt the energy supply for heat shock protein synthesis, in turn realizing mild photothermal therapy. Consequently, LA metabolic remodeling endows an intensive cascade treatment with an optimal safety profile to effectually suppress tumor proliferation and metastasis, which offers a new paradigm for the development of metabolism&#8208;regulated immunotherapy.

Functional electrolytes are prepared by employing the weak&#8208;solvation and low&#8208;viscosity isobutyronitrile as a cosolvents. The as&#8208;prepared electrolyte exhibits a sufficiently high conductivity (1.152 mS cm&#8722;1) at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, and enables the LiCoO2//graphite pouch cells to retain 68.7% of the room&#8208;temperature capacity at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C and present stable cycling performance at &#8722;40 and 60&#160;&#176;C. 








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) has always posed a significant challenge, limiting their wide application in cold environments. In this work, the high&#8208;performance LIBs working under ultralow&#8208;temperature conditions, which is achieved by employing the weak&#8208;solvation and low&#8208;viscosity isobutyronitrile as a cosolvent to tame the affinity between solvents and lithium ions, is reported. The as&#8208;prepared electrolytes exhibit a sufficiently high conductivity (1.152 mS cm&#8722;1) at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C. The electrolytes enable LiCoO2 cathode and graphite anode to achieve high Coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9% during long&#8208;term cycling at room temperature, and to respectively achieve 75.8% and 100.0% of their room&#8208;temperature capacities at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. Even the LiCoO2//graphite pouch cells can retain 68.7% of the room&#8208;temperature capacity when discharged at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, and present stable cycling performance at &#8722;40 and 60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a solution for the development of advanced electrolytes to enable LIBs working at wide&#8208;temperatures range.

         <title>Manipulating Vertical Phase Separation Enables Pseudoplanar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Over 19% Efficiency via Ternary Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary polymerization strategy is employed to manipulate the vertical phase separation in pseudoplanar heterojunction (PPHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). The terpolymer DL1, with enhanced solubility, partial edge&#8208;on orientation, and high crystallinity, endows DL1/Y6 PPHJ blend film with the optimized vertical phase separation. Therefore, DL1/Y6 based PPHJ OSCs afford an impressive PCE of 19.10%, which is the record for terpolymer donors.








Abstract
Controlling vertical phase separation of the active layer to enable efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport is crucial to boost power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of pseudoplanar heterojunction (PPHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). However, how to optimize the vertical phase separation of PPHJ OSCs via molecule design is rarely reported yet. Herein, ternary polymerization strategy is employed to develop a series of polymer donors, DL1&#8208;DL4, and regulate their solubility, molecular aggregation, molecular orientation, and miscibility, thus efficiently manipulating vertical phase separation in PPHJ OSCs. Among them, DL1 not only has enhanced solubility, inhibited molecular aggregation and partial edge&#8208;on orientation to facilitate acceptor molecules, Y6, to permeate into polymer layer and increase donor/acceptor interfaces, but also sustains high crystallinity and appropriate miscibility with Y6 to acquire ordered molecular packing, thus achieving optimized vertical phase separation to well juggle exciton dissociation and charge transport in PPHJ devices. Therefore, DL1/Y6 based PPHJ OSCs gain the best exciton dissociation probability, highest charge carrier mobilities and weakest charge recombination, and thus afford an impressive PCE of 19.10%, which is the record value for terpolymer donors. It demonstrates that ternary polymerization is an efficient method to optimize vertical phase separation in PPHJ OSCs for high PCEs.

         <title>Insulin&#8211;Dendrimer Nanocomplex for Multi&#8208;Day Glucose&#8208;Responsive Therapy in Mice and Swine</title>

An insulin nanocomplex formulation prepared by coupling electrostatic&#8208; and dynamic&#8208;covalent interactions is shown that affords long&#8208;lasting blood glucose control with an elevated insulin response to glucose challenge for up to a week following a single injection.








Abstract
The management of diabetes in a manner offering autonomous insulin therapy responsive to glucose&#8208;directed need, and moreover with a dosing schedule amenable to facile administration, remains an ongoing goal to improve the standard of care. While basal insulins with reduced dosing frequency, even once&#8208;weekly administration, are on the horizon, there is still no approved therapy that offers glucose&#8208;responsive insulin function. Herein, a nanoscale complex combining both electrostatic&#8208; and dynamic&#8208;covalent interactions between a synthetic dendrimer carrier and an insulin analogue modified with a high&#8208;affinity glucose&#8208;binding motif yields an injectable insulin depot affording both glucose&#8208;directed and long&#8208;lasting insulin availability. Following a single injection, it is even possible to control blood glucose for at least one week in diabetic swine subjected to daily oral glucose challenges. Measurements of serum insulin concentration in response to challenge show increases in insulin corresponding to elevated blood glucose levels, an uncommon finding even in preclinical work on glucose&#8208;responsive insulin. Accordingly, the subcutaneous nanocomplex that results from combining electrostatic&#8208; and dynamic&#8208;covalent interactions between a modified insulin and a synthetic dendrimer carrier affords a glucose&#8208;responsive insulin depot for week&#8208;long control following a single routine injection.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Perovskite Quantum Dots for Highly Selective Room&#8208;Temperature Spin Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell structured perovskite quantum dots with outstanding spin polarization property are developed for room&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes. The 2D chiral organic cation in the shell passivates defects on the quantum dot surface, thereby yielding a high external quantum efficiency of 5.47% and strong circularly polarized electroluminescence with a dissymmetry factor |gCP&#8208;EL| of 2.4 &#215; 10&#8722;1.








Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) is a crucial light source with a wide variety of potential applications such as magnetic recording, and 3D display. Here, core&#8211;shell heterostructured perovskite quantum dots (QDs) for room&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (spin&#8208;LEDs) are developed. Specifically, a 2D chiral perovskite shell is deposited onto the achiral 3D inorganic perovskite (CsPbBr3) core. Owing to the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect, the spin state of the injected charge carriers is biased when they are transmitted through the 2D chiral shell. The spin&#8208;controlled carriers then radiatively recombine inside the CsPbBr3 emissive core, resulting in CPL emission. It is demonstrated that the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;(naphthyl)ethylamine) (R&#8208;/S&#8208;NEA) 2D chiral cations enhance the spin polarization degree due to their strong chiroptical properties. Systematical defect analyses confirm that 2D chiral cations (i.e., R&#8208;/S&#8208;NEA) successfully passivate halide vacancies at the surface of the CsPbBr3 QDs, thereby attaining a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 78%. Moreover, the spin&#8208;LEDs prepared with core&#8211;shell QDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 5.47% and circularly polarized electroluminescence with a polarization degree (PCP&#8208;EL) of 12% at room temperature. Finally, various patterns fabricated by inkjet printing the core&#8211;shell QDs emit strong CPL, highlighting their potential as an emitter for next&#8208;generation displays.

         <title>Schottky Junction and D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 System Dual Regulation of Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Highly Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large &#960;&#8208;delocalized and &#960;&#8208;stacked Schottky junction that synergistically knits a rebuilt extended &#960;&#8208;delocalized network of D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 system (multiple donor or acceptor units) with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is developed. The catalyst realizes high&#8208;efficient charge separation and transport in both lateral and vertical directions, thus resulting in an outstanding photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate.








Abstract
Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are emerging as a promising molecular platform for photocatalysis. Nevertheless, the construction of highly effective charge transfer pathways in CTFs for oriented delivery of photoexcited electrons to enhance photocatalytic performance remains highly challenging. Herein, a molecular engineering strategy is presented to achieve highly efficient charge separation and transport in both the lateral and vertical directions for solar&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion. Specifically, a large &#960;&#8208;delocalized and &#960;&#8208;stacked Schottky junction (Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF/RGO) that synergistically knits a rebuilt extended &#960;&#8208;delocalized network of the D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 system (multiple donor or acceptor units, Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF) with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is developed. It is verified that the single&#8208;site Ru units in Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF/RGO act as effective secondary electron acceptors in the lateral direction for multistage charge separation/transport. Simultaneously, the &#960;&#8208;stacked and covalently bonded graphene is regarded as a hole extraction layer, accelerating the separation/transport of the photogenerated charges in the vertical direction over the Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF/RGO Schottky junction with full use of photogenerated electrons for the reduction reaction. Thus, the obtained photocatalyst has an excellent CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion rate (&#8776;11050 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and selectivity (&#8776;99%), producing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the heterogeneous conversion of CO2 to formate without an extra photosensitizer.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Plasma Membrane and Mitochondria Dual&#8208;Targeted NIR&#8208;II AIE Photosensitizer Evoking Synergetic Pyroptosis and Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma membrane and mitochondria dual&#8208;targeted photosensitizer (DPITQ) with NIR&#8208;II aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics for evoking synergetic pyroptosis and apoptosis is developed through rational molecular engineering. After encapsulation by DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000, DPITQ presents a clear NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability on the venous vessels of nude mice and efficient NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy for tumors.








Abstract
Phototherapy provides a noninvasive and spatiotemporal controllable paradigm to inhibit the evasion of the programmed cell death (PCD) of tumors. However, conventional photosensitizers (PSs) often induce a single PCD process, resulting in insufficient photodamage and severely impeding their application scopes. In this study, molecular engineering is conducted by adjusting electron donors to develop an aggregation&#8208;induced NIR&#8208;II emissive PS (DPITQ) for plasma membrane and mitochondria dual&#8208;targeted tumor therapy by evoking synergetic pyroptosis and apoptosis. DPITQ displays boosted type I and II reactive oxygen species generation as well as a high photothermal conversion efficacy (43%) after laser irradiation of 635 nm. The excellent biocompatibility and appropriate lipophilicity help the DPITQ to specifically anchor in the plasma membrane and mitochondria of cancer cells. Furthermore, the photosensitized DPITQ can disrupt the intact plasma membrane and cause mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately causing concurrent pyroptosis and apoptosis to suppress cancer cell proliferation even under hypoxia. It is noteworthy that the DPITQ nanoparticles (NPs) present clear NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability on the venous vessels of nude mice. Notably, the DPITQ NPs exert efficient NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy both in multicellular tumor spheroids and in vivo, causing maximum destruction to tumors but minimum adverse effects to normal tissue.

         <title>A Multifunctional Amino Acid Enables Direct Recycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroxyl groups and amino groups in L&#8208;threonine act as electron donors and nitrogen sources, respectively. N atoms derived from amino groups are able to dope into carbon layers, generating more active sites and enhancing the conductive properties of LFP particles. Therefore, the regenerated LFP shows excellent cycling performance with 86% retention after 500 cycles at 5 C rate.








Abstract
Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) batteries are extensively used in electric vehicles and energy storage due to their good cycling stability and safety. However, the finite service life of lithium&#8208;ion batteries leads to significant amounts of retired LFP batteries, urgently required to be recycled by environmentally friendly and effective methods. Here, a direct regeneration strategy using natural and low&#8208;cost L&#8208;threonine as a multifunctional reductant is proposed. The hydroxyl groups and amino groups in L&#8208;threonine act as electron donors and nitrogen sources, respectively. The reductive environment created by L&#8208;threonine not only aids in converting the degraded FePO4 phase back to a single LFP phase but also facilitates the elimination of detrimental Li&#8211;Fe anti&#8208;site defects; thus, reconstructing fast Li+ diffusion channels. Meanwhile, N atoms derived from amino groups are able to dope into carbon layers, generating more active sites and enhancing the conductive properties of LFP particles. The regenerated LFP shows great electrochemical performance with a discharge capacity of 147.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C and a capacity retention of 86% after 500 cycles at 5 C. Further, this approach is also feasible for LFP black mass sourced from practical industrial dismantling lines, providing considerable prospects for the large&#8208;scale recycling of LFP batteries.

         <title>Injectable Supramolecular Hydrogels for In Situ Programming of Car&#8208;T Cells toward Solid Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable CAR plasmid (pCAR)&#8208;loaded supramolecular hydrogel system for long&#8208;term and sustained reprogramming of CAR&#8208;T cells in situ for solid tumor immunotherapy is introduced. After injection locally adjacent to a solid tumor, the supramolecular hydrogel platform produces in situ CAR&#8208;T cells by sustaining release of T cell&#8208;targeting nanocomplexes&#8208;carrying pCAR and significantly diminishes the immunosuppressive microenvironment or facilitates the clearance of solid tumors.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell immunotherapy is approved in the treatment of hematological malignancies, but remains far from satisfactory&#160;in solid tumor treatment due to inadequate intra&#8208;tumor CAR&#8208;T cell infiltration. Herein, an injectable supramolecular hydrogel system, based on self&#8208;assembly between cationic polymer mPEG&#8208;PCL&#8208;PEI (PPP) conjugated with T cell targeting anti&#8208;CD3e f(ab')2 fragment and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD), is designed to load plasmid CAR (pCAR) with a T cell specific CD2 promoter, which successfully achieves in situ fabrication and effective accumulation of CAR&#8208;T cells at the tumor site in humanized mice models. More importantly, due to this tumor microenvironment reprogramming, secretion of cellular inflammatory cytokines (interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2), tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;), and interferon&#8208;&#947; (IFN&#8208;&#947;)) or tumor killer protein granzyme B is significantly promoted, which reverses the immunosuppressive microenvironment and significantly enhances the intra&#8208;tumor CAR&#8208;T cells and cytotoxic T cells infiltration. To the best of the current knowledge, this is a pioneer report of using injectable supramolecular hydrogel for in situ reprogramming CAR&#8208;T cells, which might be beneficial for solid tumor CAR&#8208;T immunotherapy.

         <title>Manganese@Albumin Nanocomplex and Its Assembled Nanowire Activate TLR4&#8208;Dependent Signaling Cascades of Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace Mn2+ bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form Mn@BSA nanocomplexes can potentiate pro&#8208;inflammatory responses through TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling cascades. Furthermore, assembly of the resultant Mn@BSA nanocomplexes into larger nanowires enables robust and long&#8208;duration interactions with membrane&#8208;bound TLR4s via phagocytosis, boosting the immunostimulation of macrophages.








Abstract
The immunomodulatory effect of divalent manganese cations (Mn2+), such as activation of the cGAS&#8722;STING pathway or NLRP3 inflammasomes, positions them as adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, it is found that trace Mn2+ ions, bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form Mn@BSA nanocomplexes, stimulate pro&#8208;inflammatory responses in human&#8208; or murine&#8208;derived macrophages through TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling cascades. Building on this, the assembly of Mn@BSA nanocomplexes to obtain nanowire structures enables stronger and longer&#8208;lasting immunostimulation of macrophages by regulating phagocytosis. Furthermore, Mn@BSA nanocomplexes and their nanowires efficiently activate peritoneal macrophages, reprogramme tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, and inhibit the growth of melanoma tumors in vivo. They also show better biosafety for potential clinical applications compared to typical TLR4 agonists such as lipopolysaccharides. Accordingly, the findings provide insights into the mechanism of metalloalbumin complexes as potential TLR agonists that activate macrophage polarization and highlight the importance of their nanostructures in regulating macrophage&#8208;mediated innate immunity.

         <title>Hydrophobic Trinuclear Copper Cluster&#8208;Containing Organic Framework for Synergetic Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed perfluoroalkyl hydrophobic crystalline trinuclear Cu&#8208;containing cluster organic frameworks not only inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction, but also the dynamic reconfiguration of the trinuclear Cu clusters in the F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF allows short&#8208;range Cu atoms to activate NO3&#8722; and keto acids at the same time and shows excellent performance in electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling to generate a series of amino acids.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of amino acids provides a promising green and efficient pathway to manufacture the basic substances of life. Herein, reaction of 2,5&#8208;perfluroalkyl&#8208;terepthalohydrazide and tris(4&#8208;&#181;2&#8208;O&#8208;carboxaldehyde&#8208;pyrazolato&#8208;N, N&#8242;)&#8208;tricopper affords a crystalline trinuclear copper cluster&#8208;containing organic framework, named F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF. Incorporation of abundant hydrophobic perfluroalkyl groups inside the channels of F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF is revealed to successfully suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction via preventing H+ cation with large polarity from the framework of F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF and in turn increasing the adsorption of other substrates with relatively small polarity like NO3&#8722; and keto acids on the active sites. The copper atoms with short distance in the trinuclear copper clusters of F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF enable simultaneous activization of NO3&#8722; and keto acids, facilitating the following synergistic and efficient C&#9472;N coupling on the basis of in situ spectroscopic investigations together with theoretical calculation. Combination of these effects leads to efficient electroproduction of various amino acids including glycine, alanine, leucine, valine, and phenylalanine from NO3&#8722; and keto acids with a Faraday efficiency of 42%&#8211;71% and a yield of 187&#8211;957&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, representing the thus far best performance. This work shall be helpful for developing economical, eco&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;efficiency strategy for the production of amino acids and other life substances.

         <title>Unraveling Synergistic Effect of Defects and Piezoelectric Field in Breakthrough Piezo&#8208;Photocatalytic N2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergy of defects and piezoelectric field renders an outstanding piezo&#8208;photocatalytic nitrogen reduction activity of BaTiO3. Oxygen&#8208;vacancies (OVs) can strengthen the piezoelectric polarization of BaTiO3 to promote photogenerated carrier separation, meanwhile the optimized piezoelectric polarization field can also modulate the electronic structure of Ti3+ adjacent to OVs to facilitate the chemisorption, activation and dissociation of N2.








Abstract
Piezo&#8208;photocatalysis is a frontier technology for converting mechanical and solar energies into crucial chemical substances and has emerged as a promising and sustainable strategy for N2 fixation. Here, for the first time, defects and piezoelectric field are synergized to achieve unprecedented piezo&#8208;photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) activity and their collaborative catalytic mechanism is unraveled over BaTiO3 with tunable oxygen vacancies (OVs). The introduced OVs change the local dipole state to strengthen the piezoelectric polarization of BaTiO3, resulting in a more efficient separation of photogenerated carrier. Ti3+ sites adjacent to OVs promote N2 chemisorption and activation through d&#8211;&#960; back&#8208;donation with the help of the unpaired d&#8208;orbital electron. Furthermore, a piezoelectric polarization field could modulate the electronic structure of Ti3+ to facilitate the activation and dissociation of N2, thereby substantially reducing the reaction barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step. Benefitting from the synergistic reinforcement mechanism and optimized surface dynamics processes, an exceptional piezo&#8208;photocatalytic NH3 evolution rate of 106.7&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 is delivered by BaTiO3 with moderate OVs, far surpassing that of previously reported piezocatalysts/piezo&#8208;photocatalysts. New perspectives are provided here for the rational design of an efficient piezo&#8208;photocatalytic system for the NRR.

         <title>Laser Synthesis of PtMo Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Electrode for Ultralow Voltage Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The universal laser ablation synthesis strategy of single&#8208;atom alloy (PtMo, RhMo, IrMo, and RuMo) self&#8208;standing electrodes is developed. Attributed to the optimized electron distribution and strong bonding between the Pt single atom and Mo substrate, the self&#8208;standing PtMo single&#8208;atom alloy electrode (Pt&#8208;SA0.056/Mo&#8208;L) possesses the splendid catalytic activity and high&#8208;current&#8208;density stability for hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Maximizing atom&#8208;utilization efficiency and high current stability are crucial for the platinum (Pt)&#8208;based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the Pt single&#8208;atom anchored molybdenum (Mo) foil (Pt&#8208;SA/Mo&#8208;L) as a single&#8208;atom alloy electrode is synthesized by the laser ablation strategy. The local thermal effect with fast rising&#8211;cooling rate of laser can achieve the single&#8208;atom distribution of the precious metals (e.g., Pt, Rh, Ir, and Ru) onto the Mo foil. The synthesized self&#8208;standing Pt&#8208;SA/Mo&#8208;L electrode exhibits splendid catalytic activity (31&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and high&#8208;current&#8208;density stability (&#8776;850&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 50 h) for HER in acidic media. The strong coordination of Pt&#8208;Mo bonding in Pt&#8208;SA/Mo&#8208;L is critical for the efficient and stable HER. In addition, the ultralow electrolytic voltage of 0.598&#160;V to afford the current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is realized by utilization of the anodic molybdenum oxidation instead of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here a universal synthetic strategy of single&#8208;atom alloys (PtMo, RhMo, IrMo, and RuMo) as self&#8208;standing electrodes is provided for ultralow voltage and membrane&#8208;free hydrogen production.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Lattice&#8208;Matched Boron&#8208;Doped Gallium Phosphide: A Scalable Acousto&#8208;Optic Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study implements the first integrated photonic and acousto&#8208;optic devices in novel thin&#8208;film boron&#8208;doped gallium phosphide, indicating its potential as a highly scalable hybrid photonics platform for integration with color centers in high&#8208;index materials. Optical, acoustic, and materials characterization is performed, revealing both strong intrinsic properties and clear pathways toward improvement.








Abstract
The compact size, scalability, and strongly confined fields in integrated photonic devices enable new functionalities in photonic networking and information processing, both classical and quantum. Gallium phosphide (GaP) is a promising material for active integrated photonics due to its high refractive index, wide bandgap, strong nonlinear properties, and large acousto&#8208;optic figure&#160;of merit. This study demonstrates that silicon&#8208;lattice&#8208;matched boron&#8208;doped GaP (BGaP), grown at the 12&#8208;inch wafer scale, provides similar functionalities as GaP. BGaP optical resonators exhibit intrinsic quality factors exceeding 25,000 and 200,000 at visible and telecom wavelengths, respectively. It further demonstrates the electromechanical generation of low&#8208;loss acoustic waves and an integrated acousto&#8208;optic (AO) modulator. High&#8208;resolution spatial and compositional mapping, combined with ab initio calculations, indicate two candidates for the excess optical loss in the visible band: the silicon&#8208;GaP interface and boron dimers. These results demonstrate the promise of the BGaP material platform for the development of scalable AO technologies at telecom and provide potential pathways toward higher performance at shorter&#160;wavelengths.

         <title>In Situ Regulating Cobalt/Iron Oxide&#8208;Oxyhydroxide Exchange by Dynamic Iron Incorporation for Robust Oxygen Evolution at Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exceptional and stable oxygen&#8208;evolving electrocatalyst is developed from self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous bimetallic FeOOH/Co(OH)2 microsheet arrays through a mechanical stirring strategy, yielding a current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at low overpotentials of 290 and 304&#160;mV. This catalyst rapidly reconstructs into Co1&#8208;xFexOOH species through in situ iron incorporation into CoOOH as confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron, Raman spectroscopic studies, and theoretical calculations.








Abstract
The key dilemma for green hydrogen production via electrocatalytic water splitting is the high overpotential required for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Co/Fe&#8208;based materials show superior catalytic OER activity to noble metal&#8208;based catalysts, but still lag far behind the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni/Fe&#8208;based catalysts probably due to undesirable side segregation of FeOOH with poor conductivity and unsatisfied structural durability under large current density. Here, a robust and durable OER catalyst affording current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at extremely low overpotentials of 290 and 304&#160;mV in base is reported. This catalyst evolves from amorphous bimetallic FeOOH/Co(OH)2 heterostructure microsheet arrays fabricated by a facile mechanical stirring strategy. Especially, in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman analysis decipher the rapid reconstruction of FeOOH/Co(OH)2 into dynamically stable Co1&#8208;xFexOOH active phase through in situ iron incorporation into CoOOH, which perform as the real active sites accelerating the rate&#8208;determining step supported by density functional theory calculations. By coupling with MoNi4/MoO2 cathode, the self&#8208;assembled alkaline electrolyzer can deliver 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.613&#160;V, better than commercial IrO2(+)||Pt/C(&#8208;) and most of reported transition metal&#8208;based electrolyzers. This work provides a feasible strategy for the exploration and design of industrial water&#8208;splitting catalysts for large&#8208;scale green hydrogen production.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hydrogen Production from Alkaline/Seawater over a Single&#8208;Step Synthesis of Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe Core&#8211;Shell Nanowire Arrays</title>

         <dc:description>
This work reports the synthesis of novel platinum group metal free catalysts, heterostructure of molybdenum selenide&#8208;nickel selenide (Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe) core&#8211;shell nanowire arrays constructed on nickel foam by single&#8208;step in situ hydrothermal process through optimized shape engineering and structural control technology. The Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe core&#8211;shell nanowire arrays electrocatalyst shows superior electrocatalytic performance, hydrogen evolution reaction with low overpotential from alkaline/seawater electrolysis, respectively.








Abstract
The rational design and steering of earth&#8208;abundant, efficient, and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation is highly desirable but challenging with catalysts free of platinum group metals (PGMs). Mass production of high&#8208;purity hydrogen fuel from seawater electrolysis presents a transformative technology for sustainable alternatives. Here, a heterostructure of molybdenum selenide&#8208;nickel selenide (Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe) core&#8211;shell nanowire arrays constructed on nickel foam by a single&#8208;step in situ hydrothermal process is reported. This tiered structure provides improved intrinsic activity and high electrical conductivity for efficient charge transfer and endows excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline and natural seawater conditions. The Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe freestanding electrodes require small overpotentials of 84.4 and 166&#160;mV to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline and natural seawater electrolytes, respectively. It maintains an impressive balance between electrocatalytic activity and stability. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe interface provides abundant active sites for the HER process, which modulate the binding energies of adsorbed species and decrease the energetic barrier, providing a new route to design state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, PGM&#8208;free catalysts for hydrogen production from alkaline and seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Highly Crystalized Cl&#8208;Doped SnO2 Nanocrystals for Stable Aqueous Dispersion Toward High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystallized Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs that can form very stable aqueous dispersion with shelf life up to one year are herein prepared without the need of any stabilizer. The fabricated FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells with the electron transport layers made by such NCs achieve champion efficiency up to &#8776;25% for small cell (0.085 cm2) and &#8776;20% for mini&#8208;module (12.125 cm2).








Abstract
Tin dioxide (SnO2) with high conductivity and low photocatalytic activity has been reported as one of the best candidates for highly efficient electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cell (PSC). The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SnO2 layer is achieved by chemical bath deposition with tunable properties, while the commercial SnO2 nanocrystals (NCs) with low tunability still face the necessity of further improvement. Here, a kind of highly crystallized Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs is reported that can form very stable aqueous dispersion with shelf life up to one year without any stabilizer, which can facilitate the fabrication of PSCs with satisfactory performance. Compared to the commercial SnO2 NCs regardless of the extrinsic Cl&#8208;doping conditions, the intrinsic Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs effectively suppress the energy barrier and reduces the trap state density at the buried interface between perovskite and ETL. Consequently, stable PSCs based on such Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs achieve a champion efficiency up to &#8776;25% for small cell (0.085 cm2) and &#8776;20% for mini&#8208;module (12.125 cm2), indicating its potential as a promising candidate for ETL in high&#8208;performance perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Hydrogen Ion Capturing Hydrogel Microspheres for Reversing Inflammaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lactic acid produced in degenerated tissues can activate the NLRP3/Caspase&#8208;1/IL&#8208;1&#946; axis and cause chronic inflammation, finally restricting tissue restoration. The engineered hydrogen ion&#8208;capturing hydrogel microspheres (GMNP) using biomimetic mineralization and microfluidic technologies can block the NLRP3 axis by simultaneously capturing excess hydrogen ions and suppressing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), eventually reconstructing the tissue microenvironment and promoting tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Inflammaging is deeply involved in aging&#8208;related diseases and can be destructive during aging. The maintenance of pH balance in the extracellular microenvironment can alleviate inflammaging and repair aging&#8208;related tissue damage. In this study, the hydrogen ion capturing hydrogel microsphere (GMNP) composed of mineralized transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) and catalase (CAT) nanoparticles is developed via biomimetic mineralization and microfluidic technology for blocking the NLRP3 cascade axis in inflammaging. This GMNP can neutralize the acidic microenvironment by capturing excess hydrogen ions through the calcium carbonate mineralization layer. Then, the subsequent release of encapsulated TGF&#8208;&#946; and CAT can eliminate both endogenous and exogenous stimulus of NLRP3, thus suppressing the excessive activation of inflammaging. In vitro, GMNP can suppress the excessive activation of the TXNIP/NLRP3/IL&#8208;1&#946; cascade axis and enhance extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in nucleus pulposus cells. In vivo, GMNP becomes a sustainable and stable niche with microspheres as the core to inhibit inflammaging and promote the regeneration of degenerated intervertebral discs. Therefore, this hydrogen ion&#8208;capturing hydrogel microsphere effectively reverses inflammaging by interfering with the excessive activation of NLRP3 in the degenerated tissues.

         <title>Acetamide&#8208;Caprolactam Deep Eutectic Solvent&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acetamide&#8208;caprolactam deep eutectic solvent&#8208;based electrolyte achieves excellent electrochemical performance by reconstructing the solvation structure of Zn2+, suppressing HER, forming a solid electrolyte interface, and minimizing the formation of undesirable by&#8208;products.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, conventional AZIBs face challenges including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), leading to high local pH, and by&#8208;product formation on the anode. Hereby the hydrogen bonds in the aqueous electrolyte are reconstructed by using a deep eutectic co&#8208;solvent (DES) made of acetamide (H&#8208;bond donor) and caprolactam (H&#8208;bond acceptor), which effectively suppresses the reactivity of water and broadens the electrochemical voltage stability window. The coordination between Zn2+ and acetamide&#8208;caprolactam in DES&#8208;based electrolytes produces a unique solvation structure that promotes the preferential growth of Zn crystals along the (002) plane. This will inhibit the formation of Zn dendrites and ensure the uniform deposition of Zn&#8208;ions on the anode surface. In addition, it is found that this DES&#8208;based electrolyte can form a protective membrane on the anode surface, reducing the risks of Zn corrosion. Compared to conventional electrolytes, the DES&#8208;based electrolyte shows a long&#8208;term stable plating/stripping performance with a significantly improved Coulombic efficiency from 78.18% to 98.37%. It is further demonstrated that a Zn||VS2 full&#8208;cell with the DES&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits enhanced stability after 500 cycles with 85.4% capacity retention at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Quantitative Description of Metal Center Organization and Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancing the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts requires reliable tools for discerning distinct metal center arrangements. This study leverages state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art microscopy, machine learning, and simulations to gain insights into the organization and interactions of metal centers and coordination sites in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons. The findings highlight the impact of density&#8208; and support&#8208;mediated repulsive interactions in shaping spatial configurations and forming low&#8208;nuclearity species.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts (UHD&#8208;SACs) present unique opportunities for harnessing cooperative effects between neighboring metal centers. However, the lack of tools to establish correlations between the density, types, and arrangements of isolated metal atoms and&#160;the support surface properties hinders efforts to engineer advanced material architectures. Here, this work precisely describes the metal center organization in various mono&#8208; and multimetallic UHD&#8209;SACs based on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) supports by coupling transmission electron microscopy with tailored machine&#8208;learning methods (released as a user&#8208;friendly web app) and density functional theory simulations. This approach quantifies the non&#8208;negligible presence of multimers with increasing atom density, characterizes the size and shape of these low&#8209;nuclearity clusters, and identifies surface atom density criteria to ensure isolation. Further, it provides previously inaccessible experimental insights into coordination site arrangements in the NC host, uncovering a repulsive interaction that influences the disordered distribution of metal centers in UHD&#8208;SACs. This observation holds in multimetallic systems, where chemically&#8208;specific analysis quantifies the degree of intermixing. These fundamental insights into the materials chemistry of single&#8208;atom catalysts are crucial for designing catalytic systems with superior reactivity.

         <title>Diffusible Capping Layer Enabled Homogeneous Crystallization and Component Distribution of Hybrid Sequential Deposited Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, &#8220;diffusible perovskite capping layer&#8221; strategy is proposed to solve the dilemma of uneven crystallization faced by thermal evaporation and spin&#8208;coating hybrid sequential deposited perovskite, which is by far the most promising way to obtain high efficiency of commercially textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Nowadays, the development of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite by thermal evaporation and spin&#8208;coating hybrid sequential deposition (HSD) method has special meaning on textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, the common issues of insufficient reaction caused by blocking of perovskite capping layer are exacerbated in HSD, because evaporated precursors are usually denser with higher crystallinity and the widely used additive&#8208;assisted microstructure is also difficult to access. Here, a facile &#8220;diffusible perovskite capping layer&#8221; (DPCL) strategy to solve this dilemma is presented. With DPCL, crystallization alleviation of perovskite and more diffusion channels of organic salts can be realized simultaneously, contributing to a homogenization process. The resultant perovskite films exhibit complete conversion, uniform crystallization, enhanced quality, and reduced defect, leading to obvious improvements in device efficiency, repeatability, and stability. This work offers a way to promote the development of textured tandems a step further.

Cancer Therapy
In article number 2307817, Junjie Yan, Min Yang, Zhen Gu, and co&#8208;workers discover that the intrinsic anticancer bioactivity of liquid metal nanodroplets (&lt;30 nm) can be activated via the galvanic replacement reaction with endogenous Cu2+ ions. This chemotherapy strategy, which leverages endogenous nutrients and features tumor&#8208;selective carrier&#8208;to&#8208;drug conversion, dual anticancer pathways of Ga3+ release and Cu2+ depletion along with abundant reactive oxygen species generation, provides a new tool for synthesizing drugs in biological environments.

Bioengineering
In article number 2303196, Twan Lammers, Horst Fischer, Fabian Kiessling, and co&#8208;workers establish mesoscopic 3D vascularized tumors in perfusable bioreactors to mimic the onset of metastasis in vitro. The &#8220;High Tide&#8221; cover art exemplifies how a tumor spheroid triggers bioprinted endothelium's angiogenesis, akin to the moon's effect on the sea, resulting in high tides.

Abstract
Efficient utilization of sunlight in photocatalysis is widely recognized as a promising solution for addressing the growing energy demand and environmental issues resulting from fossil fuel consumption. Recently, there have been significant developments in various near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;harvesting systems for artificial photosynthesis and photocatalytic environmental remediation. This review provides an overview of the most recent advancements in the utilization of NIR light through the creation of novel nanostructured materials and molecular photosensitizers, as well as modulating strategies to enhance the photocatalytic processes. A special focus is given to the emerging two&#8208;photon excitation NIR photocatalysis. The unique features and limitations of different systems are critically evaluated. In particular, it highlights the advantages of utilizing NIR light and two&#8208;photon excitation compared to UV&#8211;visible irradiation and one&#8208;photon excitation. Ongoing challenges and potential solutions for the future exploration of NIR light&#8208;responsive materials are also discussed.

         <title>The Emerging Landscape for Combating Resistance Associated with Energy&#8208;Based Therapies via Nanomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy&#8208;based therapies (ET) based on athermal and thermal ablation provide distinct advantages for cancer therapy, but the therapeutic efficiency is generally limited by the emergence of ET&#8208;associated resistance (ETR). The underlying mechanisms of ETR and representative applications of nanoplatforms applied in mitigating ETR are highlighted in this comprehensive review, aiming to facilitate future clinical translation.








Abstract
Cancer represents a serious disease with significant implications for public health, imposing substantial economic burden and negative societal consequences. Compared to conventional cancer treatments, such as surgery and chemotherapy, energy&#8208;based therapies (ET) based on athermal and thermal ablation provide distinct advantages, including minimally invasive procedures and rapid postoperative recovery. Nevertheless, due to the complex pathophysiology of many solid tumors, the therapeutic effectiveness of ET is often limited. Nanotechnology offers unique opportunities by enabling facile material designs, tunable physicochemical properties, and excellent biocompatibility, thereby further augmenting the outcomes of ET. Numerous nanomaterials have demonstrated the ability to overcome intrinsic therapeutic resistance associated with ET, leading to improved antitumor responses. This comprehensive review systematically summarizes the underlying mechanisms of ET&#8208;associated resistance (ETR) and highlights representative applications of nanoplatforms used to mitigate ETR. Overall, this review emphasizes the recent advances in the field and presents a detailed account of novel nanomaterial designs in combating ETR, along with efforts aimed at facilitating their clinical translation.

         <title>Multienzymatic Cascades and Nanomaterial Scaffolding&#8212;A Potential Way Forward for the Efficient Biosynthesis of Novel Chemical Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on multienzyme cascades for the biosynthesis of novel compounds and how nanomaterials can potentially improve their efficiency. Recent successes in applying biosynthetic strategies for multi&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot reactions toward novel products of interest are highlighted. Then strategies that look toward exploiting bio/nanomaterials for accessing channeling and other nanoscale phenomena in vitro to improve overall catalytic efficiency are discussed.








Abstract
Synthetic biology is touted as the next industrial revolution as it promises access to greener biocatalytic syntheses to replace many industrial organic chemistries. Here, it is shown to what synthetic biology can offer in the form of multienzyme cascades for the synthesis of the most basic of new materials&#8212;chemicals, including especially designer chemical products and their analogs. Since achieving this is predicated on dramatically expanding the chemical space that enzymes access, such chemistry will probably be undertaken in cell&#8208;free or minimalist formats to overcome the inherent toxicity of non&#8208;natural substrates to living cells. Laying out relevant aspects that need to be considered in the design of multi&#8208;enzymatic cascades for these purposes is begun. Representative multienzymatic cascades are critically reviewed, which have been specifically developed for the synthesis of compounds that have either been made only by traditional organic synthesis along with those cascades utilized for novel compound syntheses. Lastly, an overview of strategies that look toward exploiting bio/nanomaterials for accessing channeling and other nanoscale materials phenomena in vitro to direct novel enzymatic biosynthesis and improve catalytic efficiency is provided. Finally, a perspective on what is needed for this field to develop in the short and long term is presented.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Growth Factor Delivery Platforms: Strategies and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the progress of hydrogel&#8208;based growth factor delivery systems for biomedical applications and the strategies utilized for growth factor delivery optimization is presented, with an emphasis on the ways the hydrogels facilitate the delivery and improve the therapeutic efficacy of growth factors. The current limitations and future research directions in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
Growth factors play a crucial role in regulating a broad variety of biological processes and are regarded as powerful therapeutic agents in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine in the past decades. However, their application is limited by their short half&#8208;lives and potential side effects in physiological environments. Hydrogels are identified as having the promising potential to prolong the half&#8208;lives of growth factors and mitigate their adverse effects by restricting them within the matrix to reduce their rapid proteolysis, burst release, and unwanted diffusion. This review discusses recent progress in the development of growth factor&#8208;containing hydrogels for various biomedical applications, including wound healing, brain tissue repair, cartilage and bone regeneration, and spinal cord injury repair. In addition, the review introduces strategies for optimizing growth factor release including affinity&#8208;based delivery, carrier&#8208;assisted delivery, stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery, spatial structure&#8208;based delivery, and cellular system&#8208;based delivery. Finally, the review presents current limitations and future research directions for growth factor&#8208;delivering hydrogels.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products in Flow Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CO2 reduction electrolytic cells based on electrolyte flow system (flow cells) have shown great potential for industrial devices. An overview of design and optimization of flow cells for C2+ product is presented with a perspective to achieve their industrial applications in the near future.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals by renewable electric energy is one of the important strategies to address global energy shortage and carbon emission. Though the classical H&#8208;type electrolytic cell can quickly screen high&#8208;efficiency catalysts, the low current density and limited CO2 mass transfer process essentially impede its industrial applications. The electrolytic cells based on electrolyte flow system (flow cells) have shown great potential for industrial devices, due to higher current density, improved local CO2 concentration, and better mass transfer efficiency. The design and optimization of flow cells are of great significance to further accelerate the industrialization of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this review, the progress of flow cells for CO2RR to C2+ products is concerned. Firstly, the main events in the development of the flow cells for CO2RR are outlined. Second, the main design principles of CO2RR to C2+ products, the architectures, and types of flow cells are summarized. Third, the main strategies for optimizing flow cells to generate C2+ products are reviewed in detail, including cathode, anode, ion exchange membrane, and electrolyte. Finally, the preliminary attempts, challenges, and the research prospects of flow cells for industrial CO2RR toward C2+ products are discussed.

The electrolytic cells based on electrolyte flow system (flow cells) have shown great potential for industrial devices, due to higher current density, improved local CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, and better mass transfer efficiency. The design and optimization of flow cells are of great significance to further accelerate the industrialization of electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR). In this review, the progress of flow cells for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products is concerned. Firstly, the main events in the development of the flow cells for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR are outlined. Second, the main design principles of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products, the architectures, and types of flow cells are summarized. Third, the main strategies for optimizing flow cells to generate C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products are reviewed in detail, including cathode, anode, ion exchange membrane, and electrolyte. Finally, the preliminary attempts, challenges, and the research prospects of flow cells for industrial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR toward C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; products are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterization, Structure, and Reactivity of Hydroxyl Groups on Metal&#8208;Oxide Cluster Nodes of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Structural Diversity and Keys to Reactivity and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many metal&#8211;organic frameworks consist of nodes such as Zr6O8 connected by organic linkers. Hydroxyl groups are present in various forms on the nodes, characterized by infrared and NMR spectroscopies. They have contrasting reactivities, and many play central roles in catalysis, with terminal hydroxyl groups being among the most reactive.








Abstract
Among the most stable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are those incorporating nodes that are metal oxide clusters with frames such as Zr6O8. This review is a summary of the structure, bonding, and reactivity of MOF node hydroxyl groups, emphasizing those bonded to nodes containing aluminum and zirconium ions. Hydroxyl groups are often present on these nodes, sometimes balancing the charges of the metal ions. They arise during MOF syntheses in aqueous media or in post&#8208;synthesis treatments. They are identified with infrared and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and characterized by their reactivities with polar compounds such as alcohols. Terminal OH, paired&#160;&#181;2&#8208;OH, and aqua groups&#160;on nodes are catalytic sites in numerous reactions. Relatively unreactive hydroxyl groups (such as isolated&#160;&#181;2&#8208;OH groups) may replace reactive groups and inhibit catalysis; some node hydroxyl groups (e.g.,&#160;&#181;3&#8208;OH) are mere spectators in catalysis. There are similarities between MOF node hydroxyl groups and those on the surfaces of bulk metal oxides, zeolites, and enzymes, but the comparisons are mostly inexact, and much remains to be understood about MOF node hydroxyl group chemistry. It is posited that understanding and controlling this chemistry will lead to tailored MOFs and improved adsorbents and catalysts.

         <title>Advancements in Achieving High Reversibility of Zinc Anode for Alkaline Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The poor reversibility of zinc anodes hampers the development of rechargeable alkaline zinc&#8208;based batteries due to dendrite formation, passivation, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. In this review, optimization strategies including 3D structures, protective layers, alloying, additives, separators, and charge protocols, are suggested and summarized to overcome the challenges associated with Zn anodes and fully unlock their potential in alkaline zinc&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable alkaline zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBBs) have attracted extensive research attention due to their advantages of low cost, high specific energy, and high safety. Although the investigation of cathodes for alkaline secondary ZBBs has reached a relatively advanced stage, the exploration of zinc anodes is still in its infancy. Zinc anodes in alkaline electrolytes encounter challenges such as dendrite formation, passivation, corrosion during periods of cell inactivity, and hydrogen evolution during cycling, thereby limiting their rechargeability and storability. Drawing upon the latest research on zinc anodes,&#160;six fundamental strategies that encompass a wide range of aspects are identified and categorized, from electrode modifications and electrolytes to charge protocols. Specifically, these strategies include 3D structures, coatings, alloying, additives, separators, and charge protocols. They serve as an insight summary of the current research progress on zinc anodes. Additionally, the complementary nature of these strategies allows for flexible combinations, enabling further enhancement of the overall performance of zinc anodes. Finally, several future directions for the advancement of practical alkaline Zn anode are proposed. This comprehensive review not only consolidates the existing knowledge but also paves the way for broader research opportunities in the pursuit of high&#8208;performance alkaline zinc anodes.

         <title>In Situ Piezoelectric&#8208;Catalytic Anti&#8208;Inflammation Promotes the Rehabilitation of Acute Spinal Cord Injury in Synergy</title>

Abstract
Relieving inflammation via scavenging toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the acute phase of spinal cord injury (SCI) has been proved to be an effective strategy to mitigate secondary spinal cord injury and improve recovery of motor function. However, commonly used corticosteroid anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs such as methylprednisolone show adverse side effects which may induce gastrointestinal bleeding, femoral head necrosis and an increased risk of wound infection. Fortunately, hydrogen (H2), featuring selective antioxidant performance, easy penetrability and excellent biosafety, is being extensively investigated as a potential anti&#8208;inflammatory therapeutic gas for the treatment of SCI. In this work, by a facile in situ growth approach of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the piezoelectric BaTiO3, a particulate nanocomposite with Schottky heterojunction (Au@BT) has been synthesized, which can generate H2 continuously by catalyzing H+ reduction through piezoelectric catalysis. Furthermore, theoretical calculations were employed to reveal the piezoelectric catalytic mechanism of Au@BT. Transcriptomics analysis and nontargeted large&#8208;scale metabolomic analysis reveal that the deeper mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of H2 therapy based on Au@BT + US. The as&#8208;prepared Au@BT nanoparticles have been first explored as a flexible hydrogen gas generator for efficient anti&#8208;inflammatory and pro&#8208;repair application for SCI therapy. This study highlights a promising prospect of nanocatalytic medicine for disease treatments by catalyzing H2 production, thus offering a significant alternative to conventional approaches against refractory spinal cord injury.

         <title>In Situ Rapid&#8208;Formation Sprayable Hydrogels for Challenging Tissue Injury Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rapid&#8208;acting, convenient, and broadly applicable medical materials are in high demand for the treatment of extensive and intricate tissue injuries in extremely medical scarcity environment, such as battlefields, wilderness, and traffic accidents. Conventional biomaterials fail to meet all the high criteria simultaneously for emergency management. Here, we have designed a multifunctional hydrogel system capable of rapid gelation and in situ spraying, addressing clinical challenges related to hemostasis, barrier establishment, support, and subsequent therapeutic treatment of irregular, complex and urgent injured tissues. This hydrogel can be fast formed in less than 0.5&#8208;second under ultraviolet initiation. The precursor maintains an impressively low viscosity of 0.018 Pa&#183;s, while the hydrogel demonstrates a storage modulus of 0.65&#160;MPa, achieving the delicate balance between sprayable fluidity and the mechanical strength requirements in practice, allowing flexible customization of the hydrogel system for differentiated handling and treatment of various tissues. Notably, the interactions between the component of this hydrogel and the cell surface protein confer upon its inherently bioactive functionalities such as osteogenesis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and angiogenesis. This research endeavored to provide new insights and designs into emergency management and complex tissue injuries treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Rapid-acting, convenient, and broadly applicable medical materials are in high demand for the treatment of extensive and intricate tissue injuries in extremely medical scarcity environment, such as battlefields, wilderness, and traffic accidents. Conventional biomaterials fail to meet all the high criteria simultaneously for emergency management. Here, we have designed a multifunctional hydrogel system capable of rapid gelation and in situ spraying, addressing clinical challenges related to hemostasis, barrier establishment, support, and subsequent therapeutic treatment of irregular, complex and urgent injured tissues. This hydrogel can be fast formed in less than 0.5-second under ultraviolet initiation. The precursor maintains an impressively low viscosity of 0.018 Pa&#183;s, while the hydrogel demonstrates a storage modulus of 0.65&#160;MPa, achieving the delicate balance between sprayable fluidity and the mechanical strength requirements in practice, allowing flexible customization of the hydrogel system for differentiated handling and treatment of various tissues. Notably, the interactions between the component of this hydrogel and the cell surface protein confer upon its inherently bioactive functionalities such as osteogenesis, anti-inflammation, and angiogenesis. This research endeavored to provide new insights and designs into emergency management and complex tissue injuries treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Sensitive Thermochromic Behavior of InSeI, a Highly Anisotropic and Tubular 1D van der Waals Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermochromism, the change in color of a material with temperature, is the fundamental basis of optical thermometry. A longstanding challenge in realizing sensitive optical thermometers for widespread use is identifying materials with pronounced thermometric optical performance in the visible range. To this end, we demonstrate that single crystals of indium selenium iodide (InSeI), a 1D van der Waals (vdW) solid consisting of weakly&#8208;bound helical chains, exhibit considerable visible range thermochromism. We show a strong temperature&#8208;dependent optical band edge absorption shift ranging from 450 to 530 nm (2.8 to 2.3 eV) over a 380 K temperature range with an experimental (dEg/dT)max value extracted to be 1.26 &#215; 10&#8722;3 eV K&#8722;1. This value appreciably lies above most dense conventional semiconductors in the visible range and is comparable to soft lattice solids. We further sought to understand the origin of this unusually sensitive thermochromic behavior and found that it arises from strong electron&#8208;phonon interactions and anharmonic phonons that significantly broaden band edges and lower the Eg with increasing temperature. Our identification of structural signatures resulting to sensitive thermochromism in exfoliable 1D vdW crystals opens avenues in discovering low&#8208;dimensional solids with strong temperature&#8208;dependent optical response across broad spectral windows, dimensionalities, and nanoscale size regimes.

         <title>Approaching Standardization: Mechanical Material Testing of Macroscopic two&#8208;photon Polymerized Specimens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) is becoming increasingly established as additive manufacturing technology for micro&#8208;fabrication due to its high&#8208;resolution and the feasibility of generating complex parts. Until now, the high resolution of 2PP was also its bottleneck, as it limited throughput and therefore restricted the application to the production of micro&#8208;parts. Thus, mechanical properties of 2PP materials could only be characterized using non&#8208;standardized specialized micro&#8208;testing methods. Due to recent advances in 2PP technology, it is now possible to produce parts in the size of several millimeters to even centimeters, finally permitting the fabrication of macro&#8208;sized testing specimens. Besides suitable hardware systems, 2PP materials exhibiting favorable mechanical properties that allow printing of up&#8208;scaled parts are strongly demanded. In this work, the up&#8208;scalability of three different photopolymers is investigated using a high&#8208;throughput 2PP system and low numerical aperture optics. Testing specimens in the cm&#8208;range were produced and tested with common or even standardized material testing methods available in conventionally equipped polymer testing labs. Examples of the characterization of mechanical, thermo&#8208;mechanical, and fracture properties of 2PP processed materials are shown. Additionally, aspects such as post&#8208;processing and aging have been investigated. This lays a foundation for future expansion of the 2PP technology to broader industrial application.

         <title>Polymorphism&#8208;Dependent Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescent Scintillation for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two phenothiazine derivatives exhibiting intriguing polymorphism&#8208;dependent phosphorescent radioluminescence features in the crystal under X&#8208;ray irradiation are synthesized. The results reveal that stabilizing triplet excitons by intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions can achieve efficient X&#8208;ray phosphorescent scintillation. The low detection limit of 278 nGys&#8722;1 of resulting scintillators demonstrates the potential of flexible and low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray radiography.








Abstract
Organic phosphorescent scintillating materials have shown great potential for applications in radiography and radiation detection due to their efficient utilization of excitons. However, revealing the relationship between molecule stacking and the phosphorescent radioluminescence of scintillators is still challenging. This study reports on two phenothiazine derivatives with polymorphism&#8208;dependent phosphorescence radioluminescence. The experiments reveal that molecule stacking significantly affects the non&#8208;radiation decay of the triplet excitons of scintillators, which further determines the phosphorescence scintillation performance under X&#8208;ray irradiation. These phosphorescent scintillators exhibit high radio stability and have a low detection limit of 278 nGys&#8722;1. Additionally, the potential application of these scintillators in X&#8208;ray radiography, based on their X&#8208;ray excited radioluminescence properties, is demonstrated. These findings provide a guideline for obtaining high&#8208;performance phosphorescent scintillating materials by shedding light on the effect of crystal packing on the radioluminescence of organic molecules.

         <title>Supramolecular Hydrogel with Ultra&#8208;Rapid Cell&#8208;Mediated Network Adaptation for Enhancing Cellular Metabolic Energetics and Tissue Regeneration</title>

Abstract
Cellular energetics plays an important role in tissue regeneration, and the enhanced metabolic activity of delivered stem cells can accelerate tissue repair and regeneration. However, conventional hydrogels with limited network cell adaptability restrict cell&#8211;cell interactions and cell metabolic activities. In this work, we showed that a cell&#8208;adaptable hydrogel with high network dynamics enhanced the glucose uptake and fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation (FAO) of encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) compared with a hydrogel with low network dynamics. We further showed that the hMSCs encapsulated in the dynamic hydrogels exhibited increased TCA cycle activity, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and ATP biosynthesis via an E&#8208;cadherin&#8208; and AMPK&#8208;dependent mechanism. The in vivo evaluation further showed that the delivery of MSCs by the dynamic hydrogel enhanced in situ bone regeneration in an animal model. We believe that our findings provide critical insights into the impact of stem cell&#8211;biomaterial interactions on cellular metabolic energetics and the underlying mechanisms.

         <title>Current&#8208;Controllable and Reversible Multi&#8208;Resistance&#8208;State Based on Domain Wall Number Transition in 2D Ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;output state of the resistance is acquired by a pure current strategy based on the manipulation of domain wall number by pulse current under zero magnetic field in the 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. The multi&#8208;output properties can be utilized in the pattern recognition in the neuron computing trained by National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.








Abstract
Controlling the multi&#8208;state switching is significantly essential for the extensive utilization of 2D ferromagnet in magnetic racetrack memories, topological devices, and neuromorphic computing devices. The development of all&#8208;electric functional nanodevices with multi&#8208;state switching and a rapid reset remains challenging. Herein, to imitate the potentiation and depression process of biological synapses, a full&#8208;current strategy is unprecedently established by the controllable resistance&#8208;state switching originating from the spin configuration rearrangement by domain wall number modulation in Fe3GeTe2. In particular, a strong correlation is uncovered in the reduction of domain wall number with the corresponding resistance decreasing by in&#8208;situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, the magnetic state is reversed instantly to the multi&#8208;domain wall state under a single pulse current with a higher amplitude, attributed to the rapid thermal demagnetization by simulation. Based on the neuromorphic computing system with full&#8208;current&#8208;driven artificial Fe3GeTe2 synapses with multi&#8208;state switching, a high accuracy of &#8776;91% is achieved in the handwriting image recognition pattern. The results identify 2D ferromagnet as an intriguing candidate for future advanced neuromorphic spintronics.

         <title>A Holistic Review of C = C Crosslinkable Conjugated Molecules in Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Electronics: Insights into Stability, Processibility, and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C = C Cross&#8208;linking strategy is an effective tool to improve the chem&#8208;physic, optoelectronic, and soluton&#8208;processing capacities of organic conjugated molecules (OCMs) for optoelectronic applications. This review mainly describes the structural type, characterization method, and unique property of the C = C cross&#8208;linking OCMs system, and further summarizes their application in the field of organic optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable organic conjugated molecules (OCMs) consist of a series of aromatic units linked by &#963;&#8208;bonds, which present a relatively freedom intramolecular motion and intermolecular re&#8208;arrangement under external stimulation. The cross&#8208;linked strategy provides an effective platform to obtain OCMs network, which allows for outstanding optoelectronic, excellent physicochemical properties, and substantial improvement in device fabrication. An unsaturated double carbon&#8211;carbon bond (C = C) is universal segment to construct crosslinkable OCMs. In this review, the authors will set C = C cross&#8208;linkable units as an example to summarize the development of cross&#8208;linkable OCMs for solution&#8208;processable optoelectronic applications. First, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the distinctive chemical, physical, and optoelectronic properties arising from the cross&#8208;linking strategies employed in OCMs. Second, the methods for probing the C = C cross&#8208;linking reaction are also emphasized based on the perturbations of chemical structure and physicochemical property. Third, a series of model C = C cross&#8208;linkable units, including styrene, trifluoroethylene, and unsaturated acid ester, are further discussed to design and prepare novel OCMs. Furthermore, a concise overview of the optoelectronic applications associated with this approach is presented, including light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells (SCs), and field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). Lastly, the authors offer a concluding perspective and outlook for the improvement of OCMs and their optoelectronic application via the cross&#8208;linking strategy.

         <title>Super&#8208;Wide Temperature Lasers Spanning from &#8722;180 to 240 &#176;C Based on Fully&#8208;Polymerized Blue Phase Superstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a super&#8208;wide lasing temperature range below 0&#160;&#176;C (&#8722;180&#8211;240&#160;&#176;C) for the first time via a well&#8208;designed fully&#8208;polymerized blue phase liquid crystal to reduce the random crystallization and improve system compatibility. The corresponding laser behaviors and mechanisms are investigated, including a blue shifted lasing wavelength, &#8220;U&#8221; shaped threshold, and excellent photothermal/structural stability of the as&#8208;prepared samples.








Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystal (BPLC) lasers have potential applications in displays, sensors, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting fields owing to their outstanding optical properties. However, there remain challenges on lasing below 0&#160;&#176;C, which significantly limits the potential application of BPLC lasers in low&#8208;temperature environments. In this work, BPLC lasing below 0&#160;&#176;C is realized for the first time in a super&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8722;180&#8211;240&#160;&#176;C using a well&#8208;designed fully&#8208;polymerized BPLC system with a narrow line width of 0.0881&#160;nm and a low lasing threshold of 37&#160;nJ&#160;pulse&#8722;1. This fully&#8208;polymerized BPLC both effectively avoids low&#8208;temperature random crystallization and has excellent compatibility with dye molecules that significantly widen the lasing temperature range below 0&#160;&#176;C. Besides, the variations of laser peak and threshold are also revealed below 0&#160;&#176;C, that is, redshifted laser wavelength and increased threshold value with decreasing temperature, which contribute to a blue&#8208;shifted laser signal and a U&#8208;shaped lasing threshold in &#8722;180&#8211;240&#160;&#176;C. These unique laser behaviors can be ascribed to the temperature&#8208;dependent anisotropically microstructural deformation of the BP lattice. This work not only opens a door to the development of low&#8208;temperature BPLC lasers but also sets out important insights in the design of novel organic optical devices.

         <title>Engineering a Dynamic Solvent&#8208;Phobic Liquid Electrolyte Interphase for Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;phobic dynamic liquid electrolyte interphase (DLEI) on a Li metal surface (Li&#8211;PFbTHF) is developed to improve the cycling performance of practical Li metal batteries in carbonate electrolytes. Evidence from advanced techniques indicated that the C&#8211;F&#8208;rich groups of PFbTHF induce LiF/Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the LiFePO4||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells exhibit long&#8208;term cycling stability and a high rate capacity.








Abstract
The heterogeneity, species diversity, and poor mechanical stability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in conventional carbonate electrolytes result in the irreversible exhaustion of lithium (Li) and electrolytes during cycling, hindering the practical applications of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work proposes a solvent&#8208;phobic dynamic liquid electrolyte interphase (DLEI) on a Li metal (Li&#8211;PFbTHF (perfluoro&#8208;butyltetrahydrofuran)) surface that selectively transports salt and induces salt&#8208;derived SEI formation. The solvent&#8208;phobic DLEI with C&#8211;F&#8208;rich groups dramatically reduces the side reactions between Li, carbonate solvents, and humid air, forming a LiF/Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics demonstrate that DLEI effectively stabilizes the interface between Li metal and the carbonate electrolyte. Specifically, the LiFePO4||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells deliver 80.4% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1.0 C, excellent rate capacity (108.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 C), and 90.2% capacity retention after 550 cycles at 1.0 C in full&#8208;cells (negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 8) with high LiFePO4 loadings (15.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) in carbonate electrolyte. In addition, the 0.55 Ah pouch cell of 252.0&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 delivers stable cycling. Hence, this study provides an effective strategy for controlling salt&#8208;derived SEI to improve the cycling performances of carbonate&#8208;based LMBs.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Material Volumetric Additive Manufacturing of Hydrogels using Gelatin as a Sacrificial Network and 3D Suspension Bath</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gelatin is used to modulate the viscosity of reactive resins to enable their processing into 3D objects with volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM). Gelatin is also used for sequential suspension bath printing and VAM to allow the printing of multi&#8208;material 3D objects with spatial patterning of hydrogels and cells. This advance will expand the utility of VAM printing for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM) is an emerging layerless method for the rapid processing of reactive resins into 3D structures, where printing is much faster (seconds) than other lithography and direct ink writing methods (minutes to hours). As a vial of resin rotates in the VAM process, patterned light exposure defines a 3D object and then resin that has not undergone gelation can be washed away. Despite the promise of VAM, there are challenges with the printing of soft hydrogel materials from non&#8208;viscous precursors, including multi&#8208;material constructs. To address this, sacrificial gelatin is used to modulate resin viscosity to support the cytocompatible VAM printing of macromers based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), hyaluronic acid (HA), and polyacrylamide (PA). After printing, gelatin is removed by washing at an elevated temperature. To print multi&#8208;material constructs, the gelatin&#8208;containing resin is used as a shear&#8208;yielding suspension bath (including HA to further modulate bath properties) where ink can be extruded into the bath to define a multi&#8208;material resin that can then be processed with VAM into a defined object. Multi&#8208;material constructs of methacrylated HA (MeHA)&#160;and gelatin methacrylamide (GelMA)&#160;are printed (as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept) with encapsulated mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), where the local hydrogel properties guide cell spreading behavior with culture.

         <title>Building Stable Solid&#8208;State Potassium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries (SPMBs) are promising candidates for the next generation of energy storage systems for their low cost, safety, and high energy density. However, full SPMBs have not yet been reported due to the K dendrites, interfacial incompatibility, and limited availability of suitable solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Here, we present stable SPMBs using a new iodinated solid polymer electrolyte (ISPE). The functional ions reconstruct ion transport channels, providing efficient potassium ion transport. ISPE shows a combination of high ionic conductivity, superior interfacial compatibility, and electrochemical stability. In&#8208;situ alloying and iodinated interlayer increase K metal compatibility for prolonged cycling with low polarization. Moreover, the ISPE enables SPMBs with Prussian blue cathode stable operation at a high voltage of 4.5&#160;V, a superior rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling over 3,000 cycles (4.2&#160;V versus K+/K) with an ultra&#8208;high coulombic efficiency of 99.94%. More importantly, a classic solid&#8208;state potassium metal pouch cell achieved 4.2&#160;V stable cycling over 800 cycles with an high retention of 93.6%, presenting a new development strategy for secure and high&#8208;performance rechargeable solid&#8208;state potassium metal batteries.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Assembly of Atomically&#8208;Precise Copper Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Accurate structure control in dissipative assemblies is vital for precise biological functions. However, the accuracy and functionality of current artificial dissipative assembly are far from this objective. Herein, we introduce a novel approach by harnessing complex chemical reaction networks (CRN) rooted in coordination chemistry to create well&#8208;defined dissipative assemblies. We designed atomically&#8208;precise Cu nanocluster (CuNCs), specifically Cu11(&#956;9&#8208;Cl)(&#956;3&#8208;Cl)3L6Cl clusters (L = 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;piperazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbodithioate). Cu(I)&#8208;ligand ratio change and dynamic Cu(I)&#8208;Cu(I) metallophilic/coordination interactions enable the reorganization of CuNCs into metastable CuL2, finally converting into the equilibrium [CuL&#183;Y]Cl complexes (Y = MeCN or H2O) via Cu(I) oxidation/reorganization and ligand exchange process. Upon adding fuels (ascorbic acid, AA), the system goes further dissipative cycles. We observed that the encapsulated/bridging halide ions exert a subtle influence on the optical properties of CuNCs and topological changes of polymeric networks when integrating CuNCs as crosslink sites. CuNCs duration and switch period could be controlled by varying the ions, AA concentration, O2 pressure and pH. The unique Cu(I)&#8208;Cu(I) metallophilic and coordination interactions provide a versatile toolbox for designing delicate life&#8208;like materials, paving the way for tailored dissipative assemblies with precise structures and functionalities. Furthermore, these CuNCs can be employed as modular units within polymers for materials mechanics or functionalization studies, expanding their potential applications.

         <title>Chemical Circularity in 3d Printing with Biobased &#916;&#8208;Valerolactone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a vat photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing technology that fabricates parts typically made of chemically crosslinked polymers. The rapidly growing DLP market has an increasing demand for polymer raw materials, along with growing environmental concerns. Therefore, circular DLP printing with a closed&#8208;loop recyclable ink is of great importance for sustainability. The low&#8208;ceiling temperature alkyl&#8208;substituted &#948;&#8208;valerolactone (VL) is an industrially accessible biorenewable feedstock for developing recyclable polymers. In this work, acrylate&#8208;functionalized poly(&#948;&#8208;valerolactone) (PVLA), synthesized through the ring&#8208;opening transesterification polymerization of VL, is used as a platform photoprecursor to improve the chemical circularity in DLP printing. A small portion of photocurable reactive diluent (RD) turns the unprintable PVLA into DLP printable ink. Various photocurable monomers can serve as reactive diluents to modulate the properties of printed thermoplastic or thermoset structures for applications such as sacrificial molds, soft actuators, sensors, etc. The intrinsic depolymerizability of PVLA is well preserved, regardless of whether the printed polymer is a thermoplastic or a crosslinked thermoset. The recovery yield of virgin quality VL monomer is 93% through direct bulk thermolysis of the printed structures. This work proposes the utilization of depolymerizable photoprecursors and highlights the feasibility of biorenewable VL as a versatile material platform toward circular DLP printing.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Compatible Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions with A SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Composite Barrier as Low&#8208;Voltage And Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Speed Memristors</title>

Abstract
The big data era requires ultrafast, low&#8208;power and silicon&#8208;compatible materials and devices for information storage and processing. Ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) have emerged as low&#8208;power and fast memristors; but their operating voltages are high for fast switching speeds, and performances of silicon&#8208;compatible FTJs are significantly poorer than those of perovskite FTJs. Here, FTJs based on SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 composite barrier and both conducting electrodes are designed and fabricated on Si substrates. The FTJ achieves the fastest write speed of 500&#160;ps under 5&#160;V (&#8764;2 orders of magnitude faster than reported silicon&#8208;compatible FTJs) or 10&#160;ns speed at a low voltage of 1.5&#160;V (the lowest voltage among FTJs at similar speeds), low write current density &#8764;1.3 &#215; 104 A cm&#8722;2, 8 discrete states, good retention &gt;&#160;105s at 85&#160;&#176;C and endurance &gt;&#160;107. In addition, it provides a large read current (&#8764;88 A cm&#8722;2) at 0.1&#160;V, &#8764;2 orders of magnitude larger than reported FTJs. Interestingly, in FTJ&#8208;based synapses, gradually tunable conductance states (128 states) with high linearity (&lt;1) are obtained by 10&#160;ns pulses of &lt;1.2&#160;V, and a high accuracy of &#8764;91.8% in recognizing fashion product images is achieved by online neural network simulations. These results highlight that silicon&#8208;compatible HfO2&#8208;based FTJs are promising for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memories and electrical synapses.

         <title>Semimetallic Bismuthene With Edge&#8208;Rich Dangling Bonds: Broad&#8208;spectrum&#8208;driven And Edge&#8208;Confined Electron Enhancement Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Broad&#8208;spectrum&#8208;driven high&#8208;performance artificial photosynthesis is quite challenging. Herein, atomically ultrathin bismuthene with semimetallic properties is designed and demonstrated for broad&#8208;spectrum(UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR)&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The trap states in the bandgap produced by edge dangling bonds prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons from 90&#160;ps in bulk Bi to 1,650&#160;ps in bismuthine, and excited&#8208;state electrons are enriched at the edge of bismuthine. The edge dangling bonds of bismuthene as the active sites for adsorption/activation of CO2 increase the hybridization ability of the Bi 6p orbital and O 2p orbital to significantly reduce the catalytic reaction energy barrier and promote the formation of C&#8208;H bonds until the generation of CH4. Under &#955; &#8805; 400&#160;nm and &#955; &#8805; 550&#160;nm irradiation, the utilization ratios of photogenerated electron reduction CO2 hydrogenation to CO and CH4 for bismuthene are 58.24 and 300.50 times higher than those of bulk Bi, respectively. Moreover, bismuthene can extend the CO2 hydrogenation reaction to the near&#8208;infrared region (&#955; &#8805; 700&#160;nm). This pioneering work employs the single semimetal element as an artificial photosynthetic catalyst to produce a broad spectral response.

Proton&#8208;assisted assembly, inspired by Mussel's underwater adhesion, promises scalable but swift self&#8208;limiting assembly of functional nanoparticles for industrial mass production. The efficient transport of nanoparticles is realized from a microscopic volume of water into the wafer&#8208;scale monolayers within several seconds, stemming from the electrostatically accelerated nanoparticle's diffusion.








Abstract
Underwater adhesion processes in nature promise controllable assembly of functional nanoparticles for industrial mass production; However, their artificial strategies have faced challenges to uniformly transfer nanoparticles into a monolayer, particularly those below 100&#160;nm in size, over large areas. Here a scalable &#8220;one&#8208;shot&#8221; self&#8208;limiting nanoparticle transfer technique is presented, enabling the efficient transport of nanoparticles from water in microscopic volumes to an entire 2&#8208;inch wafer in a remarkably short time of 10 seconds to reach near&#8208;maximal surface coverage (&#8776;40%) in a 2D mono&#8208;layered fashion. Employing proton engineering in electrostatic assembly accelerates the diffusion of nanoparticles (over 50 &#181;m2/s), resulting in a hundredfold faster coating speed than the previously reported results in the literature. This charge&#8208;sensitive process further enables &#8220;pick&#8208;and&#8208;place&#8221; nanoparticle patterning at the wafer scale, with large flexibility in surface materials, including flexible metal oxides and 3D&#8208;printed polymers. As a result, the fabrication of wafer&#8208;scale disordered plasmonic metasurfaces in seconds is successfully demonstrated. These metasurfaces exhibit consistent resonating colors across diverse material and geometrical platforms, showcasing their potential for applications in full&#8208;color painting and optical encryption devices.
