         <title>Microfluidic Platform for Generating and Releasing Patient&#8208;Derived Cancer Organoids with Diverse Shapes: Insight into Shape&#8208;Dependent Tumor Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;ReSCUE&#8221; (Recoverable&#8208;Spheroid&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip with Unrestricted External Shape), a multi&#8208;layer microfluidic platform that facilitates the generation and selective release of uniformly sized soft matter structures, including organoids and tumoroids is introduced. This platform allows for targeted recovery and in&#8208;depth analysis of breast cancer patient&#8208;derived organoids (PDOs), enabling investigations into how tumor morphology influences tumor growth and cancer cell proliferation.








Abstract
Multicellular spheroids and patient&#8208;derived organoids find many applications in fundamental research, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine. Advances in the understanding and recapitulation of organ functionality and disease development require the generation of complex organoid models, including organoids with diverse morphologies. Microfluidics&#8208;based cell culture platforms enable time&#8208;efficient confined organoid generation. However, the ability to form organoids with different shapes with a subsequent transfer from microfluidic devices to unconstrained environments for studies of morphology&#8208;dependent organoid growth is yet to be demonstrated. Here, a microfluidic platform is introduced that enables high&#8208;fidelity formation and addressable release of breast cancer organoids with diverse shapes. Using this platform, the impact of organoid morphology on their growth in unconstrained biomimetic hydrogel is explored. It is shown that proliferative cancer cells tend to localize in high positive curvature organoid regions, causing their faster growth, while the overall growth pattern of organoids with diverse shapes tends to reduce interfacial tension at the organoid&#8208;hydrogel interface. In addition to the formation of organoids with diverse morphologies, this platform can be integrated into multi&#8208;tissue micro&#8208;physiological systems.

         <title>Sliding Ferroelectricity Induced Ultrafast Switchable Photovoltaic Response in &#949;&#8208;InSe Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the odd&#8208;even layer&#8208;dependence of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity in &#949;&#8208;InSe. The device based on the &#949;&#8208;InSe achieves an on/off ratio of 10&#8308; in ferroelectric tunneling junction and ultrafast bulk photovoltaic response in photodetector in the near&#8208;infrared band. Moreover, the photoresponse in &#949;&#8208;InSe can even exceed graphene in the same conditions, confirming the possibility of application in multifunctional devices.








Abstract
2D sliding ferroelectric semiconductors have greatly expanded the ferroelectrics family with the flexibility of bandgap and material properties, which hold great promise for ultrathin device applications that combine ferroelectrics with optoelectronics. Besides the induced different resistance states for non&#8208;volatile memories, the switchable ferroelectric polarizations can also modulate the photogenerated carriers for potentially ultrafast optoelectronic devices. Here, it is demonstrated that the room temperature sliding ferroelectricity can be used for ultrafast switchable photovoltaic response in &#949;&#8208;InSe layers. By first&#8208;principles calculations and experimental characterizations, it is revealed that the ferroelectricity with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) polarization only exists in even layer &#949;&#8208;InSe. The ferroelectricity is also demonstrated in &#949;&#8208;InSe&#8208;based vertical devices, which exhibit high on&#8208;off ratios (&#8776;104) and non&#8208;volatile storage capabilities. Moreover, the OOP ferroelectricity enables an ultrafast (&#8776;3&#160;ps) bulk photovoltaic response in the near&#8208;infrared band, rendering it a promising material for self&#8208;powered reconfigurable and ultrafast photodetector. This work reveals the essential role of ferroelectric polarization on the photogenerated carrier dynamics and paves the way for hybrid multifunctional ferroelectric and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Recyclable Ionogel with High Mechanical Robustness Based on Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contradictory requirements of recyclability and robustness of ionogels are resolved by incorporating covalent adaptable networks (CANs), resulting in a closed&#8208;loop recyclable, elastic, tough, durable, and solvent&#8208;resistant ionogel. This ionogel demonstrates robust strain sensing performance under harsh mechanical conditions and is applied for reconfigurable multimodal sensing due to its recyclability.








Abstract
Ionogels are an emerging class of soft materials for flexible electronics, with high ionic conductivity, low volatility, and mechanical stretchability. Recyclable ionogels are recently developed to address the sustainability crisis of current electronics, through the introduction of non&#8208;covalent bonds. However, this strategy sacrifices mechanical robustness and chemical stability, severely diminishing the potential for practical application. Here, covalent adaptable networks (CANs) are incorporated into ionogels, where dynamic covalent crosslinks endow high strength (11.3&#160;MPa tensile strength), stretchability (2396% elongation at break), elasticity (energy loss coefficient of 0.055 at 100% strain), and durability (5000 cycles of 150% strain). The reversible nature of CANs allows the ionogel to be closed&#8208;loop recyclable for up to ten times. Additionally, the ionogel is toughened by physical crosslinks between conducting ions and polymer networks, breaking the common dilemma in enhancing mechanical properties and electrical conductivity. The ionogel demonstrates robust strain sensing performance under harsh mechanical treatments and is applied for reconfigurable multimodal sensing based on its recyclability. This study provides insights into improving the mechanical and electrical properties of ionogels toward functionally reliable and environmentally sustainable bioelectronics.

         <title>Bidirectional Vectorial Holography Using Bi&#8208;Layer Metasurfaces and Its Application to Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material&#160;systems with direction&#8208;asymmetric transport properties are scientifically intrguing with various potential applications. This study presents optical bi&#8208;layer metasurfaces that achieve generalized asymmetric transmission for any input polarization. Experimental results demonstrate polarization&#8208;direction&#8208;multiplexed vectorial holograms, enabling advanced optical encryption and paving the way for future applications in optical computation, sensing, and imaging.








Abstract
The field of optical systems with asymmetric responses has grown significantly due to their various potential applications. Janus metasurfaces are noteworthy for their ability to control light asymmetrically at the pixel level within thin films. However, previous demonstrations are restricted to the partial control of asymmetric transmission for a limited set of input polarizations, focusing primarily on scalar functionalities. Here, optical bi&#8208;layer metasurfaces that achieve a fully generalized form of asymmetric transmission for any input polarization are presented. The designs owe much to the theoretical model of asymmetric transmission in reciprocal systems, which elucidates the relationship between front&#8208; and back&#8208;side Jones matrices in general cases. This model reveals a fundamental correlation between the polarization&#8208;direction channels of opposing sides. To circumvent this constraint, partitioning the transmission space is utilized&#160;to realize four distinct vector functionalities within the target volume. As a proof of concept, polarization&#8208;direction&#8208;multiplexed Janus vectorial holograms generating four vectorial holographic images are experimentally demonstrated. When integrated with computational vector polarizer arrays, this approach enables optical encryption with a high level of obscurity. The proposed&#160;mathematical framework and novel material systems for generalized asymmetric transmission may pave the way for applications such as optical computation, sensing, and imaging.

         <title>Biomimetic Multichannel Silk Nerve Conduits With Multicellular Spatiotemporal Distributions for Spinal Cord Injury Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the ingenious anatomy of natural spinal cords, a biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduit (BNC@MSCs/SCs) with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions in its hierarchical channel structures is presented. It is further demonstrated in rats that the BNC@MSCs/SCs can facilitate nerve regeneration and function recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI).








Abstract
Bioengineered nerve conduits have shown great promise for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair, while their practical values are limited by poor regenerative efficacy and lack of multi&#8208;level structural design. Here, inspired by the ingenious anatomy of natural spinal cords, a biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduit (namely BNC@MSCs/SCs) with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions for effective SCI repair is presented. The biomimetic silk nerve conduit (BNC) with hierarchical channels and aligned pore structures is prepared via a modified directional freeze&#8208;casting strategy. Such hierarchical structures provide appropriate space for the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Schwann cells (SCs) settled in specific channels, which contributes to the generation of BNC@MSCs/SCs resembling the cellular spatiotemporal distributions of natural spinal cords. The in vitro results reveal the facilitated SC migration and MSC differentiation in such BNC@MSCs/SCs multicellular system, which further promotes the tube formation and cell migration of endothelial cells as well as M2 polarization of macrophages. Moreover, BNC@MSCs/SCs can effectively promote the tissue repair and function recovery in SCI rats by attenuating glial scar formation while promoting neuron regeneration and myelin sheath reconstruction. Thus, it is believed that the biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduits with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions are valuable for SCI repair and other neural tissue regeneration.

     alt="Biomimetic Multichannel Silk Nerve Conduits With Multicellular Spatiotemporal Distributions for Spinal Cord Injury Repair"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the ingenious anatomy of natural spinal cords, a biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduit (BNC@MSCs/SCs) with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions in its hierarchical channel structures is presented. It is further demonstrated in rats that the BNC@MSCs/SCs can facilitate nerve regeneration and function recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioengineered nerve conduits have shown great promise for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair, while their practical values are limited by poor regenerative efficacy and lack of multi-level structural design. Here, inspired by the ingenious anatomy of natural spinal cords, a biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduit (namely BNC@MSCs/SCs) with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions for effective SCI repair is presented. The biomimetic silk nerve conduit (BNC) with hierarchical channels and aligned pore structures is prepared via a modified directional freeze-casting strategy. Such hierarchical structures provide appropriate space for the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Schwann cells (SCs) settled in specific channels, which contributes to the generation of BNC@MSCs/SCs resembling the cellular spatiotemporal distributions of natural spinal cords. The in vitro results reveal the facilitated SC migration and MSC differentiation in such BNC@MSCs/SCs multicellular system, which further promotes the tube formation and cell migration of endothelial cells as well as M2 polarization of macrophages. Moreover, BNC@MSCs/SCs can effectively promote the tissue repair and function recovery in SCI rats by attenuating glial scar formation while promoting neuron regeneration and myelin sheath reconstruction. Thus, it is believed that the biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduits with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions are valuable for SCI repair and other neural tissue regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extracellular Silica Nanomatrices Promote In Vitro Maturation of Anti&#8208;tumor Dendritic Cells via Activation of Focal Adhesion Kinase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silica nanozigzags (NZs) facilitate the in vitro maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) via mechanoactivation of focal adhesion kinase. The NZ&#8208;maturated DCs in vitro prime the cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocytes (CTLs) into the programmed cell death protein&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)lowCD44high effector memory CTLs, and in vivo suppress the growth of tumors, indicating a promising new strategy for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The efficacy of dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based cancer vaccines is critically determined by the functionalities of in vitro maturated DCs. The maturation of DCs typically relies on chemicals that are cytotoxic or hinder the ability of DCs to efficiently activate the antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocytes (CTLs) against tumors. Herein, the maturation chemicals are replaced with extracellular silica nanomatrices, fabricated by glancing angle deposition, to promote in vitro maturation of murine bone marrow&#8208;derived DCs (mBMDCs). The extracellular nanomatrices composed of silica nanozigzags (NZs) enable the generation of mature mBMDCs with upregulated levels of co&#8208;stimulatory molecules, C&#8208;C chemokine receptor type&#8208;7, X&#8208;C motif chemokine recetpor&#8208;1, DC&#8208;specific ICAM&#8208;3 grabbing nonintegrin, and enhanced endocytic capacity. The in vitro maturation is partially governed by focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that is mechanically activated in the curved cell adhesions formed at the DC&#8208;NZ interfaces. The NZ&#8208;maturated mBMDCs can prime the antigen&#8208;specific CTLs into programmed cell death protein&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)lowCD44high memory phenotypes in vitro and suppress the growth of tumors in vivo. Meanwhile, the NZ&#8208;mediated beneficial effects are also observed in human monocyte&#8208;derived DCs. This work demonstrates that the silica NZs promote the anti&#8208;tumor capacity of in vitro maturated DCs via the mechanoactivation of FAK, supporting the potential of silica NZs being a promising biomaterial for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Ion Interaction Prompted Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte for Room&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article unveils an interaction between polymer and solvent in a gel electrolyte for lithium&#8208;ion battery, that the polymer's polar group can participate in Li+ solvation structure and thereby inhibit the notorious solvent co&#8208;intercalation in graphite anode and excessive side reactions in Si and Li anodes. The quasi&#8208;solid gel electrolytes are beneficial for large current density operation, long&#8208;term cycling, or safety enhancement.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries using quasi&#8208;solid gel electrolytes (QSEs) have gained increasing interest due to their enhanced safety features. However, their commercial viability is hindered by low ionic conductivity and poor solid&#8211;solid contact interfaces. In this study, a QSE synthesized by in situ polymerizing methyl methacrylate (MMA) in 1,2&#8211;dimethoxyethane (DME)&#8208;based electrolyte is introduced, which exhibits remarkable performance in high&#8208;loading graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) pouch cells. Owing to the unique solvent&#8208;lacking solvation structure, the graphite exfoliation caused by the well&#8208;known solvent co&#8208;intercalation is prohibited, and this unprecedented phenomenon is found to be universal for other graphite&#8208;unfriendly solvents. The high ionic conductivity and great interfacial contact provided by DME enable the quasi&#8208;solid graphite||NCM811 pouch cell to demonstrate superior C&#8208;rate capability even at a high cathode mass loading (17.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8208;2), surpassing liquid carbonate electrolyte cells. Meanwhile, the optimized QSE based on carbonates exhibits excellent cycle life (92.4% capacity retention after 1700 cycles at 0.5C/0.5C) and reliable safety under harsh conditions. It also outperforms liquid electrolytes in other high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries with larger volume change. These findings elucidate the polymer's pivotal role in QSEs, offering new insights for advancing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery commercialization.

         <title>A High&#8208;Rate and Ultrastable Re2Te5/MXene Anode for Potassium Storage Enabled by Amorphous/Crystalline Heterointerface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterointerface engineering strategy is proposed to prepare a novel superstructure composed of amorphous/crystalline Re2Te5 strongly anchored on MXene substrate (A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene) for fast and stable potassium storage performance. The engineered A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene anode demonstrates high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability, and superb cyclability, as well as reliable operation in flexible potassium ion full cell.








Abstract
The pursuit of anode materials capable of rapid and reversible potassium storage performance is a challenging yet fascinating target. Herein, a heterointerface engineering strategy is proposed to prepare a novel superstructure composed of amorphous/crystalline Re2Te5 anchored on MXene substrate (A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene) as an advanced anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs). The A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene anode exhibits outstanding reversible capacity (350.4 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (162.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), remarkable long&#8208;term cycling capability (186.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 over 5000 cycles), and reliable operation in flexible full KIBs, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal chalcogenides&#8208;based devices. Experimental and theoretical investigations attribute this high performance to the synergistic effect of the A/C&#8208;Re2Te5 with a built&#8208;in electric field and the elastic MXene, enabling improved pseudocapacitive contribution, accelerated charge transfer behavior, and high K+ ion adsorption/diffusion ability. Meanwhile, a combination of intercalation and conversion reactions mechanism is observed within A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene. This work offers a new approach for developing metal tellurides&#8208; and MXene&#8208;based anodes for achieving stable cyclability and fast&#8208;charging KIBs.

         <title>Biodegradable Piezoelectric&#8208;Conductive Integrated Hydrogel Scaffold for Repair of Osteochondral Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric&#8208;conductive scaffold composed of a piezoelectric cartilage&#8208;decellularized extracellular matrix and piezoelectric&#8208;conductive modified gelatin is reported. In vivo implantation experiments in Parma pig show that piezoelectric&#8208;conductive hydrogel scaffold achieves promising repair results, providing a versatile platform for tissue engineering.








Abstract
Osteochondral injury is a prevalent condition for which no specific treatment is currently available. This study presents a piezoelectric&#8208;conductive scaffold composed of a piezoelectric cartilage&#8208;decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) and piezoelectric&#8208;conductive modified gelatin (Gel&#8208;PC). The piezoelectricity of the scaffold is achieved through the modification of diphenylalanine (FF) assembly on the pore surface, while the conductive properties of scaffold are achieved by the incorporating poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene). In vitro experiments demonstrate that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) undergo biphasic division during differentiation. In vivo studies using a Parma pig model of osteochondral defects demonstrate that the piezoelectric&#8208;conductive scaffold exhibits superior reparative efficacy. Notably, the generation of electrical stimulation is linked to joint movement. During joint activity, mechanical forces compress the scaffold, leading to deformation and the subsequent generation of an electric potential difference. The positive charges accumulated on the upper layer of the scaffold attract BMSCs, promoting their migration to the upper layer and chondrogenic differentiation. Meanwhile, the negative charges in the lower layer induce the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Overall, this piezoelectric&#8208;conducive scaffold provides a promising platform for the effective repair of osteochondral defects.

During joint activity, mechanical forces compress the scaffold, leading to deformation and the subsequent generation of an electric potential difference. The positive charges accumulated on the upper layer of the scaffold attract BMSCs, promoting their migration to the upper layer and chondrogenic differentiation. Meanwhile, the negative charges in the lower layer induce the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Overall, this piezoelectric-conducive scaffold provides a promising platform for the effective repair of osteochondral defects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Carbon Dots with Intrinsic Photochromism and In Situ Radical Afterglow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is proposed to integrate afterglow and photochromism in carbon dots (CDs) by constructing the embedded naphthalene imide (NI) structure and encapsulating the CDs using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Significantly, good appearance color tunability from colorless to brown, wide transition of luminous color from blue to yellow, and much elongated afterglow with lifetime up to 253 ms are observed.








Abstract
The combination of advanced photoluminescence characteristics to photochromism is highly attractive in preparing high&#8208;performance multifunctional photo&#8208;responsive materials for optoelectronic applications. However, this is rather challenging in material design owing to the limited mechanism understanding and construction principles. Here, an effective strategy to integrate photochromism and afterglow emission in carbon dots (CDs) is proposed through embedding naphthaleneimide (NI) structure in CDs followed by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) encapsulation. The NI&#8208;structured CDs&#8208;PVP shows intrinsic photochromism owing to the in situ formation of NI&#8208;radical anions and controllable multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive afterglow behaviors related to the oxygen&#8208;trigged triplet exciton quenching and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the pristine CDs to the photoactivated CDs radicals. Notably, a wide range of appearance colors from colorless to brown, luminescence color transition from blue to yellow, and much elongated afterglow lifetime up to 253&#160;ms are observed. With the extraordinary stimuli&#8208;chromic and stimuli&#8208;luminescent CDs&#8208;PVP film dynamically responsive to multiple external stimuli, reversible secure snapchat, data encryption/decryption and synaptic imaging recognition are realized. These findings demonstrate a fundamental principle to design multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive photochromic CDs with afterglow, providing important understandings on the synergic mechanism of dynamic photochromism and emission behaviors and thereby expanding their applications in advanced information anti&#8208;counterfeiting and artificial intelligence.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Toward Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;free mesoporous NiO catalyst with a favorable local reaction environment is reported to catalyze selective CO2 reduction toward ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 75.2%. The C&#8722;C bond forms via the direct coupling of *CO2&#8208;COOH on NiO, which transforms to ethanol energetically through the *COCOH and *OC2H5 pathway. The findings provide a new perspective of C&#8722;C coupling toward C2+ synthesis, distinctive from that on Cu catalysts.








Abstract
The electroreduction of CO2 offers a sustainable route to generate synthetic fuels. Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been developed to produce value&#8208;added C2+ alcohols; however, the limited understanding of complex C&#8722;C coupling and reaction pathway hinders the development of efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ alcohols catalysts. Herein, a Cu&#8208;free, highly mesoporous NiO catalyst, derived from the microphase separation of a block copolymer,&#160;is reported, which achieves selective CO2 reduction toward ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 75.2% at &#8722;0.6&#160;V versus RHE. The dense mesopores create a favorable local reaction environment with CO2&#8208;rich and H2O&#8208;deficient interfaces, suppressing hydrogen evolution and maximizing catalytic activity of NiO for CO2 reduction. Importantly, the C1&#8208;feeding experiments, in situ spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations consistently show that the direct coupling of *CO2 and *COOH is responsible for C&#8722;C bond formation on NiO, and subsequent reduction of *CO2&#8208;COOH to ethanol is energetically facile through the *COCOH and *OC2H5 pathway. The unconventional C&#8722;C coupling mechanism on NiO, in contrast to the *CO dimerization on Cu, is triggered by strong CO2 adsorption on the polarized Ni2+&#8208;O2&#8722; sites. The work not only demonstrates a highly selective Cu&#8208;free Ni&#8208;based alternative for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ alcohols transformation but also provides a new perspective on C&#8722;C coupling toward C2+ synthesis.

         <title>Squid&#8208;Inspired Anti&#8208;Salt Skin&#8208;Like Elastomers With Superhigh Damage Resistance for Aquatic Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of reflectin proteins in cephalopod skins, the introduction of cation&#8208;&#960; interaction into polyurethane constructs a skin&#8208;like elastomer with extraordinary damage resistance properties (103.7 &#177; 45.7 kJ m&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term anti&#8208;salt&#160;performance. The combined advantages render the present elastomer highly promising for aquatic applications, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by sweat, in vivo, and&#160;harsh oceanic environments.








Abstract
Cephalopod skins evolve multiple functions in response to environmental adaptation, encompassing nonlinear mechanoreponse, damage tolerance property, and resistance to seawater. Despite tremendous progress in skin&#8208;mimicking materials, the integration of these desirable properties into a single material system remains an ongoing challenge. Here, drawing inspiration from the structure of reflectin proteins in cephalopod skins, a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;salt elastomer with skin&#8208;like nonlinear mechanical properties and extraordinary damage resistance properties is presented. Cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is incorporated to induce the geometrically confined nanophases of hydrogen bond domains, resulting in elastomers with exceptional true tensile strength (456.5 &#177; 68.9&#160;MPa) and unprecedently high fracture energy (103.7 &#177; 45.7&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Furthermore, the cation&#8208;&#960; interaction effectively protects the hydrogen bond domains from corrosion by high&#8208;concentration saline solution. The utilization of the resultant skin&#8208;like elastomer has been demonstrated by aquatic soft robotics capable of grasping sharp objects. The combined advantages render the present elastomer highly promising for salt enviroment applications, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by sweat, in vivo, and harsh oceanic environments.

         <title>Weakening the Space Charge Layer Effect Through Tethered Anion Electrolyte and Piezoelectric Effect Toward Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the space charge layer dilemma, a physical (PbTiO3)/chemical (AMPS&#8208;Zn) barrier is designed to construct stable zinc ion flow and disrupt the gradient of anion concentration by coupling the ferroelectric effect with tethered anion electrolyte. Through numerical simulations and analyses, it is discovered that a high Zn2+ transference number can effectively weaken the SCL.








Abstract
The space charge layer (SCL) dilemma, caused by mobile anion concentration gradient and the rapid consumption of cations, is the fundamental reason for the generation of zinc dendrites, especially under high&#8208;rate discharge conditions. To address the issue, a physical (PbTiO3)/chemical (AMPS&#8208;Zn) barrier is designed to construct stable zinc ion flow and disrupt the gradient of anion concentration by coupling the ferroelectric effect with tethered anion electrolyte. The ferroelectric materials PbTiO3 with extreme&#8208;high piezoelectric constant can spontaneously generate an internal electric field to accelerate the movement of zinc ions, and the polyanionic polymer AMPS&#8208;Zn can repel mobile anions and disrupt the anions concentration gradient by tethering anions. Through numerical simulations and analyses, it is discovered that a high Zn2+ transference number can effectively weaken the SCL, thus suppressing the occurrence of zinc dendrites and parasitic side reactions. Consequently, an asymmetric cell using the PbTiO3@Zn demonstrates a reversible plating/stripping performance for 2900&#160;h, and an asymmetric cell reaches a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art runtime of 3450&#160;h with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98%. Furthermore, the PbTiO3@Zn/I2 battery demonstrated an impressive capacity retention rate of 84.0% over 65000 cycles by employing a slender Zn anode.

         <title>Accurate Simulation for 2D Lubricating Materials in Realistic Environments: From Classical to Quantum Mechanical Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective reviews the simulation methods from classical to quantum mechanical ones for 2D lubricating materials in realistic environments and emphasizes the importance of quantum method in revealing atomic and electronic mechanisms. An effective simulation method based on ab initio molecular dynamics is proposed to try to provide more ways to reveal the friction mechanisms and guide the material design.








Abstract
2D materials such as graphene, MoS2, and hexagonal BN are the most advanced solid lubricating materials with superior friction and anti&#8208;wear performance. However, as a typical surface phenomenon, the lubricating properties of 2D materials are largely dependent on the surrounding environment, such as temperature, stress, humidity, oxygen, and other environmental substances. Given the technical challenges in experiment for real&#8208;time and in situ detection of microscopic environment&#8211;material interaction, recent years have witnessed the acceleration of computational research on the lubrication behavior of 2D materials in realistic environments. This study reviews the up&#8208;to&#8208;date computational studies for the effect of environmental factors on the lubrication performance of 2D materials, summarizes the theoretical methods in lubrication from classical to quantum&#8208;mechanics ones, and emphasizes the importance of quantum method in revealing the lubrication mechanism at atomic and electronic level. An effective simulation method based on ab initio molecular dynamics is also proposed to try to provide more ways to accurately reveal the friction mechanisms and reliably guide the lubricating material design. On the basis of current development, future prospects, and challenges for the simulation and modeling in lubrication with realistic environment are&#160;outlined.

&lt;p&gt;2D materials such as graphene, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and hexagonal BN are the most advanced solid lubricating materials with superior friction and anti-wear performance. However, as a typical surface phenomenon, the lubricating properties of 2D materials are largely dependent on the surrounding environment, such as temperature, stress, humidity, oxygen, and other environmental substances. Given the technical challenges in experiment for real-time and in situ detection of microscopic environment&#8211;material interaction, recent years have witnessed the acceleration of computational research on the lubrication behavior of 2D materials in realistic environments. This study reviews the up-to-date computational studies for the effect of environmental factors on the lubrication performance of 2D materials, summarizes the theoretical methods in lubrication from classical to quantum-mechanics ones, and emphasizes the importance of quantum method in revealing the lubrication mechanism at atomic and electronic level. An effective simulation method based on ab initio molecular dynamics is also proposed to try to provide more ways to accurately reveal the friction mechanisms and reliably guide the lubricating material design.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts for the Conversion of CO2 into High&#8208;Value C2+ Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on recent advancements in the synthesis and characterization of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs) utilized in photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and thermocatalytic processes aimed at converting CO2 into valuable C2+ chemicals. It also provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of developing efficient ADCs for the synthesis of value&#8208;added CO2&#8208;based C2+ products.








Abstract
The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value&#8208;added chemicals with two or more carbons (C2+) is a promising strategy that cannot only mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions but also reduce the excessive dependence on fossil feedstocks. In recent years, atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs), including single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), and single&#8208;cluster catalysts (SCCs), emerged as attractive candidates for CO2 fixation reactions due to their unique properties, such as the maximum utilization of active sites, tunable electronic structure, the efficient elucidation of catalytic mechanism, etc. This review provides an overview of significant progress in the synthesis and characterization of ADCs utilized in photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and thermocatalytic conversion of CO2 toward high&#8208;value C2+ compounds. To provide insights for designing efficient ADCs toward the C2+ chemical synthesis originating from CO2, the key factors that influence the catalytic activity and selectivity are highlighted. Finally, the relevant challenges and opportunities are discussed to inspire new ideas for the generation of CO2&#8208;based C2+ products over ADCs.

The rich structural diversity of bio&#8208;based raw materials open unprecedented opportunities for various types of functional thermosetting resins inaccessible in conventional petrochemical&#8208;based materials. Recent advances in the field of functional bio&#8208;based thermosetting resins are presented, with a particular focus on molecular structures and design strategies for discovering functional properties.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in bio&#8208;based thermosetting resins in terms of environmental concerns and the desire for sustainable industrial practices. Beyond sustainability, utilizing the structural diversity of renewable feedstock to craft bio&#8208;based thermosets with customized functionalities is very worthy of expectation. There exist many bio&#8208;based compounds with inherently unique chemical structures and functions, some of which are even difficult to synthesize artificially. Over the past decade, great efforts are devoted to discovering/designing functional properties of bio&#8208;based thermosets, and notable progress have been made in antibacterial, antifouling, flame retardancy, serving as carbon precursors, and stimuli responsiveness, among others, largely expanding their application potential and future prospects. In this review, recent advances in the field of functional bio&#8208;based thermosets are presented, with a particular focus on molecular structures and design strategies for discovering functional properties. Examples are highlighted wherein functionalities are facilitated by the inherent structures of bio&#8208;based feedstock.

         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the factors that affect the stability of anodes and discusses the corresponding strategies for prolonging the anode lifetime, including designing catalytic materials, electrolyte optimization, and electrolyzer design. Furthermore, several methods for rapid stability assessment are proposed for the fast screening of both highly active and stable catalysts/electrodes.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production is a sustainable and economical approach that can mitigate the energy crisis and global warming issues. Although various catalysts/electrodes with excellent activities have been developed for high&#8208;efficiency seawater electrolysis, their unsatisfactory durability, especially for anodes, severely impedes their industrial applications. In this review, attention is paid to the factors that affect the stability of anodes and the corresponding strategies for designing catalytic materials to prolong the anode's lifetime. In addition, two important aspects&#8212;electrolyte optimization and electrolyzer design&#8212;with respect to anode stability improvement are summarized. Furthermore, several methods for rapid stability assessment are proposed for the fast screening of both highly active and stable catalysts/electrodes. Finally, perspectives on future investigations aimed at improving the stability of seawater electrolysis systems are outlined.

         <title>2D Materials&#8208;Based Thermal Interface Materials: Structure, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into high&#8208;performance thermal interface materials (TIMs) based on 2D materials like graphene/boron nitride, pivotal for heat management in advanced electronics. Focusing on their structural attributes, properties, and applications, it differentiates from other reviews by emphasizing their developmental history, addressing critical challenges, and proposing solutions. Additionally, it introduces other 2D materials&#8208;based TIMs, providing insights for future advancements.








Abstract
The challenges associated with heat dissipation in high&#8208;power electronic devices used in communication, new energy, and aerospace equipment have spurred an urgent need for high&#8208;performance thermal interface materials (TIMs) to establish efficient heat transfer pathways from the heater (chip) to heat sinks. Recently, emerging 2D materials, such as graphene and boron nitride, renowned for their ultrahigh basal&#8208;plane thermal conductivity and the capacity to facilitate cross&#8208;scale, multi&#8208;morphic structural design, have found widespread use as thermal fillers in the production of high&#8208;performance TIMs. To deepen the understanding of 2D material&#8208;based TIMs, this review focuses primarily on graphene and boron nitride&#8208;based TIMs, exploring their structures, properties, and applications. Building on this foundation, the developmental history of these TIMs is emphasized and a detailed analysis of critical challenges and potential solutions is provided. Additionally, the preparation and application of some other novel 2D materials&#8208;based TIMs are briefly introduced, aiming to offer constructive guidance for the future development of high&#8208;performance TIMs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Reversible Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier Systems: From Hydrogen Carriers to Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are a novel approach for hydrogen storage with the merits of high hydrogen storage capacity, safety, and long&#8208;distance transportation. The recent significant advances of two components in one reversible LOHC system, namely as hydrogen carriers and catalysts, are summarized with comparatives. The current challenges and outlook of this promising technology are also described.








Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) have gained significant attention for large&#8208;scale hydrogen storage due to their remarkable gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (HSC) and compatibility with existing oil and gas transportation networks for long&#8208;distance transport. However, the practical application of reversible LOHC systems has been constrained by the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of hydrogen carriers and the performances of associated catalysts in the (de)hydrogenation cycles. To overcome these challenges, thermodynamically favored carriers, high&#8208;performance catalysts, and catalytic procedures need to be developed. Here, significant advances in recent years have been summarized, primarily centered on regular LOHC systems catalyzed by homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, including dehydrogenative aromatization of cycloalkanes to arenes and N&#8208;heterocyclics to N&#8208;heteroarenes, as well as reverse hydrogenation processes. Furthermore, with the development of metal complexes for dehydrogenative coupling, a new family of reversible LOHC systems based on alcohols is described that can release H2 under relatively mild conditions. Finally, views on the next steps and challenges in the field of LOHC technology are provided, emphasizing new resources for low&#8208;cost hydrogen carriers, high&#8208;performance catalysts, catalytic technologies, and application scenarios.

         <title>Designing Advanced Amorphous/Nanocrystalline Alloys by Controlling the Energy State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to the modification of composition and structure, the functional properties of amorphous alloys can be improved by changing the energy state. For example, superior catalytic performance, soft magnetism, thermal stability, and magnetocaloric effect can be achieved by designing proper energy states. The correlation between the relaxuns of enthalpy and different properties is reviewed.








Abstract
Amorphous alloys, also known as metallic glasses, exhibit many advanced mechanical, physical, and chemical properties. Owing to the nonequilibrium nature, their energy states can vary over a wide range. However, the energy relaxation kinetics are very complex and composed of various types that are coupled with each other. This makes it challenging to control the energy state precisely and to study the energy&#8208;properties relationship. This brief review introduces the recent progresses on studying the enthalpy relaxation kinetics during isothermal annealing, for example, the observation of two&#8208;step relaxation phenomenon, the detection of relaxation unit (relaxun), the key role of large activation entropy in triggering memory effect, the influence of glass energy state on nanocrystallization. Based on the above knowledge, a new strategy is proposed to design a series of amorphous alloys and their composites consisting of nanocrystals and glass matrix with superior functional properties by precisely controlling the nonequilibrium energy states. As the typical examples, Fe&#8208;based amorphous alloys with both advanced soft magnetism and good plasticity, Gd&#8208;based amorphous/nanocrystalline composites with large magnetocaloric effect, and Fe&#8208;based amorphous alloys with high catalytic performance are specifically described.

         <title>Tempospatially Confined Catalytic Membranes for Advanced Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically summarizes recent representative studies on catalytic membranes (CMs) for advanced water remediation, paying attention to both thermodynamics and mass transfer kinetics mechanism. A rational design framework of tempospatially confined CM is proposed initiatively, involving the materials selection, catalytic oxidation system selection, pore microstructure design according to the tempospatial confinement, CM fabrication, and application.








Abstract
The application of homogeneous catalysts in water remediation is limited by their excessive chemical and energy input, weak regenerability, and potential leaching. Heterogeneous catalytic membranes (CMs) offer a new approach to facilitate efficient, selective, and continuous pollutant degradation. Thus, integrating membranes and continuous filtration with heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can promote thermodynamic and kinetic mass transfers in spatially confined intrapores and facilitate diffusion&#8208;reaction processes. Despite the remarkable advantages of heterogeneous CMs, their engineering application is practically restricted due to the fuzzy design criteria for specific applications. Herein, the recent advances in CMs for advanced water remediation are critically reviewed and the design flow for tempospatially confined CMs is proposed. Further, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CM materials and their catalytic mechanisms are reviewed, after which the tempospatial confinement mechanisms comprising the nanoconfinement effect, interface effect, and kinetic mass transfer are emphasized, thus clarifying their roles in the construction and performance optimization of CMs. Additionally, the fabrication methods for CMs based on their catalysts and pore sizes are summarized and an overview of their application and performance evaluations is presented. Finally, future directions for CMs in materials research and water treatment, are presented.

&lt;p&gt;This review critically summarizes recent representative studies on catalytic membranes (CMs) for advanced water remediation, paying attention to both thermodynamics and mass transfer kinetics mechanism. A rational design framework of tempospatially confined CM is proposed initiatively, involving the materials selection, catalytic oxidation system selection, pore microstructure design according to the tempospatial confinement, CM fabrication, and application.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application of homogeneous catalysts in water remediation is limited by their excessive chemical and energy input, weak regenerability, and potential leaching. Heterogeneous catalytic membranes (CMs) offer a new approach to facilitate efficient, selective, and continuous pollutant degradation. Thus, integrating membranes and continuous filtration with heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can promote thermodynamic and kinetic mass transfers in spatially confined intrapores and facilitate diffusion-reaction processes. Despite the remarkable advantages of heterogeneous CMs, their engineering application is practically restricted due to the fuzzy design criteria for specific applications. Herein, the recent advances in CMs for advanced water remediation are critically reviewed and the design flow for tempospatially confined CMs is proposed. Further, state-of-the-art CM materials and their catalytic mechanisms are reviewed, after which the tempospatial confinement mechanisms comprising the nanoconfinement effect, interface effect, and kinetic mass transfer are emphasized, thus clarifying their roles in the construction and performance optimization of CMs. Additionally, the fabrication methods for CMs based on their catalysts and pore sizes are summarized and an overview of their application and performance evaluations is presented. Finally, future directions for CMs in materials research and water treatment, are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superhydrophobic Solar&#8208;to&#8208;Thermal Materials Toward Cutting&#8208;Edge Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superhydrophobic solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal materials (SSTMs) featured with synergetic water&#8208;repellent, stable, and enhanced solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion properties, remarkably broaden the water&#8208;related application field. This review presents a timely introduction to the recent progress in synergetic functions, mechanisms, typical construction methods, and cutting&#8208;edge potentials based on water medium, providing general guidance for advancing future development of stable and high&#8208;efficient SSTMs.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion is a direct and effective way to absorb sunlight for heat via the rational design and control of photothermal materials. However, when exposed to water&#8208;existed conditions, the conventional solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal performance may experience severe degradation owing to the high specific heat capacity of water. To tackle with the challenge, the water&#8208;repellent function is introduced to construct superhydrophobic solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal materials (SSTMs) for achieving stable heating, and even, for creating new application possibilities under water droplets, sweat, seawater, and ice environments. An in&#8208;depth review of cutting&#8208;edge research of SSTMs is given, focusing on synergetic functions, typical construction methods, and cutting&#8208;edge potentials based on water medium. Moreover, the current challenges and future prospects based on SSTMs are also carefully discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired slippery surfaces, which originate in nature and possess unique characteristics of superlow liquid friction and adhesion, have broad application prospects in liquid manipulation from tiny droplets to bulk liquid, such as water collection, self&#8208;cleaning, antifouling, drag&#8208;reduction, anti&#8208;icing, and anticorrosion.








Abstract
Slippery surfaces, which originate in nature with special wettability, have attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and practical applications in a variety of fields due to their unique characteristics of superlow liquid friction and adhesion. Although research on bioinspired slippery surfaces is still in its infancy, it is a rapidly growing and enormously promising field. Herein, a systematic review of recent progress in bioinspired slippery surfaces, beginning with a brief introduction of several typical creatures with slippery property in nature, is presented. Subsequently,this review gives a detailed discussion on the basic concepts of the wetting, friction, and drag from micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;aspects and focuses on the underlying slippery mechanism. Next, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in three categories of slippery surfaces of air&#8208;trapped, liquid&#8208;infused, and liquid&#8208;like slippery surfaces, including materials, design principles, and preparation methods, are summarized and the emerging applications are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of various slippery surfaces are addressed.

Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have attracted significant attention for their potential to surpass the single&#8208;junction Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. This review highlights the milestones and advancements in monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells over the past decade. It covers research progress and challenges, and provides a roadmap for developing efficient, scalable, and stable tandem solar cells.








Abstract
The perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell represents one of the most promising avenues for exceeding the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit for single&#8208;junction solar cells at a reasonable cost. Remarkably, its efficiency has rapidly increased from 13.7% in 2015 to 34.6% in 2024. Despite the significant research efforts dedicated to this topic, the &#8220;secret&#8221; to achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells seems to be confined to a few research groups. Additionally, the discrepancies in preparation and characterization between single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells continue to impede the transition from efficient single&#8208;junction to efficient tandem solar cells. This review first revisits the key milestones in the development of monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells over the past decade. Then, a comprehensive analysis of the background, advancements, and challenges in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is provided, following the sequence of the tandem fabrication process. The progress and limitations of the prevalent stability measurements for tandem devices are also discussed. Finally, a roadmap for designing efficient, scalable, and stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is outlined. This review takes the growth history into consideration while charting the future course of perovskite/silicon tandem research.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D conjugated polymers (2DCPs) featuring extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, tailored electronic properties, and ordered structure have attracted extensive attention in organic electronics. This review summarises the recent advances in interfacial synthesis strategies, conductivity properties, and organic electronics applications of 2DCP thin films. Design principles and future research direction for full&#8208;conjugated 2DCP thin films for organic electronics are also discussed.








Abstract
2D conjugated polymers (2DCPs) possess extended in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugated lattice and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which results in enhanced electronic performance and potentially unique band structures. These properties, along with predesignability, well&#8208;defined channels, easy postmodification, and order structure attract extensive attention from material science to organic electronics. In this review, the recent advance in the interfacial synthesis and conductivity tuning strategies of 2DCP thin films, as well as their application in organic electronics is summarized. Furthermore, it is shown that, by combining topology structure design and targeted conductivity adjustment, researchers have fabricated 2DCP thin films with predesigned active groups, highly ordered structures, and enhanced conductivity. These films exhibit great potential for various thin&#8208;film organic electronics, such as organic transistors, memristors, electrochromism, chemiresistors, and photodetectors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D conjugated polymers (2DCPs) possess extended in-plane &#960;-conjugated lattice and out-of-plane &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which results in enhanced electronic performance and potentially unique band structures. These properties, along with predesignability, well-defined channels, easy postmodification, and order structure attract extensive attention from material science to organic electronics. In this review, the recent advance in the interfacial synthesis and conductivity tuning strategies of 2DCP thin films, as well as their application in organic electronics is summarized. Furthermore, it is shown that, by combining topology structure design and targeted conductivity adjustment, researchers have fabricated 2DCP thin films with predesigned active groups, highly ordered structures, and enhanced conductivity. These films exhibit great potential for various thin-film organic electronics, such as organic transistors, memristors, electrochromism, chemiresistors, and photodetectors. Finally, the future research directions and perspectives of 2DCPs are discussed in terms of the interfacial synthetic design and structure engineering for the fabrication of fully conjugated 2DCP thin films, as well as the functional manipulation of conductivity to advance their applications in future organic electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>From Charge to Spin: An In&#8208;Depth Exploration of Electron Transfer in Energy Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive physical properties associated with charge and spin afford a novel paradigm for catalyst design, challenging conventional linear scaling relationships in the realm of energy conversion. This departure from traditional approaches not only holds the potential to revolutionize asymmetric synthesis but also offers a unique perspective on unraveling the elusive origins of homochirality.








Abstract
Catalytic materials play crucial roles in various energy&#8208;related processes, ranging from large&#8208;scale chemical production to advancements in renewable energy technologies. Despite a century of dedicated research, major enduring challenges associated with enhancing catalyst efficiency and durability, particularly in green energy&#8208;related electrochemical reactions, remain. Focusing only on either the crystal structure or electronic structure of a catalyst is deemed insufficient to break the linear scaling relationship (LSR), which is the golden rule for the design of advanced catalysts. The discourse in this review intricately outlines the essence of heterogeneous catalysis reactions by highlighting the vital roles played by electron properties. The physical and electrochemical properties of electron charge and spin that govern catalysis efficiencies are analyzed. Emphasis is placed on the pronounced influence of external fields in perturbing the LSR, underscoring the vital role that electron spin plays in advancing high&#8208;performance catalyst design. The review culminates by proffering insights into the potential applications of spin catalysis, concluding with a discussion of extant challenges and inherent limitations.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As natural intercellular transporters, extracellular vesicles (EVs) show great potential as diagnostic biomarkers, therapeutic agents, and drug delivery vehicles. DNA nanomaterials provide an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use, programmable approach to design and construct sophisticated molecular devices on the EV surface for EV isolation, analysis, and delivery.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell&#8208;secreted biological nanoparticles that are critical mediators of intercellular communication. They contain diverse bioactive components, which are promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic agents. Their nanosized membrane&#8208;bound structures and innate ability to transport functional cargo across major biological barriers make them promising candidates as drug delivery vehicles. However, the complex biology and heterogeneity of EVs pose significant challenges for their controlled and actionable applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. Recently, DNA molecules with high biocompatibility emerge as excellent functional blocks for surface engineering of EVs. The robust Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing of DNA molecules and the resulting programmable DNA nanomaterials provide the EV surface with precise structural customization and adjustable physical and chemical properties, creating unprecedented opportunities for EV biomedical applications. This review focuses on the recent advances in the utilization of programmable DNA to engineer EV surfaces. The biology, function, and biomedical applications of EVs are summarized and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achievements in EV isolation, analysis, and delivery based on DNA nanomaterials are introduced. Finally, the challenges and new frontiers in EV engineering are discussed.

         <dc:description>
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have both excellent stability and continuously broken&#8208;through efficiencies. Herein, the characteristics of inverted PSCs including each functional layers, interfacial regulation strategies, and device stability are summarized. Meanwhile, the applications of inverted structure in tandem and flexible photovoltaic devices, and modules are introduced. Finally, the remaining challenges and several proposals of PSCs are put forward.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted widespread research and commercialization attention because of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost. The long&#8208;term stability of PSCs should satisfy industrial requirements for photovoltaic devices. Inverted PSCs with a p&#8208;i&#8208;n architecture exhibit considerable advantages because of their excellent stability and competitive efficiency. The continuously broken&#8208;through PCE of inverted PSCs shows huge application potential. This review summarizes the developments and outlines the characteristics of inverted PSCs including charge transport layers (CTLs), perovskite compositions, and interfacial regulation strategies. The latest effective CTLs, interfacial modification, and stability promotion strategies especially under light, thermal, and bias conditions are emphatically analyzed. Furthermore, the applications of the inverted structure in high&#8208;efficiency and stable tandem, flexible photovoltaic devices, and modules and their main obstacles are systematically introduced. Finally, the remaining challenges faced by inverted devices are discussed, and several directions for advancing inverted PSCs are proposed according to their development status and industrialization requirements.

         <title>Advances in Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics: Flexible Transparent Electrodes and Deformable Active Layer Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted significant attention as promising power sources for wearable electronic systems. This work provides an overview of the characteristics and recent research progress in the areas of structurally and intrinsically stretchable OPVs. The recent advances in stretchable OPVs are elaborated, including the design of mechanically robust transparent electrodes, photovoltaic materials, and devices.








Abstract
Stretchable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted significant attention as promising power sources for wearable electronic systems owing to their superior robustness under repetitive tensile strains and their good compatibility. However, reconciling a high power&#8208;conversion efficiency and a reasonable flexibility is a tremendous challenge. In addition, the development of stretchable OPVs must be accelerated to satisfy the increasing requirements of niche markets for mechanical robustness. Stretchable OPV devices can be classified as either structurally or intrinsically stretchable. This work reviews recent advances in stretchable OPVs, including the design of mechanically robust transparent electrodes, photovoltaic materials, and devices. Initially, an overview of the characteristics and recent research progress in the areas of structurally and intrinsically stretchable OPVs is provided. Subsequently, research into flexible and stretchable transparent electrodes that directly affect the performances of stretchable OPVs is summarized and analyzed. Overall, this review aims to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the intrinsic properties of highly efficient and deformable active materials, while also emphasizing advanced strategies for simultaneously improving the photovoltaic performance and mechanical flexibility of the active layer, including material design, multi&#8208;component settings, and structural optimization.

         <title>Toward a Brain&#8211;Neuromorphics Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brain&#8211;neuromorphics interface (BNI) is of profound implications for restoring or augmenting human's capabilities. This review profiles the recent progresses on neuromorphic electronics with both energy&#8208;efficiency and bio&#8208;fidelity characteristics toward such interface. Challenges and prospects are also summarized, which can provide guidance for promoting the development of the seamless, bidirectional, and compact tools for bridging humans and machines.








Abstract
Brain&#8211;computer interfaces (BCIs) that enable human&#8211;machine interaction have immense potential in restoring or augmenting human capabilities. Traditional BCIs are realized based on complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technologies with complex, bulky, and low biocompatible circuits, and suffer with the low energy efficiency of the von Neumann architecture. The brain&#8211;neuromorphics interface (BNI) would offer a promising solution to advance the BCI technologies and shape the interactions with machineries. Neuromorphic devices and systems are able to provide substantial computation power with extremely high energy&#8208;efficiency by implementing in&#8208;materia computing such as in situ vector&#8211;matrix multiplication (VMM) and physical reservoir computing. Recent progresses on integrating neuromorphic components with sensing and/or actuating modules, give birth to the neuromorphic afferent nerve, efferent nerve, sensorimotor loop, and so on, which has advanced the technologies for future neurorobotics by achieving sophisticated sensorimotor capabilities as the biological system. With the development on the compact artificial spiking neuron and bioelectronic interfaces, the seamless communication between a BNI and a bioentity is reasonably expectable. In this review, the upcoming BNIs are profiled by introducing the brief history of neuromorphics, reviewing the recent progresses on related areas, and discussing the future advances and challenges that lie ahead.

         <title>Targeting Compact and Ordered Emitters by Supramolecular Dynamic Interactions for High&#8208;performance Organic Ambient Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compact and ordered RTP emitters exhibit superior phosphorescent performance compared with disordered counterparts, thus greatly extending the applications. This review presents a timely introduction to the fundamental concepts and recent progress in design and preparation strategies, optical properties, underlying luminescent mechanisms and applications, providing general guidance for advancing future development of high&#8208;performance RTP materials.








Abstract
Purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have received intense attention due to their fascinating optical properties and advanced optoelectronic applications. The promotion of intersystem crossing (ISC) and minimalization of nonradiative dissipation under ambient conditions are key prerequisites for realizing high&#8208;performance organic RTP; However, the ISC process is generally inefficient for organic fluorogens and the populated triplet excitons are always too susceptible to be well stabilized by conventional means. Particularly, organizing organic fluorophores into compact and ordered entities by supramolecular dynamic interactions has proven to be a newly&#8208;emerged strategy to boost the ISC process greatly and suppress the non&#8208;radiative relaxations immensely, facilitating the population and stabilization of triplet excitons to access high&#8208;performance organic RTP. Consequently, well&#8208;defined organic emitters enable robust RTP emission even in the solution state, thus greatly extending the applications. Here, this review is focused on a timely and brief introduction to recent progress in tailoring ordered high&#8208;performance RTP emitters by supramolecular dynamic interactions. Their typical preparation strategies, optoelectronic properties, and applications are thoroughly summarized. In the summary section, key challenges and perspectives of this field are highlighted to suggest potential directions for future study.

Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) hold a higher metal atom loading and provide greater flexibility in terms of the structural characteristics of their active sites in comparison to single&#8208;atom catalysts. Consequently, DACs hold great promise for achieving improved catalytic performance. This article aims to provide a focused overview of the latest advancements in DACs, covering their synthesis and mechanisms in reversible oxygen electrocatalysis, which plays a key role in sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies. The discussion starts by highlighting the structures of DACs and the differences in diatomic coordination induced by various substrates. Subsequently, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication strategies of DACs for oxygen electrocatalysis are discussed from several different perspectives. It particularly highlights the challenges of increasing the diatomic loading capacity. More importantly, the main focus of this overview is to investigate the correlation between the configuration and activity in DACs in order to gain a deeper understanding of their active roles in oxygen electrocatalysis. This will be achieved through density functional theory calculations and sophisticated in situ characterization technologies. The aim is to provide guidelines for optimizing and upgrading DACs in oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural and its Downstream Chemicals: A Review of Catalytic Routes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass is crucial for sustainability, owing to its abundance and eco&#8208;friendliness. As a bio&#8208;based platform compound derived from sugar, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) enables the creation of high&#8208;value derivatives for further producing biopolymers, biofuels, and beyond. This review delves into efficient catalytic routes and economic feasibility of HMF synthesis and conversion, offering valuable insights for future research in this field.








Abstract
Biomass assumes an increasingly vital role in the realm of renewable energy and sustainable development due to its abundant availability, renewability, and minimal environmental impact. Within this context, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), derived from sugar dehydration, stands out as a critical bio&#8208;derived product. It serves as a pivotal multifunctional platform compound, integral in synthesizing various vital chemicals, including furan&#8208;based polymers, fine chemicals, and biofuels. The high reactivity of HMF, attributed to its highly active aldehyde, hydroxyl, and furan ring, underscores the challenge of selectively regulating its conversion to obtain the desired products. This review highlights the research progress on efficient catalytic systems for HMF synthesis, oxidation, reduction, and etherification. Additionally, it outlines the techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) and prospective research directions for the production of furan&#8208;based chemicals. Despite significant progress in catalysis research, and certain process routes demonstrating substantial economics, with key indicators surpassing petroleum&#8208;based products, a gap persists between fundamental research and large&#8208;scale industrialization. This is due to the lack of comprehensive engineering research on bio&#8208;based chemicals, making the commercialization process a distant goal. These findings provide valuable insights for further development of this field.

&lt;p&gt;Emerging fields, such as wearable electronics, digital healthcare, the Internet of Things, and humanoid robots, highlight the need for flexible devices capable of recording signals on curved surfaces and soft objects. In particular, flexible magnetosensitive devices garner significant attention owing to their ability to combine the advantages of flexible electronics and magnetoelectronic devices, such as reshaping capability, conformability, contactless sensing, and navigation capability. Several key challenges must be addressed to develop well-functional flexible magnetic devices. These include determining how to make magnetic materials flexible and even elastic, understanding how the physical properties of magnetic films change under external strain and stress, and designing and constructing flexible magnetosensitive devices. In recent years, significant progress is made in addressing these challenges. This study aims to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of the most recent developments in flexible magnetosensitive devices. This includes discussions on the fabrications and mechanical regulations of flexible magnetic materials, the principles and performances of flexible magnetic sensors, and their applications for wearable electronics.

         <dc:description>
2D nanomaterials have layered structures and exhibit excellent physical barrier properties. By introducing corrosion inhibitors and/or chemical modifications, organic coatings can be endowed with excellent self&#8208;healing properties. Furthermore, highly conductive nanomaterials can boost the cathodic protection performance of zinc&#8208;rich coatings and extend the lifespan of organic coatings in marine environments.








Abstract
2D nanomaterials, with extraordinary physical and chemical characteristics, have long been regarded as promising nanofillers in organic coatings for marine corrosion protection. The past decade has witnessed the high&#8208;speed progress of 2D nanomaterial&#8208;reinforced organic composite coatings, and plenty of breakthroughs have been achieved as yet. This review covers an in&#8208;depth and all&#8208;around outline of the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advances in 2D nanomaterial&#8208;modified organic coatings employed for the marine corrosion protection realm. Starting from a brief introduction to 2D nanomaterials, the preparation strategies and properties are illustrated. Subsequently, diverse protection models based on composite coatings for marine corrosion protection are also introduced, including physical barrier, self&#8208;healing, as well as cathodic protection, respectively. Furthermore, computational simulations and critical factors on the corrosion protection properties of composite coatings are clarified in detail. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects for marine corrosion protection based on 2D nanomaterials reinforced organic coatings are highlighted.

Silver&#8208;copper&#8208;based semiconductors (AgCuQ, Q = S, Se, Te) demonstrate compelling&#160;attributes, such as ultralow thermal conductivity, tunable electronic properties, and ductility. This review summarizes their fundamentalfeatures and recent achievements, including crystal structures, electronic bands, mechanical features, and strategies for performance enhancement, as well as addressing challenges and prospects.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technology, which enables a direct and pollution&#8208;free conversion of heat into electricity, provides a promising path to address the current global energy crisis. Among the broad range of thermoelectric materials, silver copper chalcogenides (AgCuQ, Q = S, Se, Te) have garnered significant attention in thermoelectric community in light of inherently ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, controllable electronic transport properties, excellent thermoelectric performance across various temperature ranges, and a degree of ductility. This review epitomizes the recent progress in AgCuQ&#8208;based thermoelectric materials, from the optimization of thermoelectric performance to the rational design of devices, encompassing the fundamental understanding of crystal structures, electronic band structures, mechanical properties, and quasi&#8208;liquid behaviors. The correlation between chemical composition, mechanical properties, and thermoelectric performance in this material system is also highlighted. Finally, several key issues and prospects are proposed for further optimizing AgCuQ&#8208;based thermoelectric materials.

Abstract
Smart stimuli&#8208;responsive persistent luminescence materials, combining the various advantages and frontier applications prospects, have gained booming progress in recent years. The trap&#8208;controlled property and energy storage capability to respond to external multi&#8208;stimulations through diverse luminescence pathways make them attractive in emerging multi&#8208;responsive smart platforms. This review aims at the recent advances in trap&#8208;controlled luminescence materials for advanced multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive smart platforms. The design principles, luminescence mechanisms, and representative stimulations, i.e., thermo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, mechano&#8208;, and X&#8208;rays responsiveness, are comprehensively summarized. Various emerging multi&#8208;responsive hybrid systems containing trap&#8208;controlled luminescence materials are highlighted. Specifically, temperature dependent trapping and de&#8208;trapping performance is discussed, from extreme&#8208;low temperature to ultra&#8208;high temperature conditions. Emerging applications and future perspectives are briefly presented. It is hoped that this review would provide new insights and guidelines for the rational design and performance manipulation of multi&#8208;responsive materials for advanced smart platforms.

         <title>Monolithic Integration of Full&#8208;Color Microdisplay Screen with Sub&#8208;5&#160;&#181;m Quantum&#8208;Dot Pixels</title>

         <dc:description>
The monolithic photolithograph integration of sub&#8208;5 &#181;m perovskite quantum&#8208;dot (PeQD) pixels is achieved on 0.39&#8208;inch blue&#8208;backlight micro&#8208;LED screens. This integration demonstrates full&#8208;color image and video display capabilities, with remarkable features including brightness exceeding 400&#160;000 nits, an ultra&#8208;high resolution of 3300 PPI, and a wide color gamut of 130.4% NTSC.








Abstract
Monolithic integration of color&#8208;conversion materials onto blue&#8208;backlight micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (micro&#8208;LEDs) has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving full&#8208;color microdisplay devices. However, this approach still encounters challenges such as the blue&#8208;backlight leakage and the poor fabrication yield rate due to unsatisfied quantum dot (QD) material and fabrication process. Here, the monolithic integration of 0.39&#8208;inch micro&#8208;display screens displaying colorful pictures and videos are demonstrated, which are enabled by creating interfacial chemical bonds for wafer&#8208;scale adhesion of sub&#8208;5 &#181;m QD&#8208;pixels on blue&#8208;backlight micro&#8208;LED wafer. The ligand molecule with chlorosulfonyl and silane groups is selected as the synthesis ligand and surface treatment material, facilitating the preparation of high&#8208;efficiency QD photoresist and the formation of robust chemical bonds for pixel integration. This is a leading record in micro&#8208;display devices achieving the highest brightness larger than 400 thousand nits, the ultrahigh resolution of 3300 PPI, the wide color gamut of 130.4% NTSC, and the ultimate performance of service life exceeding 1000&#160;h. These results extend the mature integrated circuit technique into the manufacture of micro&#8208;display device, which also lead the road of industrialization process of full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LEDs.

         <title>Thin Film Stoichiometry and Defects Management for Low Threshold and Air Stable Near&#8208;Infrared Perovskite Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As defect density in 3D perovskites is controlled by adjusting excess formamidinium iodide concentration, shallow defects acts as a carrier sink for amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). A comprehensive charge carrier dynamic model is presented to understand the critical factor of the reduction of ASE threshold.








Abstract
While significant efforts have been devoted to optimize the thin&#8208;film stoichiometry and processing of perovskites for applications in photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting diodes, there is a noticeable lack of emphasis on tailoring them for lasing applications. In this study, it is revealed that thin films engineered for efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes, with passivation of deep and shallow trap states and a tailored energetic landscape directing carriers toward low&#8208;energy emitting states, may not be optimal for light amplification systems. Instead, amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) is found to be sustained by shallow defects, driven by the positive correlation between the ASE threshold and the ratio of carrier injection rate in the emissive state to the recombination rate of excited carriers. This insight has informed the development of an optimized perovskite thin film and laser device exhibiting a low threshold (&#8776; 60 &#181;J cm&#8722;2) and stable ASE emission exceeding 21 hours in ambient conditions.

&lt;p&gt;As defect density in 3D perovskites is controlled by adjusting excess formamidinium iodide concentration, shallow defects acts as a carrier sink for amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). A comprehensive charge carrier dynamic model is presented to understand the critical factor of the reduction of ASE threshold.

         <title>Open&#8208;Source Throttling of CD8+ T Cells in Brain with Low&#8208;Intensity Focused Ultrasound&#8208;Guided Sequential Delivery of CXCL10, IL&#8208;2, and aPD&#8208;L1 for Glioblastoma Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An &#8220;open&#8208;source throttling&#8221; strategy for CD8+ T cells aims to enhance immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM). Low&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) guids the sequential delivery of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) to recruit CD8+ T cells and interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) to reduce T cell exhaustion (Tex), offering a promising strategy for brain tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Improving clinical immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM) relies on addressing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Enhancing CD8+ T cell infiltration and preventing its exhaustion holds promise for effective GBM immunotherapy. Here, a low&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)&#8208;guided sequential delivery strategy is developed to enhance CD8+ T cells infiltration and activity in the GBM region. The sequential delivery of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) to recruit CD8+ T cells and interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) to reduce their exhaustion is termed an &#8220;open&#8208;source throttling&#8221; strategy. Consequently, up to 3.39&#8208;fold of CD8+ T cells are observed with LIFU&#8208;guided sequential delivery of CXCL10, IL&#8208;2, and anti&#8208;programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (aPD&#8208;L1), compared to the free aPD&#8208;L1 group. The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapeutic efficacy is substantially enhanced by the reversed immunosuppressive TME due to the expansion of CD8+ T cells, resulting in the elimination of tumor, prolonged survival time, and long&#8208;term immune memory establishment in orthotopic GBM mice. Overall, LIFU&#8208;guided sequential cytokine and ICIs delivery offers an &#8220;open&#8208;source throttling&#8221; strategy of CD8+ T cells, which may present a promising strategy for brain&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Depth&#8208;Resolved X&#8208;Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Evidence of Intrinsic Polar States in HfO2&#8208;Based Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnia&#8208;based films has reignited interest in understanding the emergence of ferroelectric properties at the nanoscale. Using depth&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photo&#8208;electron spectroscopy, electrochemical states in pre&#8208;determined polarization states of epitaxial Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) and Hf0.88La0.04Ta0.08O2 (HLTO) films on SrTiO3|La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (STO|LSMO) are compared. More pronounced electrochemical changes are revealed in films with lower polarization, evidencing an intrinsic polar state.








Abstract
The discovery of ferroelectricity in nanoscale hafnia&#8208;based oxide films has spurred interest in understanding their emergent properties. Investigation focuses on the size&#8208;dependent polarization behavior, which is sensitive to content and movement of oxygen vacancies. Though polarization switching and electrochemical reactions is shown to co&#8208;occur, their relationship remains unclear. This study employs X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy with depth sensitivity to examine changes in electrochemical states occurring during polarization switching. Contrasting Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) with Hf0.88La0.04Ta0.08O2 (HLTO), a composition with an equivalent structure and comparable average ionic radius, electrochemical states are directly observed for specific polarization directions. Lower&#8208;polarization films exhibit more significant electrochemical changes upon switching, suggesting an indirect relationship between polarization and electrochemical state. This research illuminates the complex interplay between polarization and electrochemical dynamics, providing evidence for intrinsic polar states in HfO2&#8208;based&#160;ferroelectrics.

         <title>In Vivo Interactions of Nucleic Acid Nanostructures With Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleic acid nanostructures have been intracellular drug carriers for nanomedicine applications for two decades, but their interaction with cells in vivo has gained clarity only recently. This review features their cellular&#8208;level distribution in various organs and the cellular responses induced in rodents, large animals, and humans. It concludes with directions for probing cell&#8208;nanoparticle interactions and regulatory updates for clinical translation.








Abstract

Nucleic acid nanostructures, derived from the assembly of nucleic acid building blocks (e.g., plasmids and oligonucleotides), are important intracellular carriers of therapeutic cargoes widely utilized in preclinical nanomedicine applications, yet their clinical translation remains scarce. In the era of &#8220;translational nucleic acid nanotechnology&#8221;, a deeper mechanistic understanding of the interactions of nucleic acid nanostructures with cells in vivo will guide the development of more efficacious nanomedicines. This review showcases the recent progress in dissecting the in vivo interactions of four key types of nucleic acid nanostructures (i.e., tile&#8208;based, origami, spherical nucleic acid, and nucleic acid nanogel) with cells in rodents over the past five years. Emphasis lies on the cellular&#8208;level distribution of nucleic acid nanostructures in various organs and tissues and the cellular responses induced by their cellular entry. Next, in the spirit of preclinical translation, this review features the latest interactions of nucleic acid nanostructures with cells in large animals and humans. Finally, the review offers directions for studying the interactions of nucleic acid nanostructures with cells from both materials and biology perspectives and concludes with some regulatory updates.

         <title>Nano&#8208; and Micro&#8208;Platforms in Therapeutic Proteins Delivery for Cancer Therapy: Materials and Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein biologics is one of the future trends in oncology treatment, but free proteins and single&#8208;protein treatment show insufficient therapeutic effects. Various nanoparticle and microsphere platforms provide opportunities to overcome their inherent defects and achieve synergetic combination therapies. Herein, protein biologics types, delivery platforms, and platform&#8208;based combinational strategies are fully introduced step&#8208;by&#8208;step with relevant clinical and pre&#8208;clinical examples.








Abstract
Proteins have emerged as promising therapeutics in oncology due to their great specificity. Many treatment strategies are developed based on protein biologics, such as immunotherapy, starvation therapy, and pro&#8208;apoptosis therapy, while some protein biologics have entered the clinics. However, clinical translation is severely impeded by instability, short circulation time, poor transmembrane transportation, and immunogenicity. Micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles&#8208;based drug delivery platforms are designed to solve those problems and enhance protein therapeutic efficacy. This review first summarizes the different types of therapeutic proteins in clinical and research stages, highlighting their administration limitations. Next, various types of micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles are described to demonstrate how they can overcome those limitations. The potential of micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles are then explored to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of proteins by combinational therapies. Finally, the challenges and future directions of protein biologics carriers are discussed for optimized protein delivery.

Various nanoparticle and microsphere platforms provide opportunities to overcome their inherent defects and achieve synergetic combination therapies. Herein, protein biologics types, delivery platforms, and platform-based combinational strategies are fully introduced step-by-step with relevant clinical and pre-clinical examples.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proteins have emerged as promising therapeutics in oncology due to their great specificity. Many treatment strategies are developed based on protein biologics, such as immunotherapy, starvation therapy, and pro-apoptosis therapy, while some protein biologics have entered the clinics. However, clinical translation is severely impeded by instability, short circulation time, poor transmembrane transportation, and immunogenicity. Micro- and nano-particles-based drug delivery platforms are designed to solve those problems and enhance protein therapeutic efficacy. This review first summarizes the different types of therapeutic proteins in clinical and research stages, highlighting their administration limitations. Next, various types of micro- and nano-particles are described to demonstrate how they can overcome those limitations. The potential of micro- and nano-particles are then explored to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of proteins by combinational therapies. Finally, the challenges and future directions of protein biologics carriers are discussed for optimized protein delivery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Universal Ensemble&#8208;Embedding Graph Neural Network for Direct Prediction of Optical Spectra from Crystal Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper introduces GNNOpt, an equivariant graph&#8208;neural&#8208;network architecture incorporating universal embedding with automatic optimization. GNNOpt allows for precise prediction of optical spectra based exclusively on crystal structures and can be up to a million times faster than traditional first&#8208;principles calculations. Consequently, GNNOpt can significantly speed up the development of photovoltaic and quantum materials.








Abstract
Optical properties in solids, such as refractive index and absorption, hold vast applications ranging from solar panels to sensors, photodetectors, and transparent displays. However, first&#8208;principles computation of optical properties from crystal structures is a complex task due to the high convergence criteria and computational cost. Recent progress in machine learning shows promise in predicting material properties, yet predicting optical properties from crystal structures remains challenging due to the lack of efficient atomic embeddings. Here, Graph Neural Network for Optical spectra prediction (GNNOpt) is introduced, an equivariant graph&#8208;neural&#8208;network architecture featuring universal embedding with automatic optimization. This enables high&#8208;quality optical predictions with a dataset of only 944 materials. GNNOpt predicts all optical properties based on the Kramers&#8208;Kr&#246;nig relations, including absorption coefficient, complex dielectric function, complex refractive index, and reflectance. The trained model is applied to screen photovoltaic materials based on spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency and search for quantum materials based on quantum weight. First&#8208;principles calculations validate the efficacy of the GNNOpt model, demonstrating excellent agreement in predicting the optical spectra of unseen materials. The discovery of new quantum materials with high predicted quantum weight, such as SiOs, which host exotic quasiparticles with multifold nontrivial topology, demonstrates the potential of GNNOpt in predicting optical properties across a broad range of materials and&#160;applications.

         <title>Superbly Efficient and Stable Ultrapure Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Tetradentate Pt(II) Complex with Vibration Suppression Effect</title>

Spirofluorene at the 5&#8208;6 position of Carbazole suppresses reduced hole traps, and SRH recombination at the dopant molecules, resulting in enhanced F&#246;rster energy transfer and a superb device lifetime of 589&#160;h of LT70. reduced vibration&#8208;coupled structural relaxation, leading to high color purity with 16&#160;nm of full width at half maximum and PLQY of 94.1%.








Abstract
Blue phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (PHOLEDs) are on the brink of commercialization for decades. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and operational lifetime of PHOLEDs are not yet reached industrial standards. Here, a novel tetradentate Pt(II) emitter with a spirofluorene onto the carbazole unit that minimizes the vibration modes, corresponding to the structural relaxation during the de&#8208;excitation, called the vibration suppression effect is reported. This modification reduces the intensity of the second peak in the spectrum and Shockley&#8211;Read&#8211;Hall recombination by blocking direct hole injection into the emitter while enhancing F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, resulting in 451&#160;h of LT50 (the time until a 50% decrease in initial luminance at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2) and 25.1% of the maximum EQE (EQEmax). Thanks to the vibration suppression effect, an extremely narrow full width at half a maximum of 22&#160;nm is obtained. In phosphor&#8208;sensitized thermally activated delayed fluorescent OLED, ultra&#8208;pure blue emission with Commission internationale de l&#8242;Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.136, 0.096) is obtained with 28.1% of EQEmax. Furthermore, 50.3% of the EQEmax and 589&#160;h of LT70 are simultaneously recorded with the two&#8208;stack tandem PHOLED, which is the highest EQEmax among 2&#8208;tandem and bottom&#8208;emission PHOLEDs with CIEy&#160;&lt;&#160;0.15.

         <title>Sea Cucumber&#8208;Inspired Polyurethane Demonstrating Record&#8208;Breaking Mechanical Properties in Room&#8208;Temperature Self&#8208;Healing Ionogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sea cucumber&#8208;inspired polyurethane containing multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors is synthesized, which is instrumental in the creation of self&#8208;healing ionogels. The polyurethane forms dynamic hard&#8208;phase regions within the ionogels, driven by multiple hydrogen bonds. This unique phase separation structure not only significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the ionogels but also ensures their self&#8208;healing capability at room temperature.








Abstract
Practical applications of existing self&#8208;healing ionogels are often hindered by the trade&#8208;off between their mechanical robustness, ionic conductivity, and temperature requirements for their self&#8208;healing ability. Herein, this challenge is addressed by drawing inspiration from sea cucumber. A polyurethane containing multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors is synthesized and used to fabricate room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing ionogels with excellent mechanical properties, high ionic conductivity, puncture resistance, and impact resistance. The hard segments of polyurethane, driven by multiple hydrogen bonds, coalesce into hard phase regions, which can efficiently dissipate energy through the reversible disruption and reformation of multiple hydrogen bonds. Consequently, the resulting ionogels exhibit record&#8208;high tensile strength and toughness compared to other room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing ionogels. Furthermore, the inherent reversibility of multiple hydrogen bonds within the hard phase regions allows the ionogels to spontaneously and efficiently self&#8208;heal damaged mechanical properties and ionic conductivity multiple times at room temperature. To underscore their application potential, these ionogels are employed as electrolytes in the fabrication of electrochromic devices, which exhibit excellent and stable electrochromic performance, repeatable healing ability, and satisfactory impact resistance. This study presents a novel strategy for the fabrication of ionogels with exceptional mechanical properties and room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing capability.

         <title>Enhancing Compatibility of Two&#8208;Step Tandem Catalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia Over P&#8208;Cu/Co(OH)2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphorus&#8208;doping strategy is investigated to optimize the mismatched two&#8208;step tandem process of NO3RR. During the tandem catalysis, there is more favorable release of NO2&#8722; in the initial 2e&#8722; process over P&#8208;Cu, and superior efficiency in NO2&#8722; capture and conversion in the subsequent 6e&#8722; process over P&#8208;Co(OH)2, ultimately contributing to remarkable NH3 production.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a promising approach to realize ammonia generation and wastewater treatment. However, the transformation from NO3&#8722; to NH3 involves multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes and by&#8208;products (NO2&#8722;, H2, etc.), making high ammonia selectivity a challenge. Herein, a two&#8208;phase nanoflower P&#8208;Cu/Co(OH)2 electrocatalyst consisting of P&#8208;Cu clusters and P&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets is designed to match the two&#8208;step tandem process (NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; and NO2&#8722; to NH3) more compatible, avoiding excessive NO2&#8722; accumulation and optimizing the whole tandem reaction. Focusing on the initial 2e&#8722; process, the inhibited *NO2 desorption on Cu sites in P&#8208;Cu gives rise to the more appropriate NO2&#8722; released in electrolyte. Subsequently, P&#8208;Co(OH)2 exhibits a superior capacity for trapping and transforming the desorbed NO2&#8722; during the latter 6e&#8722; process due to the thermodynamic advantage and contributions of active hydrogen. In 1&#160;m KOH + 0.1&#160;m NO3&#8722;, P&#8208;Cu/Co(OH)2 leads to superior NH3 yield rate of 42.63&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 97.04% at &#8722;0.4&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Such a well&#8208;matched two&#8208;step process achieves remarkable NH3 synthesis performance from the perspective of optimizing the tandem catalytic reaction, offering a novel guideline for the design of NO3RR electrocatalysts.

   &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; released in electrolyte. Subsequently, P-Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a superior capacity for trapping and transforming the desorbed NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; during the latter 6e&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt; process due to the thermodynamic advantage and contributions of active hydrogen. In 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH + 0.1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;, P-Cu/Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to superior NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 42.63&#160;mg&#160;h&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;b&gt;
   &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency of 97.04% at &#8722;0.4&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Such a well-matched two-step process achieves remarkable NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; synthesis performance from the perspective of optimizing the tandem catalytic reaction, offering a novel guideline for the design of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pushing Theoretical Potassium Storage Limits of MXenes through Introducing New Carbon Active Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through defect local atomic environment manipulation, the potassium storage potential of the interior carbon layers in typical Ti3C2Tx MXenes has been unlocked. New sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon active sites in Ti3C2Tx MXenes are highly exposed by an atomic tailoring via chemical scissor within sublayers, leading to record&#8208;breaking potassium storage capacities (291 mAh g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycling life (more than 20 months). These findings underscore the effectiveness of regulating the neighboring environment of defects and provide insights into future high&#8208;performance electrode design strategies.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;driven capacitive storage enhances rate performance and cyclability, thereby improving the efficacy of high&#8208;power electrode materials and fast&#8208;charging batteries. Conventional defect engineering, widely&#8208;employed capacitive storage optimization strategy, primarily focuses on the influence of defects themselves on capacitive behaviors. However, the role of local environment surrounding defects, which significantly affects surface properties, remains largely unexplored for lack of suitable material platform and has long been neglected. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, typical Ti3C2Tx MXenes are chosen as model materials owing to metallic conductivity and tunable surface properties, satisfying the requirements for capacitive&#8208;type electrodes. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the potential of MXenes with modulated local atomic environment is anticipated and introducing new carbon sites found near pores can activate electrochemically inert surface, attaining record theoretical potassium storage capacities of MXenes (291 mAh g&#8722;1). This supposition is realized through atomic tailoring via chemical scissor within sublayers, exposing new sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon active sites. The resulting MXenes demonstrate unprecedented rate performance and cycling stability. Notably, MXenes with higher carbon exposure exhibit a record&#8208;breaking capacity over 200 mAh g&#8722;1 and sustain a capacity retention higher than 80% after 20 months. These findings underscore the effectiveness of regulating defects' neighboring environment and illuminate future high&#8208;performance electrode design.

         <title>Extending The Calendar Life of Fiber Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries to 200 Days with Ultra&#8208;High Barrier Polymer Tubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;high barrier composite tube is developed by blending PCTFE with organically modified montmorillonite, resulting in an ultra&#8208;low water vapor transmission rate of 0.006 mg&#160;day&#8722;1&#160;pkg&#8722;1 due to the more complex and tortuous pathways for water permeation. The resulting 2%OMMT&#8208;PCTFE&#8208;FLIBs achieved an extended cycle life of 870 cycles and a calendar life of 200 days, with over 80% capacity retention.








Abstract
Scalable fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries (FLIBs) have garnered significant attention due to huge potential applications in wearable technology. However, their widespread applications have been limited by inadequate cycle and calendar life, primarily due to the high permeability of the encapsulation layer to water vapor in ambient air. To address this challenge, an ultra&#8208;high barrier composite tube is developed by blending polytrifluorochloroethylene (PCTFE) with organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT) for the continuous packaging of FLIBs. Due to the high crystallinity (&#8776;40.21%) and small free volume (103.443 &#197;3), the PCTFE tube exhibited a low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of 0.123 mg&#160;day&#8722;1&#160;pkg&#8722;1. Furthermore, through the melt extrusion, OMMT with its plate&#8208;like morphology are fully exfoliated and dispersed within the PCTFE matrix. This created more complex pathways for water, increasing the diffusion path length and thereby reducing WVTR to 0.006 mg&#160;day&#8722;1&#160;pkg&#8722;1. This innovation enabled an ultra&#8208;long calendar life of 200 days and cycle life of 870 cycles for FLIBs, with over 80% capacity retention in ambient air. Additionally, 2%OMMT&#8208;PCTFE&#8208;FLIBs exhibited excellent flexibility, retaining an impressive 85.31% capacity after 10&#160;000 bending cycles. This research presents a simple yet effective approach to enhance the lifetime and practicality of FLIBs through building a high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;based encapsulation layer.

         <title>Toughening and Imparting Deconstructability to 3D&#8208;Printed Glassy Thermosets with &#8220;Transferinker&#8221; Additives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transferinkers are cross&#8208;linkers capable of undergoing degenerative chain transfer and new strand growth. Incorporating transferinkers into 3D printable photopolymer resins leads to improved tensile toughness and triggered chemical deconstructability. These properties result from a transferinker&#8208;driven topological transition in network structure into one that can more effectively bear stress yet is also more easily depercolated via solvolysis.








Abstract
Thermoset toughness and deconstructability are often opposing features; simultaneously improving both without sacrificing other mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness and tensile strength) is difficult, but, if achieved, could enhance the usage lifetime and end&#8208;of&#8208;life options for these materials. Here, a strategy that addresses this challenge in the context of photopolymer resins commonly used for 3D printing of glassy, acrylic thermosets is introduced. It is shown that incorporating bis&#8208;acrylate &#8220;transferinkers,&#8221; which are cross&#8208;linkers capable of undergoing degenerative chain transfer and new strand growth, as additives (5&#8211;25 mol%) into homemade or commercially available photopolymer resins leads to photopolymer thermosets with substantially improved tensile toughness and triggered chemical deconstructability with minimal impacts on Young's moduli, tensile strengths, and glass transition temperatures. These properties result from a transferinker&#8208;driven topological transition in network structure from the densely cross&#8208;linked long, heterogeneous primary strands of traditional photopolymer networks to more uniform, star&#8208;like networks with few dangling ends; the latter structure more effectively bear stress yet is also more easily depercolated via solvolysis. Thus, transferinkers represent a simple and effective strategy for improving the mechanical properties of photopolymer thermosets and providing a mechanism for their triggered deconstructability.

         <title>The Effect of Relative Humidity in Conductive Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the impact&#160;of relative humidity (RH) on conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) measurements is investigated. For insulating and ultra&#8208;thin (less than 5 nm) semiconducting samples, a RH at 4% results in lower and more inhomogeneous currents compared to RH = 54%. In contrast, for thicker&#160;semiconducting (above 5 nm) and metallic samples, RH has no significant effect. These observations are confirmed by over 17,000 tests at different locations of ten samples.








Abstract
Conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) analyzes electronic phenomena in materials and devices with nanoscale lateral resolution, and it is widely used by companies, research institutions, and universities. Most data published in the field of CAFM is collected in air at a relative humidity (RH) of 30&#8211;60%. However, the effect of RH in CAFM remains unclear because&#160;previous studies often made contradictory claims, plus the number of samples and locations tested is scarce. Moreover, previous studies on this topic did&#160;not apply current limitations, which can degrade the CAFM tips and generate false data. This article systematically analyzes the effect of RH in CAFM by applying ramped voltage stresses at over 17,000 locations on ten different samples (insulating, semiconducting, and conducting) under seven different RH. An ultra&#8208;reliable setup with a 110&#8208;pA current limitation during electrical stresses is employed, and&#160;excellent CAFM tip integrity after thousands of tests is demonstrated. It is found that higher RH results in increased currents due to the presence of a conductive&#160;water meniscus at the tip/sample junction, which increases the effective area for&#160;electron flow. This trend is observed in insulators and ultra&#8208;thin semiconductors; however, in thicker semiconductors the electron mean free path is high enough to mask this effect. Metallic samples show no dependence on RH. This study clarifies the effect of relative humidity in CAFM, enhances understanding of the technique, and teaches researchers how to improve the reliability of their studies in this field.

This article systematically analyzes the effect of RH in CAFM by applying ramped voltage stresses at over 17,000 locations on ten different samples (insulating, semiconducting, and conducting) under seven different RH. An ultra-reliable setup with a 110-pA current limitation during electrical stresses is employed, and&#160;excellent CAFM tip integrity after thousands of tests is demonstrated. It is found that higher RH results in increased currents due to the presence of a conductive&#160;water meniscus at the tip/sample junction, which increases the effective area for&#160;electron flow. This trend is observed in insulators and ultra-thin semiconductors; however, in thicker semiconductors the electron mean free path is high enough to mask this effect. Metallic samples show no dependence on RH. This study clarifies the effect of relative humidity in CAFM, enhances understanding of the technique, and teaches researchers how to improve the reliability of their studies in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Flexible Artificial Tactility with Excellent Robustness and Temperature Tolerance Based on Organohydrogel Sensor Array for Robot Motion Detection and Object Shape Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The robust and flexible artificial tactility enabled by a tough, low&#8208;hysteresis organohydrogel sensor array ensures precise detection of robot motion and external pressure over broad temperature range. Further bolstered by machine learning, robot tactility achieves accurate recognition of grasped objects, thereby expanding the potential application areas of novel intelligent robots.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based flexible artificial tactility is equipped to intelligent robots to mimic human mechanosensory perception. However, it remains a great challenge for hydrogel sensors to maintain flexibility and sensory performances during cyclic loadings at high or low temperatures due to water loss or freezing. Here, a flexible robot tactility is developed with high robustness based on organohydrogel sensor arrays with negligent hysteresis and temperature tolerance. Conductive polyaniline chains are interpenetrated through a poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;acrylic acid) network with glycerin/water mixture with interchain electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds, yielding a high dissipated energy of 1.58&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, and ultralow hysteresis during 1000 cyclic loadings. Moreover, the binary solvent provides the gels with outstanding tolerance from &#8722;100 to 60&#160;&#176;C and the organohydrogel sensors remain flexible, fatigue resistant, conductive (0.27 S m&#8722;1), highly strain sensitive (GF of 3.88) and pressure sensitive (35.8 MPa&#8722;1). The organohydrogel sensor arrays are equipped on manipulator finger dorsa and pads to simultaneously monitor the finger motions and detect the pressure distribution exerted by grasped objects. A machine learning model is used to train the system to recognize the shape of grasped objects with 100% accuracy. The flexible robot tactility based on organohydrogels is promising for novel intelligent robots.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Zinc Anode Enabled by a Recyclable Biomass Bamboo Membrane Separator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomass bamboo membrane separator with oxygen functional groups is proposed for dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes. Benefitting from the restrained activity of water molecules and anions, as well as the unique structure of the bamboo membrane, this separator enables Zn electrode to work at high capacity and current density with satisfying coulombic efficiency and lifespan.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries have gained attention as viable energy storage systems, yet the occurrence of detrimental side reactions and Zn dendrite formation undermines the efficiency of Zn anodes. Controlling water activity have proven to be an effective strategy in mitigating these challenges. However, strategies such as electrolyte design and electrode protection layer show weakness to varying degrees. Here, a new oxygen&#8208;functionalized biomass bamboo membrane separator (denoted as BM) is proposed to restrain the activity of water molecules. This BM separator features a unique, multi&#8208;tiered 2D interlayer that facilitates rapid ion diffusion. Additionally, the oxygen functional groups of the BM separator can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, effectively transforming water molecules from a free state to a bound state. Consequently, the Zn/Zn asymmetric coin cell using BM can work at the ultrahigh rate and capacity of 30 mA cm&#8722;2 and 30&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 for more than 80&#160;h while its counterparts using glass fiber&#160;can barely work. Moreover, full cells using BM separator exhibited a capacity retention of 89.7% after 1000 cycles at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This study reveals the important influence of water&#8208;limited activity on Zn anode protection and provides an avenue for the design of novel separator.

         <title>d&#8208;Orbital Induced Electronic Structure Reconfiguration toward Manipulating Electron Transfer Pathways of Metallo&#8208;Porphyrin for Enhanced AlCl2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallo&#8208;porphyrin compounds (employed Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ as the ion centers) can be used to regulate the electronic energy levels and electron transfer pathways. Thus, the NiTPP presents the highest specific capacity (177.1 mAh g&#8722;1), with an increment of 8.3% and 73.9% in comparison with the capacities of FeTPP and ZnTPP, respectively.








Abstract
The positive electrodes of non&#8208;aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AIBs) frequently encounter significant issues, for instance, low capacity in graphite (mechanism: anion de/intercalation and large electrode deformation induced) and poor stability in inorganic positive electrodes (mechanism: multi&#8208;electron redox reaction and dissolution of active materials induced). Here, metallo&#8208;porphyrin compounds (employed Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ as the ion centers) are introduced to effectively enhance both the cycling stability and reversible capacity due to the formation of stable conjugated metal&#8208;organic coordination and presence of axially coordinated active sites, respectively. With the regulation of electronic energy levels, the d&#8208;orbitals in the redox reactions and electron transfer pathways can be rearranged. The 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;21H,23H&#8208;porphine nickle(II) (NiTPP) presents the highest specific capacity (177.1 mAh g&#8722;1), with an increment of 32.1% and 77.1% in comparison with the capacities of H2TPP and graphite, respectively, which offers a new route for developing high&#8208;capacity positive electrodes for stable AIBs.

         <title>Controllable Contact&#8208;Destructive Hydrogel Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;contact&#8208;destructive&#8221; hydrogel actuator composed of a dynamic hydrogel network doped with hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) is innovatively proposed here. Such hydrogel actuator predetermined by diverse graphic patterns with the aid of 3D printing exhibits locomotion routes. Notably, diverse applications including controllable 3D structures collapse, self&#8208;erasing, and on&#8208;demand cell release, are well&#8208;demonstrated for the self&#8208;destructive hydrogel.








Abstract
Constructing hydrogels with spatially heterogeneous structures are crucial for unlocking novel applications. To this end, selectively removing a specific portion of hydrogels by facile and intricate destructive strategies is worth exploring. Herein, a &#8220;contact&#8208;destructive&#8221; hydrogel actuator is presented, composed of a dynamic hydrogel network doped with hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG). The destructive behavior of the hydrogel actuator is attributed to the surface tension&#8208;induced spreading effect and the enhanced water absorption due to the additive PEG. Parameters that act on these mechanisms are used to control the destruction of the hydrogel. During the destructive process, the hydrogel actuator exhibits locomotion routes predetermined by the graphic pattern with the aid of 3D printing. Additionally, such self&#8208;destructive behavior can be terminated by UV light irradiation when PEG is replaced with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA). Significantly, diverse applications including controllable 3D structures collapse, self&#8208;erasing, and on&#8208;demand cell release, are realized with such self&#8208;destructive hydrogel. These results demonstrate that the present hydrogel has great values in soft robotics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, controlled drug delivery, and other related fields.

         <title>Unveiling the Multifunctional Carbon Fiber Structural Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional structural batteries are set to revolutionize transportation by enhancing vehicle driving range and reducing energy consumption. This study demonstrates a fully functional structural battery, achieving the highest multifunctional performance to date. A cost&#8208;effective approach ensures multifunctionality from electrode fabrication to maintaining the mechanical properties of LFP&#8208;deposited carbon fibers, enhanced rigidity through biphasic solid&#8208;liquid electrolyte, and subsequent battery stiffness.








Abstract
Structural batteries refer to the multifunctional device capable of both storing electrical energy and bearing mechanical loads concurrently. In this context, carbon fibers emerge as a compelling choice of material and serve dual purpose by storing energy and providing stiffness and strength to the battery. Previous investigation has demonstrated proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of functional positive electrodes against metallic lithium in structural battery electrolyte. Here, an all&#8208;carbon fiber&#8208;based structural battery is demonstrated utilizing the pristine carbon fiber as negative electrode, lithium iron phosphate (LFP)&#8208;coated carbon fiber as positive electrode, and a thin cellulose separator.

&lt;p&gt;Multifunctional structural batteries are set to revolutionize transportation by enhancing vehicle driving range and reducing energy consumption. This study demonstrates a fully functional structural battery, achieving the highest multifunctional performance to date. A cost-effective approach ensures multifunctionality from electrode fabrication to maintaining the mechanical properties of LFP-deposited carbon fibers, enhanced rigidity through biphasic solid-liquid electrolyte, and subsequent battery stiffness.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural batteries refer to the multifunctional device capable of both storing electrical energy and bearing mechanical loads concurrently. In this context, carbon fibers emerge as a compelling choice of material and serve dual purpose by storing energy and providing stiffness and strength to the battery. Previous investigation has demonstrated proof-of-concept of functional positive electrodes against metallic lithium in structural battery electrolyte. Here, an all-carbon fiber-based structural battery is demonstrated utilizing the pristine carbon fiber as negative electrode, lithium iron phosphate (LFP)-coated carbon fiber as positive electrode, and a thin cellulose separator. All components are embedded in structural battery electrolyte and cured to provide rigidity to the battery. The energy density of structural battery is enhanced by use of the thin separator. The structural battery composite demonstrates an energy density of 30&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and cyclic stability up to 1000 cycles with &#8776;100% of Coulombic efficiency. Remarkably, the elastic modulus of the all-fiber structural battery exceeds 76&#160;GPa when tested in parallel to the fiber direction &#8211; by far highest till date reported in the literature. Structural batteries have immediate implication in replacing structural parts of electric vehicles while reducing the number of conventional batteries. Thus, offering mass savings to future electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Colorimetric Detection of Volatile Organic Compounds Using a Dye&#8208;Incorporated Photonic Crystal&#8208;Based Sensor Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colorimetric sensor array composed of dye&#8208;incorporated colloidal photonic crystals is fabricated for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The overlap between the photonic bandgap edge and the absorption peak of the dye enhances color changes. The sensor array generates distinct color difference maps for acetaldehyde, acetone, and acetic acid, respectively, with the limit of detection as low as 0.02&#160;ppm, without any data amplification.








Abstract
Chemoresponsive dyes offer the potential to selectively detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) unique to certain disease states. Among different VOC sensing techniques, colorimetric sensing offers the advantage of facile recognition. However, it is often challenging to discern the color changes by the naked eye. Here, highly sensitive colorimetric VOC sensor arrays from dye&#8208;incorporated colloidal photonic crystals (dye&#8208;cPhCs) are reported. cPhCs are scalably fabricated on a 4&#8208;inch wafer by spin&#8208;coating of silica nanoparticles (NPs) dispersed in a photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable monomer, where the gradient shear flow along the film thickness creates densely&#8208;packed square arrays of NPs in the top layers, whereas the bulk is quasi&#8208;amorphous with larger periodicities. The broadened reflection peak allows for augmented dye absorption originating from the overlap between the photonic bandgap edge of the cPhC and the dye absorption peak, leading to a more noticeable color change upon exposure to VOCs. The sensor array generates distinct color difference maps for acetaldehyde, acetone, and acetic acid, respectively, without any data amplification. The limit of detection for acetaldehyde, acetone, and acetic acid is 1, 0.1, and 0.02&#160;ppm, respectively. Moreover, VOC can be diagonalized by visually intuitive pattern recognition, and principal component analysis at reduced dimensionality is demonstrated.

         <title>Metastable CoCu2O3 Nanocrystals from Combustion&#8208;Aerosols for Molecular Sensing and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combustion&#8208;aerosol processes can stabilize phases that are not thermodynamically favored at ambient conditions. Key is traversing the temperature range of thermodynamic stability with sufficient residence time to form solid crystalline particles before rapid quenching. Here, CoCu2O3 nanocrystals are captured, which feature promising performance for molecular sensing and catalytic applications. Furthermore, versatility to access other metastable compositions and even heterostructures is demonstrated.








Abstract
Metastable nanostructures are kinetically trapped in local energy minima featuring intriguing surface and material properties. To unleash their potential, there is a need for non&#8208;equilibrium processes capable of stabilizing a large range of crystal phases outside thermodynamic equilibrium conditions by closely and flexibly controlling atomic reactant composition, spatial temperature distribution and residence time. Here, the capture of metastable pseudo&#8208;binary metal oxides at room temperature is demonstrated with scalable combustion&#8208;aerosol processes. By a combination of X&#8208;ray diffraction, electron microscopy and on&#8208;line flame characterization, the occurrence of metastable CoCu2O3 is investigated with controlled crystal size (4&#8211;16&#160;nm) over thermodynamically stable CuO and Co3O4. Immediate practical impact is demonstrated by exceptional sensing and stable catalytic performance for air pollutant detection (e.g., 15 parts&#8208;per&#8208;billion benzene) shown for, at least, 21 days. This approach can be extended to various binary, ternary and high entropy oxides with even more components. Also, secondary phases can be loaded on such metastable nanocrystals to access novel materials promising for actuators, energy storage or solar cells.

         <title>Digitonin&#8208;Loaded Nanoscale Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Radiotherapy&#8208;Radiodynamic Therapy and Disulfidptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mitochondria&#8208;targeted cationic nanoscale metal organic framework shows strong radiotherapy&#8208;radiodynamic therapy effects and selectively releases digitonin in acidic tumor microenvironments to induce disulfidptosis of cancer cells and downregulate immune checkpoints in cancer and T cells, thereby eliciting strong antitumor immunity to effectively inhibit tumor growth.








Abstract
The efficacy of radiotherapy (RT) is limited by inefficient X&#8208;ray absorption and reactive oxygen species generation, upregulation of immunosuppressive factors, and a reducing tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, the design of a mitochondria&#8208;targeted and digitonin (Dig)&#8208;loaded nanoscale metal&#8208;organic framework, Th&#8208;Ir&#8208;DBB/Dig, is reported to overcome these limitations and elicit strong antitumor effects upon low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation. Built from Th6O4(OH)4 secondary building units (SBUs) and photosensitizing Ir(DBB)(ppy)22+ (Ir&#8208;DBB, DBB&#160;=&#160;4,4&#8242;&#8208;di(4&#8208;benzoato)&#8722;2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine; ppy&#160;=&#160;2&#8208;phenylpyridine) ligands, Th&#8208;Ir&#8208;DBB exhibits strong RT&#8208;radiodynamic therapy (RDT) effects via potent radiosensitization with high&#8208;Z SBUs for hydroxyl radical generation and efficient excitation of Ir&#8208;DBB ligands for singlet oxygen production. Th&#8208;Ir&#8208;DBB/Dig releases digitonin in acidic TMEs to trigger disulfidptosis of cancer cells and sensitize cancer cells to RT&#8208;RDT through glucose and glutathione depletion. The released digitonin simultaneously downregulates multiple immune checkpoints in cancer cells and T cells through cholesterol depletion. As a result, Th&#8208;Ir&#8208;DBB/dig plus X&#8208;ray irradiation induces strong antitumor immunity to effectively inhibit tumor growth in mouse models of colon and breast cancer.

         <title>Tough Cortical Bone&#8208;Inspired Tubular Architected Cement&#8208;Based Material with Disorder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disordered tubular architected cement&#8208;based materials inspired by cortical bone exhibit stepwise cracking toughening mechanism, preventing brittle fracture in otherwise brittle material. Competing effects of tube size, shape, and orientation demonstrate a utility for achieving up to 5.6&#8208;fold&#8208;higher fracture toughness. Two order parameters from statistical mechanics provide pathway to quantify disorder in architected arrangements as described by Reza Moini and co&#8208;worker.








Abstract
Cortical bone is a tough biological material composed of tube&#8208;like osteons embedded in the organic matrix surrounded by weak interfaces known as cement lines. The cement lines provide a microstructurally preferable crack path, hence triggering in&#8208;plane crack deflection around osteons due to cement line&#8208;crack interaction. Inspired by this toughening mechanism and facilitated by a hybrid (3D&#8208;printing/casting) process, the study engineers architected tubular cement&#8208;based materials with the stepwise cracking toughening mechanism, that enables a non&#8208;brittle fracture. Using experimental and theoretical approaches, the study demonstrates the competition between tube size and shape on stress intensity factor from which engineering stepwise cracking can emerge. Two competing mechanisms, both positively and negatively affected by the growing tube size, arise to significantly enhance the overall fracture toughness by up to 5.6&#8208;fold compared to the monolithic brittle counterpart without sacrificing the specific strength. This is enabled by crack&#8208;tube interaction and engineering the tube size, shape, and orientation, which promotes rising resistance&#8208;curves (R&#8208;curve). &#8220;Disorder&#8221; curves and statistical mechanics parameters are proposed for the first time to quantitatively characterize the degree of disorder for describing the representation of the architected arrangement of materials in lieu of otherwise inadequate &#8220;periodicity&#8221; classification and misperceived&#160;disorder parameters (perturbation and Voronoi tessellation methods).

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing Doublet Sensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the circumvention of spin&#8208;flip in a new device concept, namely doublet&#8208;sensitized fluorescence, near&#8208;unit exciton utilization efficiency and remarkably short exciton residence time of 1.3&#160;&#181;s are achieved. Fast (over 108&#160;s&#8722;1) and efficient (&#8776;100%) exciton utilization enables high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency of 30.0% and a small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 14.7%.








Abstract
Fast and efficient exciton utilization is a crucial solution and highly desirable for achieving high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the rate and efficiency of exciton utilization in traditional OLEDs, which employ fully closed&#8208;shell materials as emitters, are inevitably limited by spin statistical limitations and transition prohibition. Herein, a new sensitization strategy, namely doublet&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (DSF), is proposed to realize high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence. In the DSF&#8208;OLED, a doublet&#8208;emitting cerium(III) complex, Ce&#8208;2, is utilized as sensitizer for multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter &#957;&#8208;DABNA. Experimental results reveal that holes and electrons predominantly recombine on Ce&#8208;2 to form doublet excitons, which subsequently transfer energy to the singlet state of &#957;&#8208;DABNA via exceptionally fast (over 108&#160;s&#8722;1) and efficient (&#8776;100%) F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer for deep&#8208;blue emission. Due to the circumvention of spin&#8208;flip in the DSF mechanism, near&#8208;unit exciton utilization efficiency and remarkably short exciton residence time of 1.36&#160;&#181;s are achieved in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept deep&#8208;blue DSF&#8208;OLED, which achieves a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinate of (0.13, 0.14), a high external quantum efficiency of 30.0%, and small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 14.7% at a luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. The DSF device exhibits significantly improved operational stability compared with unsensitized reference device.

         <title>Toward the Integration of Machine Learning and Molecular Modeling for Designing Drug Delivery Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of physics&#8208;based models from traditional simulation methods with data&#8208;driven models from artificial intelligence and data analytics paves the way for the rational design of nanocarriers for drug delivery.








Abstract
The pioneering work on liposomes in the 1960s and subsequent research in controlled drug release systems significantly advances the development of nanocarriers (NCs) for drug delivery. This field is evolved to include a diverse array of nanocarriers such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and more, each tailored to specific therapeutic applications. Despite significant achievements, the clinical translation of nanocarriers is limited, primarily due to the low efficiency of drug delivery and an incomplete understanding of nanocarrier interactions with biological systems. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration and a deep understanding of the nano&#8208;bio interface. To enhance nanocarrier design, scientists employ both physics&#8208;based and data&#8208;driven models. Physics&#8208;based models provide detailed insights into chemical reactions and interactions at atomic and molecular scales, while data&#8208;driven models leverage machine learning to analyze large datasets and uncover hidden mechanisms. The integration of these models presents challenges such as harmonizing different modeling approaches and ensuring model validation and generalization across biological systems. However, this integration is crucial for developing effective and targeted nanocarrier systems. By integrating these approaches with enhanced data infrastructure, explainable AI, computational advances, and machine learning potentials, researchers can develop innovative nanomedicine solutions, ultimately improving therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Engineered Nanoparticles for Enhanced Antitumoral Synergy Between Macrophages and T Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#8208;1)&#8208;transfected macrophage membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (PMMNPs) enable tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of dual immune checkpoint inhibitors for both T cells and macrophages. Consequently, PMMNPs not only enhance the antitumoral immunity of macrophages and T cells but also foster antitumoral synergy between these cells. This synergy is achieved by promoting tumor antigen presentation and subsequent T cell activation, and inducing the reprogramming of macrophages toward an antitumoral phenotype.








Abstract
T cells and macrophages have the potential to collaborate to eliminate tumor cells efficiently. Macrophages can eliminate tumor cells through phagocytosis and subsequently activate T cells by presenting tumor antigens. The activated T cells, in turn, can kill tumor cells and redirect tumor&#8208;associated macrophages toward an antitumoral M1 phenotype. However, checkpoint molecules expressed on tumor cells impede the collaborative action of these immune cells. Meanwhile, monotherapy with a single immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for either macrophages or T cells yields suboptimal efficacy in cancer patients. To address this challenge, here a nanoparticle capable of efficiently delivering dual ICIs to tumors for both macrophages and T cells is developed. These programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#8208;1)&#8208;transfected macrophage membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (PMMNPs) can target tumors and provide signal&#8208;regulatory protein alpha and PD&#8208;1 to block CD47 and programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), respectively, on tumor cells. PMMNPs enhance macrophage&#8208;mediated cancer cell phagocytosis and antigen presentation, promote T cell activation, and induce the reprogramming of macrophages toward an antitumoral phenotype. In syngeneic tumor&#8208;bearing mice, PMMNPs demonstrate superior therapeutic efficacy compared to nanoparticles delivering single ICIs and non&#8208;targeted delivery of anti&#8208;CD47 and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies. PMMNPs capable of augmenting the antitumoral interplay between macrophages and T cells may offer a promising avenue for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Multimaterial Digital&#8208;Light Processing of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) Composites: A Versatile Tool for the Rapid Microfabrication of MOF&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel method, combining DLP with a capillary&#8208;assisted stop&#8208;flow system, for the arbitrary and multiplexed micropatterning of MOFs over large areas while maintaining pore accessibility. Demonstrations include a luminescent oxygen sensor, an encryption system, and a colorimetric sensor, enhancing the accessibility and potential of MOF&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Patterning Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is essential for their use in sensing, electronics, photonics, and encryption technologies. However, current lithography methods are limited in their ability to pattern more than two MOFs, hindering the potential for creating advanced multifunctional surfaces. Additionally, balancing design flexibility, simplicity, and cost often results in compromises. This study addresses these challenges by combining Digital&#8208;Light Processing (DLP) with a capillary&#8208;assisted stop&#8208;flow system to enable multimaterial MOF patterning. It demonstrates the desktop fabrication of multiplexed arbitrary micropatterns across cm&#8208;scale areas while preserving the MOF's pore accessibility. The ink, consisting of a MOF crystal suspension in a low volatile solvent, a mixture of high molecular weight oligomers, and a photoinitiator, is confined by capillarity in the DLP projection area and quickly exchanged using syringe pumps. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by the direct printing of a ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based luminescent oxygen sensor, a 5&#8208;component dynamic information concealment method, and a PCN&#8208;224&#8208;based colorimetric sensor for amines, covering disparate pore and analyte sizes. The multi&#8208;MOF capabilities, simplicity, and accessibility of this strategy pave the way for the facile exploration of MOF materials across a wide range of applications, with the potential to significantly accelerate the design&#8208;to&#8208;application cycle of MOF&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Sensing Interfaces Engineering for Organic Thin Film Transistors&#8208;Based Biosensors: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs)&#8208;based biosensors are fascinating due to their properties of low cost, label&#8208;free, and inherent signal amplification. The review provides a comprehensive and timely review of optimization in sensing interface engineering, and how efficient immobilization of biological sensing probes on sensing interfaces can contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors.








Abstract
Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) enable rapid and label&#8208;free high&#8208;sensitivity detection of target analytes due to their low cost, large&#8208;area processing, biocompatibility, and inherent signal amplification. At the same time, the freedom of synthesis, tailorability, and functionalization of organic semiconductor materials and their ability to be combined with flexible substrates make them one of the ideal platforms for biosensing. However, OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors still face significant challenges, such as unexpected surface adsorption, disordered conformation, inhomogeneous graft density, and flexibility of probe molecules that biological sensing probes would face during immobilization. In this review, efficient immobilization strategies based on OTFTs biological sensing probes developed in the last 5 years are highlighted. First, the biosensors are classified according to their sensing interface. Second, a comprehensive discussion of the types of biological sensing probes is presented. Third, three commonly used methods for immobilizing biological sensing probes and their challenges are briefly described. Finally, the applications of OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors for liquid phase detection are summarized. This review provides a comprehensive and timely review of optimization in sensing interface engineering so that efficient immobilization of biological sensing probes with sensing interfaces will contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance OTFTs&#8208;based biosensors.

     alt="Sensing Interfaces Engineering for Organic Thin Film Transistors-Based Biosensors: Opportunities and Challenges"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs)-based biosensors are fascinating due to their properties of low cost, label-free, and inherent signal amplification. The review provides a comprehensive and timely review of optimization in sensing interface engineering, and how efficient immobilization of biological sensing probes on sensing interfaces can contribute to the development of high-performance OTFTs-based biosensors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) enable rapid and label-free high-sensitivity detection of target analytes due to their low cost, large-area processing, biocompatibility, and inherent signal amplification. At the same time, the freedom of synthesis, tailorability, and functionalization of organic semiconductor materials and their ability to be combined with flexible substrates make them one of the ideal platforms for biosensing. However, OTFTs-based biosensors still face significant challenges, such as unexpected surface adsorption, disordered conformation, inhomogeneous graft density, and flexibility of probe molecules that biological sensing probes would face during immobilization. In this review, efficient immobilization strategies based on OTFTs biological sensing probes developed in the last 5 years are highlighted. First, the biosensors are classified according to their sensing interface. Second, a comprehensive discussion of the types of biological sensing probes is presented. Third, three commonly used methods for immobilizing biological sensing probes and their challenges are briefly described. Finally, the applications of OTFTs-based biosensors for liquid phase detection are summarized. This review provides a comprehensive and timely review of optimization in sensing interface engineering so that efficient immobilization of biological sensing probes with sensing interfaces will contribute to the development of high-performance OTFTs-based biosensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupled High&#8208;Mobility Graphene on Cu(111)/Sapphire via Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth via chemical vapor deposition of decoupled graphene on crystalline Cu(111) films deposited on sapphire is introduced. The resulting graphene is lying atop a thin Cu2O layer and is charge neutral, low strained, and easy to transfer. Electrical transport measurements reveal excellent room temperature carrier mobilities, exceeding 105&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 upon encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride, thus opening realistic pathways for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation applications.








Abstract
The growth of high&#8208;quality graphene on flat and rigid templates, such as metal thin films on insulating wafers, is regarded as a key enabler for technologies based on 2D materials. In this work, the growth of decoupled graphene is introduced via non&#8208;reducing low&#8208;pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on crystalline Cu(111) films deposited on sapphire. The resulting film is atomically flat, with no detectable cracks or ripples, and lies atop of a thin Cu2O layer, as confirmed by microscopy, diffraction, and spectroscopy analyses. Post&#8208;growth treatment of the partially decoupled graphene enables full and uniform oxidation of the interface, greatly simplifying subsequent transfer processes, particularly dry&#8208;pick up &#8212; a task that proves challenging when dealing with graphene directly synthesized on metallic Cu(111). Electrical transport measurements reveal high carrier mobility at room temperature, exceeding 104&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 on SiO2/Si and 105&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 upon encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The demonstrated growth approach yields exceptional material quality, in line with micro&#8208;mechanically exfoliated graphene flakes, and thus paves the way toward large&#8208;scale production of pristine graphene suitable for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation applications.

         <title>Polyfunctional and Multisensory Bio&#8208;Ionoelastomers Enabled by Covalent Adaptive Networks With Hierarchically Dynamic Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With dynamic covalent and supramolecular design, a bio&#8208;ionoelastomer featuring covalent adaptive networks with hierarchically dynamic bonding is obtained via melt building approach. The multifunction and multisensory capability endow the bio&#8208;ionoelastomer with comprehensive roadmap toward soft ionotronic devices in the field of remotely monitoring, diagnosing multi&#8208;metric, and complex physiological information.








Abstract
Developing versatile ionoelastomers, the alternatives to hydrogels and ionogels, will boost the advancement of high&#8208;performance ionotronic devices. However, meeting the requirements of bio&#8208;derivation, high toughness, high stretchability, autonomous self&#8208;healing ability, high ionic conductivity, reprocessing, and favorable recyclability in a single ionoelastomer remains a challenging endeavor. Herein, a dynamic covalent and supramolecular design, lipoic acid (LA)&#8208;based dynamic covalent ionoelastomer (DCIE), is proposed via melt building covalent adaptive networks with hierarchically dynamic bonding (CAN&#8208;HDB), wherein lithium bonds aid in the dissociation of ions and the integration of dynamic disulfide metathesis, lithium bonds, and binary hydrogen bonds enhances the mechanical performances, self&#8208;healing capability, reprocessing, and recyclability. Therefore, the trade&#8208;off among mechanical versatility, ionic conductivity, self&#8208;healing capability, reprocessing, and recyclability is successfully handled. The obtained DCIE demonstrates remarkable stretchability (1011.7%), high toughness (3877&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), high ionic conductivity (3.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), outstanding self&#8208;healing capability, reprocessing for 3D printing, and desirable recyclability. Significantly, the selective ion transport endows the DCIE with multisensory feature capable of generating continuous electrical signals for high&#8208;quality sensations towards temperature, humidity, and strain. Coupled with the straightforward methodology, abundant availability of LA and HPC, as well as multifunction, the DCIEs present new concept of advanced ionic conductors for developing soft ionotronics.

         <title>Electron Release via Internal Polarization Fields for Optimal S&#8208;H Bonding States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study offers insights into material design rules for activating the basal planes of TMDs and suggests ultimate strategies using positively charged built&#8208;in polarized fields that electrostatically repel H2S+ ions. The de&#8208;localizing charge density derived from the released electrons originally bound to S atoms at the Sv incorporated heterointerface, results in unidirectional charge transport to the basal plane.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have received considerable attention as promising electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet their potential is often constrained by the inertness of the basal planes arising from their poor hydrogen adsorption ability. Here, the relationship between the electronic structure of the WS2 basal plane and HER activity is systemically analyzed to establish a clear insight. The valance state of the sulfur atoms on the basal plane has been tuned to enhance hydrogen adsorption through sequential engineering processes, including direct phase transition and heterostructure that induces work function&#8208;difference&#8208;induced unidirectional electron transfer. Additionally, an innovative synthetic approach, harnessing the built&#8208;in internal polarization field at the W&#8208;graphene heterointerface, triggers the in&#8208;situ formation of sulfur vacancies in the bottom WSx (x &lt; 2) layers. The resultant modulation of the valance state of the sulfur atom stabilizes the W&#8208;S bond, while destabilizing the S&#8208;H bond. The electronic structural changes are further amplified by the release and transfer of surplus electrons via sulfur vacancies, filling the valance state of W and S atoms. Consequently, this work provides a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the electronic structure of the WS2 basal plane and the HER activity, focusing on optimizing S&#8208;H bonding state.

         <title>Carrier&#8211;Carrier Repulsion Limits the Conductivity of N&#8208;Doped Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined dependence of the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient on the carrier density shows that the electrical conductivity at high doping is limited by the repulsion of electrons by other electrons. The carrier density nx corresponding to the maximum electrical conductivity coincides with the carrier density at which the Seebeck coefficient collapses onto Heike's law.









Abstract
Molecular doping is a key strategy to enhance the electrical conductivity of organic semiconductors. Typically, the electrical conductivity shows a maximum value upon increased doping, after which the conductivity decreases. This decrease in conductivity is commonly attributed to unfavorable changes in the morphology. However, in recent simulation work, has shown, that the conductivity&#8212;at high doping&#8212;is instead limited by electron&#8211;electron repulsion rather than by morphology, at least for some material combinations. Based on the simulations, this limitation is expected to show up in the dependence of the Seebeck coefficient versus carrier density: the Seebeck coefficient will follow Heike's formula if carrier&#8211;carrier repulsion limits the conductivity. Here, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are measured as a function of doping for a series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors. Additionally, the resulting carrier density is measured using metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor diodes, which link dopant loading and the number of charge carriers. At high carrier densities, the Seebeck coefficient indeed follows Heike's formula, confirming that the conductivity is limited by carrier&#8211;carrier repulsion rather than by morphological effects. This study shows that current models of hopping transport in organic semiconductors may be incomplete. As a result, this study offers novel insights in the design of organic semiconductors.

         <title>Customized Corneal Cross&#8208;Linking with Microneedle&#8208;Mediated Riboflavin Delivery for Keratoconus Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel customized corneal cross&#8208;linking (CXL) treatment, which utilizes microneedles for targeted riboflavin administration, not only achieves exceptional customized CXL effects comparable to the conventional epi&#8208;off CXL protocol, but also improves visual function by flattening the corneal curvature within the treated zone, paving the way for customized CXL treatment of keratoconus and other corneal pathologies.








Abstract
In this study, a novel customized corneal cross&#8208;linking (CXL) treatment is explored that utilizes microneedles (MNs) for targeted riboflavin (RF) administration prior to the CXL procedure. Unlike the conventional &#8220;one&#8208;size&#8208;fits&#8208;all&#8221; approach, this protocol offers an option for more precise and efficacious treatment. To simulate a customized corneal crosslinking technique, four distinct microneedle (MN) molds designs, including circular, semi&#8208;circular, annular and butterfly shaped, are crafted for loading an optimized RF&#8208;hyaluronic acid solution and for the subsequent fabrication of MN arrays with varying morphologies. These MNs can gently puncture the corneal epithelium while preserving the integrity of the underlying stromal layer. Following the application of these microneedles, RF solution is replenished to enhance the RF content within the stroma through the punctures created by the MNs, resulting in exceptional customized corneal cross&#8208;linking effects that are comparable to the conventional epi&#8208;off CXL protocol. Additionally, it flattened the corneal curvature within the treated zone and facilitated rapid postoperative recovery of corneal tissue. These findings suggest that the integration of customized microneedle RF delivery with corneal crosslinking technology represents a potential novel treatment modality, holding promise for the tailored treatment of corneal pathologies, and offering a more precise and efficient alternative to traditional methods.

         <title>Enhancing Detection Frequency and Reducing Noise Through Continuous Structures via Release&#8208;Controlled Transfer Toward Light&#8208;Based Wireless Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Innovative organic photodetector design based on transfer printing demonstrates enhancement in the detectivity, response speed, and frequency resolution for light&#8208;based wireless communication. Multiple&#8208;active layer that integrates a continuous single acceptor and a bulk&#8208;heterojunction (A/BHJ) structure is realized through solid&#8208;state transfer printing. A/BHJ structure contributes to extended exciton&#8208;diffusion&#8208;length and efficient trap passivation, related with improved response speed and reduced noise.








Abstract
Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have received considerable attention owing to their superior absorption coefficient and tunable bandgap. The introduction of bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) structure aims to maximize charge generation, however, its response speed is constrained by the random distribution of donor and acceptor. Herein, a multiple&#8208;active layer design consisting of a single acceptor layer and a bulk&#8208;heterojunction layer (A/BHJ structure) is introduced, which combines the benefits of both the planar junction and the BHJ, improving photo&#8208;sensing. A transfer process is employed for this structure, which involves calculating the energy release rate at each interface, considering temperature and velocity. Consequently, the OPD with the A/BHJ structure is successfully fabricated through transfer printing, resulting in reduced dark current, superior detectivity (1.06 &#215; 1013 Jones), and rapid response, achieved by creating a high hole injection barrier and suppressing trap sites within the interfaces. By thoroughly investigating charge dynamics in the structure, the A/BHJ structure&#8208;based OPD attains large bandwidth detection with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise. An efficient wireless data communication system with digital&#8208;to&#8208;analog conversion is showcased using the A/BHJ structure&#8208;based OPD.

         <title>Magnetic Miniature Soft Robot with Reprogrammable Drug&#8208;Dispensing Functionalities: Toward Advanced Targeted Combination Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Miniature robots have great prospects to transform targeted drug delivery. Here, a miniature soft robot is proposed, which can dispense four types of drugs with reprogrammable drug&#8208;dispensing sequence and dosage. This soft robot can inspire unprecedented, targeted combination therapy, where multiple drugs must be delivered to various disease sites, each with a specific sequence and dosage of drugs.








Abstract
Miniature robots are untethered actuators, which have great prospects to transform targeted drug delivery because they can potentially deliver high concentrations of medicine to the disease site(s) with minimal complications. However, existing miniature robots cannot perform advanced targeted combination therapy; majority of them can at most transport one type of drug, while those that can carry multiple drugs are unable to change their drug&#8208;dispensing sequence and dosage. Furthermore, the latter robots cannot transport more than three types of drugs, selectively dispense their drugs, maintain their mobility, or release their drugs at multiple sites. Here, a millimeter&#8208;scale soft robot is proposed, which can be actuated by alternating magnetic fields to dispense four types of drugs with reprogrammable drug&#8208;dispensing sequence and dosage (dispensing rates: 0.0992&#8211;0.231&#160;&#181;L&#160;h&#8722;1). This robot has six degrees&#8208;of&#8208;freedom motions, and it can deliver its drugs to multiple desired sites by rolling and two&#8208;anchor crawling across unstructured environments with negligible drug leakage. Such dexterity is highly desirable and unprecedented for miniature robots with drug&#8208;dispensing capabilities. The soft robot therefore has great potential to enable advanced targeted combination therapy, where four types of drugs must be delivered to various disease sites, each with a specific sequence and dosage of drugs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the evolution of AIE materials in bacterial research, highlighting their journey from initial studies of visualizing the unseen bacterial world to uncovering the underlying interaction and antibacterial mechanism. Recent advancements highlight the versatility and potential of AIE materials across a multitude of bacterial applications, showcasing their significant impact in various scientific fields.








Abstract
Bacteria share a longstanding and complex relationship with humans, playing a role in protecting gut health and sustaining the ecosystem to cause infectious diseases and antibiotic resistance. Luminogenic materials that share aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics have emerged as a versatile toolbox for bacterial studies through fluorescence visualization. Numerous research efforts highlight the superiority of AIE materials in this field. Recent advances in AIE materials in bacterial studies are categorized into four areas: understanding bacterial interactions, antibacterial strategies, diverse applications, and synergistic applications with bacteria. Initial research focuses on visualizing the unseen bacteria and progresses into developing strategies involving electrostatic interactions, amphiphilic AIE luminogens (AIEgens), and various AIE materials to enhance bacterial affinity. Recent progress in antibacterial strategies includes using photodynamic and photothermal therapies, bacterial toxicity studies, and combined therapies. Diverse applications from environmental disinfection to disease treatment, utilizing AIE materials in antibacterial coatings, bacterial sensors, wound healing materials, etc., are also provided. Finally, synergistic applications combining AIE materials with bacteria to achieve enhanced outcomes are explored. This review summarizes the developmental trend of AIE materials in bacterial studies and is expected to provide future research directions in advancing bacterial methodologies.

         <title>Advances in Functional Organosulfur&#8208;Based Mediators for Regulating Performance of Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organosulfur compounds containing dynamic C&#8211;S/S&#8211;S covalent bonds, exhibit tunable structures, unique functional adaptability, and environmental friendliness, enabling the rational design of targeted functionalities. This review summarizes the latest fundamental advances in their roles as functional mediators in optimizing the performance of diverse LMB systems and discusses the challenges, potential applications, and future research directions for this exciting class of materials.









Abstract
Rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density. However, their practical applications are hindered by lithium dendrite growth and various intricate issues associated with the cathodes. These challenges can be mitigated by using organosulfur&#8208;based mediators (OSMs), which offer the advantages of abundance, tailorable structures, and unique functional adaptability. These features enable the rational design of targeted functionalities, enhance the interfacial stability of the lithium anode and cathode, and accelerate the redox kinetics of electrodes via alternative reaction pathways, thereby effectively improving the performance of LMBs. Unlike the extensively explored field of organosulfur cathode materials, OSMs have garnered little attention. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements in OSMs for various LMB systems, including lithium&#8211;sulfur, lithium&#8211;selenium, lithium&#8211;oxygen, lithium&#8208;intercalation cathode batteries, and other LMB systems. It briefly elucidates the operating principles of these LMB systems, the regulatory mechanisms of the corresponding OSMs, and the fundamentals of OSMs activity. Ultimately, strategic optimizations are proposed for designing novel OSMs, advanced mechanism investigation, expanded applications, and the development of safe battery systems, thereby providing directions to narrow the gap between rational modulation of organosulfur compounds and their practical implementation in batteries.

         <title>K&#8208;Rich Spinel Interface of Air&#8208;Stable Layered Oxide Cathodes for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With layered oxide powders immersed in water, the K+ in the bulk phase is partially dissolved in water and accumulates on the surface of the particles. At a high K+ content, the layered phase on the surface is in situ converted into the spinel phase, which exhibits improved surface stability against air and maintains electrochemical stability in an ambient environment.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;containing transition metal layered oxides (KxTmO2), although possessing high energy density and suitable operating voltage, suffer from severe hygroscopic properties due to their two dimensional (2D)&#160;layered structure. Their air sensitivity compromises structural stability during prolonged air exposure, therefore increasing the cost. The common sense for designing air&#8208;stable layered cathode materials is to avoid contact with H2O&#160;molecules. In this study, it is surprisingly found that P3&#8208;type KxTmO2 forms an ultra&#8208;thin, potassium&#8208;rich spinel phase wrapping layer after simply water immersion, remarkedly reduces the reaction activity of the material's surface with air. Combined with Density Function Theory (DFT) calculations, this spinel phase is found to be able to effectively withstand air deterioration and preserving the crystal structure. Consequently, the water&#8208;treated material, when exposed to air, can largely maintain its good electrochemical performance, with capacity retention up to 99.15% compared to the fresh samples. Such an in situ surface phase transformation mechanism is also corroborated in other KxTmO2, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing the air stability of P3&#8208;type layered oxides for K+ storage.

         <title>A Nucleophilicity&#8208;Engineered DNA Ligation Blockade Nanoradiosensitizer Induces Irreversible DNA Damage to Overcome Cancer Radioresistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilicity&#8208;engineered DNA ligation blockade nanoradiosensitizer (DLBN) comprising Au/CeO2 heteronanostructure modified with trans&#8208;acting activator of transcription peptides, is developed. The DLBN, by leveraging Au/CeO2 heterointerface, spontaneously dissociates H2O to hydroxide, facilitating nucleophilic attack on phosphoester bonds. Remarkably, DLBN targeted inhibits the DNA ligation inside cancer cell nuclei via heterointerface&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of DNA, a crucial step in overcoming cancer radioresistance.








Abstract
During fractionated radiotherapy, DNA damage repair intensifies in tumor cells, culminating in cancer radioresistance and subsequent radiotherapy failure. Despite the recent development of nanoradiosensitizers targeting specific DNA damage repair pathways, the persistence of repair mechanisms involving multiple pathways remains inevitable. To address this challenge, a nucleophilicity&#8208;engineered DNA ligation blockade nanoradiosensitizer (DLBN) comprising Au/CeO2 heteronanostructure modified with trans&#8208;acting activator of transcription peptides is reported, which targets and inhibits the DNA ligation inside cancer cell nuclei via heterointerface&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of DNA, a crucial step in overcoming cancer radioresistance. First, the Schottky&#8208;type heteronanostructure of cancer cell nucleus&#8208;targeting DLBN effectively intensifies radiation&#8208;induced DNA damage via catalase&#8208;mimetic activity and radiation&#8208;triggered catalytic reactions. Notably, by leveraging Au/CeO2 heterointerface, DLBN spontaneously dissociates H2O to hydroxide, a nucleophile with higher nucleophilicity, thereby exhibiting remarkable dephosphorylation capability at DNA nicks through facilitated nucleophilic attack. This enables the blockade of DNA ligation, a pivotal step in all DNA damage repair pathways, effectively interrupting the repair process. Consequently, DLBN resensitizes radioresistant cells by overcoming therapy&#8208;induced radioresistance, leading to a substantial accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage. These findings offer insight into the dephosphorylation of DNA within nuclei, and underscore the potential of heteronanostructure&#8208;based nanoradiosensitizer to block DNA ligation against therapy&#8208;induced radioresistance.

         <dc:description>
Molten salt&#8208;assisted synthesis (MSAS) strategy possesses specific functions, including providing uniform liquid environment, forming favorable reaction intermediates, generating strong polarity forces, exfoliating or etching reactants, and modulating the microstructure and crystal plane feature, thus enriching the creation pathways of high&#8208;performance catalysts.








Abstract
A breakthrough in manufacturing procedures often enables people to obtain the desired functional materials. For the field of energy conversion, designing and constructing catalysts with high cost&#8208;effectiveness is urgently needed for commercial requirements. Herein, the molten salt&#8208;assisted synthesis (MSAS) strategy is emphasized, which combines the advantages of traditional solid and liquid phase synthesis of catalysts. It not only provides sufficient kinetic accessibility, but effectively controls the size, morphology, and crystal plane features of the product, thus possessing promising application prospects. Specifically, the selection and role of the molten salt system, as well as the mechanism of molten salt assistance are analyzed in depth. Then, the creation of the catalyst by the MSAS and the electrochemical energy conversion related application are introduced in detail. Finally, the key problems and countermeasures faced in breakthroughs are discussed and look forward to the future. Undoubtedly, this systematical review and insights here will promote the comprehensive understanding of the MSAS and further stimulate the generation of new and high efficiency catalysts.

         <title>Synergistic Performance of Thermoelectric and Mechanical in Nanotwinned High&#8208;Entropy Semiconductors AgMnGePbSbTe5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By increasing the configurational entropy to reduce the stacking fault energy, dense nanotwins in a new high&#8208;entropy semiconductor AgMnGePbSbTe5 are obtained. Dense coherent nanotwin boundaries provide efficient phonon scattering and dislocation pinning, leading to a high ZT of &#8776;2.46 at 750&#160;K and robust mechanical properties with a flexural strength of 82&#160;MPa and Vickers hardness of 210&#160;HV at room temperature.








Abstract
Introducing nanotwins in thermoelectric materials represents a promising approach to achieving such a synergistic combination of thermoelectric properties and mechanical properties. By increasing configurational entropy, a sharply reduced stacking fault energy in a new nanotwinned high&#8208;entropy semiconductor AgMnGePbSbTe5 is reached. Dense coherent nanotwin boundaries in this system provide an efficient phonon scattering barrier, leading to a high figure of merit ZT of &#8776;2.46 at 750&#160;K and a high average ZT of &#8776;1.54 (300&#8212;823&#160;K) with the presence of Ag2Te nanoprecipitate in the sample. More importantly, owing to the dislocation pinning caused by coherent nanotwin boundaries and the chemical short&#8208;range disorder caused by the high configurational entropy effect, AgMnGePbSbTe5 also exhibits robust mechanical properties, with flexural strength of 82&#160;MPa and Vickers hardness of 210&#160;HV.

         <title>Angular&#8208;Inertia Regulated Stable and Nanoscale Sensing of Single Molecules Using Nanopore&#8208;In&#8208;A&#8208;Tube</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study develops a nanopore&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;tube (NIAT) device that precisely regulates molecule translocation in a funnel&#8208;shaped nanopore by controlling the inertial angle and centrifugation speed in a centrifuge. This ensures stable signal readout with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, enabling nanoscale sensing of single molecules.








Abstract
Nanopore is commonly used for high&#8208;resolution, label&#8208;free sensing, and analysis of single molecules. However, controlling the speed and trajectory of molecular translocation in nanopores remains challenging, hampering sensing accuracy. Here, the study proposes a nanopore&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;tube (NIAT) device that enables decoupling of the current signal detection from molecular translocation and provides precise angular inertia&#8208;kinetic translocation of single molecules through a nanopore, thus ensuring stable signal readout with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR). Specifically, the funnel&#8208;shaped silicon nanopore, fabricated at a 10&#8208;nm resolution, is placed into a centrifugal tube. A light&#8208;induced photovoltaic effect is utilized to achieve a counter&#8208;balanced state of electrokinetic effects in the nanopore. By controlling the inertial angle and centrifugation speed, the angular inertial force is harnessed effectively for regulating the translocation process with high precision. Consequently, the speed and trajectory of the molecules are able to be adjusted in and around the nanopore, enabling controllable and high SNR current signals. Numerical simulation reveals the decisive role of inertial angle in achieving uniform translocation trajectories and enhancing analyte&#8208;nanopore interactions. The performance of the device is validated by discriminating rigid Au nanoparticles with a 1.6&#8208;nm size difference and differentiating a 1.3&#8208;nm size difference and subtle stiffness variations in flexible polyethylene glycol molecules.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanopore is commonly used for high-resolution, label-free sensing, and analysis of single molecules. However, controlling the speed and trajectory of molecular translocation in nanopores remains challenging, hampering sensing accuracy. Here, the study proposes a nanopore-in-a-tube (NIAT) device that enables decoupling of the current signal detection from molecular translocation and provides precise angular inertia-kinetic translocation of single molecules through a nanopore, thus ensuring stable signal readout with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Specifically, the funnel-shaped silicon nanopore, fabricated at a 10-nm resolution, is placed into a centrifugal tube. A light-induced photovoltaic effect is utilized to achieve a counter-balanced state of electrokinetic effects in the nanopore. By controlling the inertial angle and centrifugation speed, the angular inertial force is harnessed effectively for regulating the translocation process with high precision. Consequently, the speed and trajectory of the molecules are able to be adjusted in and around the nanopore, enabling controllable and high SNR current signals. Numerical simulation reveals the decisive role of inertial angle in achieving uniform translocation trajectories and enhancing analyte-nanopore interactions. The performance of the device is validated by discriminating rigid Au nanoparticles with a 1.6-nm size difference and differentiating a 1.3-nm size difference and subtle stiffness variations in flexible polyethylene glycol molecules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Layer&#8208;Controlled Oxidation of Bi2O2Se for Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristor Arrays With sub&#8208;pA Sneak Currents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving controllable oxidation of single&#8208;crystal Bi2O2Se through the development of large&#8208;scale UV&#8208;assisted intercalative oxidation allowed for the construction of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se heterostructures. The &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se memristor exhibited remarkable self&#8208;rectifying memristive performance, including ultra&#8208;high ON/OFF and rectification ratios, and nonlinearity. The scalable production of self&#8208;rectifying memristor arrays is successfully demonstrated, showcasing sub&#8208;pA sneak currents, desirable to minimize cross&#8208;talk effects in high&#8208;density memristor arrays.








Abstract
Smart memristors with innovative properties are crucial for the advancement of next&#8208;generation information storage and bioinspired neuromorphic computing. However, the presence of significant sneak currents in large&#8208;scale memristor arrays results in operational errors and heat accumulation, hindering their practical utility. This study successfully synthesizes a quasi&#8208;free&#8208;standing Bi2O2Se single&#8208;crystalline film and achieves layer&#8208;controlled oxidation by developing large&#8208;scale UV&#8208;assisted intercalative oxidation, resulting &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se heterostructures. The resulting &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se memristor demonstrates remarkable self&#8208;rectifying resistive switching performance (over 105 for ON/OFF and rectification ratios, as well as nonlinearity) in both nanoscale (through conductive atomic force microscopy) and microscale (through memristor array) regimes. Furthermore, the potential for scalable production of self&#8208;rectifying &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se memristor, achieving sub&#8208;pA sneak currents to minimize cross&#8208;talk effects in high&#8208;density memristor arrays is demonstrated. The memristors also exhibit ultrafast resistive switching (sub&#8208;100&#160;ns) and low power consumption (1.2 pJ) as characterized by pulse&#8208;mode testing. The findings suggest a synergetic effect of interfacial Schottky barriers and oxygen vacancy migration as the self&#8208;rectifying switching mechanism, elucidated through controllable &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 thickness modulation and theoretical ab initio calculations.

         <title>Supercapacitively Liquid&#8208;Solid Dual&#8208;State Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supercapacitively dual&#8208;state phototransistor is developed with microporous liquid&#8208;solid interface. A supercapacitively photogating effect greatly enhances responsivity up to 4.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, and realizes high&#8208;contrast scotopic neuromorphic imaging, holding promise for constructing optoelectronic systems with performance beyond conventional solid&#8208;state optoelectronics.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;transduction of solid&#8208;state optoelectronics occurs in semiconductors or their interfaces. Considering the confined active area and interfacial capacitance of solid&#8208;state materials, solid&#8208;state optoelectronics faces inherent limitations in photo&#8208;transduction, especially for bionic vision, and the performance is lower than that of living systems. For example, a photoreceptor generates pA&#8208;level photocurrent when absorbing a single photon. Here, a liquid&#8208;solid dual&#8208;state phototransistor is demonstrated, in which photo&#8208;transduction and modulation take place at the microporous interface between semiconductors and water, mimicking principles of the photoreceptor. When operating in the water, an orderly stacked photo&#8208;harvesting covalent organic framework layer generates supercapacitively photogating modulation of the channel conductivity via a dual&#8208;state interface, achieving responsivity of 4.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010 A&#160;W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 1.62&#160;&#215;&#160;1016 Jones at room temperature, several orders of magnitude higher than other photodetectors. Such bio&#8208;inspired dual&#8208;state optoelectronics enables high&#8208;contrast scotopic neuromorphic imaging with responsivity greater than photoreceptors, holding promise for constructing optoelectronic systems with performance beyond conventional solid&#8208;state optoelectronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (HEMOFs): A New Frontier in Materials Design for CO2 Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) are synthesized with up to 15 distinct metals, representing an unprecedented level of complexity for MOFs. A suite of complementary characterization techniques and density functional theory&#160;calculations unravel the metal distributions in the materials; well&#8208;mixed heterometallic clusters are directly visualized by high resolution microscopy tools. The HEMOFs are highly active for CO2 epoxidation under mild conditions.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) emerged as promising candidates for a diverse array of chemical transformations, including CO2 utilization. However, traditional HEMs catalysts are nonporous, limiting their activity to surface sites. Designing HEMs with intrinsic porosity can open the door toward enhanced reactivity while maintaining the many benefits of high configurational entropy. Here, a synergistic experimental, analytical, and theoretical approach to design the first high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) derived from polynuclear metal clusters is implemented, a novel class of porous HEMs that is highly active for CO2 fixation under mild conditions and short reaction times, outperforming existing heterogeneous catalysts. HEMOFs with up to 15 distinct metals are synthesized (the highest number of metals ever incorporated into a single MOF) and, for the first time, homogenous metal mixing within individual clusters is directly observed via high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Importantly, density functional theory studies provide unprecedented insight into the electronic structures of HEMOFs, demonstrating that the density of states in heterometallic clusters is highly sensitive to metal composition. This work dramatically advances HEMOF materials design, paving the way for further exploration of HEMs and offers new avenues for the development of multifunctional materials with tailored properties for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Heterogeneous NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode With Reversible Multielectron Reaction for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 material achieves high purity and high crystallization by the mutual promotion of intergrowth structures. Benefiting from the interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, the electronic conductivity and ion diffusion are greatly improved. The optimized Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 cathode, with a reversible three&#8208;electron redox reaction, exhibits high specific capacity and long cycling life.








Abstract
Na superionic conductor (NASICON)&#8208;structured compounds demonstrate great application potential by their robust framework and compositional diversity. However, they are blamed for the mediocre energy density, and achieving both multielectron reaction and good cycling stability simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a novel heterogeneous Na4Fe3(PO4)2(P2O7)/Na2VTi(PO4)3 (NFPP/NVTP) material with stable multielectron reaction is constructed by spray drying technology. The mutual promotion effect of intergrowth structures effectively improves the purity and the crystallization of NFPP/NVTP during the fabrication process, which is beneficial to the high capacity and cycling stability. As a result, the optimized NFPP/NVTP demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 155.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and outstanding cycling stability with 82.9% capacity retention over 2500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1, which are much superior to those of NFPP and NVTP individually. Even in full cell configuration, the energy density remains high at &#8776;380&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the cathode mass. The high capacity of NFPP/NVTP is also attributed to the successive reduction/oxidation mechanism involving the introduction of Ti3+ and interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, which greatly improve the electronic and ionic conductivity. Moreover, high reversible structural evolution during the multisodium storage process further guarantees excellent cycling stability.

Herein, a novel heterogeneous Na&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;)/Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;VTi(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (NFPP/NVTP) material with stable multielectron reaction is constructed by spray drying technology. The mutual promotion effect of intergrowth structures effectively improves the purity and the crystallization of NFPP/NVTP during the fabrication process, which is beneficial to the high capacity and cycling stability. As a result, the optimized NFPP/NVTP demonstrates a high reversible capacity of 155.3 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 20&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and outstanding cycling stability with 82.9% capacity retention over 2500 cycles at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which are much superior to those of NFPP and NVTP individually. Even in full cell configuration, the energy density remains high at &#8776;380&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; based on the cathode mass. The high capacity of NFPP/NVTP is also attributed to the successive reduction/oxidation mechanism involving the introduction of Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and interfacial charge redistribution effect between the heterogeneous phases, which greatly improve the electronic and ionic conductivity. Moreover, high reversible structural evolution during the multisodium storage process further guarantees excellent cycling stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binary&#8208;Cooperative Ultrathin Porous Membrane for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel&#8208;state zeolitic imidazolate framework (g&#8208;ZIF) nanoparticles are synthesized by a metal&#8208;gel&#8208;induced strategy, and the resulting defect&#8208;free membranes are obtained via spin&#8208;coating and thermal treatment. The membrane is constructed with g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles and stacked cross&#8208;linking boundaries, which form dual channels with fast gas transport and molecular sieving. The membrane performance is stable under 3.0 MPa.








Abstract
The construction of ultrathin porous membranes with stable structures is critical for achieving efficient gas separation. Inspired by the binary&#8208;cooperative structural features of bones and teeth&#8212;composed of rigid hydroxyapatite and flexible collagen, which confer excellent mechanical strength&#8212;a binary&#8208;cooperative porous membrane constructed with gel&#8208;state zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (g&#8208;ZIFs), synthesized using a metal&#8208;gel&#8208;induced strategy, is proposed. The enlarged cavity size and flexible frameworks of the g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles significantly improve gas adsorption and diffusion, respectively. After thermal treatment, the coordination structures forming rigid segments in the g&#8208;ZIF membranes appear at the stacked g&#8208;ZIF boundaries, exhibiting a higher Young's modulus than the g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles, denoted as the flexible segments. The g&#8208;ZIF membranes demonstrate excellent tensile and compression resistances, attributed to the effective translation of binary&#8208;cooperative effects of rigidity and flexibility into the membranes. The resulting dual&#8208;aperture structure, composed of g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles surrounded by nanoscale apertures at the boundaries, yields a membrane with a stable CO2 permeance of 4834 GPU and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 90 within 3.0&#160;MPa.

         <title>Cascaded Heteroporous Nanocomposites for Thermo&#8208;Adaptive Passive Radiation Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascaded heteroporous nanocomposite films with multistage optical scattering exhibit excellent subambient radiative cooling performance, achieving an enhanced average emissivity of 96.5% within the atmospheric window and a high reflectivity of 97.3% in the sunlight spectra. Combined with phase transition properties, these films possess thermal dissipation and absorption capabilities, effectively counteracting thermal shocks in device heating systems.








Abstract
Passive radiative cooling is a promising technology for heat dissipation that does not consume energy. However, current radiative cooling materials can only exhibit subambient cooling under atmospheric conditions and struggle to process specific heat accumulation. Thus, a passive thermal regulation mechanism adapted to wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range applications is required to match device heating systems. Herein, a heteroporous nanocomposite film (HENF) with thermo&#8208;adaptive radiation cooling performance is reported. Compared to conventional porous cooling films with limited scattering efficiencies, the HENFs with multistage scattering have a strong emissivity of 96.5% (8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m) and a high reflectivity of 97.3% (0.3&#8211;2.5&#160;&#181;m), resulting in an ultrahigh cooling power of 114&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2. In such HENFs, theoretical analyses have confirmed the spectrum management superiority of the heteroporous unit in terms of the scattering efficiency strength, with their cascading effect enhancing the overall film&#8208;cooling efficiency. The high mechanical performance, phase&#8208;transition features, and environmental adaptive properties of HENFs are also exhibited. Importantly, HENFs synergistically couple thermal dissipation and absorption to effectively process heat accumulation and counteract thermal shock in heating devices. It is anticipated that thermo&#8208;adaptive HENFs will act as a promising platform for device surface thermal regulation over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Plant&#8208;Based Shape Memory Cryogel for Hemorrhage Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the call for eco&#8208;friendly healthcare solutions rises, the novel, energy&#8208;efficient biosafe pollen cryogels answer the call&#8208;crafted without toxic crosslinkers, they offer impressive shape&#8208;memory, strong mechanical resilience, and high biocompatibility. They stand out as a potential medical game&#8208;changer for healing deep, noncompressible wounds.








Abstract
The escalating global demand for sustainable manufacturing, motivated by concerns over energy conservation and carbon footprints, encounters challenges due to insufficient renewable materials and arduous fabrication procedures to fulfill specific requirements in medical and healthcare systems. Here, biosafe pollen cryogel is engineered as effective hemostats without additional harmful crosslinkers to treat deep noncompressible wounds. A straightforward and low&#8208;energy approach is involved in forming stable macroporous cryogel, benefiting from the unique micro&#8208;hierarchical structures and chemical components of non&#8208;allergenic plant pollen. It is demonstrated that the pollen cryogel exhibits rapid water/blood&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory properties within 2 s. Owing to their inherent nano/micro hierarchical structure and abundant chemical functional groups on the pollen surface, the pollen cryogel shows effective hemostatic performance in a mouse liver penetration model, which is easily removed after usage. Overall, the self&#8208;crosslinking pollen cryogel in this work pioneers a framework of potential clinical applications for the first&#8208;hand treatment on deep noncompressible wounds.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Nanowelding of Bilayer SnSe Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;free nanowelding between 2D group&#8208;IV monochalcogenide ferroelectric semiconductor nanoplates is achieved by perfectly aligning their crystalline orientations using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip, with the assistance of the anisotropic lubricity between the nanoplates and a graphene substrate.








Abstract
Nanowelding is a bottom&#8208;up technique to create custom&#8208;designed nanostructures and devices beyond the precision of lithographic methods. Here, a new technique is reported based on anisotropic lubricity at the van der Waals interface between monolayer and bilayer SnSe nanoplates and a graphene substrate to achieve precise control of the crystal orientation and the interface during the welding process. As&#8208;grown SnSe monolayer and bilayer nanoplates are commensurate with graphene's armchair direction but lack commensuration along graphene's zigzag direction, resulting in a reduced friction along that direction and a rail&#8208;like, 1D movement that permits joining nanoplates with high precision. This way, molecular beam epitaxially grown SnSe nanoplates of lateral sizes 30&#8211;100&#160;nm are manipulated by the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature. In situ annealing is applied afterward to weld contacting nanoplates without atomic defects at the interface. This technique can be generalized to any van der Waals interfaces with anisotropic lubricity and is highly promising for the construction of complex quantum devices, such as field effect transistors, quantum interference devices, lateral tunneling junctions, and solid&#8208;state qubits.

         <title>A Straightforward Solvent&#8208;Pair&#8208;Enabled Multicomponent Coassembly Approach toward Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Decorated Mesoporous Tungsten Oxide for Trace Ammonia Sensing</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated nitrogen&#8208;doped ordered mesoporous tungsten oxide (namely Pt/N&#8208;mWO3, Rh/N&#8208;mWO3, Pd/N&#8208;mWO3) are straightforwardly synthesized through a solvent&#8208;pair&#8208;enabled multicomponent coassembly strategy. The obtained Pt/N&#8208;mWO3 materials have ordered mesoporous structure with ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles, rich oxygen vacancies, and metal&#8211;metal oxide interfaces, exhibiting superior ammonia sensing performances with a low limit of detection (51.2 ppb).








Abstract
The straightforward synthesis of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated ordered mesoporous transition metal oxides remains a great challenge due to the difficulty of balancing the interactions between precursors and templates. Herein, a solvent&#8208;pair&#8208;enabled multicomponent coassembly (SPEMC) strategy is developed for straightforward synthesis of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated nitrogen&#8208;doped ordered mesoporous tungsten oxide (abbreviated as NM/N&#8208;mWO3, NM&#160;=&#160;Pt, Rh, Pd). The amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene (PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS) copolymers coassemble with ammonium metatungstate (AMT) clusters and different kinds of hydrophilic noble metal precursors without phase separation. SPEMC synthesis requires no direct interaction between PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS and AMT, thus the assembly equilibriums between noble metal precursors and PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS can be readily controlled. The obtained NM/N&#8208;mWO3 nanocomposites possess ordered mesopores, abundant oxygen vacancies, and metal&#8211;metal oxide interfaces. As a result, the Pt/N&#8208;mWO3 sensors exhibit superior ammonia sensing performances with high sensitivity, an ultralow limit of detection (51.2 ppb), good selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that ammonia is oxidized stepwise to NO, NO2&#8722;, and NO3&#8722; during the sensing process. Moreover, a portable wireless module based on Pt/N&#8208;mWO3 sensor can recognize ppm&#8208;level concentration of ammonia, which lays a solid foundation for its application in various fields.

         <title>Jellyfish&#8208;Inspired Artificial Spider Silk for Luminous Surgical Sutures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking inspiration from the spinning process of spider silk and the luminescence mechanism of jellyfish, the luminous artificial spider silks are prepared by employing highly hydrated segments and polyhydroxyl segments. Furthermore, a luminescent surgical suture is prepared by coating the fiber with an additional polymer layer. This work provides a new design strategy for performing luminescent and robust surgical sutures.








Abstract
The development of functional surgical sutures with excellent mechanical properties, good fluorescence, and high cytocompatibility is highly required in the field of medical surgeries. Achieving fibers that simultaneously exhibit high mechanical robustness, good spinnability, and durable fluorescence emission has remained challenging up to now. Taking inspiration from the spinning process of spider silk and the luminescence mechanism of jellyfish, this work reports a luminous artificial spider silk prepared with the aim of balancing the fiber spinnability and mechanical robustness. This is realized by employing highly hydrated segments with aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence for enhancing the fiber spinnability and polyhydroxyl segments for increasing the fiber mechanical robustness. Twist insertion during fiber spinning improves the fiber strength, toughness, and fluorescence emission. Furthermore, coating the fiber with an additional polymer layer results in a &#8220;sheath&#8211;core&#8221; architecture with improved mechanical properties and capacity to withstand water. This work provides a new design strategy for performing luminescent and robust surgical sutures.

         <title>Extremely Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity and Unusual Axial Diamagnetism in a Quasi&#8208;1D Dirac Material La3MgBi5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous Hall effect is observed in quasi&#8208;1D Dirac Material La3MgBi5. The obtained anomalous Hall conductivity is the largest one in the current anomalous Hall effect systems. Especially, the absence of magnetic elements makes La3MgBi5 one of the few non&#8208;magnetic materials that can exhibit anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
Anomalous Hall effect (AHE), one of the most important electronic transport phenomena, generally appears in ferromagnetic materials but is rare in materials without magnetic elements. Here, a study of La3MgBi5 is presented, whose band structure carries multitype Dirac fermions. Although magnetic elements are absent in La3MgBi5, the signals of AHE can be observed. In particular, the anomalous Hall conductivity is extremely large, reaching 42,356 &#937;&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 with an anomalous Hall angle of 8.8%, the largest one that has been observed in the current AHE systems. The AHE is suggested to originate from the combination of skew scattering and Berry curvature. Another unique property discovered in La3MgBi5 is the axial diamagnetism. The diamagnetism is significantly enhanced and dominates the magnetization in the axial directions, which is the result of the restricted motion of the Dirac fermion at the Fermi level. These findings not only establish La3MgBi5 as a suitable platform to study AHE and quantum transport but also indicate the great potential of 315&#8208;type Bi&#8208;based materials for exploring novel physical&#160;properties.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Locked WS2 Vortex Emission via Photonic Crystal Bound States in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetry&#8208;protected bound states in the continuum in the SiNx PhC slabs engender azimuthal polarization field in the momentum space, which strongly interacts with the exciton emission from 1L WS2. Consequently, spin&#8208;dependent twisted spiral phase fronts are imposed on the exciton emission from 1L WS2, exhibiting helical wavefronts and doughnut&#8208;shaped intensity beam profiles in the momentum space.









Abstract
Owing to their strong exciton effects and valley polarization properties, monolayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (1L TMDs) have unfolded the prospects of spin&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting devices. However, the wavefront control of exciton emission, which is critical to generate structured optical fields, remains elusive. In this work, the experimental demonstration of spin&#8208;locked vortex emission from monolayer Tungsten Disulfide (1L WS2) integrated with Silicon Nitride (SiNx) PhC slabs is presented. The symmetry&#8208;protected bound states in the continuum (BIC) in the SiNx PhC slabs engender azimuthal polarization field distribution in the momentum space with a topological singularity in the center of the Brillouin zone, which imposes the resonantly enhanced WS2 exciton emission with a spin&#8208;correlated spiral phase front by taking advantage of the winding topologies of resonances with the assistance of geometric phase scheme. As a result, exciton emission from 1L WS2 exhibits helical wavefront and doughnut&#8208;shaped intensity beam profile in the momentum space with topological charges locked to the spins of light. This strategy on spin&#8208;dependent excitonic vortex emission may offer the unparalleled capability of valley&#8208;polarized structured light generation for 1L TMDs.

Na atoms are intercalated into the van der Waals (vdW) gaps of Cr2Ge2Te6 where magnetic frustration is discovered and leads to emerging spin&#8208;glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order, confirmed by characteristic signature in ac magnetic susceptibility. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.








Abstract
Tuning magnetic properties in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials has captured significant attention due to the efficient control of ground states by heterostructuring and external stimuli. Electron doping by electrostatic gating, interfacial charge transfer, and intercalation is particularly effective in manipulating the exchange and spin&#8208;orbit properties, resulting in a control of Curie temperature (TC) and magnetic anisotropy. Here, an uncharted role of intercalation is discovered to generate magnetic frustration. As a model study, Na atoms are intercalated into the vdW gaps of pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) where generated magnetic frustration leads to emerging spin&#8208;glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order. A series of dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements/analysis confirms the formation of magnetic clusters representing slow dynamics with a distribution of relaxation times. The intercalation also modifies other macroscopic physical parameters including the significant enhancement of TC from 66 to 240&#160;K and the switching of magnetic easy&#8208;hard axis direction. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Phase&#8208;Change Transmissive Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active metasurfaces are emerging as a new avenue for creating compact, high&#8208;performance reconfigurable optical devices. This study demonstrates a non&#8208;volatile transmissive metafilter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs deposited on a 200 &#215; 200 &#181;m2 microheater. The metafilter can be electrically switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using no mechanical movements with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB.








Abstract
Programmable and reconfigurable optics hold significant potential for transforming a broad spectrum of applications, spanning space explorations to biomedical imaging, gas sensing, and optical cloaking. The ability to adjust the optical properties of components like filters, lenses, and beam steering devices could result in dramatic reductions in size, weight, and power consumption in future optoelectronic devices. Among the potential candidates for reconfigurable optics, chalcogenide&#8208;based phase change materials (PCMs) offer great promise due to their non&#8208;volatile and analogue switching characteristics. Although PCM have found widespread use in electronic data storage, these memory devices are deeply sub&#8208;micron&#8208;sized. To incorporate phase change materials into free&#8208;space optical components, it is essential to scale them up to beyond several hundreds of microns while maintaining reliable switching characteristics. This study demonstrated a non&#8208;mechanical, non&#8208;volatile transmissive filter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs with a 200 &#215; 200 &#181;m2 switching area. The device/metafilter can be consistently switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using electrical pulses with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB. The device was&#160;reversibly switched for 1250 cycles before accelerated degradation took place. The work represents an important step toward realizing free&#8208;space reconfigurable optics based on&#160;PCMs.

         <title>A Versatile Cryomicroneedle Patch for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile cryomicroneedle patch (CMN&#8208;CCPH) is developed for preserving the high activity of HMME and CAT in vitro and improving bioavailability in vivo, which enhances traceable PDT by O2 generation and Cu2+&#8208;mediated GSH depletion.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) continues to encounter multifarious hurdles, stemming from the ineffectual preservation and delivery system of photosensitizers, the dearth of imaging navigation, and the antioxidant/hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Herein, a versatile cryomicroneedle patch (denoted as CMN&#8208;CCPH) is developed for traceable PDT. The therapeutic efficacy is further amplified by catalase (CAT)&#8208;induced oxygen (O2) generation and Cu2+&#8208;mediated glutathione (GSH) depletion. The CMN&#8208;CCPH is composed of cryomicroneedle (CMN) as the vehicle and CAT&#8208;biomineralized copper phosphate nanoflowers (CCP NFs) loaded with hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) as the payload. Importantly, the bioactive function of HMME and CAT can be optimally maintained under the protection of CCPH and CMN for a duration surpassing 60 days, leading to bolstered bioavailability and notable enhancements in PDT efficacy. The in vivo visualization of HMME and oxyhemoglobin saturation (sO2) monitored by fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) duplex real&#8208;time imaging unveils the noteworthy implications of CMN&#8208;delivered CCPH for intratumoral enrichment of HMME and O2 with reduced systemic toxicity. This versatile CMN patch demonstrates distinct effectiveness in neoplasm elimination, underscoring its promising clinical prospects.

         <title>All&#8208;Oxide Metasurfaces Formed by Synchronized Local Ionic Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrokinetics is revealed during ionic gating and a new concept of synchronized local ionic gating is introduced, enabling local manipulation of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of numerous nano&#8208;regions over a large area in SrCoO2.5 thin films in addition to the electrical formation of all&#8208;oxide metasurfaces.








Abstract
Ionic gating of oxide thin films has emerged as a novel way of manipulating the properties of thin films. Most studies are carried out on single devices with a three&#8208;terminal configuration,&#160;but, by exploring the electrokinetics during the ionic gating, such a configuration with initially insulating films leads to a highly non&#8208;uniform gating response of individual devices within large arrays of the devices. It is shown that such an issue can be circumvented by the formation of a uniform charge potential by the use of a thin conducting underlayer. This synchronized local ionic gating allows for the simultaneous manipulation of the electrical, magnetic, and/or optical properties of large arrays of devices. Designer metasurfaces formed in this way from SrCoO2.5 thin films display an anomalous optical reflection of light that relies on the uniform and coherent response of all the devices. Beyond oxides, almost any material whose properties can be controlled by the addition or removal of ions via gating can form novel metasurfaces using this technique. These findings provide insights into the electrokinetics of ionic gating and a wide range of applications using synchronized local ionic gating.

         <title>Embedding Biomimetic Vascular Networks via Coaxial Sacrificial Writing into Functional Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coaxial sacrificial writing into functional tissues (co&#8208;SWIFT) is used to embed biomimetic vascular networks into densely cellular matrices. These coaxially printed and perfusable hierarchical, branching vessels are composed of a smooth muscle cell&#8208;laden shell that surrounds endothelialized lumens. Using co&#8208;SWIFT, vascularized cardiac tissues are constructed that exhibit synchronous beating, high contractility, and cardio&#8208;effective drug response.








Abstract
Printing human tissues and organs replete with biomimetic vascular networks is of growing interest. While it is possible to embed perfusable channels within acellular and densely cellular matrices, they do not currently possess the biomimetic architectures found in native vessels. Here, coaxial&#160;sacrificial writing into functional tissues (co&#8208;SWIFT) is developed, an embedded bioprinting method capable of generating hierarchically branching, multilayered vascular networks within both granular hydrogel and densely cellular matrices. Coaxial printheads are designed with an extended core&#8211;shell configuration to facilitate robust core&#8211;core and shell&#8211;shell interconnections between printed branching vessels during embedded bioprinting. Using optimized core&#8211;shell ink combinations, biomimetic vessels composed of a smooth muscle cell&#8208;laden shell that surrounds perfusable lumens are coaxially printed into granular matrices composed of: 1) transparent alginate microparticles, 2) sacrificial microparticle&#8208;laden collagen, or 3) cardiac spheroids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Biomimetic blood vessels that exhibit good barrier function are produced by seeding these interconnected lumens with a confluent layer of endothelial cells. Importantly, it is found that co&#8208;SWIFT cardiac tissues mature under perfusion, beat synchronously, and exhibit a cardio&#8208;effective drug response in vitro. This advance opens new avenues for the scalable biomanufacturing of vascularized organ&#8208;specific tissues for drug testing, disease modeling, and therapeutic use.

Here, coaxial&#160;sacrificial writing into functional tissues (co-SWIFT) is developed, an embedded bioprinting method capable of generating hierarchically branching, multilayered vascular networks within both granular hydrogel and densely cellular matrices. Coaxial printheads are designed with an extended core&#8211;shell configuration to facilitate robust core&#8211;core and shell&#8211;shell interconnections between printed branching vessels during embedded bioprinting. Using optimized core&#8211;shell ink combinations, biomimetic vessels composed of a smooth muscle cell-laden shell that surrounds perfusable lumens are coaxially printed into granular matrices composed of: 1) transparent alginate microparticles, 2) sacrificial microparticle-laden collagen, or 3) cardiac spheroids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Biomimetic blood vessels that exhibit good barrier function are produced by seeding these interconnected lumens with a confluent layer of endothelial cells. Importantly, it is found that co-SWIFT cardiac tissues mature under perfusion, beat synchronously, and exhibit a cardio-effective drug response in vitro. This advance opens new avenues for the scalable biomanufacturing of vascularized organ-specific tissues for drug testing, disease modeling, and therapeutic use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller Effect Breaks the pH Dependence in Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;distorted TiOxFy catalyst is developed with a strengthened pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, which can regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst, the microenvironment at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface and consequently the absorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, leading to significant pH&#8208;resistant properties for two&#8208;electrode oxygen electroreduction to hydrogen peroxide.








Abstract
The hydrogenation of small molecules (like O2 and CO2) often exhibits strong activity dependence on pHs because of discrepant proton donor environments. However, some catalysts can show seldom dependence on two&#8208;electron oxygen electroreduction, a sustainable route of O2 hydrogenation to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this work, a pH&#8208;resistant oxygen electroreduction system arising from the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect is demonstrated. Thorough operando Raman spectra, local environment analyses and density function theory simulations, the lattice distortion of TiOxFy that introduces the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect contributing to regulating local pHs at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces and the absorption/desorption of key *OOH intermediate is revealed. Consequently, as comparison to 78.6% activity attenuation for common catalyst, the TiOxFy displays minor activity decay (3.2%) in the pH range of 1&#8211;13 with remarkable Faradaic efficiencies (93.4&#8211;96.4%) and H2O2 yield rates (595&#8211;614&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) in the current densities of 100&#8211;1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Further techno&#8208;economics analyses display the H2O2 production cost dependent on pHs, giving the lowest H2O2 price of $0.37&#160;kg&#8722;1. The present finding is expected to provide an additional dimension to pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect that leverages systems beyond traditional conception.

         <title>Fully Reprogrammable 2D Array of Multistate Molecular Switching Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, the bonding configurations of individual triazatruxene (TAT) molecules forming a honeycomb lattice on Ag(111) can be controlled, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as full reversibility, make this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory systems.








Abstract
Integration of molecular switching units into complex electronic circuits is considered to be the next step toward the realization of novel logic and memory devices. This paper reports on an ordered 2D network of neighboring ternary switching units represented by triazatruxene (TAT) molecules organized in a honeycomb lattice on a Ag(111) surface. Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, the bonding configurations of individual TAT molecules can be controlled, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. The switching between those states shows a strong bias dependence ranging from tens of millivolts to volts. The low&#8208;bias switching behavior is explored in active units consisting of two and more interacting TAT molecules that are purposefully defined (programmed) by high&#8208;bias switching within the honeycomb lattice. Within such a unit the low&#8208;bias switching can be triggered and accessed by single&#8208;point measurements on a single TAT molecule, demonstrating up to 9 and 19 distinguishable states in a dyad and a tetrad of coupled molecules, respectively. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to bias&#8208;dependent hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as full reversibility, make this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory systems.

         <title>Boosting All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells by Revitalizing the Buried Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetylcholine acts as a proficient &#8220;diver,&#8221; aiding in the reconstruction of the buried interface and significantly improving the overall quality of the top narrow&#8208;bandgap mixed tin&#8211;lead perovskite layers. As a result, single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells and their 2&#8208;terminal tandems achieve stabilized power conversion efficiencies of 22.98% and 27.54%, respectively.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) serve as crucial top subcells in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, the prevalent use of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) hole transport layers (HTLs) in NBG PSCs compromises device efficiency and stability. To address this, the study proposes a revitalizing strategy for the buried interface of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites by directly immersing acetylcholine chloride (ACh) into PEDOT: PSS. ACh acts as a proficient &#8220;diver,&#8221; not only modulating the bottom PEDOT: PSS HTLs but also facilitating the reconstruction of the buried interface and significantly enhancing the quality of the top perovskite layers. This intervention with ACh prevents Sn2+ oxidation, mitigates buried defects, and encourages the growth of large, densely packed grains within Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. Consequently, the optimized NBG PSCs exhibit significantly improved hole transport and reduced carrier recombination, achieving a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 22.98% with enhanced stability. Furthermore, these optimized NBG Sn&#8208;Pb cells enable highly efficient two&#8208;terminal and four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSCs, boasting steady&#8208;state efficiencies of 27.54% (certified at 26.41%) and 28.01%, respectively. This study emphasizes the importance of optimizing NBG PSCs through buried interface reconstruction, propelling the advancement of all&#8208;perovskite TSCs.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Printed All&#8208;Carbon Responsive Material and Soft Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new carbon&#8208;based responsive material that unlocks the unexpectedly high vapor response speed of 9400&#176; s&#8722;1 as well as excellent enviroment tolerance. Based on this, an innovative somersaulting robot with locomotion velocity close to the level of animals is designed and constructed, representing a milestone towards achieving life&#8208;like performance in biomimetic soft robots.








Abstract
Responsive materials and actuators are the basis for the development of various leading&#8208;edge technologies but have so far mostly been designed based on polymers, incurring key limitations related to sensitivity and environmental tolerance. This work reports a new responsive material, laser&#8208;printed carbon film (LPCF), produced via direct laser transformation of a liquid organic precursor and consists of graphitic and amorphous carbons. The high activity of amorphous carbon combined with the dual&#8208;gradient structure enables the LPCF to have a actuation speed of 9400&#176;&#160;s&#8722;1 in response to the stimulus of organic vapor. LPCF exhibits a conductivity of 950&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1 and excellent resistance to various extreme environmental conditions, which are unachievable for polymer&#8208;based materials. Additionally, an LPCF&#8208;based all&#8208;carbon soft robot that can mimic the complex continuous backward somersaulting motions without manual intervention is constructed. The locomotion velocity of the robot reaches a value of 1.19&#160;BL&#160;s&#8722;1, which is almost one to two orders of magnitude faster than that of reported soft robots. This work not only offers a new paradigm for highly responsive materials but also provides a great design and engineering example for the next generation of biomimetic robots with life&#8208;like performance.

The high activity of amorphous carbon combined with the dual-gradient structure enables the LPCF to have a actuation speed of 9400&#176;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in response to the stimulus of organic vapor. LPCF exhibits a conductivity of 950&#160;S&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent resistance to various extreme environmental conditions, which are unachievable for polymer-based materials. Additionally, an LPCF-based all-carbon soft robot that can mimic the complex continuous backward somersaulting motions without manual intervention is constructed. The locomotion velocity of the robot reaches a value of 1.19&#160;BL&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is almost one to two orders of magnitude faster than that of reported soft robots. This work not only offers a new paradigm for highly responsive materials but also provides a great design and engineering example for the next generation of biomimetic robots with life-like performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Large&#8208;Scale, 3D, and Stretchable Circuits</title>

         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;LSC enables the fabrication of large&#8208;scale, 3D, and stretchable circuits. Soft copper&#8208;clad laminates and multiple types of VIAs are employed to create large&#8208;scale planar interconnects and vertical interconnects. A temporary bonding strategy is proposed to mitigate misalignment with residual and thermal strains. 3D&#8208;LSC facilitates batch production of miniaturized multifunctional devices and the fabrication of large&#8208;scale stretchable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics have demonstrated excellent potential in wearable healthcare and conformal integration. Achieving the scalable fabrication of stretchable devices with high functional density is the cornerstone to enable the practical applications of stretchable electronics. Here, a comprehensive methodology for realizing large&#8208;scale, 3D, and stretchable circuits (3D&#8208;LSC) is reported. The soft copper&#8208;clad laminate (S&#8208;CCL) based on the &#8220;cast and cure&#8221; process facilitates patterning the planar interconnects with the scale beyond 1 m. With the ability to form through, buried and blind VIAs in the multilayer stack of S&#8208;CCLs, high functional density can be achieved by further creating vertical interconnects in stacked S&#8208;CCLs. The application of temporary bonding substrate effectively minimizes the misalignments caused by residual strain and thermal strain. 3D&#8208;LSC enables the batch production of stretchable skin patches based on five&#8208;layer stretchable&#160;circuits, which can serve as a miniaturized system for physiological signals monitoring with wireless power delivery. The fabrications of conformal antenna and stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode display further illustrate the potential of 3D&#8208;LSC in realizing large&#8208;scale stretchable devices.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine (III)&#8208;Based Complexation for Chiroptical Supramolecular Glass, Deep Eutectic Solvent and Luminescent Switch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular glasses and deep eutectic solvents are achieved by the biaxial type halogen bonded complexation, which also appends light irradiation&#8208;triggered luminescence through a hydrogen atom transfer process, showing applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit and display.








Abstract
Hypervalent iodine(III) have widely been utilized for organic synthetic reagents. They are also recognized as positive charge&#8208;assisted, exceptionally robust biaxial halogen bond donors, while their potential in supramolecular materials is barely explored. This work reports a cyclic diaryliodonium ion as biaxial halogen bonding donor that displays remarkable binding affinity toward phenanthroline or acridine acceptors with chiral pendants. Biaxial halogen bonding enables chiroptical evolution in solution, allowing for rational control over supramolecular chirality. Leveraging their strong binding affinity, the halogen bonding complexes manifested amorphous properties and deep eutectic behavior in the solid state. Capitalizing on these attributes, this work achieves the successful preparation of supramolecular glasses and deep eutectic solvents. Additionally, halogen bonding appended light irradiation&#8208;triggered luminescence through a hydrogen atom transfer process, showing applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit and display.

         <title>Gold Nanoparticle Transport in the Injured Kidneys with Elevated Renal Function Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using X&#8208;ray imaging to track the kidney transport of renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles, the study finds that inner strip of outer medulla is the most significant site in accumulating glomerular filtered nanoparticles in cisplatin&#8208;injured kidney: formation of gold&#8211;protein casts in the lumen of the loop of Henle increases as proximal tubular injury progresses, which is undetectable by renal function biomarkers BUN and creatinine in mild injury stages.








Abstract
Renal function biomarkers such as serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) serve as key indicators for guiding clinical decisions before administering kidney&#8208;excreted small&#8208;molecule agents. With engineered nanoparticles increasingly designed to be renally clearable to expedite their clinical translation, understanding the relationship between renal function biomarkers and nanoparticle transport in diseased kidneys becomes crucial to their biosafety in future clinical applications. In this study, renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are used as X&#8208;ray contrast agents to noninvasively track their transport and retention in cisplatin&#8208;injured kidneys with varying BUN and Cr levels. The findings reveal that AuNP transport is significantly slowed in the medulla of severely injured kidneys, with BUN and Cr levels elevated to 10 times normal. In mildly injured kidneys, where BUN and Cr levels only four to five times higher than normal, AuNP transport and retention are not predictable by BUN and Cr levels but correlate strongly with the degree of tubular injury due to the formation of gold&#8211;protein casts in the Henle's loop of the medulla. These results underscore the need for caution when employing renal&#8208;clearable nanomedicines in compromised kidneys and highlight the potential of renal&#8208;clearable AuNPs as X&#8208;ray probes for&#160;assessing kidney injuries noninvasively.

         <title>Fully 3D&#8208;Printed Miniature Soft Hydraulic Actuators with Shape Memory Effect for Morphing and Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving both rich shape morphing and shape locking remains challenging in miniature soft actuators. Fully multi&#8208;material 3D&#8208;printed, sub&#8208;millimeter thin&#8208;plate&#8208;like miniature soft hydraulic actuators with shape memory effect are reported. They can achieve programable fast, versatile 2D&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape morphing, temporary shape locking, and shape recovery for applications in non&#8208;invasive and delicate grasping and energy&#8208;saving manipulators.








Abstract
Miniature shape&#8208;morphing soft actuators driven by external stimuli and fluidic pressure hold great promise in morphing matter and small&#8208;scale soft robotics. However, it remains challenging to achieve both rich shape morphing and shape locking in a fast and controlled way due to the limitations of actuation reversibility and fabrication. Here, fully 3D&#8208;printed, sub&#8208;millimeter thin&#8208;plate&#8208;like miniature soft hydraulic actuators with shape memory effect (SME) for programable fast shape morphing and shape locking, are reported. It combines commercial high&#8208;resolution multi&#8208;material 3D printing of stiff shape memory polymers (SMPs) and soft elastomers and direct printing of microfluidic channels and 2D/3D channel networks embedded in elastomers in a single print run. Leveraging spatial patterning of hybrid compositions and expansion heterogeneity of microfluidic channel networks for versatile hydraulically actuated shape morphing, including circular, wavy, helical, saddle, and warping shapes with various curvatures, are demonstrated. The morphed shapes can be temporarily locked and recover to their original planar forms repeatedly by activating SME of the SMPs. Utilizing the fast shape morphing and locking in the miniature actuators, their potential applications in non&#8208;invasive manipulation of small&#8208;scale objects and fragile living organisms, multimodal entanglement grasping, and energy&#8208;saving manipulators, are demonstrated.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Range Planar Polymer with Efficient &#960;&#8208;Electron Delocalization for Superior Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>

A novel polymer material with a planar imine&#8208;rich configuration is developed, in which the overall molecular rigidity, efficient &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and optimized electronic structure endow the polymer material with a rapid, ultra&#8208;stable and unrivaled proton&#8208;storage capability. For real applications, an all&#8208;organic aqueous proton battery (APB) is constructed with high energy/power density and an ultralong lifespan of over 30&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Due to the unique &#8220;Grotthus mechanism&#8221;, aqueous proton batteries (APBs) are promising energy devices with intrinsic safety and sustainability. Although polymers with tunable molecular structures are ideal electrode materials, their unsatisfactory proton&#8208;storage redox behaviors hinder the practical application in APB devices. Herein, a novel planar phenazine (PPHZ) polymer with a robust and extended imine&#8208;rich skeleton is synthesized and used for APB application for the first time. The long&#8208;range planar configuration achieves ordered molecular stacking and reduced conformational disorder, while the high conjugation with strong &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization optimizes energy bandgap and electronic properties, enabling the polymer with low proton diffusion barriers, high redox activity, and superior electron affinity. As such, the PPHZ polymer as an electrode material exhibits fast, stable, and unrivaled proton&#8208;storage redox behaviors with a large capacity of 273.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 (1 C) in 1&#160;M H2SO4 electrolyte, which is the highest value among proton&#8208;inserted electrodes in aqueous acidic electrolytes. Dynamic in situ techniques confirm the high redox reversibility upon proton uptake/removal, and the corresponding protonation pathways are elucidated by theoretical calculations. Moreover, a pouch&#8208;type APB cell using PPHZ electrode exhibits an ultralong lifespan over 30&#160;000 cycles, further verifying its promising application prospect.

         <title>Gold Nanocluster: A Photoelectric Converter for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Activated Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanocluster triggers platinum (Pt)&#8208;based prodrugs activation through direct electron transfer from the excited state of the gold nanocluster to the Pt(IV) center under X&#8208;ray radiation, circulating the limitation of indirect reactive species that easily quenched in living tumor cells. This spatiotemporally synchronous radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy offers excellent antitumor performance, and leads to superior outcomes for combined treatment.








Abstract
Despite the promise of activatable chemotherapy, the development of a spatiotemporally controllable strategy for prodrug activation in deep tissues remains challenging. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept is proposed for a gold nanocluster&#8208;based strategy that utilizes X&#8208;ray irradiation to trigger the liberation of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based prodrug conjugates, thus enabling radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy. Mechanistically, the irradiated activation of prodrugs is achieved through direct photoelectron transfer from the excited&#8208;state gold nanoclusters to the Pt(IV) center, resulting in the release of cytotoxic Pt(II) agents. Compared to the traditional combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, this radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy strategy offers superior antitumor efficacy and safety benefits through spatiotemporal synergy at the tumor site. Additionally, this strategy elicits robust immunogenic cell death and yields profound outcomes for combined immunotherapy of breast cancer. This versatile strategy is ushering in a new era of radiation&#8208;mediated chemistry for controlled drug delivery and the precise regulation of biological processes.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomesh Enables Cellular&#8208;Resolution, Elastic Neuroelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The results presented here provide multifunctional materials, fabrication, and microsystem strategies establishing foundations for elastic neuroelectronics, where conventional thin&#8208;film&#8208;based electrode materials make stretchable microelectrodes through in&#8208;plane nanomesh structuring, achieving unparalleled scalability down to cellular resolution and reliable elasticity. Detailed in vivo studies suggest the ability of these devices to provide tissue&#8208;conforming, high&#8208;quality interfaces with individual neurons in intact nervous tissues.








Abstract
Silicone&#8208;based devices have the potential to achieve an ideal interface with nervous tissue but suffer from scalability, primarily due to the mechanical mismatch between established electronic materials and soft elastomer substrates. This study presents a novel approach using conventional electrode materials through multifunctional nanomesh to achieve reliable elastic microelectrodes directly on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) silicone with an unprecedented cellular resolution. This engineered nanomesh features an in&#8208;plane nanoscale mesh pattern, physically embodied by a stack of three thin&#8208;film materials by design, namely Parylene&#8208;C for mechanical buffering, gold (Au) for electrical conduction, and Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) for improved electrochemical interfacing. Nanomesh elastic neuroelectronics are validated using single&#8208;unit recording from the small and curvilinear epidural surface of mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with device self&#8208;conformed and superior recording quality compared to plastic control devices requiring manual pressing is demonstrated. Electrode scaling studies from in vivo epidural recording further revealed the need for cellular resolution for high&#8208;fidelity recording of single&#8208;unit activities and compound action potentials. In addition to creating a minimally invasive device to effectively interface with DRG sensory afferents at a single&#8208;cell resolution, this study establishes nanomeshing as a practical pathway to leverage traditional electrode materials for a new class of elastic neuroelectronics.

         <title>Versatile Method of Engineering the Band Alignment and the Electron Wavefunction Hybridization of Hybrid Quantum Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The versatile approach is fully compatible with the lithography processes to create an atomically connected interface and effectively modulate the band alignment at the interface. This method is also generic for other materials and will ultimately result in the desirable requirements for topological and Andreev devices.








Abstract
Hybrid devices that combine superconductors (S) and semiconductors (Sm) have attracted great attention due to the integration of the properties of both materials, which relies on the interface details and the resulting coupling strength and wavefunction hybridization. However, until now, none of the experiments have reported good control of the band alignment of the interface, as well as its tunability to the coupling and hybridization. Here, the interface is modified by inducing specific argon milling while maintaining its high quality, e.g., atomic connection, which results in a large induced superconducting gap and ballistic transport. By comparing with Schr&#246;dinger&#8211;Poisson calculations, it is proven that this method can vary the band bending/coupling strength and the electronic spatial distribution. In the strong coupling regime, the coexistence and tunability of crossed Andreev reflection and elastic co&#8208;tunneling&#8212;key ingredients for the Kitaev chain&#8212;are confirmed. This method is also generic for other materials and achieves a hard and huge superconducting gap in lead and indium antimonide nanowire (Pb&#8208;InSb) devices. Such a versatile method, compatible with the standard fabrication process and accompanied by the well&#8208;controlled modification of the interface, will definitely boost the creation of more sophisticated hybrid devices for exploring physics in solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets for Harnessing Low&#8208;Frequency Vibration Induced Piezoelectric Polarization Coupled with Static Dipole Field to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces vacancy&#8208;engineered ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with improved photocatalytic H2 production efficiency under low&#8208;frequency vibrations. By creating indium (In) and sulfur (S) vacancies, the voltage gradient within the sheet is increased due to a higher dipole moment and enhanced piezoelectric properties. This results in better charge separation post&#8208;light absorption, significantly boosting H2 production.








Abstract
This study investigates the impact of In&#8208; and S&#8208;vacancy concentrations on the photocatalytic activity of non&#8208;centrosymmetric zinc indium sulfide (ZIS) nanosheets for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A positive correlation between the concentrations of dual In and S vacancies and the photocatalytic HER rate over ZIS nanosheets is observed. The piezoelectric polarization, stimulated by low&#8208;frequency vortex vibration to ensure the well&#8208;dispersion of ZIS nanosheets in solution, plays a crucial role in enhancing photocatalytic HER over the dual&#8208;vacancy engineered ZIS nanosheets. The piezoelectric characteristic of the defective ZIS nanosheets is confirmed through the piezopotential response measured using piezoelectric force microscopy. Piezophotocatalytic H2 evolution over the ZIS nanosheets is boosted under accelerated vortex vibrations. The research explores how vacancies alter ZIS's dipole moment and piezoelectric properties, thereby increasing electric potential gradient and improving charge&#8208;separation efficiency, through multi&#8208;scale simulations, including Density Functional Theory and Finite Element Analysis, and a machine&#8208;learning interatomic potential for defect identification. Increased In and S vacancies lead to higher electric potential gradients in ZIS along [100] and [010] directions, attributing to dipole moment and the piezoelectric effect. This research provides a comprehensive exploration of vacancy engineering in ZIS nanosheets, leveraging the piezopotential and dipole field to enhance photocatalytic performances.

A positive correlation between the concentrations of dual In and S vacancies and the photocatalytic HER rate over ZIS nanosheets is observed. The piezoelectric polarization, stimulated by low-frequency vortex vibration to ensure the well-dispersion of ZIS nanosheets in solution, plays a crucial role in enhancing photocatalytic HER over the dual-vacancy engineered ZIS nanosheets. The piezoelectric characteristic of the defective ZIS nanosheets is confirmed through the piezopotential response measured using piezoelectric force microscopy. Piezophotocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution over the ZIS nanosheets is boosted under accelerated vortex vibrations. The research explores how vacancies alter ZIS's dipole moment and piezoelectric properties, thereby increasing electric potential gradient and improving charge-separation efficiency, through multi-scale simulations, including Density Functional Theory and Finite Element Analysis, and a machine-learning interatomic potential for defect identification. Increased In and S vacancies lead to higher electric potential gradients in ZIS along [100] and [010] directions, attributing to dipole moment and the piezoelectric effect. This research provides a comprehensive exploration of vacancy engineering in ZIS nanosheets, leveraging the piezopotential and dipole field to enhance photocatalytic performances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Defect Modification Through Oily&#8208;Allicin Modified Buried Interface Achieving Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oily Allicin is introduced into perovskite solar cells to achieve grain wrapping under different stressors, which promotes defect contact and prevents ionic migration. A power conversion efficiency of 25.07% with an FF (fill factor) of 84.03% is achieved, which reaches 93.16% of the FF S&#8211;Q limit.








Abstract
The buried interface properties of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play a crucial role in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability. The metal&#8208;oxide/perovskite heterogeneous interfaces are highly defective and cause serious ion migration. However, the buried and unexposed bottom interface and simultaneous stabilization of grain boundaries receive less attention and effective solutions. To tackle this problem, a solid&#8211;liquid strategy is employed by introducing oily&#8208;additive allicin at the buried interface to passivate the shallow (VI and Vo) and deep traps (VPb and PbI). Interestingly, oily status allicin fills the pinholes at the heterointerface and wraps the perovskite grains, suppressing the ion migration during the photoaging process. As a result, an outstanding PCE of 25.07% is achieved with a remarkable fill factor (FF) of 84.03%. The modified devices can maintain 94.51% of the original PCE after light soaking under 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1000&#160;h. This work demonstrates a buried interface modification method that employs an eco&#8208;friendly additive, which helps promote the development of PSCs with high performance and stability.

         <title>Embedded Skyrmion Bags in Thin Films of Chiral Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first experimental observations of magnetic skyrmion bags embedded within skyrmion lattices in thin plates of B20&#8208;type FeGe. By utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the extraordinary stability of embedded skyrmion bags, which remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields, is observed directly. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are topologically nontrivial spin configurations that possess particle&#8208;like properties. Earlier research has mainly focused on a specific type of skyrmion with topological charge Q = &#8722;1. However, theoretical analyses of 2D chiral magnets have predicted the existence of skyrmion bags&#8212;solitons with arbitrary positive or negative topological charge. Although such spin textures are metastable states, recent experimental observations have confirmed the stability of isolated skyrmion bags in a limited range of applied magnetic fields. Here, by utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the extraordinary stability of skyrmion bags in thin plates of B20&#8208;type FeGe is shown. In particular, it is shown that skyrmion bags embedded within a skyrmion lattice remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided. The results agree perfectly with micromagnetic simulations and establish thin plates of cubic chiral magnets as a powerful platform for exploring a broad spectrum of topological magnetic&#160;solitons.

         <title>Automated Synthesis of DNA Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this contribution, the first automated, solid&#8208;phase synthesis of DNA nanomaterials is presented, achieved via the prototype DNA nanoassembler system. This methodology enables the production of sequence&#8208;controlled custom DNA nanotubes through self&#8208;assembly. Combining single&#8208;molecule kinetics and photobleaching experiments, microfluidic assembly, and automated data screening, the construction strategy relies on the sequential hybridization of DNA modules at room temperature onto a solid support.








Abstract
DNA nanotechnology has revolutionized the ability to position matter at the nanoscale, but the preparation of DNA&#8208;based architectures remains laborious. To facilitate the formation of custom structures, a fully automated method is reported to produce sequence&#8208; and size&#8208;defined DNA nanotubes. By programming the sequential addition of desired building blocks, rigid DX&#8208;tile&#8208;based DNA nanotubes and flexible wireframe DNA structures are attained, where the total number of possible constructs increases as a power function of the number of different units available. Using single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging, the kinetics and yield of each synthetic step can be quantitatively determined, revealing differences in self&#8208;assembly dynamics as the nanotube is built up from the solid support and providing new insights into DNA self&#8208;assembly. The exploitation of automation for both assembly and analysis (through an ad&#8208;hoc developed K&#8208;means clustering algorithm) facilitates a workflow wherein the synthesis parameters may be iteratively improved upon, demonstrating how a single&#8208;molecule &#8220;assembly&#8208;analysis&#8208;optimization&#8221; sequence can be used to generate complex, noncovalent materials in good yield. The presented synthetic strategy is generalizable, making use of equipment already available in most standard laboratories and represents the first fully automated supramolecular assembly on a solid support.

         <dc:description>
An innovative approach is presented using catalysis units, simplifying material design from trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to an assembly&#8208;like process. Through Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning (ML), a structure&#8208;performance relationship is established. Integration catalysis units into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrates Ni&#8208;SalphenCOF and Co&#8208;SalphenCOF as promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This work proposes a streamlined strategy, potentially integrating DFT, ML, and experimental section for efficient functional materials development.








Abstract
It is a pressing need to develop new energy materials to address the existing energy crisis. However, screening optimal targets out of thousands of material candidates remains a great challenge. Herein, an alternative concept for highly effective materials screening based on dual&#8208;atom salphen catalysis units, is proposed and validated. Such an approach simplifies the design of catalytic materials and reforms the trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimental model into a building&#8208;blocks&#8208;assembly like process. First, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed on a series of potential catalysis units that are possible to synthesize. Then, machine learning (ML) is employed to define the structure&#8208;performance relationship and acquire chemical insights. Afterward, the projected catalysis units are integrated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to validate the concept Electrochemical tests confirming that Ni&#8208;SalphenCOF and Co&#8208;SalphenCOF are promising conductive agent&#8208;free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This work provides a fast&#8208;tracked strategy for the design and development of functional materials, which serves as a potentially workable framework for seamlessly integrating DFT calculations, ML, and experimental approaches.

         <title>Controlled Migration of Lithium Cations by Diamine Bridges in Water&#8208;Processable Polymer&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Memory Layers for Organic Synaptic Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>
Forming molecular bridges between water&#8208;soluble polymer chains widens chain distances leading to the reduced conductivity of lithium cations. This controlled migration of ions delivers pronounced hysteresis characteristics in organic transistors, which can mimic the action of biological synapses. The present organic synaptic transistors with the controlled ion migration layers can proceed with neural computing processes at an accuracy of 96%.








Abstract
Synaptic transistors require sufficient retention (memory) performances of current signals to exactly mimic biological synapses. Ion migration has been proposed to achieve high retention characteristics but less attention has been paid to polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) for organic synaptic transistors (OSTRs). Here, OSTRs with water&#8208;processable polymer&#8208;based SSEs, featuring ion migration&#8208;controllable molecular bridges, which are prepared by reactions of poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) are demonstrated. The ion conductivity of PSSA:LiOH:DETA (1:0.4:X, PLiD) films is remarkably changed by the molar ratio (X) of DETA, which is attributed to the extended distances between the PSSA chains by the DETA bridges. The devices with the PLiD layers deliver noticeably changed hysteresis reaching an optimum at X = 0.2, leading to the longest retention of current signals upon single/double pulses. The long&#8208;term potentiation test confirms that the present OSTRs can gradually build up the postsynaptic current by gate pulses of &#8722;2&#160;V, while the long&#8208;term depression can be adjusted by varying the depression gate pulses (&#8776;0.2&#8211;1.2&#160;V). The artificial neural network simulations disclose that the present OSTRs with the ion migration&#8208;controlled PLiD layers can perform synaptic processes with an accuracy of &#8776;96%.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Carrier&#8208;Dominant Transport in 2D Single&#8208;Crystal Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic nature of transport is presented by hole carriers in 2D copper without grain boundaries. Twin boundaries almost do not scatter electrons. The hidden hole&#8208;like properties of 2D copper can only be unmasked by thorough removal of grain boundaries. The existence of hole carriers is revealed in 2D copper through angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and nonlinear Hall effect measurements.








Abstract
In 2D noble metals like copper, the carrier scattering at grain boundaries has obscured the intrinsic nature of electronic transport. However, it is demonstrated that the intrinsic nature of transport by hole carriers in 2D copper can be revealed by growing thin films without grain boundaries. As even a slight deviation from the twin boundary is perceived as grain boundaries by electrons, it is only through the thorough elimination of grain boundaries that the hidden hole&#8208;like attribute of 2D single&#8208;crystal copper can be unmasked. Two types of Fermi surfaces, a large hexagonal Fermi surface centered at the zone center and the triangular Fermi surface around the zone corner, tightly matching to the calculated Fermi surface topology, confirmed by angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and vivid nonlinear Hall effects of the 2D single&#8208;crystal copper account for the presence of hole carriers experimentally. This breakthrough suggests the potential to manipulate the majority carrier polarity in metals by means of grain boundary engineering in a 2D geometry.

         <title>Near Room Temperature Solvothermal Growth of Ferroelectric CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets with Ultralow Dark Current</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with exceptional optical properties and ultralow dark current are synthesized via a near&#8208;room temperature solvothermal method by enhancing precursor solubility in alcohol. These nanoplatelets, with dimensions in the tens of micrometers, show potential for use in advanced optoelectronic devices, including optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics, by combining ferroelectricity with the inherent properties of CsPbBr3.








Abstract
CsPbBr3 exhibits outstanding optoelectronic properties and thermal stability, making it a coveted material for detectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and solar cells. Despite observations of ferroelectricity in CsPbBr3 quantum dots, synthesizing bulk ferroelectric CsPbBr3 crystals has remained elusive, hindering its potential in next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices like optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics. Here, a breakthrough is reported: a novel solvothermal technique enabling the growth of ferroelectric CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with lateral dimensions in the tens of micrometers. This represents a significant step toward achieving large&#8208;area ferroelectric CsPbBr3 crystals. Unlike traditional methods, this approach allows for growth and crystallization of CsPbBr3 in alcohol solutions by enhancing precursor solubility. This study confirms the ferroelectric nature of these nanoplatelets using second harmonic generation, electrical characterizations, and piezoresponse force microscopy. This work paves the way for utilizing ferroelectric CsPbBr3 in novel optoelectronic devices, significantly expanding the potential of this material and opening doors for further exploration in this exciting field.

         <title>Memristive Crossbar Array&#8208;Based Probabilistic Graph Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a memristive crossbar array (CBA)&#8208;based probabilistic graph model (C&#8208;PGM) using Cu0.3Te0.7/HfO2/Pt memristors. C&#8208;PGM expresses uncertainties in graph data through device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations, enabling fast processing and large&#8208;scale implementation of probabilistic units. This model demonstrates improved computational efficiency and accuracy in applications like steady&#8208;state estimation and the PageRank algorithm compared to conventional methods.








Abstract
Modern graph datasets with structural complexity and uncertainties due to incomplete information or data variability require advanced modeling techniques beyond conventional graph models. This study introduces a memristive crossbar array (CBA)&#8208;based probabilistic graph model (C&#8208;PGM) utilizing Cu0.3Te0.7/HfO2/Pt memristors, which exhibit probabilistic switching, self&#8208;rectifying, and memory characteristics. C&#8208;PGM addresses the complexities and uncertainties inherent in structural graph data across various domains, leveraging the probabilistic nature of memristors. C&#8208;PGM relies on the device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation across multiple memristive CBAs, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches that rely on sequential operations, which are slower and have a reliability concern due to repeated switching. This new approach enables the fast processing and massive implementation of probabilistic units at the expense of chip area. In this study, the hardware&#8208;based C&#8208;PGM feasibly expresses small&#8208;scale probabilistic graphs and shows minimal error in aggregate probability calculations. The probability calculation capabilities of C&#8208;PGM are applied to steady&#8208;state estimation and the PageRank algorithm, which is implemented on a simulated large&#8208;scale C&#8208;PGM. The C&#8208;PGM&#8208;based steady&#8208;state estimation and PageRank algorithm demonstrate comparable accuracy to conventional methods while significantly reducing computational costs.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Culture of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in Xeno&#8208;Free Condition Using Functional Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a fully synthetic, xeno&#8208;free culture substrate, poly(glycidyl methacrylate&#8208;grafting&#8208;guanidine&#8208;co&#8208;carboxylicacrylate) (pGC2), engineered for human pluripotent stem cells cultivation. pGC2 supports robust growth of human pluripotent stem cells, maintaining stemness and pluripotency for up to ten passages, while offering cost&#8208;competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. Comprehensive evaluations confirm its wide adaptability and potential for clinical translation in stem cell&#8208;based therapies.








Abstract
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), encompassing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), hold immense potential in regenerative medicine, offering new opportunities for personalized cell therapies. However, their clinical translation is hindered by the inevitable reliance on xenogeneic components in culture environments. This study addresses this challenge by engineering a fully synthetic, xeno&#8208;free culture substrate, whose surface composition is tailored systematically for xeno&#8208;free culture of hPSCs. A functional polymer surface, pGC2 (poly(glycidyl methacrylate&#8208;grafting&#8208;guanidine&#8208;co&#8208;carboxylic acrylate)), offers excellent cell&#8208;adhesive properties as well as non&#8208;cytotoxicity, enabling robust hESCs and hiPSCs growth while presenting cost&#8208;competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. This investigation includes comprehensive evaluations of pGC2 across diverse experimental conditions, demonstrating its wide adaptability with various pluripotent stem cell lines, culture media, and substrates. Crucially, pGC2 supports long&#8208;term hESCs and hiPSCs expansion, up to ten passages without compromising their stemness and pluripotency. Notably, this study is the first to confirm an identical proteomic profile after ten passages of xeno&#8208;free cultivation of hiPSCs on a polymeric substrate compared to Matrigel.

     alt="Long-Term Culture of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in Xeno-Free Condition Using Functional Polymer Films"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a fully synthetic, xeno-free culture substrate, poly(glycidyl methacrylate-grafting-guanidine-co-carboxylicacrylate) (pGC2), engineered for human pluripotent stem cells cultivation. pGC2 supports robust growth of human pluripotent stem cells, maintaining stemness and pluripotency for up to ten passages, while offering cost-competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. Comprehensive evaluations confirm its wide adaptability and potential for clinical translation in stem cell-based therapies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), encompassing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), hold immense potential in regenerative medicine, offering new opportunities for personalized cell therapies. However, their clinical translation is hindered by the inevitable reliance on xenogeneic components in culture environments. This study addresses this challenge by engineering a fully synthetic, xeno-free culture substrate, whose surface composition is tailored systematically for xeno-free culture of hPSCs. A functional polymer surface, pGC2 (poly(glycidyl methacrylate-grafting-guanidine-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-carboxylic acrylate)), offers excellent cell-adhesive properties as well as non-cytotoxicity, enabling robust hESCs and hiPSCs growth while presenting cost-competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. This investigation includes comprehensive evaluations of pGC2 across diverse experimental conditions, demonstrating its wide adaptability with various pluripotent stem cell lines, culture media, and substrates. Crucially, pGC2 supports long-term hESCs and hiPSCs expansion, up to ten passages without compromising their stemness and pluripotency. Notably, this study is the first to confirm an identical proteomic profile after ten passages of xeno-free cultivation of hiPSCs on a polymeric substrate compared to Matrigel. The innovative substrate bridges the gap between laboratory research and clinical translation, offering a new promising avenue for advancing stem cell-based therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Piezoelectric Analgesia Blocks Cancer&#8208;Induced Bone Pain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This polyvinylpyrrolidone modified Aurivillius structure BiOIO3 nanosheets (BIONSs) are synthesized via a hydrothermal process. Ultrasound can trigger BIONSs to generate local electrical field, internalizing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) rapidly and substantially decreasing the expression of TRPV1. With the reduction of TRPV1, the Ca2+ signal in spinal neuron is obviously decreased and the activity of wide range dynamic neurons is inhibited, accompanying the reduction of some neuropeptides and the change of inflammatory cytokines, resulting cancer induced bone pain relief for up to 6&#160;h.








Abstract
The manipulation of cell surface receptors&#8217; activity will open a new frontier for drug development and disease treatment. However, limited by the desensitization of drugs, effective physical intervention strategy remains challenging. Here, the controllable internalization of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) on neural cells by local piezoelectric field is reported. Single&#8208;cell&#8208;level local electric field is construct by synthesizing piezoelectric BiOIO3 nanosheets (BIONSs). Upon a mild ultrasound of 0.08&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, an electric field of 15.29&#160;&#181;V is generated on the surface of BIONSs, further inducing TRPV1 internalization in 5&#160;min. The as&#8208;downregulated TRPV1 expression results in the reduction of Ca2+ signal in a spinal neuron and the inhibition of the activity of wide range dynamic neurons, therefore effectively preventing the transmission of cancer&#8208;induced bone pain (CIBP). This strategy not only charts a new course for CIBP alleviation, but also introduces a promising nanotechnology for regulating cell surface receptors, showing significant potential in neuropathological and receptor&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Needle&#8208;Like Multifunctional Biphasic Microfiber for Minimally Invasive Implantable Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The needle&#8208;like stretchable multifunctional microfiber for minimally invasive bioelectronics is developed, featuring a liquid metal core&#8208;nanocomposite shell structure. This design allows stiffness control based on phase transition and offers advantageous properties of both materials such as softness, stretchability, conductivity, and strain&#8208;insensitivity. Further functionalization enhances its biosensing and stimulation capabilities, showing promise for clinical translation across various in vivo applications.








Abstract
Implantable bioelectronics has attracted significant attention in electroceuticals and clinical medicine for precise diagnosis and efficient treatment of target diseases. However, conventional rigid implantable devices face challenges such as poor tissue&#8208;device interface and unavoidable tissue damage during surgical implantation. Despite continuous efforts to utilize various soft materials to address such issues, their practical applications remain limited. Here, a needle&#8208;like stretchable microfiber composed of a phase&#8208;convertible liquid metal (LM) core and a multifunctional nanocomposite shell for minimally invasive soft bioelectronics is reported. The sharp tapered microfiber can be stiffened by freezing akin to a conventional needle to penetrate soft tissue with minimal incision. Once implanted in vivo where the LM melts, unlike conventional stiff needles, it regains soft mechanical properties, which facilitate a seamless tissue&#8208;device interface. The nanocomposite incorporating with functional nanomaterials exhibits both low impedance and the ability to detect physiological pH, providing biosensing and stimulation capabilities. The fluidic LM embedded in the nanocomposite shell enables high stretchability and strain&#8208;insensitive electrical properties. This multifunctional biphasic microfiber conforms to the surfaces of the stomach, muscle, and heart, offering a promising approach for electrophysiological recording, pH sensing, electrical stimulation, and radiofrequency ablation in vivo.

         <title>Unraveling Anomalies in Preferential Liquid Transport through the Intrinsic Pores of Cyclodextrin in Polyester Nanofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acyl chloride crosslinked macrocyclic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based polyester nanofilm composite membranes result in membranes with high water permeance and superior ion&#8208;sieving capabilities. Polar aggregate pores in the nanofilm facilitate water permeation while the intrinsic cyclodextrin cavity does not contribute to liquid permeation, enabling selective permeation of polar liquids with extremely high permeance selectivity of &gt;500 and diminishes the existence of Janus pathways.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of the porous structure of the nanofiltration membrane is critical for unlocking enhanced separation efficiencies across various liquids and solutes. Ultrathin films of crosslinked macrocycles, specifically cyclodextrins (CDs), have drawn considerable attention in this area owing to their ability to facilitate precise molecular separation with high liquid permeance for both polar and non&#8208;polar liquids, resembling Janus membranes. However, the functional role of the intrinsic cavity of CD in liquid transport remains inadequately understood, demanding immediate attention in designing nanofiltration membranes. Here, the synthesis of polyester nanofilms derived from crosslinked &#946;&#8208;CD, demonstrating remarkable Na2SO4 rejection (&#8776;92 &#8211; 99.5%), high water permeance (&#8776;4.4 &#8211; 37.4 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1), extremely low hexane permeance (&lt;1 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1), and extremely high ratio (&#945; &gt; 500) of permeances for polar and non&#8208;polar liquids, is reported. Molecular simulations support the findings, indicating that neither the polar nor the non&#8208;polar liquids flow through the &#946;&#8208;CD cavity in the nanofilm. Instead, liquid transport predominantly occurs through the 2.2&#160;nm hydrophilic aggregate pores. This challenges the presumed functional role of macrocyclic cavities in liquid transport and raises questions about the existence of the Janus structure in nanofiltration membranes produced from the macrocyclic monomers.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Graphitization: The First Observation of Homogeneous Solid&#8208;State Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic graphitization is a simple and flexible route to graphitic carbons from biomass or organic precursors. Here, it is shown that the mechanism of graphitization involves a new type of catalysis where all components are in the solid state. This has broad implications in the important world of carbon but also more widely in materials science.








Abstract
Carbon is a critical material for existing and emerging energy applications and there is considerable global effort in generating sustainable carbons. A particularly promising area is iron&#8208;catalyzed graphitization, which is the conversion of organic matter to graphitic carbon nanostructures by an iron catalyst. In this paper, it is reported that iron&#8208;catalyzed graphitization occurs via a new type of mechanism that is called homogeneous solid&#8208;state catalysis. Dark field in situ transmission electron microscopy is used to demonstrate that crystalline iron nanoparticles &#8220;burrow&#8221; through amorphous carbon to generate multiwalled graphitic nanotubes. The process is remarkably fast, particularly given the solid phase of the catalyst, and in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction is used to demonstrate that graphitization is complete within a few minutes.

         <title>Efficient Orbitronic Terahertz Emission Based on CoPt Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates for the first time the efficient generation of orbital current from CoPt alloy. This work quantifies the transport properties of the orbital currents from CoPt alloy and show that the performance of orbitronic terahertz emitters exceeds the spintronic counterpart. This work provides a new route for the developing orbitronic information devices.








Abstract
Orbitronic devices operate by manipulating orbitally polarized currents. Recent studies have shown that these orbital currents can be excited by femtosecond laser pulses in a ferromagnet such as Ni and converted into ultrafast charge currents via orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, the terahertz emission from orbitronic terahertz emitters based on Ni is still much weaker than that of the typical spintronic terahertz emitter. Here, this work reports a more efficient light&#8208;induced generation of orbital current from a CoPt alloy, and the terahertz emission from CoPt/Cu/MgO is comparable to that of benchmark spintronic terahertz emitters. By varying the composition of the CoPt alloy, the thickness of Cu, and the capping layer, this work confirms that THz emission primarily originates from the orbital accumulation generated within CoPt, propagating through Cu, followed by subsequent orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion due to the inverse orbital Rashba&#8208;Edelstein effect at the Cu/MgO interface. This study provides strong evidence for the efficient orbital current generation in CoPt alloy, paving the way for efficient orbital terahertz emitters.

&lt;p&gt;Orbitronic devices operate by manipulating orbitally polarized currents. Recent studies have shown that these orbital currents can be excited by femtosecond laser pulses in a ferromagnet such as Ni and converted into ultrafast charge currents via orbital-to-charge conversion. However, the terahertz emission from orbitronic terahertz emitters based on Ni is still much weaker than that of the typical spintronic terahertz emitter. Here, this work reports a more efficient light-induced generation of orbital current from a CoPt alloy, and the terahertz emission from CoPt/Cu/MgO is comparable to that of benchmark spintronic terahertz emitters.

         <title>Acetonitrile&#8208;Based Local High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes for Advanced Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compatibility issue of acetonitrile (AN) with lithium metal is tackled by introducing a novel approach&#8212;a locally high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) as a diluent (LAT&#8208;0.5:1:2). The electrolyte demonstrates exceptional electrochemical stability, flame retardancy, and wettability. Based on Cryo&#8208;EM characterization and theoretical simulations, the underlying mechanism of the AN&#8208;based LHCE from both the respects of solvation and SEI structures has been revealed.








Abstract
Acetonitrile (AN) is a compelling electrolyte solvent for high&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging batteries, but its reductive instability makes it incompatible with lithium metal anodes (LMAs). Herein, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) is used as the diluent to build an AN&#8208;based local high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to realize dense, dendrite&#8208;free, and stable LMAs. Such LHCE exhibits an exceptional electrochemical stability window close to 6&#160;V (vs Li+/Li), excellent wettability, and promising flame retardancy. Compared to a baseline carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, its electrochemical performance is prominent: the overpotential of lithium nucleation is minimal (only 24&#160;mV), the average half&#8208;cell coulombic efficiency (CE) reaches 99.5% at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and its practicality in full cells with LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes is also demonstrated. Compounding factors are identified to decipher the superiority of the AN&#8208;based LHCE. From the respect of solvation structures, both the elimination of free AN molecule and the diluent separation would contribute to prevention of anodic AN decomposition. Based on cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) characterization and theoretical simulations results, the produced solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is uniform and compact. Thus, this work demonstrates a successful application of AN&#8208;based electrolytes in LMAs&#8212;traditionally deemed impractical&#8212;via the combined regulation of solvation and SEI structures.

         <title>Realization of Two&#8208;Dimensional Intrinsic Polar Metal in a Buckled Honeycomb Binary Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Buckled AB honeycomb lattice with C3v symmetry belongs to polar space group P3m1, is proposed to be a promising candidate hosting topological Dirac fermions and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity. Here, the successful realization of a IV&#8208;V binary compound on Ag (111) surface via molecular beam epitaxy, is reported. Strikingly, polarity and metallicity are found to coexist in the 2D buckled SiP monolayer.








Abstract
Structural topology and symmetry of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) network play pivotal roles in defining its electrical properties and functionalities. Here, a binary buckled honeycomb lattice with C3v symmetry, which naturally hosts topological Dirac fermions and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity, is proposed. It is successfully achieved in a group IV&#8208;V compound, namely monolayer SiP epitaxially grown on Ag(111) surface. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations with angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the degeneration of the Dirac nodal lines to points due to the broken horizonal mirror symmetry is elucidated. More interesting, the SiP monolayer manifests metallic nature, which is mutually exclusive with polarity in conventional materials. It is further found that the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity is strongly suppressed by the metallic substrate. This study not only represents a breakthrough of realizing intrinsic polarity in 2D metallic material via ingenious design but also provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay of many exotic low&#8208;dimensional quantum phenomena.

         <title>Rational Design of Color&#8208;Pure Blue Organic Emitters by Poly&#8208;Heteroaromatic Omni&#8208;Delocalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Color&#8208;pure blue emitters are in great demand for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition organic light emitting diodes displays. Here, a simple and clear concept to design such emitters is presented. The application of this concept allows to derive a new structural motif, which is used to synthesize novel color&#8208;pure emitters with brilliant blue hue.









Abstract
Current research on organic light emitters which utilize multiple resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF)&#160;materials is gaining significant interest because of the materials&#8217; ability to efficiently generate color&#8208;pure blue emission. However, the underlying reasons for high color purity remain unclear. It is shown here that these emitters share a common electronic basis, which is deduced from resonance structure considerations following Clar's rule, and which is termed as &#8220;poly&#8208;heteroaromatic omni&#8208;delocalization&#8221; (PHOD). The simple and clear design rules derived from the PHOD concept allow extending the known chemical space by new structural motifs. Based on PHOD, a set of novel high&#8208;efficiency color&#8208;pure emitters with brilliant deep&#8208;blue hue is specifically designed.

Here, starting from the (Mo, Nb)4AlC3 o&#8208;MAX, the novel Mo3.33&#8208;xR0.67NbxAlC3 (R = Y, Gd&#8208;Tm, Lu) super&#8208;ordered (s&#8208;)MAX phase is synthesized with simultaneous R in&#8208;plane&#8208;ordering and Mo/Nb out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8208;ordering. The Pt&#8208;anchored 2D s&#8208;MXene shows supreme HER performance.








Abstract
Nanolamellar transition metal carbides are gaining increasing attentions because of the promising application in energy storage of their 2D derivatives. There are in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane atomic ordered occupations, which is thought to only be formed in separated systems due to totally different origins and crystallographic structure. In present work, starting from (Mo, Nb)4AlC3 o&#8208;MAX phase where out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered occupation is experimentally and theoretically proved for Mo/Nb atoms, rare&#8208;earth elements (R = Y, Gd&#8208;Tm, Lu) are introduced, and the novel Mo3.33&#8208;xR0.67NbxAlC3 (x = 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, and 2.5) super&#8208;ordered (s&#8208;) MAX phase is synthesized, where R is ordered at the outer layer in the strict stoichiometry meanwhile Mo/Nb maintains the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered occupation. By R introduction, s&#8208;MAX is easier to be delaminated to obtain the s&#8208;MXene with the topochemical ordered vacancies, leading into the enhanced supercapacitance of 114.9 F g&#8722;1 in Mo1.33Nb2C3 s&#8208;MXene compared with 95.1 F g&#8722;1 in Mo2Nb2C3 o&#8208;MXene. By Pt anchoring, very low overpotential of 22&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved for HER applications. This study demonstrates a novel variety of s&#8208;MAX phase and seeks to inspire further exploration of the ordered MAX and MXene families.

         <title>Highly Luminescent Shell&#8208;Less Indium Phosphide Quantum Dots Enabled by Atomistically Tailored Surface States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
InP quantum dots demonstrate enhanced luminescence through atomic&#8208;level surface manipulation without shell structures. Concerns persist over core instability due to oxidation propensity and inevitable trap presence. However, utilizing Zn&#8208;oleate removes some traps, and with the addition of GaCl3, most traps are eliminated, achieving over 90% luminescence efficiency with the core alone.








Abstract
Contrary to the prevailing notion that shell structures arise from the intricate chemistry and surface defects of InP quantum dots (QDs), an innovative strategy that remarkably enhances the luminescence efficiency of core&#8208;only InP QDs to over 90% is introduced. This paradigm shift is achieved through the concurrent utilization of group 2 and 3 metal&#8208;derived ligands, providing an effective remedy for surface defects and facilitating charge recombination. Specifically, a combination of Zn carboxylate and Ga chloride is employed to address the undercoordination issues associated with In and P atoms, leading to the alleviation of in&#8208;gap trap states. The intricate interplay and proportional ratio between Ga&#8208; and Zn&#8208;containing ligands play pivotal roles in attaining record&#8208;high luminescence efficiency in core&#8208;only InP QDs, as successfully demonstrated across various sizes and color emissions. Moreover, the fabrication of electroluminescent devices relying solely on InP core emission opens a new direction in optoelectronics, demonstrating the potential of the approach not only in optoelectronic applications but also in catalysis or energy conversion by charge transfer.

         <title>Vertically Phase Separated Photomultiplication Organic Photodetectors with p&#8208;n Heterojunction Type Ultrafast Dynamic Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical donor&#8211;acceptor phase separation in photomultiplication organic photodetectors induces a partial p&#8208;n heterojunction character with remarkably improved dynamic properties while maintaining high external quantum efficiency and detectivity. The strategy marks a pioneering achievement by showcasing the simultaneous presence of p&#8208;n heterojunction and photomultiplication modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time.








Abstract
Photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;type organic photodetectors (OPDs), which typically form a homogeneous distribution (HD) of n&#8208;type dopants in a p&#8208;type polymer host (HD PM&#8208;type OPDs), have achieved a breakthrough in device responsivity by surpassing a theoretical limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, they face limitations in higher dark current and slower dynamic characteristics compared to p&#8208;n heterojunction (p&#8208;n HJ) OPDs due to inherent long lifetime of trapped electrons. To overcome this, a new PM&#8208;type OPD is developed that demonstrates ultrafast dynamic properties through a vertical phase separation (VPS) strategy between the p&#8208;type polymer and n&#8208;type acceptor, referred to as VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs. Notably, VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs show three orders of magnitude&#160;increase in &#8722;3&#160;dB cut&#8208;off frequency (120&#160;kHz) and over a 200&#8208;fold faster response time (rising time = 4.8 &#181;s, falling time = 8.3 &#181;s) compared to HD PM&#8208;type OPDs, while maintaining high EQE of 1121% and specific detectivity of 2.53 &#215; 1013 Jones at &#8722;10&#160;V. The VPS PM&#8208;type OPD represents a groundbreaking advancement by demonstrating the coexistence of p&#8208;n HJ and PM modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time. This innovative approach holds the potential to enhance both static and dynamic properties of OPDs.

         <title>Designed Spin&#8208;Texture&#8208;Lattice to Control Anisotropic Magnon Transport in Antiferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through control of thin&#8208;film boundary conditions, the magnetic texture present in antiferromagnetic BiFeO3 can be stabilized as a quasi&#8208;1D periodic lattice. This has important implications on spin&#8208;wave transport in the system, which is observed in this work through nitrogen&#8208;vacancy magnetometry imaging, nonlocal transport measurements, and a combination of finite&#8208;element and analytical calculations of the magnon dispersion.








Abstract
Spin waves in magnetic materials are promising information carriers for future computing technologies due to their ultra&#8208;low energy dissipation and long coherence length. Antiferromagnets are strong candidate materials due, in part, to their stability to external fields and larger group velocities. Multiferroic antiferromagnets, such as BiFeO3 (BFO), have an additional degree of freedom stemming from magnetoelectric coupling, allowing for control of the magnetic structure, and thus spin waves, with the electric field. Unfortunately, spin&#8208;wave propagation in BFO is not well understood due to the complexity of the magnetic structure. In this work, long&#8208;range spin transport is explored within an epitaxially engineered, electrically tunable, 1D magnonic crystal. A striking anisotropy is discovered in the spin transport parallel and perpendicular to the 1D crystal axis. Multiscale theory and simulation suggest that this preferential magnon conduction emerges from a combination of a population imbalance in its dispersion, as well as anisotropic structural scattering. This work provides a pathway to electrically reconfigurable magnonic crystals in&#160;antiferromagnets.

         <title>Constructing Slip Stacking Diversity in Van der Waals Homobilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversified thermodynamically advantageous slip stackings with angstrom&#8208;scale structural discrepancies are constructed in low&#8208;symmetry van der Waals homobilayers via direct growth. Modulation strategies to switch the stacking via grain boundaries and to expand the slip stacking library from thermodynamic to kinetically favored structures via in situ thermal treatment are developed. The work unveils a unique epitaxy and offers a viable means for manipulating interlayer atomic registries.








Abstract
The van der Waals (vdW) interface provides two important degrees of freedom&#8212;twist and slip&#8212;to tune interlayer structures and inspire unique physics. However, constructing diversified high&#8208;quality slip stackings (i.e., lattice orientations between layers are parallel with only interlayer sliding) is more challenging than twisted stackings due to angstrom&#8208;scale structural discrepancies between different slip stackings, sparsity of thermodynamically stable candidates and insufficient mechanism understanding. Here, using transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers as a model system, this work theoretically elucidates that vdW materials with low lattice symmetry and weak interlayer coupling allow the creation of multifarious thermodynamically advantageous slip stackings, and experimentally achieves&#160;13 and 9 slip stackings in 1T&#8243;&#8208;ReS2 and 1T&#8243;&#8208;ReSe2 bilayers via direct growth, which are systematically revealed by atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), angle&#8208;resolved polarization Raman spectroscopy, and second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. This work also develops modulation strategies to switch the stacking via grain boundaries (GBs) and to expand the slip stacking library from thermodynamic to kinetically favored structures via in situ thermal treatment. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a prominent dependence of the pressure&#8208;induced electronic band structure transition on stacking configurations. These studies unveil a unique vdW epitaxy and offer a viable means for manipulating interlayer atomic registries.

Self&#8208;powered vehicle&#8208;road integrated electronics (SVRIE) with a multilevel fractal structure is reported to improve the level of vehicle&#8208;road collaborative perception and autonomous driving cars. With the assistance of artificial intelligence models, SVRIE enhances the ability to recognize vehicle motion, road surface, and tire health condition, with a perception accuracy of more than 90%.








Abstract
Collaborative perception between a vehicle and the road has the potential to enhance the limited perception capability of autonomous driving technologies. With this background, self&#8208;powered vehicle&#8208;road integrated electronics (SVRIE) with a multilevel fractal structure is designed to play a dual role, including a SVRIE device integrated into vehicle tires and a SVRIE array embedded into a road surface. The pressure sensing capability and anti&#8208;crosstalk performance of the SVRIE array are characterized separately to validate the feasibility of applying the SVRIE in a cooperative vehicle&#8208;infrastructure system. It is demonstrated that the SVRIE based on the multi&#8208;layered fractal structure exhibits maximum performance in collaborative sensing and interaction between vehicles and road information, such as vehicle motion, road surface condition, and tire life cycle health monitoring. Traditional data analysis methods are often of questionable accuracy. Therefore, a convolutional neural network is used to classify the vehicle and road conditions with accuracy of at least 88.3%. The transfer learning model is constructed to enhance the road surface identification capabilities with 100% accuracy. The accuracies of the vehicle tire motion recognition and tire health monitoring are 97% and 99%, respectively. This work provides new ideas for collaborative perception between vehicles and roadsides.

         <title>Minimizing Interfacial Energy Loss and Volatilization of Formamidinium via Polymer&#8208;Assisted D&#8211;A supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly Interface for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 25.78% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;assisted 5FTPP/PCBM supramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interface self&#8208;assembly strategy can minimize interfacial energy losses by addressing thermalization, conduction band offset, and nonradiative recombination, while inhibiting the adverse effect of FA+ volatilization under thermal stress by multidentate anchoring.








Abstract
2D perovskite passivation strategies effectively reduce defect&#8208;assisted carrier nonradiative recombination losses on the perovskite surface. Nonetheless, severe energy losses are causing by carrier thermalization, interfacial nonradiative recombination, and conduction band offset still persist at heterojunction perovskite/PCBM interfaces, which limits further performance enhancement of inverted heterojunction PSCs. Here, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (5FTPP) is introduced between 3D/2D perovskite heterojunction and PCBM. Compared to tetraphenylporphyrin without electron&#8208;withdrawing fluoro&#8208;substituents, 5FTPP can self&#8208;assemble with PCBM at interface into donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) complex with stronger supramolecular interaction and lower energy transfer losses. This rapid energy transfer from donor (5FTPP) to acceptor (PCBM) within femtosecond scale is demonstrated to enlarge hot carrier extraction rates and ranges, reducing thermalization losses. Furthermore, the incorporation of polystyrene derivative (PD) reinforces D&#8211;A interaction by inhibiting self&#8208;&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of 5FTPP, while fine&#8208;tuning conduction band offset and suppressing interfacial nonradiative recombination via Schottky barrier, dipole, and n&#8208;doping. Notably, the multidentate anchoring of PD&#8208;5FTPP with FA+, Pb2+, and I&#8722; mitigates the adverse effects of FA+ volatilization during thermal stress. Ultimately, devices with PD&#8208;5FTPP achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.78% (certified: 25.36%), maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous illumination at the maximum power point (65&#160;&#176;C) under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Design of Highly Conductive Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells and Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive anion exchange membrane (AEM) structures are identified from a pool of 180000 AEM variations through a trained fully connected neural network (FCNN) model. Under the guidance of machine learning, synthesized AEMs with anilinium cation domain facilitate the formation of continuous ion channels, showing potential applications in AEM&#8208;based energy devices.








Abstract
Alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM)&#8208;based fuel cells (AEMFCs) and water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are vital for enabling the efficient and large&#8208;scale utilization of hydrogen energy. However, the performance of such energy devices is impeded by the relatively low conductivity of AEMs. The conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach to designing membrane structures has proven to be both inefficient and costly. To address this challenge, a fully connected neural network (FCNN) model is developed based on acid&#8208;catalyzed AEMs to analyze the relationship between structure and conductivity among 180,000 AEM variations. Under machine learning guidance, anilinium cation&#8208;type membranes are designed and synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations and Mulliken charge population analysis validated that the presence of a large anilinium cation domain is a result of the inductive effect of N+ and benzene rings. The interconnected anilinium cation domains facilitated the formation of a continuous ion transport channel within the AEMs. Additionally, the incorporation of the benzyl electron&#8208;withdrawing group heightened the inductive effect, leading to high conductivity AEM variant as screened by the machine learning model. Furthermore, based on the highly active and low&#8208;cost monomers given by machine learning, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of anilinium&#8208;based AEMs confirms the potential for commercial applications.

         <title>Unveiling the In Situ Evolution of Li2O&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface on CoOx Embedded Carbon Fibers as Li Anode Host</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an attempt is made to unveil the in situ evolution of Li2O&#8208;rich SEIs by using carbon nanofibers modified with CoOx as Li anode host, and 18O isotope tracing provides firm evidence of oxygen migration from CoOx to Li2O besides electrolyte decomposition. The as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly help improve the anode performance in half, symmetrical, and full cells.








Abstract
Modification of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) carbon hosts with metal oxides has been considered as advantageous for the formation of Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which can show fast Li+ diffusion, and meanwhile alleviate dendrite problems caused by fragility and nonuniformity of native SEIs. However, the lack of convincing experimental evidence has made it difficult to unveil the true origin of oxygen in Li2O&#8208;rich SEIs until now. Herein, CoOx embedded carbon nanofibers (CNF&#8208;CoOx) are successfully prepared as high&#8208;performance Li anode hosts. By employing 18O isotope labeling, the role of CoOx during SEI evolution is elucidated, revealing that CoOx contributes significantly to Li2O formation by delivering oxygen. Benefiting from the rich Li2O content, the as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly improve the Li+ migration kinetics, and therefore, the CNF&#8208;CoOx@Li anode can exhibit excellent cycling stability in half, symmetrical, and full cells.

         <title>Enhanced SWIR Light Detection in Organic Semiconductor Photodetectors through Up&#8208;Conversion of Mid&#8208;Gap Trap States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for creating shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photo&#8208;response in organic photodiodes by utilizing mid&#8208;gap states through &#8216;trap&#8208;doping&#8217; is presented. This involves incorporating small amounts of a guest organic molecule into a semiconducting donor:acceptor host system. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a visible&#8208;SWIR broadband organic photodiode is demonstrated.








Abstract
Shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photodetectors are vital for many scientific and industrial applications including surveillance, quality control and inspection. In recent decades, photodetectors based on organic semiconductors have emerged, demonstrating potential to add real value to broadband and narrowband imaging and sensing scenarios, where factors such as thermal budget sensitivity, large area aperture necessity, cost considerations, and lightweight and conformal flexibility demands are prioritized. It is now recognized that the performance of organic photodetectors (OPDs), notably their specific detectivity, is ultimately limited by trap states, universally present in disordered semiconductors. This work adopts an approach of utilizing these mid&#8208;gap states to specifically create a SWIR photo&#8208;response. To this end, this work introduces a somewhat counter&#8208;intuitive approach of &#8220;trap&#8208;doping&#8221; in bulk heterojunction (BHJs) photodiodes, where small quantities of a guest organic molecule are intentionally incorporated into a semiconducting donor:acceptor host system. Following this approach, this work demonstrates a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a visible&#8208;to&#8208;SWIR broadband OPD, approaching (and, to some extent, even exceeding) state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance across critical photodetector metrics. The trap&#8208;doping approach is, even though only a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept currently, broadly applicable to various spectral windows. It represents a new modality for engineering photodetection using the unconventional strategy of turning a limitation into a feature.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Lanthanide Metallopolymer: Self&#8208;Healing and Photo&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dual&#8208;Emitting Luminescence for Diverse Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible/UV&#8208;light&#8208;driven photosensitive photoluminescent metallopolymers with good mechanical properties and fast self&#8208;healing behaviors are successfully developed by incorporating spiropyran and terpyridine components into a unified lanthanide polymer structure. By adjusting the proportions of raw material, precise control over the stimulus response and luminescent color can be achieved. The obtained polymers have been applied for dynamic information encryption, UV&#8208;sensing, and Light&#8208;writing fields.








Abstract
Photoluminescent metallopolymers displaying photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties are emerging as promising materials with versatile applications in photo&#8208;rewritable patterns, wearable UV sensors, and optical encryption anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, integrating these materials into practical applications that require fast response times, lightweight qualities, fatigue resistance, and multiple encryption capabilities poses challenges. In this study, luminescent photochromic lanthanide (Ln) metallopolymers with rapid self&#8208;healing properties are developed by cross&#8208;linking terpyridine (Tpy)&#8208; and spiropyran (SP)&#8208; functionalized polyurethane chains through Ln&#8208;Tpy coordination bonds and H&#8208;bonds among polymer chains. The resulting products exhibit a range of intriguing features: i) photo&#8208;stimuli responsiveness using spiropyran monomers without additional dopants; ii) dual&#8208;emitting performance under UV&#8208;light due to Ln&#8208;Tpy and open&#8208;ring spiropyran moieties; iii) satisfactory mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing abilities from polymer chains; iv) multiple control switches for luminescence colors through photostimulation or feed ratio adjustments. Leveraging these attributes, the developed material introduces novel opportunities for light&#8208;writing applications, advanced information encryption, UV&#8208;sensing wearable devices, and insights into designing multifunctional intelligent materials for the future.

         <title>Injectable and Sprayable Fluorescent Nanoprobe for Rapid Real&#8208;Time Detection of Human Colorectal Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of nanoprobes for colorectal cancer imaging agents is carried out by developing Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT with a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal ratio (up to 12.3) and fast visualization (3&#160;min after in situ spraying), thus enabling successful recognition of the tumor boundary. This work has demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a promising strategy in image&#8208;guided tumor resection.









Abstract
The development of minimally invasive surgery has greatly advanced precision tumor surgery, but sometime suffers from restricted visualization of the surgical field, especially during the removal of abdominal tumors. A 3&#8208;D inspection of tumors could be achieved by intravenously injecting tumor&#8208;selective fluorescent probes, whereas most of which are unable to instantly distinguish tumors via in situ spraying, which is urgently needed in the process of surgery in a convenient manner. In this study, this work has designed an injectable and sprayable fluorescent nanoprobe, termed Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT, to realize rapid tumor imaging in freshly dissected human colorectal tumors and animal models. Mechanistically, the incorporation of &#947;&#8208;glutamyl group facilitates the rapid internalization of Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT, and these internalized nanoprobes can be subsequently activated by intracellular NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase&#8208;1 to release near&#8208;infrared fluorophores. As a result, Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT can achieve a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal ratio (TNR) up to 12.3 and enable a fast visualization (3&#160;min after in situ spraying) of tumor boundaries in the xenograft tumor models, Apcmin/+ mice models and fresh human tumor tissues. In addition, Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT is capable of identifying minimal premalignant lesions via intravenous injection.

         <dc:description>
A novel polar molecule with antiparallel columnar stacking is synthesized and further embedded it into an F&#8208;2DP system by simple air&#8211;liquid interface method to control over the crystallinity of F&#8208;2DP film through self&#8208;complementary &#960;&#8208;electronic forces between the interlayer and regulate the charge transfer along the intralayer to induce multilevel memory behavior for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing 2D polymer (F&#8208;2DP) film is a desired system to regulate the charge transport in organic electronics but rather rarely reports due to the limited fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks and difficulties in synthesis. Herein, a novel polar molecule with antiparallel columnar stacking is synthesized and further embedded into an F&#8208;2DP system to control over the crystallinity of F&#8208;2DP film through self&#8208;complementary &#960;&#8208;electronic forces. The donor&#8211;accepter&#8211;accepter&#8242;&#8211;donor&#8242; (D&#8211;A&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8242;) structure regulates the charge transportation efficiently, inducing multilevel memory behavior through stepwise charge capture and transfer processes. Thus, the device exhibits ternary memory behavior with low threshold voltage (Vth1 of 1.1&#160;V, Vth2 of 2.0&#160;V), clearly distinguishable resistance states (1:102:104) and ternary yield (83%). Furthermore, the stepwise formation of the charge complex endows the device with a wider range to regulate the conductive state, which allows its application in brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing. Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology recognition can reach an accuracy of 86%, showing great potential in neuromorphic computing applications in the post&#8208;Moore era.

         <title>Positively Charged Hollow Co Nanoshells by Kirkendall Effect Stabilized by Electron Sink for Alkaline Water Dissociation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow cobalt&#160;(Co) nanoshells are formed via the Kirkendall effect and stabilized by conductive MoO2 pillars and chainmail carbon as the electron sink. The Co particles are positively charged on the surface which accelerates&#160;the water dissociation and changes the rate&#8208;determining step from Volmer to Heyrovsky process.








Abstract
While cobalt (Co) exhibits a comparable energy barrier for H* adsorption/desorption to platinum in theory, it is generally not suitable for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of unfavorable water dissociation. Here, the Kirkendall effect is adopted to fabricate positive&#8208;charged hollow metal Co (PHCo) nanoshells that are stabilized by MoO2 and chainmail carbon as the electron sink. Compared to the zero&#8208;valent Co, the PHCo accelerates the water dissociation and changes the rate&#8208;determining step from Volmer to Heyrovsky process. Alkaline HER occurs with a low overpotential of 59.0&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Operando Raman and first principles calculations reveal that the interfacial water to the PHCo sites and the accelerated proton transfer are conducive to the adsorption and dissociation of H2O molecules. Meanwhile, the upshifted d&#8208;band center of PHCo optimizes the adsorption/desorption of H*. This work provides a unique synthesis of hollow Co nanoshells via the Kirkendall effect and insights to water dissociation on catalyst surfaces with tailored charge states.

         <title>Unveiling Gating Behavior in Piezoionic Effect: toward Neuromimetic Tactile Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoionic hydrogels hold the potential to enable direct ionic gating of transistors. This research reveals that these hydrogels can exhibit gating behavior in response to mechanical stimuli, an analog to the mechanically gated phenomena observed in biological neurons. This breakthrough not only advances neuromimetic pressure sensors but also enhances fundamental understanding of the piezoionic mechanism.








Abstract
The human perception system's information processing is intricately linked to the nonlinear response and gating effect of neurons. While piezoionics holds potential in emulating the pressure sensing capability of biological skin, the incorporation of information processing functions seems neglected. Here, ionic gating behavior in piezoionic hydrogels is uncovered as a notable extension beyond the previously observed linear responses. The hydrogel can generate remarkably high voltages (700&#160;mV) and currents (7&#160;mA) when indentation forces surpass the threshold. Through a comprehensive analysis involving simulations and experimental investigations, it is proposed that the gating behavior emerges due to significant diffusion differences between cations and anions. To showcase the practical implications of this breakthrough, the piezoionic hydrogels are successfully integrated with prostheses and robot hands, demonstrating that the gating effect enables accurate discrimination between gentle and harsh touch. The advancement in neuromimetic tactile sensing has significant potential for emerging applications such as humanoid robotics and biomedical engineering, offering valuable opportunities for further development of embodied neuromorphic intelligence.

         <title>Breaking the Saturation of Sensitivity for Ultrawide Range Flexible Pressure Sensors by Soft&#8208;Strain Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for pressure sensing is demonstrated for breaking through the saturation of electrical responses and sensitivity. The strain&#8208;effect&#8208;based pressure sensors can generate increased resistance changes with tensile strain of conductive films over an overwide linear detection range (over 1.5 MPa), and obtain unsaturated electrical response changes&#160;over 100% (from 5.22&#8211;70 MPa&#8722;1).








Abstract
The flexible pressure sensors with a broad pressure range and unsaturated sensitivity are highly desired in practical applications. However, pressure sensors by piezoresistive effect are always limited by the compressibility of sensing layers, resulting in a theoretically decreasing sensitivity of less than 100%. Here, a unique strategy is proposed that utilizes the strain effect, simultaneously achieving a trade&#8208;off between a wider pressure detection range and unsaturated sensitivity. Ascribed to the strain effect of sensing layers induced by interlaced microdomes, the sensors possess an increased sensitivity (5.22&#8211;70 MPa&#8722;1) over an ultrawide pressure range (45 Pa&#8211;4.1 MPa), a high&#8208;pressure resolution (5 Pa), fast response/recovery time (30/45 ms), and a robust response under a high&#8208;pressure loading of 3.5 MPa for more than 5000 cycles. These superior sensing performances allow the sensor to monitor large pressure. The flexible pressure sensor array can assist doctors in restoring the neutral mechanical axis, tracking knee flexion angles, and extracting gait features. Moreover, the flexible sensing array can be integrated into the joint motion surveillance system to map the balance medial&#8211;lateral contact forces on the metal compartments in real time, demonstrating the potential for further development into precise medical human&#8211;machine interfaces during total knee replacement surgery.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Performance Thermochromic Polymers via a Solid&#8208;solid Phase Transition Mechanism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lightly cross&#8208;linked alkyl acrylates can function as thermochromic materials with ultrahigh transparency and solar&#8208;modulating abilities via a crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous polymer transition. When used as greenhouse materials or coupled with thermoelectric devices, the thermochromic layer is able to function as a thermal valve.








Abstract
Thermochromic materials are substances that change color in response to temperature variations. Today, sustainability concerns are the main drivers of thermochromic research, with smart, energy&#8208;efficient windows being one of the primary applications. While vanadium oxides and leuco dyes are traditionally the main thermochromic materials, hydrogels operating based on change of solvation have risen as some of the most promising materials due to their high optical transparency and good solar modulating abilities. In this work, a distinct mechanism for thermochromism arising from the crystalline solid to amorphous solid polymer transition, with a corresponding transition from an opaque state to a transparent state is disclosed. Both ultra&#8208;high optical transparency (Tlum up to 99%) and ultra&#8208;high solar modulation (&#916;Tsolar up to 87%) are observed. The transition temperature is tunable from 11 to 61&#160;&#176;C by tuning the polymer structure. When incorporated into applications such as greenhouse materials and thermoelectric devices, significant performance enhancement is observed, due to the thermochromic material functioning as a thermal valve, speeding up solar heat absorbance while inhibiting the cooling process via its phase transition.

         <title>A Universal Biocompatible and Multifunctional Solid Electrolyte in p&#8208;Type and n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Complementary Circuits and Bioelectronic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and biocompatible, highly stretchable, flexible, self&#8208;healable gelatin&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte for bioelectronic applications is introduced. This nonvolatile electrolyte demonstrates compatibility with a wide range of both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels for organic electrochemical transistors while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. They are further used in circuits and for sensing physiological signals.








Abstract
The development of soft and flexible devices for collection of bioelectrical signals is gaining momentum for wearable and implantable applications. Among these devices, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) stand out due to their low operating voltage and large signal amplification capable of transducing weak biological signals. While liquid electrolytes have demonstrated efficacy in OECTs, they limit its operating temperature and pose challenges for electronic packaging due to potential leakage. Conversely, solid electrolytes offer advantages such as mechanical flexibility, robustness against environmental factors, and ability to bridge the interface between rigid dry electronics systems and soft wet biological tissues. However, few systems have demonstrated generality and compatibility with a wide range of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs). This paper introduces a highly stretchable, flexible, biocompatible, self&#8208;healable gelatin&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte, compatible with both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type OMIEC channels while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. Furthermore, this nonvolatile electrolyte is stable up to 120&#160;&#176;C and exhibits high ionic conductivity even in dry environment. Additionally, an OECT&#8208;based complementary inverter with a record&#8208;high normalized&#8208;gain of 228 V&#8722;1 and a corresponding ultralow static power consumption of 1 nW is demonstrated. These advancements pave the way for versatile applications ranging from bioelectronics to power&#8208;efficient implants.

         <title>Extracting Geometry and Topology of Orange Pericarps for the Design of Bioinspired Energy Absorbing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired material design method is presented to imitate the irregular structure of biological materials and obtain their outstanding mechanical properties. Rather than replicating the biological structure one&#8208;to&#8208;one, the method identifies distributions of fundamental building blocks and connectivity rules and generates synthetic equivalents with the same distributions. The method is demonstrated using the orange pericarp, known for protective, energy&#8208;absorbing capabilities.








Abstract
As a result of evolution, many biological materials have developed irregular structures that lead to outstanding mechanical performances, like high stiffness&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios and good energy absorption. However, reproducing these irregular biological structures in synthetic materials remains a complex design and fabrication challenge. Here, a bioinspired material design method is presented that characterizes the irregular structure as a network of building blocks, also known as tiles, and rules to connect them. Rather than replicating the biological structure one&#8208;to&#8208;one, synthetic materials are generated with the same distributions of tiles and connectivity rules as the biological material and it is shown that these equivalent materials have structure&#8208;to&#8208;property relationships similar to the biological ones. To demonstrate the method, the pericarp of the orange, a member of the citrus family known for its protective, energy&#8208;absorbing capabilities is studied. Polymer samples are generated and characterized under quasistatic and dynamic compression and display spatially&#8208;varying stiffness and good energy absorption, as seen in the biological materials. By quantifying which tiles and connectivity rules locally deform in response to loading, it is also determined how to spatially control the stiffness and energy absorption.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanostructures Grown from Reacting Droplet&#8208;In&#8208;Microwell Array on Flexible Films for Quantitative Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy in Plant Wearable In Situ Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micro&#8208;well structured plasmonic film with in situ grown dendritic Ag nanostructures is developed for plant wearable surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection. The film capitalizes on the concentration enrichment of analytes through droplet evaporation within the microwell, facilitating ultrasensitive detection. Additionally, this film offers dual&#8208;sided detection and allows for multiplexed identification of target analytes, expanding its utility in precision agriculture, bio&#8208;sensing, and environmental surveillance.








Abstract
Plant wearable detection has garnered significant interest in advancing agricultural intelligence and promoting sustainable food production amidst the challenges of climate change. Accurately monitoring plant health and agrochemical residue levels necessitates qualities such as precision, affordability, simplicity, and noninvasiveness. Here, a novel attachable plasmonic film is introduced and designed for on&#8208;site detection of agrochemical residues utilizing surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). By functionalizing a thin polydimethylsiloxane film with silver nanoparticles via controlled droplet reactions in micro&#8208;well arrays, a plasmonic film is achieved that not only maintains optical transparency for precise analyte localization but also conforms closely to the plant surface, facilitating highly sensitive SERS measurements. The reliability of this film enables accurate identification and quantification of individual compounds and their mixtures, boasting an ultra&#8208;low detection limit ranging from 10&#8722;16 to 10&#8722;13 m, with mini mal relative standard deviation. To showcase its potential, on&#8208;field detection of pesticide residues on fruit surfaces is conducted using a handheld Raman spectrometer. This advancement in fabricating plasmonic nanostructures on flexible films holds promise for expanding SERS applications beyond plant monitoring, including personalized health monitoring, point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis, wearable devices for human&#8211;machine interface, and on&#8208;site monitoring of environmental&#160;pollutants.

         <title>Manipulating Alkyl Inner Side Chain of Acceptor for Efficient As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulating the alkyl inner side chain of the small molecule acceptors assists in regulating molecular bandgap, energy levels, and intermolecular interaction, which is conducive to optimizing the trade&#8208;off among short&#8208;circuit current density, open&#8208;circuit voltage, and fill factor. Consequently, the optimal as&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver top&#8208;ranked efficiencies of over 18%.








Abstract
As&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) possess tremendous potential for low&#8208;cost commercial applications. Herein, five small&#8208;molecule acceptors (A1&#8211;A5) are designed and synthesized by selectively and elaborately extending the alkyl inner side chain flanking on the pyrrole motif to prepare efficient as&#8208;cast devices. As the extension of the alkyl chain, the absorption spectra of the films are gradually blue&#8208;shifted from A1 to A5 along with slightly uplifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, which is conducive for optimizing the trade&#8208;off between short&#8208;circuit current density and open&#8208;circuit voltage of the devices. Moreover, a longer alkyl chain improves compatibility between the acceptor and donor. The in situ technique clarifies that good compatibility will prolong molecular assembly time and assist in the preferential formation of the donor phase, where the acceptor precipitates in the framework formed by the donor. The corresponding film&#8208;formation dynamics facilitate the realization of favorable film morphology with a suitable fibrillar structure, molecular stacking, and vertical phase separation, resulting in an incremental fill factor from A1 to A5&#8208;based devices. Consequently, the A3&#8208;based as&#8208;cast OSCs achieve a top&#8208;ranked efficiency of 18.29%. This work proposes an ingenious strategy to manipulate intermolecular interactions and control the film&#8208;formation process for constructing high&#8208;performance as&#8208;cast devices.

         <dc:description>
New monomers capable of frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization are identified through computational screening of thermostability and ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization exotherms. Subsequent experimental validation of physical properties of monomers, kinetics, and material properties reveal frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization viability and promise in enabling energy&#8208;efficient manufacturing of 3D printed structures and gradient materials.








Abstract
Frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) presents an energy&#8208;efficient approach to produce high&#8208;performance polymers, typically utilizing norbornene derivatives from Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. This study broadens the monomer repertoire for FROMP, incorporating the cycloaddition product of biosourced furan compounds and benzyne, namely 1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;epoxynaphthalene (HEN) derivatives. A computational screening of Diels&#8211;Alder products is conducted, selecting products with resistance to retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder but also sufficient ring strain to facilitate FROMP. The experiments reveal that varying substituents both modulate the FROMP kinetics and enable the creation of thermoplastic materials characterized by different thermomechanical properties. Moreover, HEN&#8208;based crosslinkers are designed to enhance the resulting thermomechanical properties at high temperatures (&gt;200&#160;&#176;C). The versatility of such materials is demonstrated through direct ink writing (DIW) to rapidly produce 3D structures without the need for printed supports. This research significantly extends the range of monomers suitable for FROMP, furthering efficient production of high&#8208;performance polymeric materials.

         <title>Complementary Multisite Turnover Catalysis toward Superefficient Bifunctional Seawater Splitting at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional non&#8208;noble electrocatalyst is in situ constructed on metallic nickel nitride surface with multilevel collaborative interfaces and abundant multifunctional trimetal sites for seawater electrolysis, in which interfacial Mo sites are responsible for hydrogen evolution, while Co/Fe species facilitate oxygen evolution kinetics, thus cooperatively expediting bifunctional freshwater/seawater splitting at 1000 mA cm&#8208;2 with low cell voltages of 1.65/1.69 V, outperforming most of the ever&#8208;reported non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The utilization of seawater for hydrogen production via water splitting is increasingly recognized as a promising avenue for the future. The key dilemma for seawater electrolysis is the incompatibility of superior hydrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;evolving activities at ampere&#8208;scale current densities for both cathodic and anodic catalysts, thus leading to large electric power consumption of overall seawater splitting. Here, in situ construction of Fe4N/Co3N/MoO2 heterostructure arrays anchoring on metallic nickel nitride surface with multilevel collaborative catalytic interfaces and abundant multifunctional metal sites is reported, which serves as a robust bifunctional catalyst for alkaline freshwater/seawater splitting at ampere&#8208;level current density. Operando Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies combined with density functional theory calculations corroborate that Mo and Co/Fe sites situated on the Fe4N/Co3N/MoO2 multilevel interfaces optimize the reaction pathway and coordination environment to enhance water adsorption/dissociation, hydrogen adsorption, and oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate adsorption, thus cooperatively expediting hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions in base. Inspiringly, this electrocatalyst can substantially ameliorate overall freshwater/seawater splitting at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with low cell voltages of 1.65/1.69&#160;V, along with superb long&#8208;term stability at 500&#8211;1500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 200 h, outperforming nearly all the ever&#8208;reported non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts for freshwater/seawater electrolysis. This work offers a viable approach to design high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts for seawater splitting.

         <dc:description>
To advance high&#8208;quality imaging units in optoelectronic systems, a phototransistor that shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics is reported. Thanks to the programmable two&#8208;dimensional electron gas which can be modulated by drain/gate voltage inputs under different light exposure, a triplex photo&#8208;imaging functionality with capable of self&#8208;powering, photoconduction, and photo&#8208;synaptic operation is achieved, providing guidance toward system&#8208;on&#8208;chip photoelectric systems.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality imaging units are indispensable in modern optoelectronic systems for accurate recognition and processing of optical information. To fulfill massive and complex imaging tasks in the digital age, devices with remarkable photoresponsive characteristics and versatile reconfigurable functions on a single&#8208;device platform are in demand but remain challenging to fabricate. Herein, an AlGaN/GaN&#8208;based double&#8208;heterostructure is reported, incorporated with a unique compositionally graded AlGaN structure to generate a channel of polarization&#8208;induced two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEGs). Owing to the programmable feature of the 2DEGs by the combined gate and drain voltage inputs, with a particular capability of electron separation, collection and storage under different light illumination, the phototransistor shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics. A self&#8208;powered mode with a responsivity over 100&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and a photoconductive mode with a responsivity of &#8776;108&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 are achieved, with the ultimate demonstration of a 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10 device array for imaging. More intriguingly, the device can be switched to photoelectric synapse mode, emulating synaptic functions to denoise the imaging process while prolonging the image storage ability. The demonstration of three&#8208;in&#8208;one operational characteristics in a single device offers a new path toward future integrated and multifunctional imaging units.

         <title>Colossal Near&#8208;Field Radiative Heat Transfer Mediated by Coupled Polaritons with an Ultrahigh Dynamic Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;area device near&#8208;field thermal radiation measurement system with in situ adjustable vacuum gap distances down to &lt;100&#160;nm is successfully established. The radiative thermal conductance and effective gap heat transfer coefficient of near&#8208;field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) can reach unprecedented values with the help of coupled polaritons. The dynamic regulation of NFRHT can be achieved by modulating the strong coupling effect.








Abstract
Near&#8208;field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) can exceed the blackbody limit by several orders of magnitude owing to the tunneling evanescent waves. Exploiting this near&#8208;field enhancement holds significant potential for emerging technologies. It has been suggested that coupled polaritons can give rise to orders of magnitude enhancement of NFRHT. However, a thorough experimental verification of this phenomenon is still missing. Here this work experimentally shows that NFRHT mediated by coupled polaritons in millimeter&#8208;size graphene/SiC/SiO2 composite devices in planar plate configuration can realize about 302.8 &#177; &#8197;35.2&#8208;fold enhancement with respect to the blackbody limit at a gap distance of 87&#8197; &#177; &#8197;0.8&#160;nm. The radiative thermal conductance and effective gap heat transfer coefficient can reach unprecedented values of 0.136 WK&#8722;1 and 5440 Wm&#8722;2K&#8722;1. Additionally, a scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical measurement, in conjunction with full&#8208;wave numerical simulations, provides further evidence for the coupled polaritonic characteristics of the devices. Notably, this work experimentally demonstrates dynamic regulation of NFRHT can be achieved by modulating the bias voltage, leading to an ultrahigh dynamic range of &#8776;4.115. This work ambiguously elucidates the important role of coupled polaritons in NFRHT, paving the way for the manipulation of nanoscale heat transport, energy conversion, and thermal computing via the strong coupling effect.

Lactate has emerged as a critical immunosuppressive factor within the tumor microenvironment, greatly impeding the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Hence, depriving lactate provides a favorable strategy to reprogram tumor immune microenvironment (TIM). This research suggests that LAB&#8208;1 is capable of colonizing TIM and sustaining a long&#8208;term reduction in lactate concentration. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that lactate metabolism efficiently reprograms TIM.








Abstract
The elevated levels of lactate in tumor tissue play a pivotal role in fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, efficiently reducing lactate levels to reprogram tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) is considered a crucial step for boosted immunotherapy. Here, a high&#8208;lactate&#8208;metabolizing photosynthetic bacteria (LAB&#8208;1) is selectively screened for TIM reprogramming, which then improves the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. The culture medium for LAB&#8208;1 screening is initially developed through an orthogonal experiment, simulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and utilizing lactate as the sole organic carbon source. As demonstrated in a murine 4T1 model, LAB&#8208;1 colonizes the TME selectively, resulting in a significant reduction in lactate levels and a subsequent increase in pH values within the tumor tissue. Furthermore, single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that LAB&#8208;1 effectively reprograms the TIM, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of antitumor immune therapy. This approach of utilizing lactate&#8208;consuming bacteria represents a potent tool for augmenting tumor immunotherapy efficiency.

An innovative dual&#8208;engineered macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (Du&#8208;EMME) is developed for safe lung metastatic delivery of antitumor bacteria. After administration, strain&#8208;loaded engineered macrophages can be actively enriched toward tumors. This strategy enhances the biocompatibility of microbial therapies while achieving efficient enrichment of the strains in the tumor. The proliferated intratumoral engineered strains activate the tumor microenvironment, achieving potent anticancer effects.








Abstract
Lung metastases are the leading cause of death among cancer patients. The challenges of inefficient drug delivery, compounded by a robust immunosuppressive microenvironment, make effective treatment difficult. Here, an innovative dual&#8208;engineered macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (Du&#8208;EMME) therapy is developed that integrates modified macrophages and engineered antitumor bacteria. These engineered macrophages, termed R&#8208;GEM cells, are designed to express RGD peptides on extracellular membranes, enhancing their tumor cell binding and intratumor enrichment. R&#8208;GEM cells are cocultured with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009, producing macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (R&#8208;GEM/VNP cells). The intracellular bacteria maintain bioactivity for more than 24&#160;h, and the bacteria released from R&#8208;GEM/VNP cells within the tumor continue to exert bacteria&#8208;mediated antitumor effects. This is further supported by macrophage&#8208;based chemotaxis and camouflage, which enhance the intratumoral enrichment and biocompatibility of the bacteria. Additionally, R&#8208;GEM cells loaded with IFN&#947;&#8208;secreting strains (VNP&#8208;IFN&#947;) form R&#8208;GEM/VNP&#8208;IFN&#947; cells. Treatment with these cells effectively halts lung metastatic tumor progression in three mouse models (breast cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer). R&#8208;GEM/VNP&#8208;IFN&#947; cells vigorously activate the tumor microenvironment, suppressing tumor&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;type macrophages, MDSCs, and Tregs, and enhancing tumor&#8208;antagonizing M1&#8208;type macrophages, mature DCs, and Teffs. Du&#8208;EMME therapy offers a promising strategy for targeted and enhanced antitumor immunity in treating cancer metastases.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Polymyxin Mitigates Cytotoxicity and Reverses Drug Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (RISA) is presented in the aqueous solution of antibiotics and adjuvants via dynamic covalent bonding. The resulting assemblies via RISA effectively mask the positive charge of polymyxins, preventing their interaction with negatively charged mammalian cells and reducing potential cytotoxicity, enhancing the bactericidal efficacy of polymyxins and preventing the emergence of further resistance.








Abstract
Polymyxins have been regarded as an efficient therapeutic against many life&#8208;threatening, multidrug resistant Gram&#8208;negative bacterial infections; however, the cytotoxicity and emergence of drug resistance associated with polymyxins have greatly hindered their clinical potential. Herein, the reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (RISA) of polymyxins and natural aldehydes in aqueous solution is presented. The resulting assemblies effectively mask the positively charged nature of polymyxins, reducing their cytotoxicity. Moreover, the representative PMBA4 (composed of polymyxin B (PMB) and (E)&#8208;2&#8208;heptenal (A4)) assemblies demonstrate enhanced binding to Gram&#8208;negative bacterial outer membranes and exhibit multiple antimicrobial mechanisms, including increased membrane permeability, elevated bacterial metabolism, suppression of quorum sensing, reduced ATP synthesis, and potential reduction of bacterial drug resistance. Remarkably, PMBA4 assemblies reverse drug resistance in clinically isolated drug&#8208;resistant strains of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, demonstrating exceptional efficacy in preventing and eradicating bacterial biofilms. PMBA4 assemblies efficiently eradicate Gram&#8208;negative bacterial biofilm infections in vivo and alleviate inflammatory response. This RISA strategy offers a practical and clinically applicable approach to minimize side effects, reverse drug resistance, and prevent the emergence of resistance associated with free polymyxins.

         <title>Suppressed Defects by Functional Thermally Cross&#8208;Linked Fullerene for High&#8208;Efficiency Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed tin&#8208;lead&#8208;based perovskite solar cells with ideal bandgap (1.2 eV) develop rapidly, while the top interface defects and Sn oxidation cannot be solved simultaneously. It is found cross&#8208;linkable [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric styryl dendron ester (C&#8208;PCBSD) can coordinate with perovskite and optimize the interface and bulk of perovskite. This work demonstrates the optimization effect of C&#8208;PCBSD on perovskite interface and bulk.








Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites have attracted the attention of the community due to their narrow bandgap, ideal for photovoltaic applications, especially tandem solar cells. However, the oxidation and rapid crystallization of Sn2+ and the interfacial traps hinder their development. Here, cross&#8208;linkable [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric styryl dendron ester (C&#8208;PCBSD) is introduced during the quenching step of perovskite thin film processing to suppress the generation of surface defects at the electron transport layer interface and improve the bulk crystallinity. The C&#8208;PCBSD has strong coordination ability with Sn2+ and Pb2+ perovskite precursors, which retards the crystallization process, suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+, and improves the perovskite bulk and surface crystallinity, yielding films with reduced nonradiative recombination and enhanced interface charge extraction. Besides, the C&#8208;PCBSD network deposited on the perovskite surface displays superior hydrophobicity and oxygen resistance. Consequently, the devices with C&#8208;PCBSD obtain PCEs of up to 23.4% and retained 97% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of storage in a N2 atmosphere.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Magnet&#8208;Free Spin Generation in a Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates creation of polarized electron spins in n&#8208;GaAs via the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in nonmagnetic chiral molecular junctions. Spin accumulation in n&#8208;GaAs resulting from a charge current from a gold electrode through chiral molecules is evidenced by observation of the Hanle effect. The experiment points to a new scheme of fully nonmagnetic semiconductor spintronics. 








Abstract
Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors (SCs) are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in SCs is frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet (FM), there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), the efficient creation of spin accumulation in n&#8208;doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) of chiral molecules (&#945;&#8208;helix l&#8208;polyalanine, AHPA&#8208;L), is demonstrated. The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the n&#8208;GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality&#8208;induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional SC. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet&#8208;free SC spintronics.

&lt;p&gt;This work demonstrates creation of polarized electron spins in n-GaAs via the chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in nonmagnetic chiral molecular junctions. Spin accumulation in n-GaAs resulting from a charge current from a gold electrode through chiral molecules is evidenced by observation of the Hanle effect. The experiment points to a new scheme of fully nonmagnetic semiconductor spintronics. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors (SCs) are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in SCs is frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet (FM), there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), the efficient creation of spin accumulation in &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of chiral molecules (&#945;-helix &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-polyalanine, AHPA-L), is demonstrated. The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality-induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional SC. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet-free SC spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bipolar Textile Composite Electrodes Enabling Flexible Tandem Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipolar textile composite electrode (BTCE) is fabricated by sandwiching the nickel&#8208;coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric (NiPET) with the cathode and Li metal anode layers. The energy density of BTCE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries increases significantly. More impressively, benefiting from the outstanding flexibility of BTCE, the pouch cell shows zero capacity decay under thousands of bending and folding tests.








Abstract
A majority of flexible and wearable electronics require high operational voltage that is conventionally achieved by serial connection of battery unit cells using external wires. However, this inevitably decreases the energy density of the battery module and may cause additional safety hazards. Herein, a bipolar textile composite electrode (BTCE) that enables internal tandem&#8208;stacking configuration to yield high&#8208;voltage (6 to 12&#160;V class) solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) is reported. BTCE is comprised of a nickel&#8208;coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric (NiPET) core layer, a cathode coated on one side of the NiPET, and a Li metal anode coated on the other side of the NiPET. Stacking BTCEs with solid&#8208;state electrolytes alternatively leads to the extension of output voltage and decreased usage of inert package materials, which in turn significantly boosts the energy density of the battery. More importantly, the BTCE&#8208;based SSLMB possesses remarkable capacity retention per cycle of over 99.98% over cycling. The composite structure of BTCE also enables outstanding flexibility; the battery keeps stable charge/discharge characteristics over thousands of bending and folding. BTCE shows great promise for future safe, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, and flexible SSLMBs for a wide range of flexible and wearable electronics.

         <title>Retinomorphic Color Perception Based on Opponent Process Enabled by Perovskite Bipolar Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual perovskite absorber device in an antagonistic configuration is capable of generate bipolar responses with colors from the opponent pairs. Two variants (red&#8208;green and yellow&#8208;blue opponents) are fabricated, and filter&#8208;free machine color vision with high contrasts is demonstrated. The adaptation capabilities of the perovskite photodetector also ensure accurate color perception in different lighting conditions.








Abstract
The ability to perceive color by the retina can be attributed to both its trichromatic photoreceptors and the antagonistic neural wiring known as the opponent process. While neuromorphic sensors have been shown to demonstrate memory and adaptation capabilities, color perception is still challenging due to the intrinsic lack of spectral selectivity in narrow bandgap semiconductors. Furthermore, research on emulating neural wiring is severely lacking. The combination of halide perovskite materials with a tunable bandgap and a novel bipolar photodetector design emulates the efficiency of the retina in processing color information. The stimuli&#8208;responsive material is also responsible for maintaining partial color constancy&#8212;an adaptation feature. Leveraging the unique enhancement of color contrasts, an in&#8208;sensor data compression and edge detection can also be demonstrated. The color perception, chromatic adaptation, and color contrast enhancement make perovskite bipolar photodetectors a unique example where the sensor and neural wiring can be co&#8208;developed in conjunction.

         <title>Tough Supramolecular Hydrogels Crafted via Lignin&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular hydrogel forms by diffusing lignosulfonate sodium (LS) into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution, creating high&#8208;density crystalline domains and networks. This enhances mechanical properties (tensile strength: &#8776;20 Mpa, Young's modulus: &#8776;14 Mpa, toughness: &#8776;50 MJ&#160;m&#8315;3) and provides low&#8208;temperature stability (&lt;&#8208;60&#160;&#176;C), antibacterial, and UV&#8208;blocking (&#8776;100%). 









Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels are typically assembled through weak non&#8208;covalent interactions, posing a significant challenge in achieving ultra strength. Developing a higher strength based on molecular/nanoscale engineering concepts is a potential improvement strategy. Herein, a super&#8208;tough supramolecular hydrogel is assembled by gradually diffusing lignosulfonate sodium (LS) into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution. Both simulations and analytical results indicate that the assembly and subsequent enhancement of the crosslinked network are primarily attributed to LS&#8208;induced formation and gradual densification of strong crystalline domains within the hydrogel. The optimized hydrogel exhibits impressive mechanical properties with tensile strength of &#8776;20&#160;MPa, Young's modulus of &#8776;14&#160;MPa, and toughness of &#8776;50&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8315;3, making it the strongest lignin&#8208;PVA/polymer hydrogel known so far. Moreover, LS provides the supramolecular hydrogel with excellent low&#8208;temperature stability (&lt;&#8208;60&#160;&#176;C), antibacterial, and UV&#8208;blocking capability (&#8776;100%). Interestingly, the diffusion ability of LS is demonstrated for self&#8208;restructuring damaged supramolecular hydrogel, achieving 3D patterning on hydrogel surfaces, and enhancing the local strength of the freeze&#8208;thaw PVA hydrogel. The goal is to foster a versatile hydrogel platform by combining eco&#8208;friendly LS with biocompatible PVA, paving the way for innovation and interdisciplinarity in biomedicine, engineering materials, and forestry science.

         <title>Biometabolically Derived Selenium Nanoparticles Armed with Protein Protective Suit toward High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;Se Batteries</title>

&#8220;Functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; bio&#8208;selenium nanoparticles are developed by Bacillus subtilis subsp.&#8217;s microbial metabolism process from toxic selenite (SeO32&#8722;), in which selenium nanoparticles are tightly encased in a natural biomembrane with rich functional groups containing nitrogen and phosphorus that effectively suppress shuttle effect and alleviate volume expansion, achieving superior electrochemical and structural stability.








Abstract
Selenium (Se) serves as a burgeoning high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of Se cathode is strictly limited by low Se utilization and inferior cycling stability arising from intrinsic volume expansion and notorious shuttle effect. Herein, a microbial metabolism strategy is developed to prepare &#8220;functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; Se globules via Bacillus subtilis subsp. from selenite in sewage, in which Se nanoparticles are armed with a natural biological protein membrane with rich nitrogen and phosphorus, achieving the eco&#8208;efficient conversion of trash into treasure (selenite, SeO32&#8722; &#8594; Selenium, Se). The appealing&#8208;design &#8220;functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; Se globules are beneficial to accommodate volume changes of Se in electrochemical reactions, confining polyselenides via chemisorption, and enhancing mechanical strength of electrode by associated bacteria debris, realizing comprehensive utilization of microorganism. By conceptualizing &#8220;functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; Se globules, rather than artificial Se&#8208;host composites, as cathode for lithium&#8211;selenium batteries, it exhibits outstanding cycling stability and improved rate performance. This strategy opens the door to design smart electrode materials with unattainable structure that cannot be achieved by traditional approaches, achieving eco&#8208;efficient conversion of pollutants into energy&#8208;storage nanomaterials, which will be a promising research field for interdisciplinary of energy, biology, and environment.

         <title>Optimizing Double&#8208;Fibril Network Morphology via Solid Additive Strategy Enables Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with 19.50% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;fibril network morphology (DFNM) is constructed and optimized in the all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) with the use of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene volatile solid additives. Through subtly modifying the alkoxy of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene additives, improved molecular packing and well&#8208;defined DFMN are simultaneously realized, leading to a record efficiency of 19.50% for all&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Double&#8208;fibril network morphology (DFNM), in which the donor and the acceptor can self&#8208;assemble into a double&#8208;fibril structure, is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport in organic solar cells. Herein, it is demonstrated that such DFNM can be constructed and optimized in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) with the assistance of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene volatile solid additives. It is revealed that the incorporation of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene can induce a stepwise regulation in the aggregation of donor and acceptor molecules during film casting and thermal annealing processes. Through altering the alkoxy of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene solid additives, both the intermolecular interactions and molecular miscibility with the host materials can be precisely tuned, which allows for the optimization of the molecular aggregation process and facilitation of molecular self&#8208;assembly, and thus leading to reinforced molecular packing and optimized DFNM. As a result, an unprecedented efficiency of 19.50% (certified as 19.1%) is obtained for 2&#8208;ethoxynaphthalene&#8208;processed PM6:PY&#8208;DT&#8208;X all&#8208;PSCs with excellent photostability (T80&#160;=&#160;1750&#160;h). This work reveals that the optimization of DFNM via solid additive strategy is a promising avenue to boosting the performance of all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>In&#8208;Sublattice Carrier Transition Enabled Polarimetric Photodetectors with Reconfigurable Polarity Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarization photodetector based on in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition in the CdSb2Se3Br2/WSe2 heterostructure, with a giant and reconfigurable PR value, is proposed. By changing the gate voltage, the device exhibits reconfigurable PR values from positive to negative, covering all possible numbers (1&#8594;+&#8734;/&#8722;&#8734;&#8594;&#8722;1). Moreover, gate&#8208;tunable polarimetric imaging is implemented. This work makes a conceptual advance in designing next&#8208;generation miniaturized highly polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronics.








Abstract
Miniaturized polarimetric photodetectors based on anisotropic two&#8208;dimensional&#160;materials attract potential applications in ultra&#8208;compact polarimeters. However, these photodetectors are hindered by the small polarization ratio values and complicated artificial structures. Here, a novel polarization photodetector based on in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition in the CdSb2Se3Br2/WSe2 heterostructure, with a giant and reconfigurable PR value, is demonstrated. The unique periodic sublattice structure of CdSb2Se3Br2 features an in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition preferred along Sb2Se3 chains. Leveraging on the in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition in the CdSb2Se3Br2/WSe2 heterostructure, gate voltage has an anisotropic modulation effect on the band alignment of heterostructure along sublattice. Consequently, the heterostructure exhibits a polarization&#8208;tunable photo&#8208;induced threshold voltage shift, which provides reconfigurable PR values from positive (unipolar regime) to negative (bipolar regime), covering all possible numbers (1&#8594;+&#8734;/&#8722;&#8734;&#8594;&#8722;1). Using this anisotropic photovoltaic effect, gate&#8208;tunable polarimetric imaging is successfully implemented. This work provides a new platform for developing next&#8208;generation highly polarimetric optoelectronics.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Direct Upcycling of Spent Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes into High&#8208;Voltage Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a closed&#8208;loop direct upcycling strategy that converts waste current collector debris into dopants is proposed, and a highly inclusive eutectic molten salt is utilized to repair highly degraded polycrystalline LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes while achieving single&#8208;crystallization transformation and introducing Al/Cu dual&#8208;doping. Consequently, upcycled materials can overcome the key challenges at high voltages: strain accumulation and lattice oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Facing the resource and environmental pressures brought by the retiring wave of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), direct recycling methods are considered to be the next generation's solution. However, the contradiction between limited battery life and the demand for rapidly iterating technology forces the direct recovery paradigm to shift toward &#8220;direct upcycling.&#8221; Herein, a closed&#8208;loop direct upcycling strategy that converts waste current collector debris into dopants is proposed, and a highly inclusive eutectic molten salt system is utilized to repair structural defects in degraded polycrystalline LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes while achieving single&#8208;crystallization transformation and introducing Al/Cu dual&#8208;doping. Upcycled materials can effectively overcome the two key challenges at high voltages: strain accumulation and lattice oxygen evolution. It exhibits comprehensive electrochemical performance far superior to commercial materials at 4.6&#160;V, especially its fast charging capability at 15&#160;C, and an impressive 91.1% capacity retention after 200 cycles in a 1.2&#160;Ah pouch cell. Importantly, this approach demonstrates broad applicability to various spent layered cathodes, particularly showcasing its value in the recycling of mixed spent cathodes. This work effectively bridges the gap between waste management and material performance enhancement, offering a sustainable path for the recycling of spent LIBs and the production of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage cathodes.

         <title>Liquid Gallium&#8208;Assisted Pyrolysis of MOF Affording CNT Non&#8208;Hollow Frameworks in High Yields for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid gallium&#8208;assisted pyrolysis and subsequent acid treatment are cleverly used to obtain a high yield of O&#8208;rich carbon nanotube (CNT) non&#8208;hollow framework (NOCNTF&#8208;15) at relatively low temperatures. Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and experimental results mutually confirm that the NOCNTF&#8208;15 is a high capacity and ultralong life anode for SIBs.








Abstract
Carbon materials have great potential for applications in energy, biology, and environment due to their excellent chemical and physical properties. Their preparation by carbonization methods encounters limitations and the carbon loss during pyrolysis in the form of gaseous molecules results in low yield of carbon materials. Herein a low&#8208;energy (600&#160;&#176;C) and high&#8208;yield (82&#160;wt.%) carbonization strategy is developed using liquid gallium&#8208;assisted pyrolysis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) affording the N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (CNT) non&#8208;hollow frameworks encapsulating Co nanoparticles. The liquid gallium layer offers protection against air, promotes heat transfer, and limits the escape of small carbonaceous gaseous molecules, which greatly improve the yields of the pyrolysis reaction. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic interaction between CNTs and N/O&#8208;containing groups gives a non&#8208;hollow framework composed of N/O&#8208;enriched and open CNTs (NOCNTF&#8208;15, 15 denotes the 15&#160;mm thickness of the liquid gallium layer during the pyrolysis) with high specific capacity (185&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;stable cyclability (stable operation at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and 50&#160;&#176;C for 20&#160;000 cycles). This study provides a unique approach to carbonization that facilitates the practical application of low&#8208;cost CNTs and other MOFs&#8208;derived carbon materials in high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs).

Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic interaction between CNTs and N/O-containing groups gives a non-hollow framework composed of N/O-enriched and open CNTs (NOCNTF-15, 15 denotes the 15&#160;mm thickness of the liquid gallium layer during the pyrolysis) with high specific capacity (185&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and ultra-stable cyclability (stable operation at 10&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 50&#160;&#176;C for 20&#160;000 cycles). This study provides a unique approach to carbonization that facilitates the practical application of low-cost CNTs and other MOFs-derived carbon materials in high-performance sodium-ion batteries (SIBs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In situ Blending For Co&#8208;Deposition of Electron Transport and Perovskite Layers Enables Over 24% Efficiency Stable Conventional Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron transport layer (ETL) materials have been rationally designed for in situ blending to co&#8208;deposit ETL and light&#8208;absorbing layers simultaneously in conventional perovskite solar cells. Such a strategy significantly improves the qualities of perovskite growth and buried interface to improve charge transport/collection. A record high power conversion efficiency over 24% is achieved for organic ETLs based devices.








Abstract
Simplifying the manufacturing processes of multilayered high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is yet of vital importance for their cost&#8208;effective production. Herein, an in situ blending strategy is presented for co&#8208;deposition of electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite absorber by incorporating (3&#8208;(7&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetraoxo&#8208;3,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo&#8208; [lmn][3,8]phenanthrolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;yl)propyl)phosphonic acid (NDP) into the perovskite precursor solutions. The phosphonic acid&#8208;like anchoring group coupled with its large molecular size drives the migration of NDP toward indium tin oxide (ITO) surface to form a distinct ETL during perovskite film forming. This strategy circumvents the critical wetting issue and simultaneously improves the interfacial charge collection efficiencies. Consequently, n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs based on in situ blended NDP achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.01%, which is one of the highest values for PSCs using organic ETLs. This performance is notably higher than that of ETL&#8208;free (21.19%) and independently spin&#8208;coated (21.42%) counterparts. More encouragingly, the in situ blending strategy dramatically enhances the device stability under harsh conditions by retaining over 90% of initial efficiencies after 250&#160;h in 100&#160;&#176;C or 65% humidity storage. Moreover, this strategy is universally adaptable to various perovskite compositions, device architectures, and electron transport materials (ETMs), showing great potential for applications in diverse optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Reverse Hydrogen Spillover on Metal Oxides for Water&#8208;Promoted Catalytic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this work unravels the water&#8208;effected mechanisms on the metal oxide surface during ethanol oxidation reactions through various in situ surface sensitive spectroscopies: i) the competitive adsorption of water&#8208;dissociated *OH species with O2 at Sn active sites leads to water poisoning; ii) the proton&#8208;induced active *OOH species, achieved by accelerated reverse hydrogen spillover among metal oxides, enhances water&#8208;promoted functionality.








Abstract
Understanding the water&#8208;involved mechanism on metal oxide surface and the dynamic interaction of water with active sites is crucial in solving water poisoning in catalytic reactions. Herein, this work solves this problem by designing the water&#8208;promoted function of metal oxides in the ethanol oxidation reaction. In situ multimodal spectroscopies unveil that the competitive adsorption of water&#8208;dissociated *OH species with O2 at Sn active sites results in water poisoning and the sluggish proton transfer in CoO&#8208;SnO2 imparts water&#8208;resistant effect. Carbon material as electron donor and proton transport channel optimizes the Co active sites and expedites the reverse hydrogen spillover from CoO to SnO2. The water&#8208;promoted function arises from spillover protons facilitating O2 activation on the SnO2 surface, leading to crucial *OOH intermediate formation for catalyzing C&#8208;H and C&#8208;C cleavage. Consequently, the tailored CoO&#8208;C&#8208;SnO2 showcases a remarkable 60&#8208;fold enhancement in ethanol oxidation reaction compared to bare SnO2 under high&#8208;humidity conditions.

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Capacity Cathode Presodiation Agent Via Triggering Anionic Oxidation Activity in Sodium Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely implanting Ni into specific Li sites within the Na2O framework tunes band structures, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion and accelerating the decomposition kinetics of Na2O. It can serve as a cathode presodiation agent to compensate for the irreversible sodium loss during the initial cycling; thus, enhancing the energy density of practical Na&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cells.








Abstract
Compensating for the irreversible loss of limited active sodium (Na) is crucial for enhancing the energy density of practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) full&#8208;cell, especially when employing hard carbon anode with initially lower coulombic efficiency. Introducing sacrificial cathode presodiation agents, particularly those that own potential anionic oxidation activity with a high theoretical capacity, can provide additional sodium sources for compensating Na loss. Herein, Ni atoms are precisely implanted at the Na sites within Na2O framework, obtaining a (Na0.89Ni0.05&#9633;0.06)2O (Ni&#8211;Na2O) presodiation agent. The synergistic interaction between Na vacancies and Ni catalyst effectively tunes the band structure, forming moderate Ni&#8211;O covalent bonds, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion, reducing the decomposition overpotential to 2.8&#160;V (vs Na/Na+), and achieving a high presodiation capacity of 710 mAh/g&#8776;Na2O (Na2O decomposition rate &gt;80%). Incorporating currently&#8208;modified presodiation agent with Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na2/3Ni2/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes, the energy density of corresponding Na&#8208;ion full&#8208;cells presents an essential improvement of 23.9% and 19.3%, respectively. Further, not limited to Ni&#8211;Na2O, the structure&#8211;function relationship between the anionic oxidation mechanism and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface fabrication is revealed as a paradigm for the development of sacrificial cathode presodiation agent.

         <title>Homogeneous Fluorine Doping toward Highly Conductive and Stable Li10GeP2S12 Solid Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;doped Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 possesses enhanced stability against moist air and lithium metal due to decreased H2O adsorption energy and formation energy of lithium vacancy, showing nearly one order of magnitude higher ionic conductivity than that of Li10GeP2S12 after air&#8208;exposure. The Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 monolayer solid electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries display improved cycling stability and rate capability.








Abstract
The unique structure and exceptionally high lithium ion conductivity over 10&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 of Li10GeP2S12 have gained extensive attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, its poor resistivity to moisture and chemical/electrochemical incompatibility with lithium metal severely impede its practical application. Herein, a fluorine functionalized Li10GeP2S12 is synthesized by stannous fluoride doping and employed as a monolayer solid electrolyte to realize stable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The atomic&#8208;scale mechanism underlying the impact of fluorine doping on both moisture and electrochemical stability of Li10GeP2S12 is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Fluorine surface doping significantly reduces surface hydrophilicity by electronic regulation, thereby retarding the hydrolysis reaction of Li10GeP2S12. After exposed to a relative humidity of 35%&#8211;40% for 20&#160;min, the ionic conductivity of Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 maintains as high as 2.21&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of Li10GeP2S12 with 0.31&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1. Meanwhile, bulk doping of highly electronegative fluorine promotes the formation of lithium vacancies in the Li10GeP2S12 system, thus allowing stable lithium plating/stripping in Li | Li symmetric batteries, boosting a critical current density reaching 2.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique structure and exceptionally high lithium ion conductivity over 10&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; of Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; have gained extensive attention in all-solid-state lithium batteries. However, its poor resistivity to moisture and chemical/electrochemical incompatibility with lithium metal severely impede its practical application. Herein, a fluorine functionalized Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is synthesized by stannous fluoride doping and employed as a monolayer solid electrolyte to realize stable all-solid-state lithium batteries. The atomic-scale mechanism underlying the impact of fluorine doping on both moisture and electrochemical stability of Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Fluorine surface doping significantly reduces surface hydrophilicity by electronic regulation, thereby retarding the hydrolysis reaction of Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. After exposed to a relative humidity of 35%&#8211;40% for 20&#160;min, the ionic conductivity of Li&lt;sub&gt;9.98&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;0.99&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.01&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;11.98&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;0.02&lt;/sub&gt; maintains as high as 2.21&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; with 0.31&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Meanwhile, bulk doping of highly electronegative fluorine promotes the formation of lithium vacancies in the Li&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;GeP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; system, thus allowing stable lithium plating/stripping in Li | Li symmetric batteries, boosting a critical current density reaching 2.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; | lithium all-solid-state batteries display improved cycling stability and rate capability, showing 80.1% retention after 600 cycles at 1C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

To obtain high&#8208;performance microwave absorption materials, designing structures has proved as a promising way. Herein, ultra&#8208;broadband multilayer bidirectional MXene/polyimide aerogel absorbers containing multi&#8208;structures ranging from the micro&#8208; to the macroscopic are produced with the aid of electric and temperature fields.

Abstract
To obtain high&#8208;performance electromagnetic microwave (EM) absorption materials with broad effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) and reduced thickness, designing structures has proved to be a promising way. Herein, ultra&#8208;broadband multilayer bidirectional MXene/polyimide EM absorption aerogels containing multi&#8208;structures on scales ranging from the micro&#8208; to the macroscale are produced with the aid of electric and temperature fields. On the microscale, under the action of electric force and temperature gradient, the ordered structures made of aligned Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets and the microscale layered aerogel walls enable the bidirectional aerogel to achieve a wide EAB of 8.58&#160;GHz at a thickness of 2.1&#160;mm. This is ascribed to the numerous aligned nanosheets and layered aerogel walls perpendicular to the incident EMs, facilitating the conversion of electromagnetic energy into electrical energy. Furthermore, on the macroscale, the multilayer bidirectional aerogel with non&#8208;gradient structures effectively resolves the conflict between impedance matching and energy loss, resulting in an ultrawide EAB of 9.41&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3&#160;mm. This innovative design of electric&#8208;field&#8208;assisted multilayer bidirectional aerogels with multiscale structural coupling may provide feasible and effective pathways for the development of advanced EM absorption materials.

         <title>Interstitial Boron Atoms in Pd Aerogel Selectively Switch the Pathway for Glycolic Acid Synthesis from Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdB alloy aerogel is synthesized as an anode catalyst for selective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion, achieving a peak mass activity of 6.71 A mgPd&#8722;1 and GA Faraday efficiency of 93.8%. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations uncover the ligand effect and oxophilicity enhancement originating from B incorporation synergistically regulate the adsorption and conversion of key intermediates, thereby allowing the highly effective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;reforming of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) into valuable chemicals is garnering significant attention as it opens a mild avenue for waste resource utilization. However, achieving high activity and selectivity for valuable C2 products during ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation in PET hydrolysate on Pd electrocatalysts remains challenging. The strong interaction between Pd and carbonyl (*CO) intermediates leads to undesirable over&#8208;oxidation and poisoning of Pd sites, which hinders the highly efficient C2 products production. Herein, a nonmetallic alloying strategy is employed to fabricate a Pd&#8208;boron alloy aerogel (PdB), wherein B atoms are induced to regulate the electron structure and surface oxophilicity. This approach allows a remarkable mass activity of 6.71 A mgPd&#8722;1, glycolic acid (GA) Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93.8%, and stable 100 h cyclic electrolysis. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal the contributions of B inserted in Pd lattice on highly effective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion. Interestingly, the heightened surface oxophilicity and regulated electronic structure by B incorporation weakened *CO intermediates adsorption and enhanced hydroxyl species affinity to accelerate oxidative *OH adspecies formation, thereby synergistically avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and boosting GA synthesis. This work provides valuable insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for GA synthesis via an oxophilic B motifs incorporation strategy.

         <title>Constructing Pd and Cu Crowding Single Atoms by Protein Confinement to Promote Sonogashira Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a convenient protein confinement strategy that tightly locates crowded&#160;Pd and Cu single atoms to promote the substrate activation and transmetallation in the Sonogashira reaction. These results provide important clues for the efficient construction of high&#8208;performance heterogeneous catalysts with multiple neighboring active centers and&#160;achieving valuable organic transformations cocatalyzed by multiple active centers.








Abstract
For multicenter&#8208;catalyzed reactions, it is important to accurately construct heterogeneous catalysts containing multiple active centers with high activity and low cost, which&#160;is more challenging compared to homogeneous catalysts because of the low activity and spatial confinement of active centers in the loaded state. Herein, a convenient protein confinement strategy is reported to locate Pd and Cu single atoms in crowding state on carbon coated alumina for promoting Sonogashira reaction, the most powerful method for constructing the acetylenic moiety in molecules. The single&#8208;atomic Pd and Cu centers take advantage in not only the maximized atomic utilization for low cost, but also the much&#8208;enhanced performance by facilitating the activation of aryl halides and alkynes. Their locally crowded dispersion brings them closer to each other, which facilitates the transmetallation process of acetylide intermediates between them. Thus, the Sonogashira reaction is drove smoothly by the obtained catalyst with a turnover frequency value of 313 h&#8722;1, much more efficiently than that by commercial Pd/C and CuI catalyst, conventional Pd and Cu nanocatalysts, and mixed Pd and Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst. The obtained catalyst also exhibits the outstanding durability in the recycling test.

         <title>Synchronous Switching Strategy to Enhance the Real&#8208;Time Powering and Charging Performance of Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synchronous switching strategy is developed to enhance the real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). It can improve the real&#8208;time powering performance of TENG for sensors to 5&#8211;7 times, comparable to a commercial constant voltage source; and make it possible to enhance the charging performance of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are of great significance as sustainable power sources that harvest energy from the human body and environment. Nevertheless, due to TENG's impedance&#8208;dependent output voltage characteristics, in traditional strategy (TS), real&#8208;timely powering a sensor with TENG has a poor sensing on/off ratio (or response), and directly charging a capacitor with TENG shows a low charging efficiency. This degraded real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of TENG compared to a commercial constant voltage source is a huge challenge of the TENG field for a long time. This work proposes a synchronous switching strategy (SSS) for TENG to real&#8208;timely power sensors or charge capacitors without degrading its performance.

&lt;p&gt;A synchronous switching strategy is developed to enhance the real-time powering and charging performance of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). It can improve the real-time powering performance of TENG for sensors to 5&#8211;7 times, comparable to a commercial constant voltage source; and make it possible to enhance the charging performance of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are of great significance as sustainable power sources that harvest energy from the human body and environment. Nevertheless, due to TENG's impedance-dependent output voltage characteristics, in traditional strategy (TS), real-timely powering a sensor with TENG has a poor sensing on/off ratio (or response), and directly charging a capacitor with TENG shows a low charging efficiency. This degraded real-time powering and charging performance of TENG compared to a commercial constant voltage source is a huge challenge of the TENG field for a long time. This work proposes a synchronous switching strategy (SSS) for TENG to real-timely power sensors or charge capacitors without degrading its performance. Compared with TS, this new strategy enables sensors to have 5&#8211;7 times sensing on/off ratio enhancement when using TENG as a power source, reaching the powering ability of a commercial constant voltage source, it makes the powering performance of TENG stable under different driving frequency, improving the powering robustness of TENG. In addition, compared with TS, SSS can also enhance the charging efficiency of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times when charging capacitors. This work contributes to real-timely powering or charging the distributed, mobile and wireless electronics using TENG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Adhesion&#8208;Controlled Heterogeneous Nucleation of Tin Halide Perovskites for Eco&#8208;Friendly Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of tin halide perovskites are regulated by incorporating CsF into the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer to adjust the adhesive strength of interfaces. As a result, FASnI2Br&#8211;CsF indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.12%. Ultimately, the utilization of tin halide perovskite IPVs to power radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors is successfully explored.








Abstract
The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has accelerated the advancement of indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) that directly power wireless IoT devices. The interest in lead&#8208;free perovskites for IPVs stems from their similar optoelectronic properties to high&#8208;performance lead halide perovskites, but without concerns about toxic lead leakage in indoor environments. However, currently prevalent lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs, especially tin halide perovskites (THPs), still exhibit inferior performance, arising from their uncontrollable crystallization. Here, a novel adhesive bonding strategy is proposed for precisely regulating heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of THPs by introducing alkali metal fluorides. These ionic adhesives boost the work of adhesion at the buried interface between substrates and perovskite film, subsequently reducing the contact angle and energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation, resulting in high&#8208;quality THP films. The resulting THP solar cells achieve an efficiency of 20.12% under indoor illumination at 1000 lux, exceeding all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs and successfully powering radio frequency identification&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Band Engineering of Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>

A ligand&#8208;induced energy level modulation of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) is reported for band engineering of PQD solids, which can form a gradient band structure within the PQD solids with substantially diminishes trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination, significantly promoting the charge transport within the PQD solids. Consequently, the band&#8208;engineered PQD solar cells give a remarkable efficiency of up to 16.44%.








Abstract
CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) shows high potential for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics due to their tunable surface chemistry, good solution&#8208;processability and unique photophysical properties. However, the remained long&#8208;chain ligand attached to the PQD surface significantly impedes the charge carrier transport within the PQD solids, thereby predominantly influencing the charge extraction of PQD solar cells (PQDSCs). Herein, a ligand&#8208;induced energy level modulation is reported for band engineering of PQD solids to improve the charge extraction of PQDSCs. Detailed theoretical calculations and systemic experimental studies are performed to comprehensively understand the photophysical properties of the PQD solids dominated by the surface ligands of PQDs. The results reveal that 4&#8208;nitrobenzenethiol and 4&#8208;methoxybenzenethiol molecules with different dipole moments can firmly anchor to the PQD surface through the thiol group to modulate the energy levels of PQDs, and a gradient band structure within the PQD solid is subsequently realized. Consequently, the band&#8208;engineered PQDSC delivers an efficiency of up to 16.44%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of CsPbI3 PQDSCs. This work provides a feasible avenue for the band engineering of PQD solids by tuning the surface chemistry of PQDs for high&#8208;performing solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Interference of ATP&#8208;Adenosine Axis by Engineered Biohybrid for Amplifying Immunogenic Cell Death&#8208;Mediated Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered biohybrid (Bc@AZTF) is rationally designed to activate immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#160;therapy and impede the production of immunosuppressive adenosine, which can establish a collaborative antitumor immune network to potentiate effective tumoricidal immunity and activate the enduring immunological memory to manage tumor recurrence and rechallenge, thereby amplifying ICD&#8208;mediated antitumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) often results in the production and accumulation of adenosine (ADO), a byproduct that negatively impacts the therapeutic effect as well as facilitates tumor development and metastasis. Here, an innovative strategy is elaborately developed to effectively activate ICD while avoiding the generation of immunosuppressive adenosine. Specifically, ZIF&#8208;90, an ATP&#8208;responsive consumer, is synthesized as the core carrier to encapsulate AB680 (CD73 inhibitor) and then coated with an iron&#8208;polyphenol layer to prepare the ICD inducer (AZTF), which is further grafted onto prebiotic bacteria via the esterification reaction to obtain the engineered biohybrid (Bc@AZTF). Particularly, the designed Bc@AZTF can actively enrich in tumor sites and respond to the acidic tumor microenvironment to offload AZTF nanoparticles, which can consume intracellular ATP (iATP) content and simultaneously inhibit the ATP&#8208;adenosine axis to reduce the accumulation of adenosine, thereby alleviating adenosine&#8208;mediated immunosuppression and strikingly amplifying ICD effect. Importantly, the synergy of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 (&#945;PD&#8208;1) with Bc@AZTF not only establishes a collaborative antitumor immune network to potentiate effective tumoricidal immunity but also activates long&#8208;lasting immune memory effects to manage tumor recurrence and rechallenge, presenting a new paradigm for ICD treatment combined with adenosine metabolism.

         <title>An Electrolyte Engineered Homonuclear Copper Complex as Homogeneous Catalyst for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chlorine bridge&#8208;enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T) with a Cu atom proximal distance of 4.7 &#197; is in situ synthesized in electrolyte as homogeneous catalyst for rationalizing the lithium&#8211;sulfur redox reactions. The optimized content of 0.25&#160;wt% approaches the saturated concentration of Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T in electrolyte, further boosting its homogeneous optimization activity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries suffer from severe polysulfide shuttle, retarded sulfur conversion kinetics and notorious lithium dendrites, which has curtailed the discharge capacity, cycling lifespan and safety. Engineered catalysts act as a feasible strategy to synchronously manipulate the evolution behaviors of sulfur and lithium species. Herein, a chlorine bridge&#8208;enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T) is in situ synthesized in electrolyte as homogeneous catalyst for rationalizing the Li&#8211;S redox reactions. The well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T provides completely active sites and sufficient contact for homogeneously guiding the Li2S nucleation/decomposition reactions, and stabilizing the lithium working interface according to the synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;computed tomography, small angle neutron scattering and COMSOL results. Moreover, Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T with the content of 0.25&#160;wt% approaching saturated concentration in electrolyte further boosts the homogeneous optimization function in really operated Li&#8211;S batteries. Accordingly, the capacity retention of the Li&#8211;S battery is elevated from 51.4% to 86.3% at 0.2 C, and reaches 77.0% at 1.0 C over 400 cycles. Furthermore, the sulfur cathode with the assistance of Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T realizes the stable cycling under the practical scenarios of soft&#8208;packaged pouch cell and high sulfur loading (6.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 with the electrolyte usage of 4.5&#160;&#181;L mgS&#8722;1).

Furthermore, the sulfur cathode with the assistance of Cu-2-T realizes the stable cycling under the practical scenarios of soft-packaged pouch cell and high sulfur loading (6.5&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with the electrolyte usage of 4.5&#160;&#181;L mg&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Unraveling Mechanism for Microstructure Engineering toward High&#8208;Capacity Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An increase of 14&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 in reversible capacity at the first cycle is achieved in a tungsten(W)&#8208;introduced cathode through microstructure regulation. The modified microstructure featured as coherent spinel twin boundaries can effectively promote lithium ion&#160;transport and thus endow capacity enhancement. This work provides insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship for the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode.









Abstract
Microstructural engineering on nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide (NRLO) cathode materials is considered a promising approach to increase both the capacity and lifespan of lithium&#8208;ion batteries by introducing high valence&#8208;state elements. However, rational regulation on NRLO microstructures based on a deep understanding of its capacity enhancement mechanism remains challenging. Herein for the first time, it is demonstrated that an increase of 14&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 in reversible capacity at the first cycle can be achieved via tailoring the micro and nano structure of NRLO through introducing tungsten. Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization reveals that the formation of a modified microstructure featured as coherent spinel twin boundaries. Theoretical modeling and electrochemical investigations further demonstrate that the capacity increase mechanism is related to such coherent spinel twin boundaries, which can lower the Li+ diffusion barrier and thus allow more Li+ to participate in deeper phase transitions. Meanwhile, the surface and grain boundaries of NRLOs are found to be modified by generating a dense and uniform LiWxOy phase, which further extends its cycle life by reducing side reactions with electrolytes. This work enables a comprehensive understanding of the capacity&#8208;increased mechanism and endows the remarkable potential of microstructural engineering for capacity&#8208; and lifespan&#8208;increased NRLOs.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Carbon Potassium&#8208;Ion Capacitor Enabled by Hollow Carbon Fibrous Electrodes with Reduced Graphitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZrO2 ceramic nanofibers are employed as the catalytic template to fabricate hollow tubular N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nanofibers, which has high tensile strength, robust structural flexibility, and excellent electronic conductivity. High K+&#8208;storage capacity at low plateau potential and fast K+&#8208;intercalation kinetics are achieved to build a flexible K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor.








Abstract
The large size of K+ ions (1.38 &#197;) sets a challenge in achieving high kinetics and long lifespan of potassium storage devices. Here, a fibrous ZrO2 membrane is utilized as a reactive template to construct a dual&#8208;carbon K&#8208;ion capacitor. Unlike graphite, ZrO2&#8208;catalyzed graphitic carbon presents a relatively disordered layer arrangement with an expanded interlayer spacing of 0.378&#160;nm to accommodate K+ insertion/extraction. Pyridine&#8208;derived nitrogen sites can locally store K&#8208;ions without disrupting the formation of stage&#8208;1 graphite intercalation compounds (GICs). Consequently, N&#8208;doped hollow graphitic carbon fiber achieves a K+&#8208;storage capacity (primarily below 1&#160;V), which is 1.5 time that of commercial graphite. Potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors are assembled using the hollow carbon fiber electrodes and the ZrO2 nanofiber membrane as the separator. The capacitor exhibits a high power of 40 000 W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, full charge in 8.5&#8201;s, 93% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 2&#8201;A g&#8722;1, and a low self&#8208;discharge rate of 8.6&#160;mV h&#8722;1. The scalability and high performance of the lattice&#8208;expanded tubular carbon electrodes underscores may advance the practical potassium&#8208;ion capacitors.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Modal Melt&#8208;Processing of Birefringent Cellulosic Materials for Eco&#8208;Friendly Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relying on the thermal&#8208;activated dynamic covalent&#8208;locking of the spatial topological structure, a dynamic chemical modification strategy is proposed for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of birefringent cellulosic materials for eco&#8208;friendly anti&#8208;counterfeiting. With customizable processing forms, the materials exhibit a wide color gamut, recyclability, and biodegradability. The diversified flexible elements facilitate scalable fabrication and compatibility with universal processing techniques, thereby enabling versatile and programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Ubiquitous anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials with a rapidly rising annual consumption (over 1010&#160;m2) can pose a serious environmental burden. Biobased cellulosic materials with birefringence offer attractive sustainable alternatives, but their scalable solvent&#8208;free processing remain challenging. Here, a dynamic chemical modification strategy is proposed for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of birefringent cellulosic materials for eco&#8208;friendly anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Relying on the thermal&#8208;activated dynamic covalent&#8208;locking of the spatial topological structure of preferred oriented cellulose, the strategy balances the contradiction between the strong confinement of long&#8208;range ordered structures and the molecular motility required for entropically&#8208;driven reconstruction. Equipped with customizable processing forms including mold&#8208;pressing, spinning, direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing, and blade&#8208;coating, the materials exhibit a wide color gamut, self&#8208;healing efficiency (94.5%), recyclability, and biodegradability. Moreover, the diversified flexible elements facilitate scalable fabrication and compatibility with universal processing techniques, thereby enabling versatile and programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting. The strategy is expected to provide references for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of cellulose and promote sustainable innovation in the anti&#8208;counterfeiting industry.

         <title>Bioinspired Artificial Visual&#8208;Respiratory Synapse as Multimodal Scene Recognition System with Oxidized&#8208;Vacancies MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial visual&#8208;respiratory synapse using monolayer vacancy&#8208;induced oxidized MXene is introduced, leveraging synergistic light and atmospheric plasticity. Oxidized vacancies exhibit photocarrier trapping and hydroxyl preference, enabling environmental and multimodal neural network image recognition. This device promises advancements in intelligent interactive systems through enhanced sensory integration and responsive neural network functionalities.








Abstract
In the pursuit of artificial neural systems, the integration of multimodal plasticity, memory retention, and perceptual functions stands as a paramount objective in achieving neuromorphic perceptual components inspired by the human brain, to emulating the neurological excitability tuning observed in human visual and respiratory collaborations. Here, an artificial visual&#8208;respiratory synapse is presented with monolayer oxidized MXene (VRSOM) exhibiting synergistic light and atmospheric plasticity. The VRSOM enables to realize facile modulation of synaptic behaviors, encompassing postsynaptic current, sustained photoconductivity, stable facilitation/depression properties, and &#8220;learning&#8208;experience&#8221; behavior. These performances rely on the privileged photocarrier trapping characteristics and the hydroxyl&#8208;preferential selectivity inherent of oxidized vacancies. Moreover, environment recognitions and multimodal neural network image identifications are achieved through multisensory integration, underscoring the potential of the VRSOM in reproducing human&#8208;like perceptual attributes. The VRSOM platform holds significant promise for hardware output of human&#8208;like mixed&#8208;modal interactions and paves the way for perceiving multisensory neural behaviors in artificial interactive devices.

Defect&#8208;Free Nanowelding
The anisotropic lubricity between two&#8208;dimensional semiconducting tin selenide nanoplates and a graphene substrate enables the motion of nanoplates strictly along the zigzag direction of graphene. A subsequential in situ annealing welds the nanoplates together and yields defect&#8208;free interfaces. More details can be found in article number 2312199 by Salvador Barraza&#8208;Lopez, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Kai Chang, and co&#8208;workers.

Gold nanomaterials possess many appealing material properties, such as facile control over their size/shape and surface functionality, intrinsic chemical inertness yet with high biocompatibility, adjustable localized surface plasmon resonances, tunable conductivity, wide electrochemical window, etc. Such material attributes have been recently utilized for designing and fabricating soft bioelectronics and optoelectronics. This motivates to give a comprehensive overview of this burgeoning field. The discussion of representative tailor&#8208;made gold nanomaterials, including gold nanocrystals, ultrathin gold nanowires, vertically aligned gold nanowires, hard template&#8208;assisted gold nanowires/gold nanotubes, bimetallic/trimetallic gold nanowires, gold nanomeshes, and gold nanosheets, is begun. This is followed by the description of various fabrication methodologies for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications such as strain sensors, pressure sensors, electrochemical sensors, electrophysiological devices, energy&#8208;storage devices, energy&#8208;harvesting devices, optoelectronics, and others. Finally, the remaining challenges and opportunities are discussed.

         <title>Rational Strategies to Improve the Efficiency of 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies to improve the efficiency of 2D PSCs, focusing on component&#160;engineering, crystal&#160;structure and photovoltaic properties. The strategies around solution chemical engineering, processing technique and interface optimization, are systematically discussed. Finally, challenges and perspectives associated with 2D perovskites are outlined to provide insights into potential improvements in photovoltaic performance.








Abstract
In the quest for durable photovoltaic devices, 2D halide perovskites have emerged as a focus of extensive research. However, the reduced dimension in structure is accompanied by inferior optical&#8208;electrical properties, such as widened band gap, enhanced exciton binding energy, and obstructed charge transport. As a result, the efficiency of 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lags significantly behind their 3D counterparts. To overcome these constraints, extensive investigations into materials and processing techniques are pursued rigorously to augment the efficiency of 2D PSCs. Herein, The cutting&#8208;edge delve into developments in 2D PSCs, with a focus on chemical and material engineering, as well as their structure and photovoltaic properties. The review starts with an introduction of the crystal structure, followed by the key evaluation criteria of 2D PSCs. Then, the strategies around solution chemical engineering, processing technique, and interface optimization, to simultaneously boost efficiency and stability are systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives associated with 2D perovskites to provide insights into potential improvements in photovoltaic performance will be outlined.

         <title>Interstitials in Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interstitial strategy has attracted increasing attentions due to its remarkable impact on synergistically optimizing carrier and phonon transport properties. This review overviews and defines five typical interstitials, including rattling, decoupling, interlayer, dynamic, and liquid interstitials. Their transport mechanisms in thermoelectric materials are thoroughly illustrated, and future development directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Defect structure is pivotal in advancing thermoelectric performance with interstitials being widely recognized for their remarkable roles in optimizing both phonon and electron transport properties. Diverse interstitial atoms are identified in previous works according to their distinct roles and can be classified into rattling interstitial, decoupling interstitial, interlayer interstitial, dynamic interstitial, and liquid interstitial. Specifically, rattling interstitial can cause phonon resonance in cage compound to scatter phonon transport; decoupling interstitial can contribute to phonon blocking and electron transport due to their significantly different mean free paths; interlayer interstitial can facilitate out&#8208;of&#8208;layer electron transport in layered compounds; dynamic interstitial can tune temperature&#8208;dependent carrier density and optimize electrical transport properties at wide temperatures; liquid interstitial could improve the carrier mobility at homogeneous dispersion state. All of these interstitials have positive impact on thermoelectric performance by adjusting transport parameters. This perspective therefore intends to provide a thorough overview of advances in interstitial strategy and highlight their significance for optimizing thermoelectric parameters. Finally, the profound potential for extending interstitial strategy to various other thermoelectric systems is discussed and some future directions in thermoelectric material are also outlined.

         <title>From Lab to Application: Challenges and Opportunities in Achieving Fast Charging with Polyanionic Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast charging alleviates range anxiety in sodium&#8208;ion batteries caused by limited energy density. This review focuses on the fast&#8208;charging design of polyanionic cathodes and proposes innovative modification strategy classifications&#8212;from shortening migration paths to increasing diffusion coefficients. Discussions extend from coin cells to pouch cells, aiming to provide insights into high&#8208;rate polyanionic materials, emphasizing their significant potential in fast&#8208;charging applications.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), recognized for balanced energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are positioned as a promising complement to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and a substitute for lead&#8211;acid batteries, particularly in low&#8208;speed electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage. Despite their extensive potential, concerns about range anxiety due to lower energy density underscore the importance of fast&#8208;charging technologies, which drives the exploration of high&#8208;rate electrode materials. Polyanionic cathode materials are emerging as promising candidates in this regard. However, their intrinsic limitation in electronic conductivity poses challenges for synchronized electron and ion transport, hindering their suitability for fast&#8208;charging applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of sodium ion migration during charging/discharging, highlighting it as a critical rate&#8208;limiting step for fast charging. By delving into intrinsic dynamics, key factors that constrain fast&#8208;charging characteristics are identified and summarized. Innovative modification routes are then introduced, with a focus on shortening migration paths and increasing diffusion coefficients, providing detailed insights into feasible strategies. Moreover, the discussion extends beyond half cells to full cells, addressing challenges and opportunities in transitioning polyanionic materials from the laboratory to practical applications. This review aims to offer valuable insights into the development of high&#8208;rate polyanionic cathodes, acknowledging their pivotal role in advancing fast&#8208;charging SIBs.

         <title>Wetting Behavior&#8208;Induced Interfacial transmission of Energy and Signal: Materials, Mechanisms, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes and discusses the mechanisms of energy and signal transmission for electricity, light, and heat at wetting interfaces, elucidating their respective scientific issues, technical characteristics, challenges, commonalities, and potential for technological convergence. Harnessing synergistic advantages in practical applications and constructing advanced, multifunctional, and highly efficient smart systems based on wetted interfaces is the aim of providing strategies.








Abstract
Wetting behaviors can significantly affect the transport of energy and signal (E&amp;S) through vapor, solid, and liquid interfaces, which has prompted increased interest in interfacial science and technology. E&amp;S transmission can be achieved using electricity, light, and heat, which often accompany and interact with each other.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wetting behaviors can significantly affect the transport of energy and signal (E&amp;amp;S) through vapor, solid, and liquid interfaces, which has prompted increased interest in interfacial science and technology. E&amp;amp;S transmission can be achieved using electricity, light, and heat, which often accompany and interact with each other. Over the past decade, their distinctive transport phenomena during wetting processes have made significant contributions to various domains. However, few studies have analyzed the intricate relationship between wetting behavior and E&amp;amp;S transport. This review summarizes and discusses the mechanisms of electrical, light, and heat transmission at wetting interfaces to elucidate their respective scientific issues, technical characteristics, challenges, commonalities, and potential for technological convergence. The materials, structures, and devices involved in E&amp;amp;S transportation are also analyzed. Particularly, harnessing synergistic advantages in practical applications and constructing advanced, multifunctional, and highly efficient smart systems based on wetted interfaces is the aim to provide strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

Recently, mechanochromic LC materials have becoming a hot topic in multi fields from flexible artificial skins to visualized sensors and smart biomimetic devices. In this review, the recent progress of mechanochromic LCs is comprehensively summarized. Firstly, the mechanism and functionalities of mechanochromic LC is introduced, followed by preparation of various functional materials based on mechanochromic LCs. Then the applications of mechanochromic LCs are provided. Finally, the conclusion and outlooks of this field is given. This overview is hoped to provide inspiration in fabrication of advanced functional soft materials for scientists and engineers from multidisciplines including materials science, elastomers, chemistry and physical science.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
