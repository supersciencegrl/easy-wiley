         <title>Chemical Circularity in 3d Printing with Biobased &#916;&#8208;Valerolactone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a vat photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing technology that fabricates parts typically made of chemically crosslinked polymers. The rapidly growing DLP market has an increasing demand for polymer raw materials, along with growing environmental concerns. Therefore, circular DLP printing with a closed&#8208;loop recyclable ink is of great importance for sustainability. The low&#8208;ceiling temperature alkyl&#8208;substituted &#948;&#8208;valerolactone (VL) is an industrially accessible biorenewable feedstock for developing recyclable polymers. In this work, acrylate&#8208;functionalized poly(&#948;&#8208;valerolactone) (PVLA), synthesized through the ring&#8208;opening transesterification polymerization of VL, is used as a platform photoprecursor to improve the chemical circularity in DLP printing. A small portion of photocurable reactive diluent (RD) turns the unprintable PVLA into DLP printable ink. Various photocurable monomers can serve as reactive diluents to modulate the properties of printed thermoplastic or thermoset structures for applications such as sacrificial molds, soft actuators, sensors, etc. The intrinsic depolymerizability of PVLA is well preserved, regardless of whether the printed polymer is a thermoplastic or a crosslinked thermoset. The recovery yield of virgin quality VL monomer is 93% through direct bulk thermolysis of the printed structures. This work proposes the utilization of depolymerizable photoprecursors and highlights the feasibility of biorenewable VL as a versatile material platform toward circular DLP printing.

         <title>Robust Fiber&#8208;Shaped Flexible Temperature Sensors for Safety Monitoring with Ultrahigh Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible temperature sensors capable of detecting and transmitting temperature data from the human body, environment, and electronic devices hold significant potential for applications in electronic skins, human&#8208;machine interactions, and disaster prevention systems. Nonetheless, fabricating flexible temperature sensors with exceptional sensing performance remains a formidable task, primarily due to the intricate process of constructing an intrinsically flexible sensing element with high sensitivity. In this study, we introduce a facile in situ two&#8208;step synthetic method for fabricating flexible fiber&#8208;shaped NiO/carbon nanotube fiber (CNTF) composites. The resulting NiO/CNTF flexible temperature sensors demonstrate outstanding deformability and temperature sensing characteristics, encompassing a broad working range (&#8722;15&#8211;60&#176;C) and high sensitivity (maximum TCR of &#8722;20.2%&#176;C&#8722;1 and B value of 3332 K). Importantly, the mechanical and thermal behaviors of the sensor in various application conditions are thoroughly examined using finite element analysis simulations. Moreover, the temperature sensors can effectively capture diverse thermal signals in wearable applications. Notably, a temperature monitoring and warning system is developed to prevent fire accidents resulting from abnormal thermal runaway in electronic devices.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Compatible Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions with A SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Composite Barrier as Low&#8208;Voltage And Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Speed Memristors</title>

Abstract
The big data era requires ultrafast, low&#8208;power and silicon&#8208;compatible materials and devices for information storage and processing. Ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) have emerged as low&#8208;power and fast memristors; but their operating voltages are high for fast switching speeds, and performances of silicon&#8208;compatible FTJs are significantly poorer than those of perovskite FTJs. Here, FTJs based on SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 composite barrier and both conducting electrodes are designed and fabricated on Si substrates. The FTJ achieves the fastest write speed of 500&#160;ps under 5&#160;V (&#8764;2 orders of magnitude faster than reported silicon&#8208;compatible FTJs) or 10&#160;ns speed at a low voltage of 1.5&#160;V (the lowest voltage among FTJs at similar speeds), low write current density &#8764;1.3 &#215; 104 A cm&#8722;2, 8 discrete states, good retention &gt;&#160;105s at 85&#160;&#176;C and endurance &gt;&#160;107. In addition, it provides a large read current (&#8764;88 A cm&#8722;2) at 0.1&#160;V, &#8764;2 orders of magnitude larger than reported FTJs. Interestingly, in FTJ&#8208;based synapses, gradually tunable conductance states (128 states) with high linearity (&lt;1) are obtained by 10&#160;ns pulses of &lt;1.2&#160;V, and a high accuracy of &#8764;91.8% in recognizing fashion product images is achieved by online neural network simulations. These results highlight that silicon&#8208;compatible HfO2&#8208;based FTJs are promising for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memories and electrical synapses.

         <title>Semimetallic Bismuthene With Edge&#8208;Rich Dangling Bonds: Broad&#8208;spectrum&#8208;driven And Edge&#8208;Confined Electron Enhancement Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Broad&#8208;spectrum&#8208;driven high&#8208;performance artificial photosynthesis is quite challenging. Herein, atomically ultrathin bismuthene with semimetallic properties is designed and demonstrated for broad&#8208;spectrum(UV&#8208;Vis&#8208;NIR)&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The trap states in the bandgap produced by edge dangling bonds prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons from 90&#160;ps in bulk Bi to 1,650&#160;ps in bismuthine, and excited&#8208;state electrons are enriched at the edge of bismuthine. The edge dangling bonds of bismuthene as the active sites for adsorption/activation of CO2 increase the hybridization ability of the Bi 6p orbital and O 2p orbital to significantly reduce the catalytic reaction energy barrier and promote the formation of C&#8208;H bonds until the generation of CH4. Under &#955; &#8805; 400&#160;nm and &#955; &#8805; 550&#160;nm irradiation, the utilization ratios of photogenerated electron reduction CO2 hydrogenation to CO and CH4 for bismuthene are 58.24 and 300.50 times higher than those of bulk Bi, respectively. Moreover, bismuthene can extend the CO2 hydrogenation reaction to the near&#8208;infrared region (&#955; &#8805; 700&#160;nm). This pioneering work employs the single semimetal element as an artificial photosynthetic catalyst to produce a broad spectral response.

         <title>Efficient And Stable Multi&#8208;Color Emissions of The Coumarin Modified Cs3LnCl6 Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanocrystals And Led Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based lead&#8208;free perovskite materials hold great promise for the development of high&#8208;resolution full&#8208;color displays in the future. In this work, we systemically prepared various Cs3LnCl6 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) emitting light across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum with remarkably high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). Especially, by introducing multifunctional coumarin small molecules into Cs3EuCl6 NCs as an intermediate state, Cs3EuCl6 NCs can achieve an impressive PLQY of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional ET efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, we successfully fabricated the lanthanide&#8208;based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue. Among them, the Cs3EuCl6 NCs based red LED demonstrates a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 18&#160;nm at 617&#160;nm, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 5.17% and a maximum brightness of 2373&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which is the most excellent reported for lead&#8208;free narrowband (within 20&#160;nm) emission devices. Notably, these devices exhibit an operating half&#8208;life of 440 hours at a brightness level of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, surpassing the performance of most reported lead&#8208;free perovskite LEDs (PLEDs). Our work opens up exciting possibilities for the future commercialization of lanthanide&#8208;based PLEDs in the display industry, paving the way for more vibrant, energy&#8208;efficient, and long&#8208;lasting display technologies.

Especially, by introducing multifunctional coumarin small molecules into Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;EuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; NCs as an intermediate state, Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;EuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; NCs can achieve an impressive PLQY of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional ET efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, we successfully fabricated the lanthanide-based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue. Among them, the Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;EuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; NCs based red LED demonstrates a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 18&#160;nm at 617&#160;nm, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) up to 5.17% and a maximum brightness of 2373&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the most excellent reported for lead-free narrowband (within 20&#160;nm) emission devices. Notably, these devices exhibit an operating half-life of 440 hours at a brightness level of 100&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, surpassing the performance of most reported lead-free perovskite LEDs (PLEDs). Our work opens up exciting possibilities for the future commercialization of lanthanide-based PLEDs in the display industry, paving the way for more vibrant, energy-efficient, and long-lasting display technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions Above Room Temperature in A Van Der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic crystals are a promising platform for innovative spintronic devices based on magnetic skyrmions, thanks to their high flexibility and atomic thickness stability. However, room&#8208;temperature skyrmion&#8208;hosting vdW materials are scarce, which poses a challenge for practical applications. In this study, we employed a chemical vapor transport (CVT) approach to synthesize Fe3GaTe2 crystals and observed room&#8208;temperature N&#233;el skyrmions in Fe3GaTe2 nanoflakes above 58&#160;nm in thickness through in&#8208;situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (L&#8208;TEM). Upon an optimized field cooling procedure, zero&#8208;field hexagonal skyrmion lattices were successfully generated in nanoflakes with an extended thickness range (30&#8208;180&#160;nm). Significantly, these skyrmion lattices remain stable up to 355 K, setting a new record for the highest temperature at which skyrmions can be hosted. Our research established Fe3GaTe2 as an emerging above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature skyrmion&#8208;hosting vdW material, holding great promise for future spintronics.

         <title>Stretchable Device for Simultaneous Measurements of Contractility and Electrophysiology of Neuromuscular Tissue in The Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Devices interfacing with biological tissues can provide valuable insights into function, disease, and metabolism through electrical and mechanical signals. However, certain neuromuscular tissues, like those in the gastrointestinal tract, undergo significant strains of up to 40%. Conventional inextensible devices cannot capture the dynamic responses in these tissues. This study introduces electrodes made from poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that enable simultaneous monitoring of electrical and mechanical responses of gut tissue. The soft PDMS layers conform to tissue surfaces during gastrointestinal movement. Dopants, including Capstone&#8482; FS&#8208;30 and polyethylene glycol, are explored to enhance the conductivity, electrical sensitivity to strain, and stability of the PEDOT:PSS. The devices are fabricated using shadow masks and solution&#8208;processing techniques, providing a faster and simpler process than traditional clean&#8208;room based lithography. Tested on ex vivo mouse colon and human stomach, the device recorded voltage changes of up to 300 &#956;V during contraction and distension consistent with muscle activity, while simultaneously recording resistance changes of up to 150% due to mechanical strain. These devices detect and respond to chemical stimulants and blockers, and can induce contractions through electrical stimulation. They hold great potential for studying and treating complex disorders like irritable bowel syndrome and gastroparesis.

         <title>4D Multi&#8208;Material Printing of Soft Actuators with Spatial and Temporal Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft actuators (SAs) are devices which can interact with delicate objects in a manner not achievable with traditional robotics. Whilst it is possible to design a soft actuator whose actuation is triggered via an external stimulus, the use of a single stimulus creates challenges in the spatial and temporal control of the actuation. One solution is to design soft actuators whose actuation requires the combination of stimuli (i.e., logic&#8208;gate type actuation) to initiate the actuation event. Herein, we present a 4D printed multi&#8208;material soft actuator design (MMSA) whose actuation is only initiated by a combination of triggers (i.e., pH and temperature). Using 3D printing, we designed a multi&#8208;layered soft actuator with a hydrophilic pH sensitive layer, and a hydrophobic magnetic and temperature responsive shape memory polymer layer. The hydrogel responds to environmental pH conditions by swelling or shrinking, whilst the shape memory polymer can resist the shape deformation of the hydrogel until triggered by temperature or light. The combination of these stimuli responsive layers allows for a high level of spatial and temporal control of the actuation. We demonstrate the utility of the 4D MMSA via a series of cargo capture and release experiments, validating its ability to demonstrate active spatiotemporal control. The MMSA concept provides a promising research direction to develop multifunctional soft devices with potential applications in biomedical engineering and environmental engineering.

         <title>Highly Stable Organic Molecular Porous Solid Electrolyte with One&#8208;Dimensional Ion Migration Channel for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8722;Oxygen Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8722;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) batteries have been widely recognized as one of the candidates for the next&#8208;generation of energy storage batteries. However, the development of solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries has been hindered by the lack of solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) with high ionic conductivity at room temperature, high Li+ transference number, and the high stability to air. Herein, we developed the organic molecular porous solid cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) with one&#8208;dimensional (1D) ion migration channels as the SSE for solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Taking advantage of the 1D ion migration channel for Li+ conduction, CB[7] SSE achieved high ionic conductivity (2.45&#215;10&#8722;4 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#8201;&#176;C). Moreover, the noncovalent interactions facilitated the immobilization of anions, realizing a high Li+ transference number (tLi+ = 0.81) and Li+ uniform distribution. The CB[7] SSE also shows a wide electrochemical stability window of 0&#8211;4.65&#160;V and high thermal stability and chemical stability, as well as realizes stable Li+ plating/stripping (more than 1000&#160;h at 0.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). As a result, the CB[7] SSE endows solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries with superior rate capability and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (up to 500&#160;h). This design strategy of CB[7] SSE paves the way for stable and efficient solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries toward practical applications.

         <title>Topological Analysis and Structural Determination of Three&#8208;dimensional Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) constitute a new type of crystalline materials that consist of a range of porous structures with numerous applications in the fields of adsorption, separation, and catalysis. However, because of the complexity of the three&#8208;periodic net structure, it would be desirable to develop a thorough structural comprehension, along with a means to precisely determine the actual structure. Indeed, such advancements would considerably contribute to the rational design and application of 3D COFs. In this review, we introduce and categorize the reported topologies of 3D COFs according to the configurations of their building blocks, and provide a comprehensive overview of diffraction&#8208;based structural determination methods. The current challenges and future prospects for these materials will also be discussed.

         <title>Piezocatalytic Schottky Junction Treats Atherosclerosis by a Biomimetic Trojan Horse Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque is characterized by the foamy macrophage burden, involving impaired cholesterol efflux and deficient efferocytosis. Correspondingly, piezocatalytic therapy is an emerging solution for eliminating the foamy macrophage burden with satisfactory spatiotemporal controllability and deep penetration depth. Herein, we engineer a biomimetic Trojan horse (Au&#8208;ZnO@MM) by coating the macrophage membrane (MM) onto the surface of a rod&#8208;like Au&#8208;ZnO Schottky Junction to effectively relieve the atherosclerotic progression. These Trojan horses with the coating of MM are actively transported into subsistent foamy macrophages and generate abundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) via ultrasound&#8208;activated piezocatalysis. ROS&#8208;initiated autophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction induce substantial cell apoptosis, alleviating the burden of subsistent foamy macrophages. The resulting apoptotic fragments further significantly facilitate cholesterol excretion and trigger efferocytosis of intraplaque fresh macrophages. Ultimately, the biomimetic Au&#8208;ZnO@MM piezocatalyst not only inhibits the foaming capacity of macrophages, but also improves the function of removing cell debris, which can stabilize atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque. Meanwhile, the plasmon resonance effect of integrated gold nanoparticles enables favorable photoacoustic molecular imaging for real&#8208;time image&#8208;guided atherosclerotic therapy. This proposed biomimetic Trojan horse strategy provides the paradigm of employing ultrasound&#8208;activated piezocatalytic methodology for enhanced atherosclerotic theranostics.

         <title>Uncovering the Network Modifier for Highly Disordered Amorphous Li&#8208;Garnet Glass&#8208;Ceramics</title>

Abstract
Highly disordered amorphous Li7La3Zr2O12 (aLLZO) is a promising class of electrolyte separators and protective layers for hybrid or all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries due to its grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free nature and wide electrochemical stability window. Unlike low&#8208;entropy ionic glasses such as LixPOyNz (LiPON), these medium&#8208;entropy non&#8208;Zachariasen aLLZO phases offer a higher number of stable structure arrangements over a wide range of tunable synthesis temperatures, providing the potential to tune the LBU&#8208;Li+ transport relation. We reveal that lanthanum (La) is the active &#8220;network modifier&#8221; for this new class of highly disordered Li+ conductors, whereas zirconium and lithium serve as &#8220;network formers&#8221;. Specifically, within the solubility limit of La in aLLZO, increasing the La concentration can result in longer bond distances between the 1st nearest neighbors of Zr&#8211;O and La&#8211;O within the same LBU and the 2nd nearest neighbors of Zr&#8211;La across two adjacent network&#8208;former and network&#8208;modifier LBUs, suggesting a more disordered medium&#8208; and long&#8208;range order structure in LLZO. These findings open new avenues for the future design of amorphous Li+ electrolytes and the selection of network&#8208;modifier dopants. Moreover, the wide yet relatively low synthesis temperatures of these glass&#8208;ceramics make them attractive candidates for low&#8208;cost and more sustainable hybrid&#8208; or all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries for energy storage.

         <title>Solid Additive Dual&#8208;Regulates Spectral Response Enabling High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) possess significant potential for applications in vehicles and buildings due to their distinctive visual transparency. Conventional device engineering strategies are typically used to optimize photon selection and utilization at the expense of power conversion efficiency (PCE); moreover, the fixed spectral utilization range always impose an unsatisfactory upper limit to its light utilization efficiency (LUE). In this study, a novel solid additive 1,3&#8208;diphenoxybenzene (DB) has been employed to dual&#8208;regulate donor/acceptor molecular aggregation and crystallinity, which effectively broadens the spectral response of resulting device in near&#8208;infrared region. Besides, more visible light was allowed to pass through the devices, which enables ST&#8208;OSCs to possess satisfactory photocurrent and high average visible transmittance (AVT) simultaneously. The inclusion of DB also results in a multi&#8208;scale phase&#8208;separated morphology and effectively suppresses voltage losses. Consequently, the optimal ST&#8208;OSCs based on PP2+DB/BTP&#8208;eC9+DB achieves a superior LUE of 4.77%, with an AVT of 42.98% and a PCE of 11.10%, representing the highest value within AVT range of 40&#8211;50% observed thus far. Such results indicate that the ST&#8208;OSCs can simultaneously meet the requirements for minimum commercial efficiency and plant photosynthesis when integrated with the roofs of agricultural greenhouses. This work emphasizes the significance of additives to tune the spectral response in ST&#8208;OSCs, and charts the way for organic photovoltaics in economically sustainable agricultural development.

         <title>Tailoring Built&#8208;in Electric Field in a Self&#8208;Assembled Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework/MXene Nanocomposites for Microwave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The use of heterointerface engineering, which can play a pivotal role in producing advanced microwave&#8208;absorbing materials, to prepare a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8211;MXene nanocomposite is reported herein. The ZIF&#8211;MXene composites can be prepared by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly of negatively charged titanium carbide MXene flakes and positively charged Co&#8208;containing ZIF nanomaterials. This approach effectively creates abundant Mott&#8211;Schottky heterointerfaces exhibiting a robust built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) effect, as evidenced by experimental and theoretical analyses, leading to a notable attenuation of electromagnetic energy. Systematic manipulation of the BIEF&#8208;exhibiting heterointerface, achieved through topological modulation of the ZIF, proficiently alters charge separation, facilitates electron migration, and ultimately enhances polarization relaxation loss, resulting in exceptional electromagnetic wave absorption performance (reflection loss RLmin = &#8722;47.35 dB and effective absorption bandwidth fE = 6.32 GHz). The present study demonstrates an innovative model system for elucidating the interfacial polarization mechanisms and pioneers a novel approach to developing functional materials with electromagnetic characteristics through spatial charge engineering.

         <title>Anti&#8208;inflammatory Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Silk Fibroin/Cryogel Hybrid Dual Fiber Scaffold with Hierarchical Structure Promotes Healing of Chronic Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Chronic wounds resulting from diabetes, pressure, radiation therapy, and other factors continue to pose significant challenges in wound healing. To address this, our study introduces a novel hybrid fibroin fibrous scaffold (FFS) comprising randomly arranged fibroin fibers and vertically aligned cryogel fibers (CF). The fibroin scaffold was efficiently degummed at room temperature and simultaneously formed a porous structure. The aligned cryogel fibers were produced via directional freeze&#8208;drying, achieved by controlling solution concentration and freezing polymerization temperature. The incorporation of aligned cryogel fibers into the expanded fibroin fiber scaffold led to enhanced cell infiltration both in vitro and in vivo, further elevating the hybrid scaffold's tissue compatibility. We also conjugated the anti&#8208;inflammatory peptide 1 (AP&#8208;1) to the hybrid fibrous scaffold, effectively transforming the inflammatory status of chronic wounds from pro&#8208;inflammatory to pro&#8208;reparative. Consequently, the FFS&#8208;AP1+CF group demonstrated superior granulation tissue formation, angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and re&#8208;epithelialization during the proliferative phase compared to the commercial product PELNAC. Moreover, the FFS&#8208;AP1+CF group displayed epidermis thickness, numbers of regenerated hair follicles, and collagen density closer to normal skin tissue. Our findings highlight the potential of random fibroin fibers/aligned cryogel fibers hybrid fibrous scaffold as a promising approach for skin tissue filling and tissue regeneration.

         <title>A Hybrid Pulsed Laser Deposition Approach to Grow Thin Films of Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials such as transition metal chalcogenides have emerged as electronic, photonic, and quantum materials with scientific and technological importance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vapor-pressure mismatched materials such as transition metal chalcogenides have emerged as electronic, photonic, and quantum materials with scientific and technological importance. However, epitaxial growth of vapor-pressure mismatched materials are challenging due to differences in the reactivity, sticking coefficient, and surface adatom mobility of the mismatched species constituting the material, especially sulfur containing compounds. Here, we report a novel approach to grow chalcogenides &#8211; hybrid pulsed laser deposition &#8211; wherein an organosulfur precursor is used as a sulfur source in conjunction with pulsed laser deposition to regulate the stoichiometry of the deposited films. Epitaxial or textured thin films of sulfides with variety of structure and chemistry such as alkaline metal chalcogenides, main group chalcogenides, transition metal chalcogenides and chalcogenide perovskites are demonstrated, and structural characterization reveal improvement in thin film crystallinity, and surface and interface roughness compared to the state-of-the-art. The growth method can be broadened to other vapor-pressure mismatched chalcogenides such as selenides and tellurides.

         <title>Reversible Surface Engineering of Cellulose Elementary Fibrils: From Ultralong Nanocelluloses to Advanced Cellulosic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are supramolecular assemblies of cellulose chains that provide outstanding mechanical support and structural functions for cellulosic organisms. However, traditional chemical pretreatments and mechanical defibrillation of natural cellulose produce irreversible surface functionalization and adverse effects of morphology of the CNFs, respectively, which limits the utilization of CNFs in nanoassembly and surface functionalization. Herein, we present a facile and energetically efficient surface engineering strategy to completely exfoliate cellulose elementary fibrils from various bioresources, which provides CNFs with ultrahigh aspect ratios (&#8764;1400) and reversible surface. During the mild process of swelling and esterification, the crystallinity and the morphology of the elementary fibrils were retained, resulting in high yields (98%) with low energy consumption (12.4&#160;kJ g&#8722;1). In particular, on the CNF surface, the surface hydroxyl groups were restored by removal of the carboxyl moieties via saponification, which offers a significant opportunity for reconstitution of stronger hydrogen bonding interfaces. Therefore, the resultant CNFs can be used as sustainable building blocks for construction of multi&#8208;dimensional advanced cellulosic materials, e.g., 1D filaments, 2D films and 3D aerogels. The proposed surface engineering strategy provides a new platform for fully utilizing the characteristics of the cellulose elementary fibrils in the development of high&#8208;performance cellulosic materials.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Optical Multi&#8208;Classification Platform for Minimizing Occasional Inaccuracy in Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Biomarker Detection</title>

Abstract
On&#8208;site diagnostic tests that accurately identify disease biomarkers lay the foundation for self&#8208;healthcare applications. However, these tests routinely rely on single&#8208;mode signals and suffer from insufficient accuracy, especially for multiplexed point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests within a few minutes. Here, we develop a dual&#8208;mode multi&#8208;classification diagnostic platform that integrates an electrochemiluminescence sensor and a field&#8208;effect transistor sensor in a microfluidic chip. The microfluidic channel guides the testing samples to flow across electro&#8208;optical sensor units, which produce dual&#8208;mode readouts by detecting infectious biomarkers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, human rhinovirus, and group B streptococcus. Then, machine&#8208;learning classifiers generate three&#8208;dimensional hyperplanes to diagnose different diseases. Dual&#8208;mode readouts derived from distinct mechanisms enhance the anti&#8208;interference ability physically, and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;aided diagnosis in high&#8208;dimensional space reduces the occasional inaccuracy mathematically. Clinical validation studies with 501 unprocessed samples indicate that the platform has an accuracy approaching 99%, higher than the 77%&#8764;93% accuracy of rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing technologies at 100% statistical power (&gt; 150 clinical tests). Moreover, the diagnosis time is 5 minutes without a trade&#8208;off of accuracy. This work solves the occasional inaccuracy issue of rapid on&#8208;site diagnosis, endowing POCT systems with the same accuracy as laboratory tests and holding unique prospects for complicated scenes of personalized healthcare.

         <title>Mechanically and Thermally Robust Gel Electrolytes Built from A Charged Double Helical Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer electrolytes have received tremendous interest in the development of solid&#8208;state batteries, but often fall short in one or more key properties required for practical applications. Herein, we report a rigid gel polymer electrolyte prepared by immobilizing a liquid mixture of a lithium salt and poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether with only 8 wt% poly(2,2&#8242;&#8208;disulfonyl&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;benzidine terephthalamide) (PBDT). The high charge density and rigid double helical structure of PBDT lead to formation of a nanofibrillar structure that endows this electrolyte with stronger mechanical properties, wider temperature window, and higher battery rate capability compared to all other poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)&#8208;based electrolytes. We systematically study the ion transport mechanism in this rigid polymer electrolyte using multiple complementary techniques. Li/LiFePO4 cells show excellent capacity retention over long&#8208;term cycling, with thermal cycling reversibility between ambient temperature and elevated temperatures, demonstrating compelling potential for solid&#8208;state batteries targeting fast charging at high temperatures and slower discharging at ambient temperature.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Enables Hydrogel Electrolyte with Ionic Hopping Migration and Self&#8208;Healability Toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes (HEs), characterized by intrinsic safety, mechanical stability, and biocompatibility, can promote the development of flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (FAZIBs). However, current FAZIB technology is severely restricted by the uncontrollable dendrite growth arising from undesirable reactions between the HEs with sluggish ionic conductivity and Zn metal. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a molecular engineering strategy, which involves the introduction of oxygen&#8208;rich poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (OR&#8208;PUU) into polyacrylamide (PAM)&#8208;based HEs. The OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs facilitate rapid ion transfer through their ionic hopping migration mechanism, resulting in uniform and orderly Zn2+ deposition. The abundant polar groups on the OR&#8208;PUU molecules in OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs break the inherent H&#8208;bond network, tune the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+, and inhibit the occurrence of side reactions. Moreover, the interaction of hierarchical H&#8208;bonds in the OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs endows them with self&#8208;healability, enabling in&#8208;situ repair of cracks induced by plating/stripping. Consequently, Zn symmetric cells incorporating the novel OR&#8208;PUU/PAM HEs exhibit a long cycling life of 2000&#160;h. The resulting Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery displays a low capacity decay rate of 0.009% over 2000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&#8722;1. Overall, this work provides valuable insights to facilitate the realization of dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal anodes through the molecular engineering of HEs.

         <title>Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven Rapid 3d Printing of Photoresponsive Resins for Optically Clear Multifunctional 3d Objects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Light&#8208;driven three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing is gaining significant attention for its unparalleled build speed and high&#8208;resolution in additive manufacturing. However, extending vat photopolymerization to multifunctional, photoresponsive materials poses challenges, such as light attenuation and interference between the photocatalysts and photoactive moieties. This study introduces novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven acrylic resins that enable rapid, high&#8208;resolution photoactive 3D printing. The synergistic combination of a cyanine&#8208;based photocatalyst, borate, and iodonium coinitiators achieves an excellent printing rate and feature resolution under low&#8208;intensity, red light exposure. The incorporation of novel hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) crosslinkers allows for spatially&#8208;resolved photoactivation upon exposure to violet/blue light. Furthermore, a photobleaching mechanism inhibited by HNu 254 during the photopolymerization process results in the production of optically&#8208;clear 3D printed objects. Real&#8208;time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy validates the rapid photopolymerization of the HABI&#8208;containing acrylic resin, whereas mechanistic evaluations reveal the underlying dynamics that are responsible for the rapid photopolymerization rate, wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photoactivation, and observed photobleaching phenomenon. Ultimately, this visible&#8208;light&#8208;based printing method demonstrates: (i) rapid printing rate of 22.5&#160;mm/h, (ii) excellent feature resolution (approximately 20&#160;&#181;m), and (iii) production of optically clear object with self&#8208;healing capability and spatially controlled cleavage. This study serves as a roadmap for developing next&#8208;generation &#8220;smart&#8221; 3D printing technologies.

This study serves as a roadmap for developing next-generation &#8220;smart&#8221; 3D printing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tunable Adhesion for All&#8208;Dry Transfer of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials Enabled by The Freezing of Transfer Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The real applications of CVD&#8208;grown graphene films require the reliable techniques for transferring graphene from growth substrates onto application&#8208;specific substrates. The transfer approaches that avoid the use of organic solvents, etchants and strong bases are compatible with industrial batch processing, in which graphene transfer should be conducted by dry exfoliation and lamination. However, all&#8208;dry transfer of graphene remains unachievable owing to the difficulty in precisely controlling interfacial adhesion to enable the crack&#8208; and contamination&#8208;free transfer. Herein, through controllable crosslinking of transfer medium polymer, we successfully tuned the adhesion between the polymer and graphene for all&#8208;dry transfer of graphene wafers. Stronger adhesion enables crack&#8208;free peeling of the graphene from growth substrates, while reduced adhesion facilitates the exfoliation of polymer from graphene surface leaving an ultraclean surface. This work provides an industrially compatible approach for transferring two&#8208;dimensional materials, key for their future applications, and offers a route for tuning the interfacial adhesion that would allow for the transfer&#8208;enabled fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>&#947;&#8208;Ray Irradiation Significantly Enhances Capacitive Energy Storage Performance of Polymer Dielectric Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Polymer dielectric capacitors are fundamental in advanced electronics and power grids but suffer from low energy density, hindering miniaturization of compact electrical systems. We show that high&#8208;energy and strong penetrating &#947;&#8208;irradiation significantly enhances capacitive energy storage performance of polymer dielectrics. &#947;&#8208;irradiated biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) films exhibit an extraordinarily high energy density of &#8764;10.4 J cm&#8722;3 at &#8764;968 MV m&#8722;1 with an efficiency of &#8764;97.3%. In particular, an energy density of &#8764;4.06 J cm&#8722;3 with an ultrahigh efficiency of &#8764;98% is reliably maintained through 20,000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles under 600 MV m&#8722;1. At 125&#160;&#176;C, the &#947;&#8208;irradiated BOPP film still delivers a high discharged energy density of &#8764;5.88 J cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency of &#8764;90% at &#8764;770 MV m&#8722;1. Substantial improvements are also achieved for &#947;&#8208;irradiated cycloolefin copolymers at a high temperature of 150&#160;&#176;C, verifying the strategy generalizability. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the excellent performance should be related to the &#947;&#8208;irradiation induced polar functional groups with high electron affinity in the molecular chain, which offer deep energy traps to impede charge transport. This work provides a simple and generally applicable strategy for developing high&#8208;performance polymer dielectrics.

         <title>Eliminating Non&#8208;Corner&#8208;Sharing Octahedral for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
The metal halide [BX6]4&#8208; octahedron, where B represents a metal cation and X represents a halide anion, is regarded as the fundamental structural and functional unit of metal halide perovskites. However, the influence of the way the [BX6]4&#8722; octahedra connect to each other has on the structural stability and optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskite is still unclear. Here, we tune and reliably characterize the octahedral connectivity, including corner&#8208;, edge&#8208;, and face&#8208;sharing, of various CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 (0&#8804;x&#8804;0.3) perovskite films through compositional and additive engineering, and with ultralow&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy. We find that the overall solar cell device performance, the charge carrier lifetime, the open&#8208;circuit voltage, and the current density&#8208;voltage hysteresis are all improved when the films consist of corner&#8208;sharing octahedra, and non&#8208;corner sharing phases are suppressed, even in films with the same chemical composition. Additionally, we find that the structural, optoelectronic, and device performance stabilities are similarly enhanced when non&#8208;corner&#8208;sharing connectivities are suppressed. Our approach, combining macroscopic device tests and microscopic material characterization, provides a powerful tool enabling a thorough understanding of the impact of octahedral connectivity on device performance, and opens a new parameter space for designing high&#8208;performance photovoltaic metal halide perovskite devices.

         <title>Graphene and MOF Assembly: Enhanced Fabrication and Functional Derivative via MOF Amorphisation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The integration of graphene and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has numerous implications across various domains, but fabricating such assemblies is often complicated and time&#8208;consuming. Herein, we presented a one&#8208;step preparation of graphene&#8208;MOF assembly by directly impregnating vertical graphene (VG) arrays into the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) precursors under ambient conditions. This approach can effectively assemble multiple ZIFs, including ZIF&#8208;7, ZIF&#8208;8 and ZIF&#8208;67, resulting in their uniform dispersion on the VG with adjustable sizes and shapes. Hydrogen defects on the VG surface are critical in inducing such high&#8208;efficiency ZIF assembly, acting as the reactive sites to interact with the ZIF precursors and facilitate their crystallisation. We further demonstrate the versatility of VG&#8208;ZIF&#8208;67 assembly by exploring the process of MOF amorphisation. Surprisingly, this process leads to an amorphous thin&#8208;film coating formed on VG (named VG&#8208;IL&#8208;amZIF&#8208;67), which preserves the short&#8208;range molecular bonds of crystalline ZIF&#8208;67 while sacrificing the long&#8208;range order. Such a unique film&#8208;on&#8208;graphene architecture maintains the essential characteristics and functionalities of ZIF&#8208;67 within a disordered arrangement, making it well&#8208;suited for electrocatalysis. In electrochemical oxygen reduction, VG&#8208;IL&#8208;amZIF&#8208;67 exhibits exceptional activity, selectivity, and stability to produce H2O2 in acid media.

         <title>Reconfigurable Growth of Engineered Living Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The growth of multicellular organisms is a process akin to additive manufacturing where cellular proliferation and mechanical boundary conditions, amongst other factors, drive morphogenesis. Engineers have limited ability to engineer morphogenesis to manufacture goods or to reconfigure materials comprised of biomass. Herein, a method that uses biological processes to grow and regrow magnetic engineered living materials (mELMs) into desired geometries is reported. These composites contain Saccharomyces cerevisiae and magnetic particles within a hydrogel matrix. The reconfigurable manufacturing process relies on the growth of living cells, magnetic forces, and elastic recovery of the hydrogel. The mELM then adopts a form in an external magnetic field. Yeast within the material proliferate, resulting in 259 &#177; 14% volume expansion. Yeast proliferation fixes the magnetic deformation, even when the magnetic field is removed. The shape fixity can be up to 99.3 &#177; 0.3%. The grown mELM can recover up to 73.9 &#177; 1.9% of the original form by removing yeast cell walls. The directed growth and recovery process can be repeated at least five times. This work enables ELMs to be processed and reprocessed into user&#8208;defined geometries without external material deposition.

Abstract
Hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers (HCPs) with ultra&#8208;high porosity, superior physicochemical stability and excellent cost&#8208;effectiveness are attractive candidates for methane storage. However, the construction of HCPs with BET surface areas exceeding 3000 m2 g&#8211;1 remains extremely challenging. In this work, a newly developed DBM&#8208;knitting method with a slow&#8208;knitting rate was employed to increase the crosslinking degree, in which dichloromethane (DCM) was replaced by dibromomethane (DBM) as both solvent and electrophilic cross&#8208;linker, resulting in highly porous and physicochemically stable HCPs. The BET surface areas of DBM&#8208;knitted SHCPs&#8208;Br are 44%&#8211;120% higher than that of DCM&#8208;knitted SHCPs&#8208;Cl using the same building blocks. Remarkably, SHCP&#8208;3&#8208;Br exhibits an unprecedentedly high porosity (SBET = 3120 m2 g&#8211;1) among reported HCPs, and shows a competitive volumetric 5&#8211;100&#160;bar working methane capacity of 191 cm3 (STP) cm&#8211;3 at 273&#160;K calculated by using real packing density, which outperforms sate&#8208;of&#8208;art MOFs at comparable condtions. This facile and versatile low&#8208;knitting&#8208;rate strategy enables effective improvement in the porosity of HCPs for porosity&#8208;desired applications.

&lt;p&gt;Hyper-cross-linked polymers (HCPs) with ultra-high porosity, superior physicochemical stability and excellent cost-effectiveness are attractive candidates for methane storage. However, the construction of HCPs with BET surface areas exceeding 3000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; remains extremely challenging.

The BET surface areas of DBM-knitted SHCPs-Br are 44%&#8211;120% higher than that of DCM-knitted SHCPs-Cl using the same building blocks.

         <title>Proton&#8208;Assisted Assembly of Colloidal Nanoparticles into Wafer&#8208;Scale Monolayers in Seconds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proton&#8208;assisted assembly, inspired by Mussel's underwater adhesion, promises scalable but swift self&#8208;limiting assembly of functional nanoparticles for industrial mass production. The efficient transport of nanoparticles is realized from a microscopic volume of water into the wafer&#8208;scale monolayers within several seconds, stemming from the electrostatically accelerated nanoparticle's diffusion.








Abstract
Underwater adhesion processes in nature promise controllable assembly of functional nanoparticles for industrial mass production; However, their artificial strategies have faced challenges to uniformly transfer nanoparticles into a monolayer, particularly those below 100&#160;nm in size, over large areas. Here a scalable &#8220;one&#8208;shot&#8221; self&#8208;limiting nanoparticle transfer technique is presented, enabling the efficient transport of nanoparticles from water in microscopic volumes to an entire 2&#8208;inch wafer in a remarkably short time of 10 seconds to reach near&#8208;maximal surface coverage (&#8776;40%) in a 2D mono&#8208;layered fashion. Employing proton engineering in electrostatic assembly accelerates the diffusion of nanoparticles (over 50 &#181;m2/s), resulting in a hundredfold faster coating speed than the previously reported results in the literature. This charge&#8208;sensitive process further enables &#8220;pick&#8208;and&#8208;place&#8221; nanoparticle patterning at the wafer scale, with large flexibility in surface materials, including flexible metal oxides and 3D&#8208;printed polymers. As a result, the fabrication of wafer&#8208;scale disordered plasmonic metasurfaces in seconds is successfully demonstrated. These metasurfaces exhibit consistent resonating colors across diverse material and geometrical platforms, showcasing their potential for applications in full&#8208;color painting and optical encryption devices.

         <title>Mapping Extracellular Space Features of Viral Encephalitis to Evaluate the Proficiency of Anti&#8208;Viral Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust approach that utilizes single particle diffusion fingerprinting of quantum dots, along with machine learning, to map brain extracellular space features and predict the efficacy of drugs against viral encephalitis is developed.








Abstract
The extracellular space (ECS) is an important barrier against viral attack on brain cells, and dynamic changes in ECS microstructure characteristics are closely related to the progression of viral encephalitis in the brain and the efficacy of antiviral drugs. However, mapping the precise morphological and rheological features of the ECS in viral encephalitis is still challenging so far. Here, a robust approach is developed using single&#8208;particle diffusional fingerprinting of quantum dots combined with machine learning to map ECS features in the brain and predict the efficacy of antiviral encephalitis drugs. These results demonstrated that this approach can characterize the microrheology and geometry of the brain ECS at different stages of viral infection and identify subtle changes induced by different drug treatments. This approach provides a potential platform for drug proficiency assessment and is expected to offer a reliable basis for the clinical translation of drugs.

         <title>Multiple Cations Nanoconfinement in Ultrathin V2O5 Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Ion Diffusion Kinetics Toward High&#8208;performance Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, supramolecular&#160;self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to intercalate unitary cation including NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Al3+ and multiple cations (NH4+ + Na+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+ + Mg2+) in ultrathin V2O5 nanosheets. The success on multiple cations nanoconfinement enables very fast zinc ion diffusion kinetics and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability. The optimized diffusion coefficient of zinc ion (7.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1) in this assembly series surpasses most of the V&#8208;based cathodes reported up to date.








Abstract
Nanoconfinement of cations in layered oxide cathode is an important approach to realize advanced zinc ion storage performance. However, thus far, the conventional hydrothermal/solvothermal route for this nanoconfinement has been restricted to its uncontrollable phase structure and the difficulty on the multiple cation co&#8208;confinement simultaneously. Herein, this work reports a general, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of ultrathin V2O5 nanosheets using various unitary cations including Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Al3+, NH4+, and multiple cations (NH4+ + Na+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+ +Mg2+). The unitary cation confinement results in a remarkable increase in the specific capacity and Zn&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics, and the multiple cation confinement gives rise to superior structural and cycling stability by multiple cation synergetic pillaring effect. The optimized diffusion coefficient of Zn&#8208;ion (7.5 &#215; 10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1) in this assembly series surpasses most of the V&#8208;based cathodes reported up to date. The work develops a novel multiple&#8208;cations nanoconfinement strategy toward high&#8208;performance cathode for aqueous battery. It also provides new insights into the guest cation regulation of zinc&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics through a general, supramolecular assembly pathway.

         <title>Heterojunction&#8208;Induced Rapid Transformation of Ni3+/Ni2+ Sites which Mediates Urea Oxidation for Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ni3+/Ni2+&#8208;mediated urea oxidation pathway is achieved via constructing heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni2P4O12/NiTe), resulting in a record&#8208;high electrocatalytic urea oxidation performance. Furthermore, achieving excellent hydrogen evolution property in a urea electrolysis electrolyzer equipped with Ni2P4O12/NiTe as bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts (Ni2P4O12/NiTe || Ni2P4O12/NiTe), steadily delivering 100 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.475 V over 500 h.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is an environmentally&#8208;friendly strategy for hydrogen production but suffers from significant energy consumption. Substituting urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with lower theoretical voltage for water oxidation reaction adopting nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts engenders reduced energy consumption for hydrogen production. The main obstacle remains strong interaction between accumulated Ni3+ and *COO in the conventional Ni3+&#8208;catalyzing pathway. Herein, a novel Ni3+/Ni2+ mediated pathway for UOR via constructing a heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni2P4O12/NiTe), which efficiently lowers the energy barrier of UOR and avoids the accumulation of Ni3+ and excessive adsorption of *COO on the electrocatalysts, is developed. As a result, Ni2P4O12/NiTe demonstrates an exceptionally low potential of 1.313&#160;V to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 toward efficient urea oxidation reaction while simultaneously showcases an overpotential of merely 24&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction.

&lt;p&gt;A novel Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated urea oxidation pathway is achieved via constructing heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;/NiTe), resulting in a record-high electrocatalytic urea oxidation performance. Furthermore, achieving excellent hydrogen evolution property in a urea electrolysis electrolyzer equipped with Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;/NiTe as bi-functional electrocatalysts (Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;/NiTe || Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;/NiTe), steadily delivering 100 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.475 V over 500 h.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water electrolysis is an environmentally-friendly strategy for hydrogen production but suffers from significant energy consumption. Substituting urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with lower theoretical voltage for water oxidation reaction adopting nickel-based electrocatalysts engenders reduced energy consumption for hydrogen production. The main obstacle remains strong interaction between accumulated Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and *COO in the conventional Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-catalyzing pathway. Herein, a novel Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mediated pathway for UOR via constructing a heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;/NiTe), which efficiently lowers the energy barrier of UOR and avoids the accumulation of Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and excessive adsorption of *COO on the electrocatalysts, is developed. As a result, Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;/NiTe demonstrates an exceptionally low potential of 1.313&#160;V to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; toward efficient urea oxidation reaction while simultaneously showcases an overpotential of merely 24&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for hydrogen evolution reaction. Constructing urea electrolysis electrolyzer using Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;/NiTe at both sides attains 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a low cell voltage of 1.475&#160;V along with excellent stability over 500 h accompanied with nearly 100% Faradic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
The remarkable progress in perovskite solar cell (PSC) technology has witnessed a remarkable leap in efficiency within the past decade. As this technology continues to mature, flexible PSCs (F&#8208;PSCs) are emerging as pivotal components for a wide array of applications, spanning from powering portable electronics and wearable devices to integrating seamlessly into electronic textiles and large&#8208;scale industrial roofing. F&#8208;PSCs characterized by their lightweight, mechanical flexibility, and adaptability for cost&#8208;effective roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing, hold immense commercial potential. However, the persistent concerns regarding the overall stability and mechanical robustness of these devices loom large. This comprehensive review delves into recent strides made in enhancing the mechanical stability of F&#8208;PSCs. It covers a spectrum of crucial aspects, encompassing perovskite material optimization, precise crystal grain regulation, film quality enhancement, strategic interface engineering, innovational developed flexible transparent electrodes, judicious substrate selection, and the integration of various functional layers. By collating and analyzing these dedicated research endeavors, this review illuminates the current landscape of progress in addressing the challenges surrounding mechanical stability. Furthermore, it provides valuable insights into the persistent obstacles and bottlenecks that demand attention and innovative solutions in the field of F&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Sustainable and Rapid Water Purification at the Confined Hydrogel Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the design insight into the peroxymonosulfate activation system by boosting the mass transfer performance within hydrogel interfaces for ultrafast water purification.








Abstract
Emerging organic contaminants in water matrices have challenged ecosystems and human health safety. Persulfate&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes (PS&#8208;AOPs) have attracted much attention as they address potential water purification challenges. However, overcoming the mass transfer constraint and the catalyst's inherent site agglomeration in the heterogeneous system remains urgent. Herein, the abundant metal&#8208;anchored loading (&#8776;6&#8211;8&#160;g m&#8722;2) of alginate hydrogel membranes coupled with cross&#8208;flow mode as an efficient strategy for water purification applications is proposed. The organic flux of the confined hydrogel interfaces sharply enlarges with the reduction of the thickness of the boundary layer via the pressure field. The normalized property of the system displays a remarkable organic (sulfonamides) elimination rate of 4.87 &#215; 104&#160;mg min&#8722;1 mol&#8722;1. Furthermore, due to the fast reaction time (&lt;1&#160;min), cross&#8208;flow mode only reaches a meager energy cost (&#8776;2.21&#160;Wh m&#8722;3) under the pressure drive field. It is anticipated that this finding provides insight into the novel design with ultrafast organic removal performance and low techno&#8208;economic cost (i.e., energy operation cost, material, and reagent cost) for the field of water purification under various PS&#8208;AOPs challenging scenarios.

         <title>Revitalizing Ancient Mitochondria with Nano&#8208;Strategies: Mitochondria&#8208;Remedying Nanodrugs Concentrate on Disease Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondrial quality decrease, oxidative stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, and inflammation are the major features of multiple types of diseases of mitochondrial damage. Mitochodnria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs with different characteristics and remarkable brilliance are committed to ameliorating various diseases by rescuing mitochondria via repairing mitochondrial quality, protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress, inhibiting mPTP and inflammation response and mitochondrial bionics.








Abstract
Mitochondria, widely known as the energy factories of eukaryotic cells, have a myriad of vital functions across diverse cellular processes. Dysfunctions within mitochondria serve as catalysts for various diseases, prompting widespread cellular demise. Mounting research on remedying damaged mitochondria indicates that mitochondria constitute a valuable target for therapeutic intervention against diseases. But the less clinical practice and lower recovery rate imply the limitation of traditional drugs, which need a further breakthrough. Nanotechnology has approached favorable regiospecific biodistribution and high efficacy by capitalizing on excellent nanomaterials and targeting drug delivery. Mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs have achieved ideal therapeutic effects. This review elucidates the significance of mitochondria in various cells and organs, while also compiling mortality data for related diseases. Correspondingly, nanodrug&#8208;mediate therapeutic strategies and applicable mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs in disease are detailed, with a full understanding of the roles of mitochondria dysfunction and the advantages of nanodrugs. In addition, the future challenges and directions are widely discussed. In conclusion, this review provides comprehensive insights into the design and development of mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs, aiming to help scientists who desire to extend their research fields and engage in this interdisciplinary subject.

         <title>Printable Liquid Metal Foams That Grow When Watered</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixing small amounts of water into liquid metal&#8208;matrix pastes (liquid metal foams, LMFs) can give rise to significant foaming due to reactions that evolve hydrogen and produce oxides. The resulting LMFs are porous, electrically conductive, and responsive to environmental conditions. This expansion can be utilized for a type of 4D printing in which patterned conductors &#8220;grow&#8221;, fill cavities, and shape&#8208;morph over time.









Abstract
Pastes and &#8220;foams&#8221; containing liquid metal (LM) as the continuous phase (liquid metal foams, LMFs) exhibit metallic properties while displaying paste or putty&#8208;like rheological behavior. These properties enable LMFs to be patterned into soft and stretchable electrical and thermal conductors through processes conducted at room temperature,&#160;such as printing. The simplest LMFs, featured in this work, are made by stirring LM in air, thereby entraining oxide&#8208;lined air &#8220;pockets&#8221; into the LM. Here, it is reported that mixing small amounts of water (as low as 1 wt%) into such LMFs gives rise to significant foaming by harnessing known reactions that evolve hydrogen and produce oxides. The resulting structures can be &#8776;4&#8211;5&#215; their original volume and possess a fascinating combination of attributes: porosity, electrical conductivity, and responsiveness to environmental conditions. This expansion can be utilized for a type of 4D printing in which patterned conductors &#8220;grow,&#8221; fill cavities, and change shape and density with respect to time. Excessive exposure to water in the long term ultimately consumes the metal in the LMF. However, when exposure to water is controlled, the metallic properties of porous LMFs can be preserved.

         <title>Intense Left&#8208;handed Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Nematic Hydroxypropyl Cellulose Composite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) derived luminescent materials exhibit intense and multicolored left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (CPL), opening the way for the practical application of nanocellulosic chirality in durable multimode anticounterfeiting and enantioselective photopolymerization. The versatility, high glum, and large &#934; of this system will promote its applications in chiral sensing, chiroptical devices, 3D display technologies, and CPL chiral imaging.








Abstract
Integrating optically active components into chiral photonic cellulose to fabricate circularly polarized luminescent materials has transformative potential in disease detection, asymmetric reactions, and anticounterfeiting techniques. However, the lack of cellulose&#8208;based left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (L&#8208;CPL) emissions hampers the progress of these chiral functionalizations. Here, this work proposes an unprecedented strategy: incorporating a chiral nematic organization of hydroxypropyl cellulose with robust aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens to generate intense L&#8208;CPL emission. By utilizing N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide as a good solvent for fluorescent components and cellulose matrices, this work produces a right&#8208;handed chiral nematic structure film with a uniform appearance in reflective and fluorescent states. Remarkably, this system integrates a high asymmetric factor (0.51) and an impressive emission quantum yield (55.8%) into one fascinating composite. More meaningfully, this approach is versatile, allowing for the incorporation of luminogen derivatives emitting multicolored L&#8208;CPL. These chiral fluorescent films possess exceptional mechanical flexibility (toughness up to 0.9 MJ m&#8722;3) and structural stability even under harsh environmental exposures, making them promising for the fabrication of various products. Additionally, these films can be cast on the fabrics to reveal multilevel and durable anticounterfeiting capabilities or used as a chiral light source to induce enantioselective photopolymerization, thereby offering significant potential for diverse practical applications.

         <title>Gold Recovery from E&#8208;Waste by Food&#8208;Waste Amyloid Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an innovative approach to recover gold from e&#8208;waste using protein amyloid aerogels derived from food waste. These aerogels demonstrate exceptional gold adsorption capabilities, transforming gold ions into gold single crystals at the microscopic level and yielding a high&#8208;purity 22&#8208;carat gold nugget in bulk, demonstrating an eco&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;effective potential for gold recovery.








Abstract
Demand for gold recovery from e&#8208;waste grows steadily due to its pervasive use in the most diverse technical applications. Current methods of gold recovery are resource&#8208;intensive, necessitating the development of more efficient extraction materials. This study explores protein amyloid nanofibrils (AF) derived from whey, a dairy industry side&#8208;stream, as a novel adsorbent for gold recovery from e&#8208;waste. To do so, AF aerogels are prepared and assessed against gold adsorption capacity and selectivity over other metals present in waste electrical and electronic equipment (e&#8208;waste). The results demonstrate that AF aerogel has a remarkable gold adsorption capacity (166.7&#160;mg g&#8722;1) and selectivity, making it efficient and an adsorbent for gold recovery. Moreover, AF aerogels are efficient templates to convert gold ions into single crystalline flakes due to Au growth along the (111) plane. When used as templates to recover gold from e&#8208;waste solutions obtained by dissolving computer motherboards in suitable solvents, the process yields high&#8208;purity gold nuggets, constituted by &#8776;90.8&#160;wt% gold (21&#8211;22 carats), with trace amounts of other metals. Life cycle assessment and techno&#8211;economic analysis of the process finally consolidate the potential of protein nanofibril aerogels from food side&#8208;streams as an environmentally friendly and economically viable approach for gold recovery from e&#8208;waste.

         <title>Versatile Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Redox&#8208;Active Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active organic materials, including electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism, are discussed individually. The challenges, solutions, and perspectives are also proposed in this review.








Abstract
Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered organic redox&#8208;active molecules have gained significant attention in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs) due to their low cost, low toxicity, and ease of preparation. Specially, their multiple reaction categories (anion/cation insertion types of reaction) and higher operating voltage, when compared to traditional conjugated carbonyl materials, underscore their promising prospects. However, the high solubility of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox active materials in organic electrolyte and their low electronic conductivity contribute to inferior cycling performance, sluggish reaction kinetics, and limited rate capability. This review provides a detailed overview of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials, encompassing their redox chemistry, solutions to overcome shortcomings, characterization of charge storage mechanisms, and recent progress. Additionally, prospects and directions are proposed for future investigations. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate further exploration of underlying mechanisms and interface chemistry through in situ characterization techniques, thereby promoting the practical application of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials in AMIBs.

         <title>Early Diagnosis and Prognosis Prediction of Pancreatic Cancer Using Engineered Hybrid Core&#8208;Shells in Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops designer Au@SiO2@ZrO2 core&#8208;shells with tunable structural features for direct laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS) based recording of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs), enabling both early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of pancreatic cancer (PC). This work highlights the synergistic effect of core&#8208;shell structures in LDI and offers insights into the material&#8208;based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.








Abstract
Effective detection of bio&#8208;molecules relies on the precise design and preparation of materials, particularly in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS). Despite significant advancements in substrate materials, the performance of single&#8208;structured substrates remains suboptimal for LDI&#8208;MS analysis of complex systems. Herein, designer Au@SiO2@ZrO2 core&#8208;shell substrates are developed for LDI&#8208;MS&#8208;based early diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC). Through controlling Au core size and ZrO2 shell crystallization, signal amplification of metabolites up to 3 orders is not only achieved, but also the synergistic mechanism of the LDI process is revealed. The optimized Au@SiO2@ZrO2 enables a direct record of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) by LDI&#8208;MS. Subsequently, SMFs are employed to distinguish early PC (stage I/II) from controls, with an accuracy of 92%. Moreover, a prognostic prediction scoring system is established with enhanced efficacy in predicting PC survival compared to CA19&#8208;9 (p &lt; 0.05). This work contributes to material&#8208;based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

         <title>Breaking&#8208;down Tumoral Physical Barrier by Remotely Unwrapping Metal&#8208;Polyphenol&#8208;Packaged Hyaluronidase for Optimizing Photothermal/Photodynamic Therapy&#8208;Induced Immune Response</title>

Abstract
The therapy of solid tumors is often hindered by the compact and rigid tumoral extracellular matrix (TECM). Precise reduction of TECM by hyaluronidase (HAase) in combination with nanotechnology is promising for solid tumor therapeutics, yet remains an enormous challenge. Inspired by the treatment of iron poisoning, here we propose a remotely unwrapping strategy of metal&#8208;polyphenol&#8208;packaged HAase (named PPFH) by sequentially injecting PPFH and a clinically used iron&#8208;chelator deferoxamine (DFO). The in situ dynamic disassembly of PPFH could be triggered by the intravenously injected DFO, resulting in the release, reactivation and deep penetration of encapsulated HAase inside tumors. Such a cost&#8208;effective HAase delivery strategy memorably improved the subsequent photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT)&#8208;induced intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells and the cross&#8208;talk between tumor and tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLN), thereby decreasing the immunosuppression and optimizing tumoricidal immune response that can efficiently protect mice from tumor growth, metastasis and recurrence in multiple mouse cancer models. Overall, this work presents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the dynamic disassembly of metal&#8208;polyphenol nanoparticles for extracellular drug delivery as well as the modulation of TECM and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Capillarity Enabled Large&#8208;Array Liquid Metal Electrodes for Compact and High&#8208;Throughput Dielectrophoretic Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile method is proposed to integrate high&#8208;density thick liquid metal alloy (LMA) electrodes in microfluidic devices, leveraging the passive control ability of capillary burst valves with carefully designed burst pressures. This allows self&#8208;assembly of LMA electrode array through simple hand&#8208;push injection. The fabricated 5000 pairs of LMA electrodes are demonstrated to achieve ten times higher throughput in dielectrophoresis deflection.








Abstract
Dielectrophoresis (DEP) particle separation has label&#8208;free, well&#8208;controllable, and low&#8208;damage merits. Sidewall microelectrodes made of liquid metal alloy (LMA) inherits the additional advantage of thick electrodes to generate impactful DEP force. However, existing LMA electrode&#8208;based devices lack the ability to integrate large&#8208;array electrodes in a compact footprint, severely limiting flow rate and thus throughput. Herein, a facile and versatile method is proposed to integrate high&#8208;density thick LMA electrodes in microfluidic devices, taking advantage of the passive control ability of capillary burst valves (CBVs). CBVs with carefully designed burst pressures are co&#8208;designed in microfluidic channels, allowing self&#8208;assembly of LMA electrode array through simple hand&#8208;push injection. The arrayed electrode configuration brings the accumulative DEP deflection effect. Specifically, The fabricated 5000 pairs of sidewall electrodes in a compact chip are demonstrted to achieve ten times higher throughput in DEP deflection. The 5000&#8208;electrode&#8208;pair device is applied to successfully separate four mixed samples, including human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and A549 cells&#160;with the flow rate of 70 &#181;L min&#8722;1. It is envisioned that this work can greatly facilitate LMA electrode array fabrication and offer a robust and versatile platform for DEP separation applications.

         <title>Beyond Conventional Carbon Activation: Creating Porosity without Etching Using Cesium Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient synthetic strategy is proposed for highly porous carbons with a high yield of 25% and a specific surface area of 3008 m2 g&#8722;1 upon thermal treatment of carboxylic acids and Cs2CO3. The unconventional roles of Cs species are unraveled as an electron injector and intercalation agent to promote the formation of carbonaceous frameworks and porous structures.








Abstract
Facile synthesis of porous carbon with high yield and high specific surface area (SSA) from low&#8208;cost molecular precursors offers promising opportunities for their industrial applications. However, conventional activation methods using potassium and sodium hydroxides or carbonates suffer from low yields (&lt;20%) and poor control over porosity and composition especially when high SSAs are targeted (&gt;2000 m2 g&#8722;1) because nanopores are typically created by etching. Herein, a non&#8208;etching activation strategy is demonstrated using cesium salts of low&#8208;cost carboxylic acids as the sole precursor in producing porous carbons with yields of up to 25% and SSAs reaching 3008 m2 g&#8722;1. The pore size and oxygen content can be adjusted by tuning the synthesis temperature or changing the molecular precursor. Mechanistic investigation unravels the non&#8208;classical role of cesium as an activating agent. The cesium compounds that form in situ, including carbonates, oxides, and metallic cesium, have extremely low work function enabling electron injection into organic/carbonaceous framework, promoting condensation, and intercalation of cesium ions into graphitic stacks forming slit pores. The resulting porous carbons deliver a high capacity of 252 mAh g&#8722;1 (567 F g&#8722;1) and durability of 100&#160;000 cycles as cathodes of Zn&#8208;ion capacitors, showing their potential for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Harnessing High&#8208;Throughput Computational Methods to Accelerate the Discovery of Optimal Proton Conductors for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pivoting to advanced computational methods accelerates the discovery of optimal proton conductors. Calculations predict that BaSnxCe0.8&#8208;xYb0.2O3&#8208;&#948; (BSCYb) exhibits superior conductivity and stability over existing materials. Experimental studies confirm these insights, demonstrating outstanding performance in BSCYb&#8208;based protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs). This research underscores the potential of computational methodologies in propelling more efficient PCEC systems for power generation and fuel production.









Abstract
The pursuit of high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lasting protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) is impeded by the lack of efficient and enduring proton conductors. Conventional research approaches, predominantly based on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodology, have proven to be demanding of resources and time&#8208;consuming. Here, this work reports the findings in harnessing high&#8208;throughput computational methods to expedite the discovery of optimal electrolytes for PCECs. This work methodically computes the oxygen vacancy formation energy (EV), hydration energy (EH), and the adsorption energies of H2O and CO2 for a set of 932 oxide candidates. Notably, these findings highlight BaSnxCe0.8&#8208;xYb0.2O3&#8208;&#948; (BSCYb) as a prospective game&#8208;changing contender, displaying superior proton conductivity and chemical resilience when compared to the well&#8208;regarded BaZrxCe0.8&#8208;xY0.1Yb0.1O3&#8208;&#948; (BZCYYb) series. Experimental validations substantiate the computational predictions; PCECs incorporating BSCYb as the electrolyte achieved extraordinary peak power densities in the fuel cell mode (0.52 and 1.57&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 450 and 600 &#176;C, respectively), a current density of 2.62 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3&#160;V and 600 &#176;C in the electrolysis mode while demonstrating exceptional durability for over 1000&#8208;h when exposed to 50% H2O. This research underscores the transformative potential of high&#8208;throughput computational techniques in advancing the field of proton&#8208;conducting oxides for sustainable power generation and hydrogen production.

         <title>Fully Memristive Elementary Motion Detectors for a Maneuver Prediction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully memristive elementary motion detector (M&#8208;EMD) is proposed to emulate the biological vision system. Inspired by the structure and function of the biological motion&#8208;detecting neural circuit, the detector achieves agile and efficient motion detection using a simple configuration composed only of memristors. The proposed detector is applicable to a motion&#8208;detecting element for edge&#8208;level neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Insects can efficiently perform object motion detection via a specialized neural circuit, called an elementary motion detector (EMD). In contrast, conventional machine vision systems require significant computational resources for dynamic motion processing. Here, a fully memristive EMD (M&#8208;EMD) is presented that implements the Hassenstein&#8211;Reichardt (HR) correlator, a biological model of the EMD. The M&#8208;EMD consists of a simple Wye (Y) configuration, including a static resistor, a dynamic memristor, and a Mott memristor. The resistor and dynamic memristor introduce different signal delays, enabling spatio&#8208;temporal signal integration in the subsequent Mott memristor, resulting in a direction&#8208;selective response. In addition, a neuromorphic system is developed employing the M&#8208;EMDs to predict a lane&#8208;changing maneuver by vehicles on the road. The system achieved a high accuracy (&gt; 87%) in predicting future lane&#8208;changing maneuvers on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset while reducing the computational cost by 92.9% compared to the conventional neuromorphic system without the M&#8208;EMD, suggesting its strong potential for edge&#8208;level computing.

     alt="Fully Memristive Elementary Motion Detectors for a Maneuver Prediction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fully memristive elementary motion detector (M-EMD) is proposed to emulate the biological vision system. Inspired by the structure and function of the biological motion-detecting neural circuit, the detector achieves agile and efficient motion detection using a simple configuration composed only of memristors. The proposed detector is applicable to a motion-detecting element for edge-level neuromorphic computing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insects can efficiently perform object motion detection via a specialized neural circuit, called an elementary motion detector (EMD). In contrast, conventional machine vision systems require significant computational resources for dynamic motion processing. Here, a fully memristive EMD (M-EMD) is presented that implements the Hassenstein&#8211;Reichardt (HR) correlator, a biological model of the EMD. The M-EMD consists of a simple Wye (Y) configuration, including a static resistor, a dynamic memristor, and a Mott memristor. The resistor and dynamic memristor introduce different signal delays, enabling spatio-temporal signal integration in the subsequent Mott memristor, resulting in a direction-selective response. In addition, a neuromorphic system is developed employing the M-EMDs to predict a lane-changing maneuver by vehicles on the road. The system achieved a high accuracy (&amp;gt; 87%) in predicting future lane-changing maneuvers on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset while reducing the computational cost by 92.9% compared to the conventional neuromorphic system without the M-EMD, suggesting its strong potential for edge-level computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioengineered Neutrophils for Smart Response in Brain Infection Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CellUs integrates live neutrophils enveloping a liposomal formulation of antibiotic ceftriaxone, steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug dexamethasone, and oxygen&#8208;loaded perfluorocarbon, for treating brain infections. CellUs leverages the natural chemotactic property of neutrophils to penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier, accurately targets infection sites, and synchronizes the release of therapeutic agents under the ultrasound stimulation, thereby combating both bacterial infection and excess inflammatory cytokines.








Abstract
Brain infections, frequently accompanied by significant inflammation, necessitate comprehensive therapeutic approaches targeting both infections and associated inflammation. A major impediment to such combined treatment is the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which significantly restricts therapeutic agents from achieving effective concentrations within the central nervous system. Here, a neutrophil&#8208;centric dual&#8208;responsive delivery system, coined &#8220;CellUs,&#8221; is pioneered. This system is characterized by live neutrophils enveloping liposomes of dexamethasone, ceftriaxone, and oxygen&#8208;saturated perfluorocarbon (Lipo@D/C/P). CellUs is meticulously engineered to co&#8208;deliver antibiotics, anti&#8208;inflammatory agents, and oxygen, embodying a comprehensive strategy against brain infections. CellUs leverages the intrinsic abilities of neutrophils to navigate through BBB, accurately target infection sites, and synchronize the release of Lipo@D/C/P with local inflammatory signals. Notably, the incorporation of ultrasound&#8208;responsive perfluorocarbon within Lipo@D/C/P ensures the on&#8208;demand release of therapeutic agents at the afflicted regions. CellUs shows considerable promise in treating Staphylococcus aureus infections in mice with meningitis, particularly when combined with ultrasound treatments. It effectively penetrates BBB, significantly eliminates bacteria, reduces inflammation, and delivers oxygen to the affected brain tissue, resulting in a substantial improvement in survival rates. Consequently, CellUs harnesses the natural chemotactic properties of neutrophils and offers an innovative pathway to improve treatment effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects.

         <title>Homomultivalent Polymeric Nanotraps Disturb Lipid Metabolism Homeostasis and Tune Pyroptosis in Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically or pharmaceutically modulating lipid metabolism homeostasis is a promising anti&#8208;tumor strategy, while bioactive material&#8208;based interventions are still limited. This study has fabricated homomultivalent supramolecular nanotraps (PTMCD4) by adjusting the density of heptakis (2,3,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;methyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin on the polymer, which effectively reduces phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol levels in tumor cells for perturbed lipid metabolism homeostasis and induces lysosomal stress for tumor cell pyroptosis.








Abstract
Genetic manipulations and pharmaceutical interventions to disturb lipid metabolism homeostasis have emerged as an attractive approach for the management of cancer. However, the research on the utilization of bioactive materials to modulate lipid metabolism homeostasis remains constrained. In this study, heptakis (2,3,6&#8208;tri&#8208;O&#8208;methyl)&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (TMCD) is utilized to fabricate homomultivalent polymeric nanotraps, and surprisingly, its unprecedented ability to perturb lipid metabolism homeostasis and induce pyroptosis in tumor cells is found. Through modulation of the density of TMCD arrayed on the polymers, one top&#8208;performing nanotrap, PTMCD4, exhibits the most powerful cholesterol&#8208;trapping and depletion capacity, thus achieving prominent cytotoxicity toward different types of tumor cells and encouraging antitumor effects in vivo. The interactions between PTMCD4 and biomembranes of tumor cells effectively enable the reduction of cellular phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol levels, thus provoking damage to the biomembrane integrity and perturbation of lipid metabolism homeostasis. Additionally, the interplays between PTMCD4 and lysosomes also induce lysosomal stress, activate the nucleotide&#8208;binding oligomerization domain&#8208;like receptor protein 3 inflammasomes, and subsequently trigger tumor cell pyroptosis. To sum up, this study first introduces dendronized bioactive polymers to manipulate lipid metabolism and has shed light on another innovative insight for cancer therapy.

         <title>Fluidic Ultrasound Generation for Non&#8208;Destructive Testing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;coupled ultrasound enables material characterization and fault detection for specimens that are very large or do not allow contact with other materials. This study presents a novel fluidic transducer that can withstand harsh environments and generates a high&#8208;amplitude ultrasonic signal without impedance mismatch to air. Its usability for time&#8208;of&#8208;flight measurements was&#160;verified and compared to piezoelectric transducers.








Abstract
Air&#8208;coupled ultrasonic testing (ACU) is a pioneering technique in non&#8208;destructive testing (NDT). While contact testing and fluid immersion testing are standard methods in many applications, the adoption of ACU is progressing slowly, especially in the low ultrasonic frequency range. A main reason for this development is the difficulty of generating high amplitude ultrasonic bursts with equipment that is robust enough to be applied outside a laboratory environment. This paper presents the fluidic ultrasonic transducer as a solution to this challenge. This novel aeroacoustic source uses the flow instability of a sonic jet in a bistable fluidic switch to generate ultrasonic bursts up to 60&#160;kHz with a mean peak pressure of 320&#160;Pa. The robust design allows operation in adverse environments, independent of the operating fluid. Non&#8208;contact through&#8208;transmission experiments are conducted on four materials and compared with the results of conventional transducers. For the first time, it is shown that the novel fluidic ultrasonic transducer provides a suitable acoustic signal for NDT tasks and has potential of furthering the implementation of ACU in industrial&#160;applications.

         <title>Functionality Modulation Toward Thianthrene&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodical functionality modulation is carried out to construct an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The incorporation of cyanovinylene linkage enhances the hydrophilicity and stability of the porous polymers. Furthermore, a gradual insertion of electroactive moieties into the structural backbone leads to the construction of a hollow spherical porous polymer as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst.








Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is significant but rarely demonstrated. Porous organic polymers (POPs) with well&#8208;defined electroactive functionalities show superior performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Precise control of the active sites' local environment requires careful modulation of linkers through the judicious selection of building units. Here, a systematic strategy is introduced for modulating functionality to design and synthesize a series of thianthrene&#8208;based bifunctional sp2 C&#9552;C bonded POPs with hollow spherical morphologies exhibiting superior electrocatalytic activity. This precise structural tuning allowed to gain insight into the effects of heteroatom incorporation, hydrophilicity, and variations in linker length on electrocatalytic activity. The most efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst THT&#8208;PyDAN achieves a current density of 10 mA cm&#9472;2 at an overpotential (&#951;10) of &#8776;65 mV (in 0.5 m H2SO4) and &#8776;283 mV (in 1 m KOH) for HER and OER, respectively. THT&#8208;PyDAN exhibits superior activity to all previously reported metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts in the literature. Furthermore, these investigations demonstrate that THT&#8208;PyDAN maintains its performance even after 36 h of chronoamperometry and 1000 CV cycling. Post&#8208;catalytic characterization using FT&#8208;IR, XPS, and microscopic imaging techniques underscores the long&#8208;term durability of THT&#8208;PyDAN.

When fluorine&#8208;free meets bio&#8208;based: the suitable combination of a fluorine&#8208;free lithium bis(oxalato)borate salt with a bio&#8208;based &#436;&#8208;valerolactone solvent is demonstrated in this work. This novel and sustainable electrolyte not only presents enhanced safety and the ability to prevent aluminum dissolution, but also enables the realization of lithium&#8208;ion capacitors with excellent energy&#8208;to&#8208;power performance and outstanding long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
In this work, the properties of a novel electrolyte based on the combination of bio&#8208;based &#436;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL) solvent with lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) salt and its use for lithium&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs) are presented. It is shown that the 1 m LiBOB in GVL electrolyte displays good transport properties, high thermal stability, and the ability to prevent anodic dissolution. Its impact on the performance of both battery&#8208;type and capacitive&#8208;type electrodes is evaluated. In this regard, special attention is paid to the filming properties associated with LiBOB and GVL decomposition at the electrode surfaces. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, the full&#8208;cell devices assembled in this study are the first example of a fluorine&#8208;free LIC. These devices exhibit a favorable energy&#8208;to&#8208;power ratio, delivering 80&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1AM at 10&#160;000&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1AM along with excellent cycling stability, retaining 80% of the initial capacitance after 25&#160;000 cycles. Furthermore, post&#8208;mortem analysis of the LIC electrodes is conducted to gain deeper insights into the degradation mechanisms within the device.

         <title>Infinite Self&#8208;Propulsion of Circularly On/Discharged Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the superhydrophobic surface printed with symmetrical waved alternating potential, the droplets can be circularly charged or discharged during the transport process. By deeply studying the motion mechanisms for neutral droplets and charged droplets, the circularly on/discharged droplets achieve the infinite self&#8208;propulsion (&gt;1000 mm) with an ultrahigh velocity of meters per second.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propulsion of droplets in a controlled and long path at a high&#8208;speed is crucial for organic synthesis, pathological diagnosis and programable lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip. To date, extensive efforts have been made to achieve droplet self&#8208;propulsion by asymmetric gradient, yet, existing structural, chemical, or charge density gradients can only last for a while (&lt;50&#160;mm). Here, this work designs a symmetrical waved alternating potential (WAP) on a superhydrophobic surface to charge or discharge the droplets during the transport process. By deeply studying the motion mechanisms for neutral droplets and charged droplets, the circularly on/discharged droplets achieve the infinite self&#8208;propulsion (&gt;1000&#160;mm) with an ultrahigh velocity of meters per second. In addition, after permutation and combination of two motion styles of the droplets, it can be competent for more interesting work, such as liquid diode and liquid logic gate. Being assembled into a microfluidic chip, the strategy would be applied in chemical synthesis, cell culture, and diagnostic kits.

         <title>3D Noble&#8208;Metal Nanostructures Approaching Atomic Efficiency and Atomic Density Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D amorphous noble metal&#8208;based oxides with simultaneous enhancement on atomic efficiency and density are synthesized by the assistance of atomic channels, where the atomic utilization increases from 18.2% to 59.4%. The mass activity and turnover frequency value of OER for Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than CuO/IrO2&#8208;C and Cu2IrOx&#8208;A. 








Abstract
Noble metals have been widely used in catalysis, however, the scarcity and high cost of noble metal motivate researchers to balance the atomic efficiency and atomic density, which is formidably challenging. This article proposes a robust strategy for fabricating 3D amorphous noble metal&#8208;based oxides with simultaneous enhancement on atomic efficiency and density with the assistance of atomic channels, where the atomic utilization increases from 18.2% to 59.4%. The unique properties of amorphous bimetallic oxides and formation of atomic channels have been evidenced by detailed experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations. Moreover, the universality of the current strategy is validated by other binary oxides. When Cu2IrOx with atomic channels (Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE) is used as catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the mass activity and turnover frequency value of Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than CuO/IrO2 and Cu2IrOx without atomic channels, largely outperforming the reported OER catalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the formation of atomic channels leads to various Ir sites, on which the proton of adsorbed *OH can transfer to adjacent O atoms of [IrO6]. This work may attract immediate interest of researchers in material science, chemistry, catalysis, and beyond.

         <title>Evolution of Grain Boundaries Promoted Hydrogen Production for Industrial&#8208;Grade Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evolution of grain boundaries via Cu&#8208;mediated NiMo bimetallic oxides (MCu&#8208;BNiMo) leading to the high efficiency of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution (HER) in industrial&#8208;grade current density (0.5 A cm&#8208;2 at 2.12 V), which is nearly five&#8208;fold that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art HER electrocatalyst Pt/C.








Abstract
The development of efficient and durable high&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen production electrocatalysts is crucial for the large&#8208;scale production of green hydrogen and the early realization of hydrogen economic blueprint. Herein, the evolution of grain boundaries through Cu&#8208;mediated NiMo bimetallic oxides (MCu&#8208;BNiMo), which leading to the high efficiency of electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution process (HER) in industrial&#8208;grade current density, is successfully driven. The optimal MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo demonstrates ultrahigh current density (&gt;2 A cm&#8722;2) at a smaller overpotential in 1&#160;m KOH (572&#160;mV), than that of BNiMo, which does not have lattice strain. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo with optimal lattice strain generated more electrophilic Mo sites with partial oxidation owing to accelerated charge transfer from Cu to Mo, which lowers the energy barriers for H* adsorption. These synergistic effects lead to the enhanced HER performance of MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo. More importantly, industrial application of MCu0.10&#8208;BNiMo operated in alkaline electrolytic cell is also determined, with its current density reached 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 at 2.12&#160;V and 0.1 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.79&#160;V, which is nearly five&#8208;fold that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art HER electrocatalyst Pt/C. The strategy provides valuable insights for achieving industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production through a highly efficient HER electrocatalyst.

         <title>Microencapsulated Perovskite Crystals via In Situ Permeation Growth from Polymer Microencapsulation&#8208;Expansion&#8208;Contraction Strategy: Advancing a Record Long&#8208;Term Stability beyond 10&#160;000 h for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microencapsulation of PbI2 and perovskite crystals with the in situ polymerized poly(4&#8208;acrylamidopyridine) (poly(4&#8208;AcM)): this novel strategy modulates the PbI2&#8208;ammonium salt reaction through poly(4&#8208;AcM) microencapsulation&#8208;expansion&#8208;contraction behavior. The resultant decelerated crystallization rate fosters high&#8208;quality perovskite film formation, achieving a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 24.04%. Remarkably, after 13 008 h in dry storage, the PCE impressively retains 91% of its initial efficiency.








Abstract
Organic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) bearing both high efficiency and durability are predominantly challenged by inadequate crystallinity of perovskite. Herein, a polymer microencapsulation&#8208;expansion&#8208;contraction strategy is proposed for the first time to optimize the crystallization behavior of perovskite, typically by adeptly harnessing the swelling and deswelling characteristics of poly(4&#8208;acrylamidopyridine) (poly(4&#8208;AcM)) network on PbI2 surface. It can effectively retard the crystallization rate of perovskite, permitting meliorative crystallinity featured by increased grain size from 0.74 to 1.32&#160;&#181;m and reduced trap density from 1.12 &#215; 1016 to 2.56 &#215; 1015 cm&#8722;3.

     alt="Microencapsulated Perovskite Crystals via In Situ Permeation Growth from Polymer Microencapsulation-Expansion-Contraction Strategy: Advancing a Record Long-Term Stability beyond 10&#160;000 h for Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microencapsulation of PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and perovskite crystals with the in situ polymerized poly(4-acrylamidopyridine) (poly(4-AcM)): this novel strategy modulates the PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ammonium salt reaction through poly(4-AcM) microencapsulation-expansion-contraction behavior. The resultant decelerated crystallization rate fosters high-quality perovskite film formation, achieving a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 24.04%. Remarkably, after 13 008 h in dry storage, the PCE impressively retains 91% of its initial efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) bearing both high efficiency and durability are predominantly challenged by inadequate crystallinity of perovskite. Herein, a polymer microencapsulation-expansion-contraction strategy is proposed for the first time to optimize the crystallization behavior of perovskite, typically by adeptly harnessing the swelling and deswelling characteristics of poly(4-acrylamidopyridine) (poly(4-AcM)) network on PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface. It can effectively retard the crystallization rate of perovskite, permitting meliorative crystallinity featured by increased grain size from 0.74 to 1.32&#160;&#181;m and reduced trap density from 1.12 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; to 2.56 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, profiting from the protection of poly(4-AcM) microencapsulation layer, the degradation of the perovskite is markedly suppressed. Resultant PSCs gain a robust power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.04%. Typically, they maintain 91% of their initial PCE for 13&#160;008 h in a desiccated ambient environment and retain 92% PCE after storage for 4000 h with a relative humidity of 50 &#177; 10%, which is the state-of-the-art long-term stability among the reported contributions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Activated Hour&#8208;Long Afterglow from Transparent and Flexible Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Afterglow materials featuring long emission durations ranging from milliseconds to hours have garnered increasing interest owing to their potential applications in sensing, bioimaging, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Unfortunately, polymeric materials rarely exhibit afterglow properties under ambient conditions because of the rapid nonradiative decay rate of triplet excitons. In this study, hour&#8208;long afterglow (HLA) polymer films were fabricated using a facile molecular doping strategy. Flexible and transparent polymer films emitted a bright afterglow lasting over 11&#160;h at room temperature in air, which is one of the best performances among the organic afterglow materials reported to date. Intriguingly, HLA polymer films can be activated by sunlight, and their cyan afterglow in air can be readily observed by the naked eye. Moreover, the HLA color of the polymer films could be tuned from cyan to red through the F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer mechanism. Their application in flexible displays and information storage has also been demonstrated. With remarkable advantages, including an hour&#8208;long and bright afterglow, tunable afterglow colors, superior flexibility and transparency, and ease of fabrication, the HLA polymer paves the way for the practical application of afterglow materials in the engineering sector.

         <title>Chemical Rules for Stacked Kagome and Honeycomb Topological Semimetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We study the chemical rules for predicting and understanding topological states in stacked kagome and honeycomb lattices in both analytical and numerical ways. Starting with a minimal five&#8208;band tight&#8208;binding model, we sort out all the topological states into five groups, which are determined by the interlayer and intralayer hopping parameters. Combined with the model, we design an algorithm to obtain a series of experimentally synthesized topological semimetals with kagome and honeycomb layers, i.e., IAMX family (IA = Alkali metal element, M = Rare earth metal element, X = Carbon group element), in the inorganic crystal structure database. A follow&#8208;up high&#8208;throughput calculation shows that IAMX family materials are all nodal&#8208;line semimetals and they will be Weyl semimetals after taking spin&#8208;orbit coupling into consideration. To have further insights into the topology of the IAMX family, a detailed chemical rule analysis is carried out on the high&#8208;throughput calculations, including the lattice constants of the structure, intralayer and interlayer couplings, bond strengths, electronegativity, and so on, which are consistent with our tight&#8208;binding model. our study provides a way to discover and modulate topological properties in stacked kagome and honeycomb crystals and offers candidates for studying topology&#8208;related properties like topological superconductors and axion insulators.

         <title>Anchoring Charge Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have displayed great potential for improving efficiency and stability in p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells. The anchoring of SAMs at the conduction metal oxide substrates and their interaction with perovskite materials must be rationally tailored to ensure efficient charge carrier extraction and improved quality of the perovskite films. Herein, we selected SAM molecules with different anchoring groups and spacers to control the interaction with perovskite in the p&#8208;i&#8208;n mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells. We found that the monolayer with the carboxylate group exhibits appropriate interaction and has a more favourable orientation and arrangement than that of the phosphate group. This resulted in reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination and enhanced crystallinity. In addition, the short chain length led to an improved energy level alignment of SAMs with perovskite, improving hole extraction. As a result, the narrow bandgap (&#8764;1.25&#160;eV) Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cell devices showed efficiencies of up to 23.1% with an open circuit voltage of up to 0.89&#160;V. Unencapsulated devices retained 93% of their initial efficiency after storage in N2 atmosphere for over 2500 hours. Overall, this work highlights
 the underexplored potential of SAMs for perovskite photovoltaics and provides essential findings on the influence of their structural modification.

         <title>Highly&#8211;Flexible, High&#8211;Performance and Stretchable Piezoelectric Sensor Based on a Hierarchical Droplet&#8211;Shaped Ceramics with Enhanced Damage Tolerance</title>

Abstract
Stretchable self&#8211;powered sensors are of significant interest in next&#8211;generation wearable electronics. However, current strategies for creating stretchable piezoelectric sensors based on piezoelectric polymers or 0&#8211;3 piezoelectric composites face several challenges such as low piezoelectric activity, low sensitivity and poor durability. In this paper, we use a biomimetic soft&#8211;rigid hybrid strategy to construct a new form of highly flexible, high&#8211;performance, and stretchable piezoelectric sensor. Inspired by the hinged bivalve Cristaria plicata, hierarchical droplet&#8211;shaped ceramics were manufactured and used as rigid components, where computational models indicated that the unique arched curved surface and rounded corners of this bionic structure can effectively alleviate stress concentrations. To ensure electrical connectivity of the piezoelectric phase during stretching, a patterned liquid metal acted as a soft circuit and a silicone polymer with optimized wettability and stretchability served as a soft component that formed a strong mechanical interlock with the hierarchical ceramics. The novel sensor design exhibited excellent sensitivity and durability, where the open circuit voltage was shown to remain stable after 5,000 stretching cycles at 60% strain and 5,000 twisting cycles at 180&#176;. To demonstrate its potential in healthcare applications, this new stretchable sensor was successfully used for wireless gesture recognition and the assessment of the progression of knee osteoarthritis.

         <title>Collagen Mineralization Decreases Nk Cell&#8208;Mediated Cytotoxicity of Breast Cancer Cells via Increased Glycocalyx Thickness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Skeletal metastasis is common in patients with advanced breast cancer, and often caused by immune evasion of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). In the skeleton, tumor cells not only disseminate to the bone marrow, but also to osteogenic niches in which they interact with newly mineralizing bone extracellular matrix (ECM). However, it remains unclear how mineralization of collagen type I, the primary component of bone ECM, regulates tumor&#8208;immune cell interactions. Here, we have utilized a combination of synthetic bone matrix models with controlled mineral content, nanoscale optical imaging, and flow cytometry to evaluate how collagen type I mineralization affects the biochemical and biophysical properties of the tumor cell glycocalyx, a dense layer of glycosylated proteins and lipids decorating their cell surface. Our results suggest that collagen mineralization upregulates mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation and sialylation by tumor cells, which increased their glycocalyx thickness while enhancing resistance to attack by Natural Killer (NK) cells. These changes were functionally linked as treatment with a sialylation inhibitor decreased mineralization&#8208;dependent glycocalyx thickness and made tumor cells more susceptible to NK cell attack. Together, our results suggest that interference with glycocalyx sialylation may represent a therapeutic strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapies targeting bone&#8208;metastatic breast cancer.

         <title>Configurational Disorder, Strong Anharmonicity, and Coupled Host Dynamics Lead to Superionic Transport in Li3YCl6 (LYC)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In superionic crystals, liquid&#8208;like ionic diffusivities often come hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity and soft vibrational dynamics. However, generalized relationships between ion transport and vibrational dynamics remain elusive due to the diversity of superionic materials and complex underlying mechanisms. Here, we examine links between vibrational dynamics and ion transport in close&#8208;packed lithium halide ion conductor Li3YCl6 (LYC) using a suite of atomistic first&#8208;principles methods. We show that configurational disorder, lattice anharmonicity, and coupled host&#8208;mobile ion vibrational dynamics together induce a transition to the superionic state. Statistical correlations between ionic hops and activation of the distribution of vibrational modes are found. However, typical phenomena associated with superionic conductors such as selective breakdown of zone&#8208;boundary soft phonons, or long wavelength transverse acoustic modes as in the concept, are not present. Instead, anharmonic zone&#8208;boundary modes aiding Li diffusion are found to broaden and soften selectively but persist across the superionic transition. These anharmonic modes couple Li ion motion with the vibrations of the flexible close&#8208;packed anion framework, which remains stable and facilitates ionic hopping. our results provide insights into how configurational disorder and soft&#8208;yet&#8208;resilient vibrational modes enable ionic hopping, particularly in three&#8208;dimensional close&#8208;packed&#160;crystals.

         <title>Colloidal Synthesis of P&#8208;type Zn3As2 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zinc pnictides, particularly Zn3As2, hold significant promise for optoelectronic applications owing to their intrinsic p&#8208;type behavior and appropriate bandgaps. However, despite the outstanding properties of colloidal Zn3As2 nanocrystals, research in this area is lacking because of the absence of suitable precursors, occurrence of surface oxidation, and intricacy of the crystal structures. In this study, a novel and facile solution&#8208;based synthetic approach is presented for obtaining highly crystalline p&#8208;type Zn3As2 nanocrystals with accurate stoichiometry. By carefully controlling the feed ratio and reaction temperature, colloidal Zn3As2 nanocrystals are successfully obtained. Moreover, the mechanism underlying the conversion of As precursors in the initial phases of Zn3As2 synthesis is elucidated. Furthermore, these nanocrystals have been employed as active layers in field&#8208;effect transistors that exhibit inherent p&#8208;type characteristics with native surface ligands. To enhance the charge transport properties, a dual passivation strategy is introduced via phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange, leading to enhanced hole mobilities as high as 0.089 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. This study not only contributes to the advancement of nanocrystal synthesis, but also opens up new possibilities for previously underexplored p&#8208;type nanocrystal research.

         <title>Crystal Phase Engineering of Ultrathin Alloy Nanostructures for Highly Efficient Electroreduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of RuMo alloy nanoflowers (NFs) with unconventional face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase and hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp)/fcc heterophase is well achieved. Notably, fcc RuMo NFs demonstrate superior catalytic performance toward nitrate electroreduction to ammonia than hcp/fcc RuMo NFs. Mechanism studies reveal that crystal phase engineering of RuMo alloy nanostructures can significantly improve the electroactivity.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) toward ammonia synthesis is recognized as a sustainable strategy to balance the global nitrogen cycle. However, it still remains a great challenge to achieve highly efficient ammonia production due to the complex proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer process in NO3RR. Here, the controlled synthesis of RuMo alloy nanoflowers (NFs) with unconventional face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase and hexagonal close&#8208;packed/fcc heterophase for highly efficient NO3RR is reported. Significantly, fcc RuMo NFs demonstrate high Faradaic efficiency of 95.2% and a large yield rate of 32.7&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 toward ammonia production at 0 and &#8722;0.1&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode), respectively. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations have unraveled that fcc RuMo NFs possess the highest d&#8208;band center with superior electroactivity, which originates from the strong Ru&#9472;Mo interactions and the high intrinsic activity of the unconventional fcc phase. The optimal electronic structures of fcc RuMo NFs supply strong adsorption of key intermediates with suppression of the competitive hydrogen evolution, which further determines the remarkable NO3RR performance. The successful demonstration of high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries with fcc RuMo NFs suggests their substantial application potential in electrochemical energy supply systems.

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Vertical Morphology and Energy Loss in Efficient Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although a suitable vertical phase separation (VPS) morphology is essential for improving charge transport efficiency, reducing charge recombination, and ultimately boosting the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs), there is a lack of theoretical guidance on how to achieve the ideal morphology. Herein, we established a relationship between the molecular structure and the VPS morphology of pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) OSCs by using molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a bridge. We revealed the morphological evolution mechanism by studying four binary systems with vary electrostatic potential difference (&#8710;ESP) between donors and acceptors. Our findings manifest that as &#8710;ESP increases, the active layer is more likely to form a well&#8208;mixed phase, while a smaller &#8710;ESP favors VPS morphology. Interestingly, we also observed that a larger &#8710;ESP led to enhanced miscibility between donors and acceptors, resulting in higher non&#8208;radiative energy losses (&#916;E3). Based on these discoveries, we meticulously designed a ternary PPHJ device with an appropriate &#8710;ESP to obtain better VPS morphology and lower &#916;E3, and achieve an impressive efficiency of 19.09%. Our work demonstrates that by optimizing the &#916;ESP, we can not only control the formation of VPS morphology but also reduce energy losses, paving the way to further boost OSC performance.

A superior armored probiotic (EcN@PC&#8211;Fe/HA) with an inflammation&#8208;targeting capacity is developed to enhance the efficacy and timely action of bacterial therapy against inflammatory bowel disease. EcN@PC&#8211;Fe/HA shows excellent prophylactic efficacy and therapeutic performance against dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced colitis including alleviating inflammation, restoring intestinal barrier function, and reshaping the dysbiosis of intestinal bacteria.








Abstract
Manipulation of the gut microbiota using oral microecological preparations has shown great promise in treating various inflammatory disorders. However, delivering these preparations while maintaining their disease&#8208;site specificity, stability, and therapeutic efficacy is highly challenging due to the dynamic changes associated with pathological microenvironments in the gastrointestinal tract. Herein, a superior armored probiotic with an inflammation&#8208;targeting capacity is developed to enhance the efficacy and timely action of bacterial therapy against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The coating strategy exhibits suitability for diverse probiotic strains and has negligible influence on bacterial viability. This study demonstrates that these armored probiotics have ultraresistance to extreme intraluminal conditions and stable mucoadhesive capacity. Notably, the HA&#8208;functionalized nanoarmor equips the probiotics with inflamed&#8208;site targetability through multiple interactions, thus enhancing their efficacy in IBD therapy. Moreover, timely &#8220;awakening&#8221; of ingested probiotics through the responsive transferrin&#8208;directed degradation of the nanoarmor at the site of inflammation is highly beneficial for bacterial therapy, which requires the bacterial cells to be fully functional. Given its easy preparation and favorable biocompatibility, the developed single&#8208;cell coating approach provides an effective strategy for the advanced delivery of probiotics for biomedical applications at the cellular level.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Carrier Cooling Regulation for Mixed Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin(II) oxalate as a substitute for tin(II) fluoride is used to regulate the hot carrier cooling kinetics, increase the carrier diffusion length, and prolong the carrier lifetime. Based on this strategy, the champion efficiencies of mixed Sn&#8208;Pb and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells are 23.36% and 27.56%, accompanied by significantly improved long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
The rapid relaxation of hot carriers leads to energy loss in the form of heat and consequently restricts the theoretical efficiency of single&#8208;junction solar cells; However, this issue has not received much attention in tin&#8208;lead perovskites solar cells. Herein, tin(II) oxalate (SnC2O4) is introduced into tin&#8208;lead perovskite precursor solution to regulate hot&#8208;carrier cooling dynamics. The addition of SnC2O4 increases the length of carrier diffusion, extends the lifetime of carriers, and simultaneously slows down the cooling rate of carriers. Furthermore, SnC2O4 can bond with uncoordinated Sn2+ and Pb2+ ions to regulate the crystallization of perovskite and enable large grains. The strongly reducing properties of the C2O42&#8722; can inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and minimize the formation of Sn vacancies in the resulting perovskite films. Additionally, as a substitute for tin(II) fluoride, the introduction of SnC2O4 avoids the carrier transport issues caused by the aggregation of F&#8211; ions at the interface. As a result, the SnC2O4&#8208;treated Sn&#8208;Pb cells show a champion efficiency of 23.36%, as well as 27.56% for the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Moreover, the SnC2O4&#8208;treated devices show excellent long&#8208;term stability. This finding is expected to pave the way toward stable and highly efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature, Universal Synthetic Route for Mesoporous Metal Oxides by Exploiting Synergistic Effect of Thermal Activation and Plasma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of thermal activation and plasma enabled low&#8208;temperature synthesis (150&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C) of various mesoporous metal oxide (V2O5, V6O13, TiO2, WO3, Nb2O5, and MoO3), suitable for flexible polymeric substrates. As a proof of concept, the direct synthesis of mesoporous V2O5 is demonstrated on an indium&#8208;tin oxide&#8208;coated polyimide film and its application as electrode materials.








Abstract
Mesoporous metal oxides exhibit excellent physicochemical properties and are widely used in various fields, including energy storage/conversion, catalysis, and sensors. Although several soft&#8208;template approaches are reported, high&#8208;temperature calcination for both metal oxide formation and template removal is necessary, which limits direct synthesis on a plastic substrate for flexible devices. Here, a universal synthetic approach that combines thermal activation and oxygen plasma to synthesize diverse mesoporous metal oxides (V2O5, V6O13, TiO2, Nb2O5, WO3, and MoO3) at low temperatures (150&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C), which can be applicable to a flexible polymeric substrate is introduced. As a demonstration, a flexible micro&#8208;supercapacitor is fabricated by directly synthesizing mesoporous V2O5 on an indium&#8208;tin oxide&#8208;coated colorless polyimide film. The energy storage performance is well maintained under severe bending conditions.

         <title>Control of Charge&#8208;Spin Interconversion in van der Waals Heterostructures with Chiral Charge Density Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tunable charge&#8208;spin interconversion (CSI) is observed in graphene/1T&#8208;TaS2 van der Waals heterostructures by manipulating the charge density wave (CDW) phases in 1T&#8208;TaS2. The output of one of the CSI components switches off with the commensurability of the CDW phases. First&#8208;principles calculations support that chiral CDW multidomains in the heterostructure are at the origin of the switching of CSI.








Abstract
A charge density wave (CDW) represents an exotic state in which electrons are arranged in a long&#8208;range ordered pattern in low&#8208;dimensional materials. Although the understanding of the fundamental character of CDW is enriched after extensive studies, its practical application remains limited. Here, an unprecedented demonstration of a tunable charge&#8208;spin interconversion (CSI) in graphene/1T&#8208;TaS2 van der Waals heterostructures is shown by manipulating the distinct CDW phases in 1T&#8208;TaS2. Whereas CSI from spins polarized in all three directions is observed in the heterostructure when the CDW phase does not show commensurability, the output of one of the components disappears, and the other two are enhanced when the CDW phase becomes commensurate. The experimental observation is supported by first&#8208;principles calculations, which evidence that chiral CDW multidomains in the heterostructure are at the origin of the switching of CSI. The results uncover a new approach for on&#8208;demand CSI in low&#8208;dimensional systems, paving the way for advanced spin&#8208;orbitronic devices.

         <title>Freeze&#8208;Thaw Microfluidic System Produces &#8220;Themis&#8221; Nanocomplex for Cleaning Persisters&#8208;Infected Macrophages and Enhancing Uninfected Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC) is fabricated via a microfluidic chip based on the freeze&#8208;thaw strategy. For infected macrophages, TNC releases heme to reconstruct the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. For uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulates TCA cycle and OXPHOS, contributing to the immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacteria therapy.








Abstract
Macrophages are the primary effectors against potential pathogen infections. They can be &#8220;parasitized&#8221; by intracellular bacteria, serving as &#8220;accomplices&#8221;, protecting intracellular bacteria and even switching them to persisters. Here, using a freeze&#8208;thaw strategy&#8208;based microfluidic chip, a &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC) is created. The TNC consists of Lactobacillus reuteri&#8208;derived membrane vesicles, heme, and vancomycin, which cleaned infected macrophages and enhanced uninfected macrophages. In infected macrophages, TNC releases heme that led to the reconstruction of the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. The revived bacteria produces virulence factors that destroyed host macrophages (accomplices), thereby being externalized and becoming vulnerable to immune responses. In uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulates the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), contributing to immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC of cleaning the accomplice (infected macrophages) and reinforcing uninfected macrophages provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacterial therapy.

For uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulates TCA cycle and OXPHOS, contributing to the immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacteria therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macrophages are the primary effectors against potential pathogen infections. They can be &#8220;parasitized&#8221; by intracellular bacteria, serving as &#8220;accomplices&#8221;, protecting intracellular bacteria and even switching them to persisters. Here, using a freeze-thaw strategy-based microfluidic chip, a &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC) is created. The TNC consists of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus reuteri&lt;/i&gt;-derived membrane vesicles, heme, and vancomycin, which cleaned infected macrophages and enhanced uninfected macrophages. In infected macrophages, TNC releases heme that led to the reconstruction of the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. The revived bacteria produces virulence factors that destroyed host macrophages (accomplices), thereby being externalized and becoming vulnerable to immune responses. In uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulates the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), contributing to immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC of cleaning the accomplice (infected macrophages) and reinforcing uninfected macrophages provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacterial therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Resonant Band Hybridization in Alloyed Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterobilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bandstructure engineering using alloying is widely utilised for achieving optimised performance in modern semiconductor devices. While alloying has been studied in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, its application in van der Waals heterostructures built from atomically thin layers is largely unexplored. Here, we fabricate heterobilayers made from monolayers of WSe2 (or MoSe2) and MoxW{1}Se2 alloy and observe nontrivial tuning of the resultant bandstructure as a function of concentration x. we monitor this evolution by measuring the energy of photoluminescence (PL) of the interlayer exciton (IX) composed of an electron and hole residing in different monolayers. In MoxW{1}Se2/WSe2, we observe a strong IX energy shift of 100 meV for varied from 1 to 0.6. However, for 0.6 this shift saturates and the IX PL energy asymptotically approaches that of the indirect bandgap in bilayer WSe2. we theoretically interpret this observation as the strong variation of the conduction band K valley for 0.6, with IX PL arising from the K transition, while for 0.6, the bandstructure hybridization becomes prevalent leading to the dominating momentum&#8208;indirect KQ transition. This bandstructure hybridization is accompanied with strong modification of IX PL dynamics and nonlinear exciton properties. our work provides foundation for bandstructure engineering in van der Waals heterostructures highlighting the importance of hybridization effects and opening a way to devices with accurately tailored electronic&#160;properties.

         <title>Enhancing Photosynthesis Efficiency of Hydrogen Peroxide by Modulating Side Chains to Facilitate Water Oxidation at Low&#8208;Energy Barrier Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial oxidant in advanced oxidation processes. Its in&#8208;situ photosynthesis in natural water holds the promise of practical application for water remediation. However, current photosynthesis of H2O2 systems primarily relies on oxygen reduction, leading to limited performance in natural water with low dissolved oxygen or anaerobic conditions found in polluted water. Herein, we introduce a novel photocatalyst based on conjugated polymers with alternating electron donor&#8208;acceptor structures and electron&#8208;withdrawing side chains on electron donors. Specifically, carbazole functions as the electron donor, triazine serves as the electron acceptor, and cyano acts as the electron&#8208;withdrawing side chain. Notably, the photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 0.64%, the highest reported in natural water. Furthermore, even in anaerobic conditions, it achieves an impressive H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of 1365 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1, surpassing all the reported photosynthetic systems of H2O2. This remarkable improvement is attributed to the effective relocation of the water oxidation active site from a high&#8208;energy carbazole to a low&#8208;energy acetylene site mediated by the side chains, resulting in enhanced O2 or H2O2 generation from water. This breakthrough offers a new avenue for efficient water remediation using advanced oxidation technologies in oxygen&#8208;limited environments, holding significant implications for environmental restoration.

         <title>Sticky and Strain&#8208;Gradient Artificial Epineurium for Sutureless Nerve Repair in Rodents and Nonhuman Primates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The need for the development of soft materials capable of stably adhering to nerve tissues without any suturing followed by additional damages has been at the fore at a time when success in postoperative recovery depends largely on the surgical experience and/or specialized microsuturing skills of the surgeon. Despite fully recognizing such prerequisite conditions, designing the materials with robust adhesion to wet nerves as well as acute/chronic anti&#8208;inflammation remains to be resolved. Herein, we present a sticky and strain&#8208;gradient artificial epineurium (SSGAE) that overcomes the most critically challenging aspect for realizing sutureless repair of severely injured nerves. In this regard, the SSGAE with a skin&#8208;inspired hierarchical structure entailing strain&#8208;gradient layers, anisotropic Janus layers including hydrophobic top and hydrophilic bottom surfaces, and synergistic self&#8208;healing capabilities enables immediate and stable neurorrhaphy in both rodent and nonhuman primate models, indicating that our bioinspired materials strategy significantly contributes to translational medicine for effective peripheral nerve repair.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Structured Covalent Organic Frameworks Nano&#8208;Coatings with Active and Angle&#8208;Independent Structural Coloration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;performance multifunctional nanocoatings not only protect and enhance substrate materials, but also offer additional functionalities. This demands a sophisticated coordination of the coating's inherent properties and microstructural features. Here we present a multi&#8208;functional active nanocoating via meta&#8208;structural engineering of covalent organic framework (COF) deposition materials. Our COF nanocoating, characterized by well&#8208;defined micropores (1&#8208;2&#160;nm), meta&#8208;structured textures (30&#8208;300&#160;nm), tailored thickness (100&#8208;300&#160;nm), and good uniformness, showcases a unique combination of angle&#8208;independent structural coloration and ultrafast responsiveness to gaseous stimuli. Remarkably, it demonstrates good compatibility with a wide range of inert substrate materials, from rigid ones like glass and metal to flexible elastomers and nanomaterial films of various shapes and sizes. This versatility enables the facile development of devices that can optically report information about their environments. Examples include chemically active coatings with ultrafast (&#8764; 10&#160;ms) color&#8208;changing behaviors and programmable actuation behaviors upon exposure to gaseous stimuli, and mechanically active coatings that can detect substrate strain up to 50% yet maintain structural robustness and consistent coloration hue. We believe that meta&#8208;structural engineering of COF nanocoatings on inert substrates could enable them to respond to environmental stimuli, potentially indicating a new trend in developing multifunctional materials and smart devices.

         <title>Microalgae&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Its Associated Anxiety and Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) exhibit a notable prevalence of psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression. Nevertheless, the etiology of psychiatric disorders associated with IBD remains uncertain, and an efficacious treatment approach has yet to be established. Herein, we propose an oral hydrogel strategy (SP@Rh&#8208;gel) for co&#8208;delivery of Spirulina platensis and rhein to treat IBD and IBD&#8208;associated anxiety and depression by modulating the microbiota&#8208;gut&#8208;brain axis. SP@Rh&#8208;gel improves the solubility, release characteristics and intestinal retention capacity of the drug, leading to a significant improvement in the oral therapeutic efficacy. Oral administration of SP@Rh&#8208;gel inhibits NF&#8208;&#954;B&#8208;caspase&#8208;1 signaling pathway to reduce intestinal inflammation and rebalances the disrupted intestinal microbial community to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Furthermore, SP@Rh&#8208;gel maintains intestinal barrier integrity and reduces the release of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharides and their entry into the hippocampus through the blood&#8208;brain barrier, thereby inhibiting neuroinflammation and maintaining neuroplasticity. SP@Rh&#8208;gel significantly alleviates the colitis symptoms, as well as anxiety&#8208; and depression&#8208;like behaviors, in a chronic colitis mouse model. This study demonstrates the significant involvement of the microbiota&#8208;gut&#8208;brain axis in the development of IBD with psychiatric disorders and proposes a safe, simple, and highly efficient therapeutic approach for managing IBD and comorbid psychiatric disorders.

         <title>Piezoionic Elastomers by Phase And Interface Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Energy&#8208;Harvesting Ionotronics</title>

Abstract
Piezoionic materials play a pivotal role in energy&#8208;harvesting ionotronics. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing the structural requirements for voltage generation, current conduction, and mechanical adaptability. The conventional approach of employing crystalline heterostructures for stress concentration and localized charge separation, while effective for voltage generation, often compromises the stretchability and long&#8208;range charge transport found in homogeneous quasi&#8208;solid states. Herein, we introduce phase and interface engineering strategy to address this dilemma and present a piezoionic elastomer that seamlessly integrates ionic liquids and ionic plastic crystals, forming a finely tuned microphase&#8208;separated structure with an intermediate phase. This approach promotes charge separation via stress concentration among hard phases while leveraging the high ionic charge mobility in soft and intermediate phases. Impressively, the elastomer achieves an extraordinary piezoionic coefficient of about 6.0&#160;mV kPa&#8722;1, a more than threefold improvement over current hydrogels and ionogels. The resulting power density of 1.3 &#956;W cm&#8722;3 sets a new benchmark, exceeding that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezoionic gels. Notably, our elastomer combines outstanding stretchability, remarkable toughness, and rapid self&#8208;healing capability, underscoring its potential for real&#8208;world applications. This work may represent a stride toward mechanically robust energy harvesting systems and provide insights into ionotronic systems for human&#8208;machine interaction.

         <title>Engineered Bio&#8208;Heterojunction Confers Extra&#8208; and Intracellular Bacterial Ferroptosis and Hunger&#8208;Triggered Cell Protection for Diabetic Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precise ferroptosis bio&#8208;heterojunction (F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ) consisting of Fe2O3, Ti3C2&#8208;MXene, and glucose oxidase is developed to induce extra&#8208;intracellular bacteria&#8208;targeted ferroptosis for infected diabetic cutaneous regeneration. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ induces extracellular bacterial ferroptosis via photothermal, photodynamic, and chemodynamic properties and assists macrophages against intracellular bacteria via ferroportin&#8208;mediated bacterial ferroptosis and hunger&#8208;triggered AMPK pathway&#8208;mediated cell protection, elevating the biocompatibility of ferroptosis&#8208;mediated therapeutic strategies.








Abstract
Nanomaterial&#8208;mediated ferroptosis has garnered considerable interest in the antibacterial field, as it invokes the disequilibrium of ion homeostasis and boosts lipid peroxidation in extra&#8208; and intracellular bacteria. However, current ferroptosis&#8208;associated antibacterial strategies indiscriminately pose damage to healthy cells, ultimately compromising their biocompatibility. To address this daunting issue, this work has designed a precise ferroptosis bio&#8208;heterojunction (F&#8208;bio&#8208;HJ) consisting of Fe2O3, Ti3C2&#8208;MXene, and glucose oxidase (GOx) to induce extra&#8208;intracellular bacteria&#8208;targeted ferroptosis for infected diabetic cutaneous regeneration. Fe2O3/Ti3C2&#8208;MXene@GOx (FMG) catalytically generates a considerable amount of ROS which assaults the membrane of extracellular bacteria, facilitating the permeation of synchronously generated Fe2+/Fe3+ into bacteria under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, causing planktonic bacterial death via ferroptosis, Fe2+ overload, and lipid peroxidation. Additionally, FMG facilitates intracellular bacterial ferroptosis by transporting Fe2+ into intracellular bacteria via inward ferroportin (FPN). With GOx consuming glucose, FMG creates hunger protection which helps macrophages escape cell ferroptosis by activating the adenosine 5&#8217;&#8208;monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. In vivo results authenticate that FMG boosts diabetic infectious cutaneous regeneration without triggering ferroptosis in normal cells. As envisaged, the proposed tactic provides a promising approach to combat intractable infections by precisely terminating extra&#8208;intracellular infection via steerable ferroptosis, thereby markedly elevating the biocompatibility of therapeutic ferroptosis&#8208;mediated strategies.

         <title>Ln&#8208;Mof&#8208;Based Hydrogel Films with Tunable Luminescence and Afterglow Behavior for Visual Detection of Ofloxacin and Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Applications</title>

Abstract
Highly selective and sensitive quantitative detection of ofloxacin (OFX) at ultra&#8208;low concentrations in aqueous media and development of new afterglow materials remains a challenge. Herein, a new 2D water&#8208;stable lanthanide metal&#8208;organic framework (NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb) is proposed, which exhibits high selectivity towards OFX through the luminescence quenching with the lowest detection limit (1.1&#160;nM) reported to date and a fast response within 6 s. In addition, the luminescence detection of OFX by NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb was not affected by typical components of blood plasma and urine. The excellent sensing effect of NIIC&#8208;2&#8208;Tb was further utilized to prepare a composite functional sensing carrageenan hydrogel material for the rapid detection of OFX in meat in real time and the first discovery of impressive afterglow in MOF&#8208;based hydrogels. This study not only presents novel Ln&#8208;MOF materials and Ln&#8208;MOF&#8208;based hydrogel films for luminescent sensing of OFX, but also demonstrates color&#8208;tunable luminescent films with afterglow, which expands the application of composite luminescent materials for detection and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Monolithic 2d Perovskites Enabled Artificial Photonic Synapses for Neuromorphic Vision Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neuromorphic visual sensors (NVS) based on photonic synapses hold a significant promise to emulate the human visual system. However, current photonic synapses rely on exquisite engineering of the complex heterogeneous interface to realize learning and memory functions, resulting in high fabrication cost, reduced reliability, high energy consumption and uncompact architecture, severely limiting the up&#8208;scaled manufacture and on&#8208;chip integration. Here we innovate a photo&#8208;memory fundamental based on ion&#8208;exciton coupling to simplify synaptic structure and minimize energy consumption. Due to the intrinsic organic/inorganic interface within the crystal, the photodetector based on monolithic 2D perovskite exhibits a persistent photocurrent lasting about 90 s, enabling versatile synaptic functions. The electrical power consumption per synaptic event is estimated to be ca. 1.45&#215;10&#8722;16 J, one order of magnitude lower than that in a natural biological system. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept image preprocessing using the neuromorphic vision sensors enabled by photonic synapse demonstrates 4 times enhancement of classification accuracy. Furthermore, getting rid of the artificial neural network, an expectation&#8208;based thresholding model is put forward to mimic the human visual system for facial recognition. This conceptual device unveils a new mechanism to simplify synaptic structure, promising the transformation of the NVS and fostering the emergence of next generation neural networks.

         <title>Enabling Self&#8208;Adaptive Water&#8208;Energy&#8208;Balance of Photothermal Water Diode Evaporator: Dynamically Maximizing Energy Utilization Under the Ever&#8208;Changing Sunlight</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Maintaining a match between input solar energy and required energy by water supply management is key to achieving efficient interfacial solar&#8208;driven evaporation (ISDE). In practice, the solar radiation flux is constantly changing throughout the day, so keeping a dynamic water&#8208;energy&#8208;balance of ISDE is a big challenge. Herein, a photothermal water diode (WD) evaporator concept is proposed by an integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic Janus absorber to overcome the issue. Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, a self&#8208;adaptive balance between photothermal energy input and water uptake is established, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization. The experimental and simulation results exhibit that with the increase of sunlight intensity, the water supply speed is significantly accelerated due to the dynamic management and self&#8208;regulation on water replenishment. Therefore, an excellent evaporation rate of up to 2.14&#160;kg m&#8211;2&#160;h&#8211;1 with a high efficiency of 93.7% under one sun illumination is achieved. This water diode engineering with Janus wettability provides a novel strategy and extends the path for designing solar evaporation systems with diverse water supply properties, which shows great potential in different environmental conditions.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;emitting Diodes Based on Chiral Hole Transport Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) demonstrate promising application in 3D display due to the direct generation of circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). But the chiral luminescence materials face challenges as intricated synthetic route and enantiomeric separation, etc. Herein, we design fresh CP&#8208;OLEDs based on chiral hole transport material instead of chiral emitters. A pair of hole transport enantiomers (R/S&#8208;NPACZ) exhibit intense dissymmetry factors (|gPL|) about 5.0&#215;10&#8722;3. With R/S&#8208;NPACZ as hole transport layers, CP&#8208;OLEDs were fabricated employing six achiral phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with different wavelengths, in consistence with the generated CPEL spectra. The CP&#8208;OLEDs based on achiral red, green and blue iridium(III) complexes exhibit external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 14.9%, 30.7% and 14.1% with |gEL| factors of 8.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4, 2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. Moreover, the devices using achiral blue, blueish&#8208;green and green TADF materials display EQEs of 24.1%, 17.9% and 25.4% with |gEL| factors of 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3,3.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. As far as we know, it is the first example of CP&#8208;OLEDs based on chiral hole transport materials, which act as the organic circularly polarizers and have potential to generate CPEL from achiral luminescence materials.

         <title>Progress in Anode Stability Improvement for Seawater Electrolysis to Produce Hydrogen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production is a sustainable and economical approach that can mitigate the energy crisis and global warming issues. Although various catalysts/electrodes with excellent activities have been developed for high&#8208;efficiency seawater electrolysis, their unsatisfactory durability, especially for anodes, severely impedes their industrial applications. In this review, attention is paid to the factors that affect the stability of anodes and the corresponding strategies for designing catalytic materials to prolong the anode lifetime. In addition, two important aspects&#8212;electrolyte optimization and electrolyzer design&#8212;with respect to anode stability improvement are summarized. Furthermore, several methods for rapid stability assessment are proposed for the fast screening of both highly active and stable catalysts/electrodes. Finally, perspectives on future investigations aimed at improving the stability of seawater electrolysis systems are outlined.

         <title>Hydrogen Bonds&#8208;Pinned Entanglement Blunting The Interfacial Crack of Hydrogel&#8208;Elastomer Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anchoring a layer of amorphous hydrogel on an antagonistic elastomer has potential applications in surface aqueous lubrication. However, the interfacial crack propagation usually occurs under continuous loads for amorphous hydrogel, leading to the failure of hydrogel interface. This work presents a universal strategy to blunt the interfacial cracks by designing a hydrogen bonds&#8208;pinned entanglement (Hb&#8208;En) structure of amorphous hydrogel on engineering elastomers. The unique Hb&#8208;En structures is created by pinning well&#8208;tailored entanglements via covalent&#8208;like hydrogen bonds, which can amplify the delocalization of interfacial stress concentration and elevate the necessary fracture energy barrier within hydrogel interface. Therefore, the interfacial crack propagation could be suppressed under single and cyclic loads, resulting in a high interfacial toughness over 1650 J/m2 and an excellent interfacial fatigue threshold of 423 J/m2. Such a strategy universally works on blunting the interfacial crack between hydrogel coating and various elastomer materials with arbitrary shapes. The superb fatigue&#8208;crack insensitivity at the interface allows for durable aqueous lubrication of hydrogel coating with low friction.

         <title>Mechanical Stimulation of Anti&#8208;inflammatory And Antioxidant Hydrogels for Rapid Re&#8208;epithelialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The epithelium, an essential barrier to protect organisms against infection, exists in many organs. However, rapid re&#8208;epithelialization to restore tissue integrity and function in an adverse environment is challenging. In this work, we report a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant hydrogel with mechanical stimulation for rapid re&#8208;epithelialization, mainly composed of the small molecule thioctic acid, biocompatible glycine and &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanoparticles. Glycine&#8208;modified supramolecular thioctic acid is stable and possesses outstanding mechanical properties. The incorporating &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 providing the potential contrast function for magnetic resonance imaging observation, can propel hydrogel reconfiguration to enhance the mechanical properties of the hydrogel underwater due to water&#8208;initiated release of Fe3+. In vitro experiments showed that the hydrogels effectively reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species, guided macrophages toward M2 polarization, and alleviated inflammation. The effect of rapid re&#8208;epithelialization was ultimately demonstrated in a long urethral injury model in vivo, and the mechanical stimulation of hydrogels achieved effective functional replacement and ultimately accurate remodeling of the epithelium. Notably, the proposed strategy provides an advanced alternative treatment for patients in need of large&#8208;area epithelial reconstruction.

         <title>Steering CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products via Enhancing Localized *Co Coverage And Local Pressure in Conical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) involves a multistep proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process that generates a variety of intermediates, making it challenging to transform them into target products with high activity and selectivity. Here, we report a catalyst featuring a nanosheets&#8208;stacked sphere structure with numerous open and deep conical cavities (OD&#8208;CCs). Under the guidance of finite&#8208;element method (FEM) simulations and theoretical analysis, we showed that exerting control over the confinement space resulted in diffusion limitation of the carbon intermediates, thereby increasing local pressure and subsequently enhancing localized *CO coverage for dimerization. The nanocavities exhibited a structure&#8208;driven shift in selectivity of multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) product from 41.8% to 81.7% during the CO2RR process.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
The artificial disturbance in the nitrogen cycle has necessitated an urgent need for nitric oxide (NO) removal. Electrochemical technologies for NO conversion have gained increasing attention in recent years. This comprehensive review presents the recent advancements in selective electrocatalytic conversion of NO to high value&#8208;added chemicals, with specific emphasis on catalyst design, electrolyte composition, mass diffusion, and adsorption energies of key intermediate species. Furthermore, the review explores the synergistic electrochemical co&#8208;electrolysis of NO with specific carbon source molecules, enabling the synthesis of a range of valuable chemicals with C&#8208;N bonds. It also provides in&#8208;depth insights into the intricate reaction pathways and underlying mechanisms, offering valuable perspectives on the challenges and prospects of selective NO electrolysis. By advancing comprehension and fostering awareness of nitrogen cycle balance, this review contributes to the development of efficient and sustainable electrocatalytic systems for the selective synthesis of valuable chemicals from NO.

         <title>Interlayer Bi&#8208;Atomic Pair Bridging the van der Waals Gap for 100% Activation of Two&#8208;Dimensional Layered Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials are regarded as prospective catalyst candidates due to their advantageous atomic exposure ratio. Nevertheless, the predominant population of atoms residing on the basal plane, exhibiting saturated coordination, exhibit inert behavior, while a mere fraction of atoms located at the periphery display reactivity. Here, we report a novel approach to attain complete atom activation in 2D layered materials through the construction of an interlayer bi&#8208;atomic pair bridge. The atoms in question have been strategically optimized to achieve a highly favorable state for the adsorption of intermediates. This optimization results in the introduction of new gap states around the Fermi level. Moreover, the presence of the interlayer bridge facilitates the electron transfer across the van der Waals gap, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics. The hydrogen evolution reaction exhibits an impressive ultrahigh current density of 2000&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 at 397&#160;mV, surpassing the pristine MoS2 by approximately two orders of magnitude (26&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 at 397&#160;mV). Our study provides new insights for enhancing the efficacy of 2D layered catalysts.

         <title>Engineering A Dynamic Solvent&#8208;phobic Liquid Electrolyte Interphase for Long&#8208;life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The heterogeneity, species diversity, and poor mechanical stability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in conventional carbonate electrolytes result in the irreversible exhaustion of lithium (Li) and electrolytes during cycling, hindering the practical applications of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, we propose a solvent&#8208;phobic dynamic liquid electrolyte interphase (DLEI) on a Li metal (Li&#8211;PFbTHF (perfluoro&#8208;butyltetrahydrofuran)) surface that selectively transports salt and induces salt&#8208;derived SEI formation. The solvent&#8208;phobic DLEI with C&#8211;F&#8208;rich groups dramatically reduced the side reactions between Li, carbonate solvents, and humid air, forming a LiF/Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics demonstrated that DLEI effectively stabilized the interface between Li metal and the carbonate electrolyte. Specifically, the LiFePO4||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells deliver 80.4% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1.0 C, excellent rate capacity (108.2 mAh g&#8211;1 at 5.0 C), and 90.2% capacity retention after 550 cycles at 1.0 C in full&#8208;cells (negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 8) with high LiFePO4 loadings (15.6&#160;mg cm&#8211;2) in carbonate electrolyte. In addition, the 0.55 Ah pouch cell of 252.0&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 delivered stable cycling. Hence, this study provides an effective strategy for controlling salt&#8208;derived SEI to improve the cycling performances of carbonate&#8208;based LMBs.

         <title>Enhancing Purely Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence via Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Long&#8208;lived and highly efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are in high demand for practical applications in lighting and display, security signboards, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Achieving RTP in aqueous solutions, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence emission and NIR&#8208;excited RTP are crucial for applications in bio&#8208;imaging, but these goals pose significant challenges. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly provides an effective strategy to address the above problems. This review focuses on the recent advances in the enhancement of RTP via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, covering four key aspects: small molecular self&#8208;assembly, cocrystals, the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic hosts and guests, and multi&#8208;stage supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. This review not only highlights progress in these areas but also underscores the prominent challenges associated with developing supramolecular RTP materials. The resulting strategies for the development of high&#8208;performance supramolecular RTP materials are discussed, aiming to satisfy the practical applications of RTP materials in biomedical science.

         <title>Ultrasound Imaging of Tumor Vascular CD93 with MMRN2 Modified Microbubbles for Immune Microenvironment Prediction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Vascular microenvironment is found to be closely related to immunotherapy efficacy. Identification and ultrasound imaging of the unique vascular characteristics able to predict immune microenvironment are important for immunotherapy decision&#8208;making. Herein, it is proved that high CD93 expression in the tumor vessels is closely related to the poor immune response of prostate cancer. For ultrasound molecular imaging of CD93, CD93&#8208;targeted microbubbles (MBs) consisted of a gaseous core and the MMRN2 (Multimerin&#8208;2) containing cell membrane/lipid hybrid membrane are then synthesized. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that these MBs can recognize CD93 efficiently and then accumulate within tumor regions highly expressing CD93. Contrast&#8208;enhanced ultrasound imaging with CD93&#8208;targeted MBs demonstrates that ultrasound intensity is negatively related with inflammatory tumor immune microenvironment and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Together, endothelial expression of CD93 in tumor is a unique predictor of immunosuppressive microenvironment and CD93&#8208;targeted MBs have a great potential of evaluating tumor immune status.

         <title>Direct Observation of Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Skyrmion Motion Driven by Ultra&#8208;Low Current Density in Van Der Waals Ferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The recent discovery of room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism in 2&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials, such as Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT), has garnered significant interest in offering a robust platform for 2D spintronic applications. Various fundamental operations essential for the realization of 2D spintronics devices have been experimentally confirmed using these materials at room temperature, such as current&#8208;induced magnetization switching or tunneling magnetoresistance. Nevertheless, the potential applications of magnetic skyrmions in FGaT systems at room temperature remain unexplored. In this work, the current&#8208;induced generation of magnetic skyrmions in FGaT flakes employing high&#8208;resolution magnetic transmission soft X&#8208;ray microscopy is introduced, supported by a feasible mechanism based on thermal effects. Furthermore, direct observation of the current&#8208;induced magnetic skyrmion motion at room temperature in FGaT flakes is presented with ultra&#8208;low threshold current density. Our work highlights the potential of FGaT as a foundation for room&#8208;temperature&#8208;operating 2D skyrmion device applications.

         <title>Boosting The Performances of Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics via Synergetic Near&#8208;infrared Light Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) offer promising prospects for application in building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic systems and greenhouses, but further improvement of their performance faces a delicate trade&#8208;off between the two competing indexes of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). Herein, we take advantage of coupling plasmonics with the optical design of ST&#8208;OPVs to enhance near&#8208;infrared absorption and hence simultaneously improve efficiency and visible transparency to the maximum extent. By integrating core&#8208;bishell PdCu@Au@SiO2 nanotripods that act as optically isotropic Lambertian sources with near&#8208;infrared&#8208;customized localized surface plasmon resonance in an optimal ternary PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based ST&#8208;OPV, we show that their interplay with a multilayer optical coupling layer, consisting of ZnS(130&#160;nm)/Na3AlF6(60&#160;nm)/WO3(100&#160;nm)/LaF3(50&#160;nm) identified from high&#8208;throughput optical screening, leads to a record&#8208;high PCE of 16.14% (certified as 15.90%) along with an excellent AVT of 33.02%. The strong enhancement of the light utilization efficiency by &#8764;50% as compared to the counterpart device without optical engineering provides an encouraging and universal pathway for promoting breakthroughs in ST&#8208;OPVs from meticulous optical design.

By integrating core-bishell PdCu@Au@SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanotripods that act as optically isotropic Lambertian sources with near-infrared-customized localized surface plasmon resonance in an optimal ternary PM6:BTP-eC9:L8-BO-based ST-OPV, we show that their interplay with a multilayer optical coupling layer, consisting of ZnS(130&#160;nm)/Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;AlF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(60&#160;nm)/WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(100&#160;nm)/LaF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(50&#160;nm) identified from high-throughput optical screening, leads to a record-high PCE of 16.14% (certified as 15.90%) along with an excellent AVT of 33.02%. The strong enhancement of the light utilization efficiency by &#8764;50% as compared to the counterpart device without optical engineering provides an encouraging and universal pathway for promoting breakthroughs in ST-OPVs from meticulous optical design.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Super&#8208;wide Temperature Lasers Spanning from &#8208;180 &#176;C to 240 &#176;C Based on Fully&#8208;polymerized Blue Phase Superstructures</title>

Abstract
Blue phase liquid crystal (BPLC) lasers have potential applications in displays, sensors, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting fields owing to their outstanding optical properties. However, there remain challenges on lasing below 0 &#176;C, which significantly limits the potential application of BPLC lasers in low&#8208;temperature environments. In this work, BPLC lasing below 0 &#176;C was realized for the first time in a super&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8208;180 &#8764; 240 &#176;C using a well&#8208;designed fully&#8208;polymerized BPLC system with a narrow line width of 0.0881&#160;nm and a low lasing threshold of 37 nJ/pulse. This fully&#8208;polymerized BPLC both effectively avoids low&#8208;temperature random crystallization and has excellent compatibility with dye molecules that significantly widened the lasing temperature range below 0 &#176;C. Besides, the variations of laser peak and threshold were also revealed below 0 &#176;C, i.e., redshifted laser wavelength and increased threshold value with decreasing temperature, which contributed to a blue&#8208;shifted laser signal and a U&#8208;shaped lasing threshold in &#8208;180 &#8764; 240 &#176;C. These unique laser behaviors could be ascribed to the temperature&#8208;dependent anisotropically microstructural deformation of BP lattice. This work not only opens a door to the development of low&#8208;temperature BPLC lasers but also sets out important insights in the design of novel organic optical devices.

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Mechanical Disruption of &#946;&#8208;Amyloid&#8208;Like Fibers using Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors</title>

         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven rotary motor is co&#8208;self&#8208;assembled in a &#946;&#8208;amyloid&#8208;like structure forming supramolecular hydrogels. Upon UV irradiation, the work produced by the continuous rotation of the motor is shown to disrupt the hydrogen bonds of the self&#8208;assembled system, leading to an endergonic gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition in out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions. The structure of the original hydrogel is subsequently recovered in the dark.








Abstract
Artificial molecular motors have the potential to generate mechanical work on their environment by producing autonomous unidirectional motions when supplied with a source of energy. However, the harnessing of this mechanical work to subsequently activate various endoenergetic processes that can be useful in materials science remains elusive. Here, it is shown that by integrating a light&#8208;driven rotary motor through hydrogen bonds in a &#946;&#8208;amyloid&#8208;like structure forming supramolecular hydrogels, the mechanical work generated during the constant rotation of the molecular machine under UV irradiation is sufficient to disrupt the &#946;&#8208;amyloid fibers and to trigger a gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition at macroscopic scale. This melting of the gel under UV irradiation occurs 25 &#176;C below the temperature needed to melt it by solely using thermal activation. In the dark, a reversible sol&#8211;gel transition is observed as the system fully recovers its original microstructure, thus illustrating the possible access to new kinds of motorized materials that can be controlled by advanced out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics.

         <title>Physically and Chemically Stable Molybdenum&#8208;Based Composite Electrodes for p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a pivotal component within solar devices, the electrode has a profound impact on the device performance. Herein, device configuration based on the physically and chemically stable molybdenum electrode is engineered to fundamentally tackle the instability factors introduced by electrodes in perovskite solar cells. A titanium seed layer is further introduced to optimize the electrode interfacial contact. 








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered much attention in recent years. Despite the remarkable advancements in PSCs utilizing traditional metal electrodes, challenges such as stability concerns and elevated costs have necessitated the exploration of innovative electrode designs to facilitate industrial commercialization. Herein, a physically and chemically stable molybdenum (Mo) electrode is developed to fundamentally tackle the instability factors introduced by electrodes. The combined spatially resolved element analyses and theoretical study demonstrate the high diffusion barrier of Mo ions within the device. Structural and morphology characterization also reveals the negligible plastic deformation and halide&#8208;metal reaction during aging when Mo is in contact with perovskite (PVSK). The electrode/underlayer junction is further stabilized by a thin seed layer of titanium (Ti) to improve Mo film's uniformity and adhesion. Based on a corresponding p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs (ITO/PTAA/PVSK/C60/SnO2/ITO/Ti/Mo), the champion sample could deliver an efficiency of 22.25%, which is among the highest value for PSCs based on Mo electrodes. Meanwhile, the device shows negligible performance decay after 2000 h operation, and retains 91% of the initial value after 1300 h at 50&#8211;60 &#176;C. In summary, the multilayer Mo electrode opens an effective avenue to all&#8208;round stable electrode design in high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Competing Mechanisms Determine Oxygen Redox in Doped Ni&#8211;Mn Based Layered Oxides for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the well&#8208;known P2 to O2 phase transition, oxygen redox is a main bottleneck for capacity retention. Using synchrotron&#8208;based methods, it is revealed that competing mechanisms between Ni and Mg (or Li, Zn, and Cu) are critical for controlling the degree of oxygen redox in doped Ni&#8211;Mn based layered oxides in Na&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Cation doping is an effective strategy for improving the cyclability of layered oxide cathode materials through suppression of phase transitions in the high voltage region. In this study, Mg and Sc are chosen as dopants in P2&#8208;Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, and both have found to&#160;positively impact the cycling stability, but influence the high voltage regime in different ways. Through a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based methods and theoretical calculations it is shown that it is more than just suppression of the P2 to O2 phase transition that is critical for promoting the favorable properties, and that the interplay between Ni and O activity is also a critical aspect that dictates the performance. With Mg doping, the Ni activity can be enhanced while simultaneously suppressing the O activity. This is surprising because it is in contrast to what has been reported in other Mn&#8208;based layered oxides where Mg is known to trigger oxygen redox. This contradiction is addressed by proposing a competing mechanism between Ni and Mg that impacts differences in O activity in Na0.67MgxNi0.33&#8208;xMn0.67O2 (x&#160;&lt;&#160;0&#160;&lt;&#160;0.33). These findings provide a new direction in understanding the effects of cation doping on the electrochemical behavior of layered oxides.

An amorphous MnO2 lamellae encapsulated N, S, P co&#8208;doped carbon sphere (A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC) is fabricated through a self&#8208;doping process coupled with in situ encapsulating strategy. Due to the predesigned amorphous MnO2 surface defects and the abundance of multi&#8208;heteroatom catalytic active sites, the as&#8208;developed A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC can readily work as an oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction dual&#8208;functional electrocatalyst for both liquid and solid rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery.








Abstract
The intelligent construction of non&#8208;noble metal materials that exhibit reversible oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with bifunctional electrocatalytic performance is greatly coveted in the realm of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a crafted structure&#8208;amorphous MnO2 lamellae encapsulated covalent triazine polymer&#8208;derived N, S, P co&#8208;doped carbon sphere (A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC) is designed using a self&#8208;doped pyrolysis coupled with an in situ encapsulation strategy. The customized A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC&#8208;2 demonstrates a superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, confirmed by a small &#916;E index of 0.64&#160;V for ORR/OER. Experimental investigations, along with density functional theory calculations validate that predesigned amorphous MnO2 surface defects and abundant heteroatom catalytic active sites collectively enhance the oxygen electrocatalytic performance. Impressively, the A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC&#8208;based rechargeable liquid ZABs show a large open&#8208;circuit potential of 1.54&#160;V, an ultrahigh peak power density of 181&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, an enormous capacity of 816 mAh g&#8722;1, and a remarkable stability for more than 1720 discharging/charging cycles. Additionally, the assembled flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZABs also demonstrate outstanding cycle stability, surpassing 140 discharging/charging cycles. Therefore, this highly operable synthetic strategy offers substantial understanding in the development of magnificent bifunctional electrocatalysts for various sustainable energy conversions and beyond.

         <title>Selective Organ&#8208;Targeting Hafnium Oxide Nanoparticles with Multienzyme&#8208;Mimetic Activities Attenuate Radiation&#8208;Induced Tissue Damage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Commonly known as radioenhancers, HfO2 nanoparticles reported in the study present surprising radioprotection in mice and rabbits, along with selective organ&#8208;targeting through fine&#8208;tuned synthesis. These multienzyme&#8208;mimicking agents can be visualized by spectral computed tomography with improved half&#8208;life and stability over amifostine. The protective mechanisms involve inhibiting DNA damage and inflammation and attenuating activated FoxO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK interactive cascades.








Abstract
Radioprotective agents hold clinical promises to counteract off&#8208;target adverse effects of radiation and benefit radiotherapeutic outcomes, yet the inability to control drug transport in human organs poses a leading limitation. Based upon a validated rank&#8208;based multigene signature model, radiosensitivity indices are evaluated of diverse normal organs as a genomic predictor of radiation susceptibility. Selective ORgan&#8208;Targeting (SORT) hafnium oxide nanoparticles (HfO2 NPs) are rationally designed via modulated synthesis by &#945;&#8208;lactalbumin, homing to top vulnerable organs. HfO2 NPs like Hensify are commonly radioenhancers, but SORT HfO2 NPs exhibit surprising radioprotective effects dictated by unfolded ligands and Hf(0)/Hf(IV) redox couples. Still, the X&#8208;ray attenuation patterns allow radiological confirmation in target organs by dual&#8208;beam spectral computed tomography. SORT HfO2 NPs present potent antioxidant activities, catalytically scavenge reactive oxygen species, and mimic multienzyme catalytic activities. Consequently, SORT NPs rescue radiation&#8208;induced DNA damage in mouse and rabbit models and provide survival benefits upon lethal exposures. In addition to inhibiting radiation&#8208;induced mitochondrial apoptosis, SORT NPs impede DNA damage and inflammation by attenuating activated FoxO, Hippo, TNF, and MAPK interactive cascades. A universal methodology is proposed to reverse radioenhancers into radioprotectors. SORT radioprotective agents with image guidance are envisioned as compelling in personalized shielding from radiation deposition.

         <title>Unveiling Challenges and Opportunities in Silicon&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries: Thin&#8208;Film Bonding with Mismatch Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For Li&#8208;metal anodes, Li&#8208;ionsstripping/depositing on the surface leads to gaps and Li dendrite formation, which is an electrochemical behavior and unavoidable. For Si&#8208;based anodes, Li&#8208;ions inserting/extracting within the Si&#8208;based electrode cause volume changes and a local separation from the SE, which is a mechanical behavior and avoidable by mitigating the strain mismatch of thin&#8208;film bonding between anode and SE.








Abstract
Li&#8208;metal and silicon are potential anode materials in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion batteries (ASSBs) due to high specific capacity. However, both materials form gaps at the interface with solid electrolytes (SEs) during charging/discharging, resulting in increased impedance and uneven current density distribution. In this perspective, the different mechanisms of formation of these gaps are elaborated in detail. For Li&#8208;metal anodes, Li&#8208;ions are repeatedly stripped and unevenly deposited on the surface, leading to gaps and Li dendrite formation, which is an unavoidable electrochemical behavior. For Si&#8208;based anodes, Li&#8208;ions inserting/extracting within the Si&#8208;based electrode causes volume changes and a local separation from the SE, which is a mechanical behavior and avoidable by mitigating the strain mismatch of thin&#8208;film bonding between anode and SE. Si electro&#8211;chemical&#8211;mechanical behaviors are also described and strategies recommended to synergistically decrease Si&#8208;based electrode strain, including Si materials, Si&#8208;based composites, and electrodes. Last, it is suggested to choose a composite polymer&#8211;inorganic SE with favorable elastic properties and high ionic conductivity and form it directly on the Si&#8208;based electrode, beneficial for increasing SE strain to accommodate stack pressure and the stability of the interface. Thus, this perspective sheds light on the development and application of Si&#8208;based ASSBs.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interactions to Anti&#8208;Leaching Pt Single Atoms for Efficient Hydrosilylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with different microenvironments have been implemented by introducing cation vacancies into CoFe&#8208;Layered double hydroxide (LDH). Compared with Pt anchored on the surface of CoFe&#8208;LDH, Pt anchored on cobalt vacancies exhibits stronger electronic metal&#8208;support interaction between the Pt atoms and the oxide atoms of CoFe&#8208;LDH, which result in a superior activity and stability in the hydrosilylation.








Abstract
Modulating the electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI) of the single&#8208;atomic sites against leaching via microenvironment regulation is critical to achieving high activity and stability but remains challenging. Herein, this work selectively confines Pt single atoms on CoFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) by three oxygen atoms around cation vacancy (Pt1/LDHV) or one oxygen atom at the regular surface (Pt1/LDH) via cation vacancy engineering. By characterizing the structural evolution of the obtained catalysts before and after vacancy construction and single&#8208;atom anchoring, this work demonstrates how the microenvironments modulate the EMSI and the catalytic performance. Theoretical simulations further reveal a significantly enhanced EMSI effect by the three&#8208;coordinated Pt1 atoms on cation vacancies in Pt1/LDHV, which endows a more prominent anti&#8208;leaching feature than the one&#8208;coordinated ones on the regular surface. As a result, the Pt1/LDHV catalyst shows exceptional performance in anti&#8208;Markovnikov alkene hydrosilylation, with a turnover frequency of 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;105 h&#8722;1. More importantly, the enhanced EMSI of Pt1/LDHV effectively prevented the leaching of Pt atom from the catalyst surface and can be recycled at least ten times with only a 3.4% loss of catalytic efficiency with minimal Pt leaching, and reach a high turnover number of 1.0&#160;&#215;&#160;106.

         <title>Digital Mechanical Metamaterial: Encoding Mechanical Information with Graphical Stiffness Pattern for Adaptive Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An encodable mechanical metamaterial that uses graphical stiffness patterns to in situ program versatile mechanical capabilities is demonstrated. Independently switching digital stiffness states in constituent units enables extensive programmability across various qualities, including tunable shape, stress&#8211;strain response, Poisson's ratio, and offers functions like adaptive energy absorption and pressure delivery. 








Abstract
Inspired by the adaptive features exhibited by biological organisms like the octopus, soft machines that can tune their shape and mechanical properties have shown great potential in applications involving unstructured and continuously changing environments. However, current soft machines are far from achieving the same level of adaptability as their biological counterparts, hampered by limited real&#8208;time tunability and severely deficient reprogrammable space of properties and functionalities. As a steppingstone toward fully adaptive soft robots and smart interactive machines, an encodable multifunctional material that uses graphical stiffness patterns is introduced here to in situ program versatile mechanical capabilities without requiring additional infrastructure. Through independently switching the digital binary stiffness states (soft or rigid) of individual constituent units of a simple auxetic structure with elliptical voids, in situ and gradational tunability is demonstrated here in various mechanical qualities such as shape&#8208;shifting and &#8208;memory, stress&#8211;strain response, and Poisson's ratio under compressive load as well as application&#8208;oriented functionalities such as tunable and reusable energy absorption and pressure delivery. This digitally programmable material is expected to pave the way toward multienvironment soft robots and interactive machines.

         <title>A General and Convenient Peptide Self&#8208;Assembling Mechanism for Developing Supramolecular Versatile Nanomaterials Based on The Biosynthetic Hybrid Amyloid&#8208;Resilin Protein</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement self&#8208;assembling strategy are demonstrated to induce any proteins to assemble into hydrogels alone or in combination with notable compositional control. The nanoscale interactions among disordered elastin&#8208;like domains and amyloid nanofibrils lead to many useful macroscopic material properties. Few pure protein&#8208;based materials could meet such seemingly mutually exclusive properties simultaneously. Such versatility renders this nanomaterial as next&#8208;generation functional materials.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembling peptides are valuable building blocks to fabricate supramolecular biomaterials, which have broad applications from biomedicine to biotechnology. However, limited choices to induce different globular proteins into hydrogels hinder these designs. Here, an easy&#8208;to&#8208;implement and tunable self&#8208;assembling strategy, which employs Ure2 amyloidogenic peptide, are described to induce any target proteins to assemble into supramolecular hydrogels alone or in combination with notable compositional control. Furthermore, the collective effect of nanoscale interactions among amyloid nanofibrils and partially disordered elastomeric polypeptides are investigated. This led to many useful macroscopic material properties simultaneously emerging from one pure protein material, i.e. strong adhesion to any substrates under wet conditions, rapidly self&#8208;&#8208;assembling into robust and porous hydrogels, adaptation to remodeling processes, strongly promoting cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, he demonstrated this supramolecular material&#8242;s robust performance in vitro and vivo for tissue engineering, cosmetic and hemostasis applications and exhibited superior performance compared to corresponding commercial counterparts. To the best of his knowledge, few pure protein&#8208;based materials could meet such seemingly mutually exclusive properties simultaneously. Such versatility renders this novel supramolecular nanomaterial as next&#8208;generation functional protein&#8208;based materials, and he demonstrated the sequence level modulation of structural order and disorder as an untapped principle to design new proteins.

         <title>Ultracompact Single&#8208;Photon Sources of Linearly Polarized Vortex Beams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultracompact chip&#8208;integrated single&#8208;photon sources of linearly polarized vortex beams are proposed based on quantum emitter&#8208;coupled metasurfaces. The design strategy facilitates the control of the polarization, orbital angular momentums (OAMs), and entanglement of multichannel single&#8208;photon emission, enabling simultaneous generation of high&#8208;purity orthogonal linearly polarized single&#8208;photon beams with arbitrary different OAMs, which meets growing demands for increasing the quantum information channel capacity of highly integrated quantum system.








Abstract
Ultracompact chip&#8208;integrated single&#8208;photon sources of collimated beams with polarization&#8208;encoded states are crucial for integrated quantum technologies. However, most of currently available single&#8208;photon sources rely on external bulky optical components to shape the polarization and phase front of emitted photon beams. Efficient integration of quantum emitters with beam shaping and polarization encoding functionalities remains so far elusive. Here, ultracompact single&#8208;photon sources of linearly polarized vortex beams based on chip&#8208;integrated quantum emitter&#8208;coupled metasurfaces are presented, which are meticulously designed by fully exploiting the potential of nanobrick&#8208;arrayed metasurfaces. The authors first demonstrate on&#8208;chip single&#8208;photon generation of high&#8208;purity linearly polarized vortex beams with prescribed topological charges of 0, &#8722; 1, and +1. The multiplexing of single&#8208;photon emission channels with orthogonal linear polarizations carrying different topological charges are further realized and their entanglement is demonstarated. The work illustrates the potential and feasibility of ultracompact quantum emitter&#8208;coupled metasurfaces as a new quantum optics platform for realizing chip&#8208;integrated high&#8208;dimensional single&#8208;photon sources.

         <title>Plasticizer&#8208;Induced Enhancement of Mesoscale Dissymmetry in Thin Films of Chiral Polymers with Variable Chain Length</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blending of variable chain length chiral polymers with a plasticizer additive results in dramatic enhancement of the absorbance dissymmetry ratio due to structural order enhancement following annealing of chiral polymer:plasticizer blends. The Mueller matrix ellipsometry confirms strong chiroptical response in agreement with conventional circular dichroism measurements. These findings open a new pathway for tuning optical activity of conjugated chiral polymers.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers with chiral side chains are of interest in areas including chiral photonics, optoelectronics, and chemical and biological sensing. However, the low dissymmetry factors of most neat polymer thin films have limited their practical application. Here, a robust method to increase the absorption dissymmetry factor in a poly&#8208;fluorene&#8208;thiophene (PF8TS series) system is demonstrated by varying molecular weight and introducing an achiral plasticizer, polyethylene mono alcohol (PEM&#8208;OH). Extending chain length within the optimal range and adding this long&#8208;chain alcohol significantly enhance the chiroptical properties of spin&#8208;coated and annealed thin films. Mueller matrix spectroscopic ellipsometry (MMSE) analysis shows good agreement with the steady&#8208;state transmission measurements confirming a strong chiral response (circular dichroism (CD)&#160;and circular birefringence (CB)), ruling out linear dichroism, birefringence, and specific reflection effects. Solid&#8208;state NMR studies of annealed hybrid chiral polymer systems show enhancement of signals associated with aromatic &#960;&#8208;stacked backbone and the ordered side&#8208;chain conformations. Further studies using Raman spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and polarized optical microscopy (POM) indicate that PEM&#8208;OH facilitates mesoscopic crystal domain ordering upon annealing. This provides new insights into routes for tuning optical activity in conjugated polymers.

         <title>Constructing Cooperative Interface via Bi&#8208;Functional COF for Facilitating the Sulfur Conversion and Li+ Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel asymmetric COF with strong polar cyanide groups and polysulfide chains (COF&#8208;CN&#8208;S) is designed and prepared, acting as cooperative functional promoters to simultaneously address lithium anode and sulfur cathode problems.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries stand out for their high theoretical specific capacity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the practical implementation of Li&#8211;S batteries is hindered by issues such as the shuttle effect, tardy redox kinetics, and dendrite growth. Herein, an appealingly designed covalent organic framework (COF) with bi&#8208;functional active sites of cyanide groups and polysulfide chains (COF&#8208;CN&#8208;S) is developed as cooperative functional promoters to simultaneously address dendrites and shuttle effect issues. Combining in situ techniques and theoretical calculations, it can be demonstrated that the unique chemical architecture of COF&#8208;CN&#8208;S is capable of performing the following functions: 1) The COF&#8208;CN&#8208;S delivers significantly enhanced Li+ transport capability due to abundant ion&#8208;hopping sites (cyano&#8208;groups); 2) it functions as a selective ion sieve by regulating the dynamic behavior of polysulfide anions and Li+, thus inhibiting shuttle effect and dendrite growth; 3) by acting as a redox mediator, the COF&#8208;CN&#8208;S can effectively control the electrochemical behavior of polysulfides and enhance their conversion kinetics. Based on the above advantages, the COF&#8208;CN&#8208;S endows Li&#8211;S batteries with excellent performance. This study highlights the significance of interface modification and offers novel insights into the rational design of organic materials in the Li&#8211;S realm.

Combining in situ techniques and theoretical calculations, it can be demonstrated that the unique chemical architecture of COF-CN-S is capable of performing the following functions: 1) The COF-CN-S delivers significantly enhanced Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport capability due to abundant ion-hopping sites (cyano-groups); 2) it functions as a selective ion sieve by regulating the dynamic behavior of polysulfide anions and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, thus inhibiting shuttle effect and dendrite growth; 3) by acting as a redox mediator, the COF-CN-S can effectively control the electrochemical behavior of polysulfides and enhance their conversion kinetics. Based on the above advantages, the COF-CN-S endows Li&#8211;S batteries with excellent performance. This study highlights the significance of interface modification and offers novel insights into the rational design of organic materials in the Li&#8211;S realm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Coordination Structures of Zn Sites Through Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Accelerates Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of well&#8208;structured, symmetry&#8208;breaking zinc metal&#8208;organic framework catalysts are synthesized for nitrogen reduction, highlighting the correlation between the coordination environment of metal sites, low&#8208;valence Zn&#948;+ formation, and catalytic activity.








Abstract
Manipulating the coordination environment of individual active sites in a precise manner remains an important challenge in electrocatalytic reactions. Herein, inspired by theoretical predictions, a facile procedure to synthesize a series of symmetry&#8208;breaking zinc metal&#8211;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF) catalysts with well&#8208;defined structures is presented. Benefiting from the optimized coordination microenvironment regulated by symmetry&#8208;breaking, Zn&#8208;N2S2&#8208;MOF exhibits the best performance of nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) with NH3 yield rate of 25.07&#160;&#177;&#160;1.57&#160;&#181;g&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 44.57&#160;&#177;&#160;2.79% compared with reported Zn&#8208;based NRR catalysts. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure shows that the symmetry&#8208;breaking distorts the coordination environment and modulates the delocalized electrons around the Zn sites, which favors the formation of unpaired low&#8208;valence Zn&#948;+, thereby facilitating the adsorption/activation of N2. Theoretical calculations elucidate that low&#8208;valence Zn&#948;+ in Zn&#8208;N2S2&#8208;MOF can effectively lower the energy barrier of potential determining step, promoting the kinetics and boosting the NRR activity. This work highlights the relationship between the precise coordination environment of metal sites and the catalytic activity, which offers insightful guidance for rationally designing high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Spatiotemporal Measurement of Extracellular Signaling Molecules Using an Aptamer Switch&#8208;Conjugated Hydrogel Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cells communicate through secreted biomolecules, however, there are few tools to directly record these signals. Embedding fluorescent aptamer sensors within a biocompatible hydrogel enables tracking of cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signaling with molecular specificity and high temporal resolution, demonstrated by monitoring of the molecular signals driving slime mold cell migration. This technology shall be applicable for studying a wide range of biological systems.








Abstract
Cells rely on secreted signaling molecules to coordinate essential biological functions including development, metabolism, and immunity. Unfortunately, such signaling processes remain difficult to measure with sufficient chemical specificity and temporal resolution. To address this need, an aptamer&#8208;conjugated hydrogel matrix that enables continuous fluorescent measurement of specific secreted analytes &#8211; in two dimensions, in real&#8208;time is developed. As a proof of concept, real&#8208;time imaging of inter&#8208;cellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'&#8208;monophosphate (cAMP) signals in Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba cells is performed. A set of aptamer switches that generate a rapid and reversible change in fluorescence in response to cAMP signals is engineered. By combining multiple switches with different dynamic ranges, measure cAMP concentrations spanning three orders of magnitude in a single experiment can be measured. These sensors are embedded within a biocompatible hydrogel on which cells are cultured and their cAMP secretions can be imaged using fluorescent microscopy. Using this aptamer&#8208;hydrogel material system, the first direct measurements of oscillatory cAMP signaling that correlate closely with previous indirect measurements are achieved. Using different aptamer switches, this approach can be generalized for measuring other secreted molecules to directly visualize diverse extracellular signaling processes and the biological effects that they trigger in recipient cells.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Color Real&#8208;Time Chemosensing of a Compartmentalized Reaction Network Involving Enzyme&#8208;Induced Membrane Permeation of Peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;compartment system with two optically and spatially separated chemosensing ensembles for monitoring the enzymatic conversion and subsequent permeation of peptides is constructed. One long&#8208;wavelength fluorescent reporter pair is positioned outside the liposomes to monitor the enzymatic digestion of enkephalin substrates by thermolysin. A second shorter&#8208;wavelength chemosensing ensemble inside the liposomes signals the subsequent permeation of the enzymatic products.








Abstract
The design of synthetic systems with interrelated reaction sequences that model incipient biological complexity is limited by physicochemical tools that allow the direct monitoring of the individual processes in real&#8208;time. To mimic a simple digestion&#8208;resorption sequence, the authors have designed compartmentalized liposomal systems that incorporate extra&#8208; and intravesicular chemosensing ensembles. The extravesicular reporter pair consists of cucurbit[7]uril and methylene blue to monitor the enzymatic cleavage of short enkephalin&#8208;related peptides by thermolysin through a switch&#8208;off fluorescence response (&#8220;digestion&#8221;). Because the substrate is membrane&#8208;impermeable, but the dipeptide product is permeable, uptake of the latter into the pre&#8208;formed liposomes occurs as a follow&#8208;up process. The intravesicular chemosensing ensemble consists of i) cucurbit[8]uril, 2&#8208;anilinonaphthalene&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid, and methyl viologen or ii) cucurbit[7]uril and berberine to monitor the uptake (&#8220;resorption&#8221;) of the enzymatic products through the liposomal membranes by i) a switch&#8208;on or ii) a switch&#8208;off fluorescence response. The dyes are designed to allow selective optical excitation and read&#8208;out of the extra&#8208; and intravesicular dyes, which allow for dual&#8208;color chemosensing and, therefore, kinetic discrimination of the two sequential reactions.

         <title>Defect Passivation and Lithium Ion Coordination Via Hole Transporting Layer Modification for High Performance Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tryptamine as an additive is introduced in the hole transport layer. The molecular interactions of tryptamine with perovskite and lithium cation result in a drastic improvement of VOC from 1.192 to 1.251 V, yielding a high device power conversion efficiency of 21.8%, together with greatly enhanced moisture stability.








Abstract
Metal halide inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have great potential to achieve high efficiency with excellent thermal stability. However, the surface defect traps restrain the achievement of high open circuit voltage (VOC) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices due to the severe nonradiative charge recombination. Moreover, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transporting layer (HTL) significantly hampers device moisture stability, even though it renders the highest solar cell efficiency. Herein, a one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds strategy is proposed using a biocompatible material tryptamine (TA) as an additive in HTL. First, TA bearing electron rich moieties can favorably passivate the surface defects of inorganic perovskite films, significantly reducing trap density and prolonging charge lifetime. It results in a drastic improvement of VOC from 1.192 to 1.251&#160;V, with a VOC loss of 0.48&#160;V. The corresponding PSCs achieve a 21.8% PCE under 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 illumination. Second, TA in HTL can coordinate with lithium cations, retarding their reaction with moisture and increasing the moisture stability of HTL. Consequently, the black phase of inorganic perovskite films is well preserved, and the corresponding PSCs maintain 90% of the initial PCE after 800&#160;h storage at relative humidity of 25&#8211;35%, much higher than the control devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors Achieved by Optimizing Structural and Energetic Ordering of Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based Polymers</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance p&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors are demonstrated through molecular optimization and polymer chain alignment. The fine&#8208;tuning of aliphatic&#8211;glycol hybrid side chains reduces the structural/energetic disorders in mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors, thereby maximizing device performances. In parallel, a floating film transfer method is employed to reinforce the anisotropic alignment of polymer chains, enabling unidirectional charge transport between the electrodes.








Abstract
For optimizing steady&#8208;state performance in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), both molecular design and structural alignment approaches must work in tandem to minimize energetic and microstructural disorders in polymeric mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor films. Herein, a series of poly(diketopyrrolopyrrole)s bearing various lengths of aliphatic&#8211;glycol hybrid side chains (PDPP&#8208;mEG; m = 2&#8211;5) is developed to achieve high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type OECTs. PDPP&#8208;4EG polymer with the optimized length of side chains exhibits excellent crystallinity owing to enhanced lamellar and backbone interactions. Furthermore, the improved structural ordering in PDPP&#8208;4EG films significantly decreases trap state density and energetic disorder. Consequently, PDPP&#8208;4EG&#8208;based OECT devices produce a mobility&#8211;volumetric capacitance product ([&#181;C*]) of 702 F V&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a hole mobility of 6.49 &#177; 0.60 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Finally, for achieving the optimal structural ordering along the OECT channel direction, a floating film transfer method is employed to reinforce the unidirectional orientation of polymer chains, leading to a substantially increased figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit [&#181;C*] to over 800 F V&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The research demonstrates the importance of side chain engineering of polymeric mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors in conjunction with their anisotropic microstructural optimization to maximize OECT characteristics.

         <title>Palygorskite&#8208;Derived Ternary Fluoride with 2D Ion Transport Channels for Ampere Hour&#8208;Scale Li&#8208;S Pouch Cell with High Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
MgAlF5&#183;2H2O provides 2D ion channels owing to its inverse Weberite&#8208;type crystal framework, to ensure efficient Li&#8208;ion transport under harsh conditions, thereby accelerating Li2S redox kinetics. MgAlF5&#183;2H2O simultaneously captures polysulfides by chemisorption to suppress shuttle effect. MgAlF5&#183;2H2O&#8208;based cathode achieves a 1.97&#160;A&#160;h&#8208;level Li&#8208;S pouch cell with high gravimetric energy density and cycle stability.








Abstract
Although various excellent electrocatalysts/adsorbents have made notable progress as sulfur cathode hosts on the lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) coin&#8208;cell level, high energy density (WG) of the practical Li&#8208;S pouch cells is still limited by inefficient Li&#8208;ion transport in the thick sulfur cathode under low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) and negative/positive (N/P) ratios, which aggravates the shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics. Here a new ternary fluoride MgAlF5&#183;2H2O with ultrafast ion conduction&#8211;strong polysulfides capture integration is developed. MgAlF5&#183;2H2O has an inverse Weberite&#8208;type crystal framework, in which the corner&#8208;sharing [AlF6]&#8211;[MgF4 (H2O)2] octahedra units extend to form two&#8208;dimensional Li&#8208;ion transport channels along the [100] and [010] directions, respectively. Applied as the cathode sulfur host, the MgAlF5&#183;2H2O lithiated by LiTFSI (lithium salt in Li&#8208;S electrolyte) acts as a fast ionic conductor to ensure efficient Li&#8208;ion transport to accelerate the redox kinetics under high S loadings and low E/S and N/P. Meanwhile, the strong polar MgAlF5&#183;2H2O captures polysulfides by chemisorption to suppress the shuttle effect. Therefore, a 1.97&#160;A&#160;h&#8208;level Li&#8208;S pouch cell achieves a high WG of 386&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. This work develops a new&#8208;type ionic conductor, and provides unique insights and new hosts for designing practical Li&#8208;S pouch cells.

         <title>Reversible Structural Evolution of Metal&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Catalysts During CO2 Electroreduction: An Operando X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy Study</title>

         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;nitrogen doped carbon catalysts containing Co, Zn, or Cu single atomic sites in their as prepared state tend to reversibly form metallic clusters during CO2 electroreduction as evidenced by operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The formed metallic cluster with the remaining single atomic species jointly determines the catalytic functionality of these materials.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) is a rising technology, aiming to reduce the energy sector dependence on fossil fuels and to produce carbon&#8208;neutral raw materials. Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) are emerging, cost&#8208;effective catalysts for this reaction; however, their long&#8208;term stability is a major issue. To overcome this, understanding their structural evolution is crucial, requiring systematic in&#8208;depth operando studies. Here a series of M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts (M = Fe, Sn, Cu, Co, Ni, Zn) is investigated using operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. It is found that the Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and Sn&#8208;N&#8208;C are prone to oxide clusters formation even before CO2RR. In contrast, the respective metal cations are singly dispersed in the as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C, Co&#8208;N&#8208;C, Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C, and (Zn)&#8208;N&#8208;C. During CO2RR, metallic clusters/nanoparticles reversibly formed in all catalysts, except for the Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C. This phenomenon, previously observed only in Cu&#8208;N&#8208;C, thus is ubiquitous in M&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts. The competition between M&#8208;O and M&#8208;N interactions is an important factor determining the mobility of metal species in M&#8208;N&#8208;C. Specifically, the strong interaction between the Ni centers and the N&#8208;functional groups of the carbon support results in higher stability of the Ni single&#8208;sites, leading to the excellent performance of Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C in the CO2 to CO conversion, in comparison to other transition metals.

A hollow structural S&#8208;scheme heterojunction of ZnSe and oxygen vacancy enriched TiO2, namely, h&#8208;ZnSe/Pt@TiO2, is designed and fabricated, with which the photocatalytic reforming of cellulose for H2 and formic acid is realized in pure water.

Abstract
Photocatalytic cellulose reforming usually requires harsh conditions due to its sluggish kinetics. Here, a hollow structural S&#8208;scheme heterojunction of ZnSe and oxygen vacancy enriched TiO2, namely, h&#8208;ZnSe/Pt@TiO2, is designed and fabricated, with which the photocatalytic reforming of cellulose for H2 and formic acid is realized in pure water. H2 and formic acid productivity of 1858 and 372&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a steady H2 evolution for 300 h are achieved with &#945;&#8208;cellulose. Comparable photocatalytic activity can also be achieved using various cellulose sources.

Furthermore, the polyhydroxy species produced during cellulose degradation are favored to adsorb on the oxygen vacancy enriched TiO2 surface, which promotes the photocatalytic reforming process and is accounted to the preservation of formic acid as the major solution&#8208;phase product. In addition, sequential reactions of oxidation of aldehydes and elimination of formic acid of the cellulose degradation process are revealed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic cellulose reforming usually requires harsh conditions due to its sluggish kinetics. Here, a hollow structural S-scheme heterojunction of ZnSe and oxygen vacancy enriched TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, namely, h-ZnSe/Pt@TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is designed and fabricated, with which the photocatalytic reforming of cellulose for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and formic acid is realized in pure water. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and formic acid productivity of 1858 and 372&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a steady H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution for 300 h are achieved with &#945;-cellulose. Comparable photocatalytic activity can also be achieved using various cellulose sources. It is experimentally proven that the photogenerated charge transfer follows an S-scheme mechanism, which not only promotes the charge separation but also preserves the higher reductive and oxidative abilities of the ZnSe and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Furthermore, the polyhydroxy species produced during cellulose degradation are favored to adsorb on the oxygen vacancy enriched TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; surface, which promotes the photocatalytic reforming process and is accounted to the preservation of formic acid as the major solution-phase product. In addition, sequential reactions of oxidation of aldehydes and elimination of formic acid of the cellulose degradation process are revealed.

         <title>Mnemonic Rutile&#8211;Rutile Interfaces Triggering Spontaneous Dissociation of Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface mineral&#8211;water interactions are decisive for any photocatalytic process. In this work, fibrous rutile homoepitaxially grown on twinned rutile seeds with a specific interface structure that displays the ability to spontaneously dissociate water are investigated. This is thought to be the first example of an interface with mnemonic behavior capable of transmitting structurally encoded properties to a new environment.








Abstract
Water interaction with mineral surfaces is a complex living system decisive for any photocatalytic process. Resolving the atomistic structure of mineral&#8211;water interfaces is thus crucial for understanding these processes. Fibrous rutile TiO2, grown hydrothermally on twinned rutile seeds under acidic conditions, is studied in terms of interface translation, atomic structure, and surface chemistry in the presence of water, by means of advanced microscopy and spectroscopy methods combined with structure modeling and density functional theory calculations. It is shown that fibers while staying in stable separation during their growth, adopt a special crystallographic registry that is controlled by repulsion forces between fully hydroxylated and protonated (110) surfaces. During relaxation, a turbulent proton transfer and cracking of O&#9472;H bonds is observed, generating a strong acidic character via proton jump from bridge &#9472;OHb to terminal &#9472;OHt groups, and spontaneous dissociation of interfacial water via a transient protonation of the &#9472;OHt groups. It is shown, that this specific interface structure can be implemented to induce acidic response in an initially neutral medium when re&#8208;immersed. This is thought to be the first demonstration of quantum&#8208;confined&#160;mineral&#8211;water interface, capable of memorizing its past and conveying its structurally encoded properties into a new environment.

         <title>Aqueous Solution Enhanced Room Temperature Phosphorescence through Coordination&#8208;Induced Structural Rigidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum/scandium&#8208;doped phosphorescent microcubes (Al/Sc&#8208;PMCs) can be synthesized by hydrothermal polymerization of Al3+ ions, Sc3+ ions, and leucine ligands. Because of abundant metal sites and hydrophilic groups on the Al/Sc&#8208;PMCs surface, a coordination&#8208;induced structural rigidity strategy is developed for achieving aqueous solution enhanced room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of the Al/Sc&#8208;PMCs, with a RTP intensity increase of up to 22.16&#8208;times.








Abstract
Achieving aqueous solution enhanced room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is critical for the applications of RTP materials in solution phase, but which faces a great challenge. Herein, for the first time, a strategy of coordination&#8208;induced structural rigidity is proposed to achieve enhanced quantum efficiency of aluminum/scandium&#8208;doped phosphorescent microcubes (Al/Sc&#8208;PMCs) in aqueous solution. The Al/Sc&#8208;PMCs in a dry state exhibit a nearly invisible blue RTP. However, they emit a strong RTP emission in aqueous solution with a RTP intensity increase of up to 22.16&#8208;times, which is opposite to common solution&#8208;quenched RTP. The RTP enhancement mechanism is attributed to the abundant metal sites (Al3+ and Sc3+ ions) on the Al/Sc&#8208;PMCs surface that can tightly combine with water molecules through the strong coordination. Subsequently, these coordinated water molecules as the bridging agent can bind with surface groups by hydrogen bonding interaction, thereby rigidifying chemical groups and inhibiting their motions, resulting in the transition from the nonradiative decay to the radiative decay, which greatly enhances the RTP efficiency of the Al/Sc&#8208;PMCs. This work not only develops a coordination rigidity strategy to enhance RTP intensity in aqueous solution, but also constructs a phosphorescent probe to achieve reliable and accurate determination of analyte in complex biological matrices.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Growth of Ferroelectric 2D &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 Semiconductor by Spray Pyrolysis for Next&#8208;Generation Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the spray pyrolysis technique, a novel approach for large&#8208;area manufacturing of 2D ferroelectric&#8208;semiconductor In2Se3, is proposed. It demonstrates excellent uniform growth with a 15&#160;cm &#215; 15&#160;cm sized glass substrate. Excellent electrical characteristics such as a large memory window and high on/off current ratio exceeding 107 are achieved with the fabricated In2Se3 ferroelectric&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistor.








Abstract
In2Se3, 2D ferroelectric&#8208;semiconductor, is a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation memory device because of its outstanding electrical properties. However, the large&#8208;area manufacturing of In2Se3 is still a big challenge. In this work, spray pyrolysis technique is introduced for the growth of large&#8208;area In2Se3 thin film. A polycrystalline &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 layer can be grown on 15&#160;cm &#215; 15&#160;cm glasss at the substrate temperature of 275&#160;&#176;C. The In2Se3 ferroelectric&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (FeS&#8208;FET) on glass substrate demonstrates a large hysteresis window of 40.3&#160;V at the &#177;40&#160;V of gate voltage sweep and excellent uniformity. The FeS&#8208;FET exhibits an electron field effect mobility of 0.97 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off current ratio of &gt;107 in the transfer curves. The memory behavior of the large&#8208;area, In2Se3 FeS&#8208;FETs for next&#8208;generation memory is demonstrated.

         <title>Highly Bright and Stable Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskite White Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terbium doping and guest&#8211;host strategy are adopted to substantially enhance STEradiative recombination and charge injection efficiency in lead&#8208;free DP emitting layer. Consequently, a record luminance of 2793&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and EQE of 0.76% for the constructed white LED are reported, substantially surpassing those of recently reported DP&#8208;based EL devices.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites (DPs) are emerging highly stable emitters with efficient broadband self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) photoluminescence (PL), but their low electroluminescent (EL) efficiency is a critical shortcoming. This work promotes the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and luminance of DP&#8208;based white light&#8208;emitting diode (wLED) with a normal device structure to 0.76% and 2793&#160;cd m&#8722;2 via two modifications: This work prevents the formation of adverse metallic silver, spatially confined STE, and lowers local site symmetry in Cs2Na0.4Ag0.6In0.97Bi0.03Cl6 DP by terbium doping; and this work develops a guest&#8211;host strategy to improve film morphology, reduce defect density, and increase carrier mobility. These alterations cause substantial increase in STE radiative recombination and charge injection efficiency of perovskite layer. Finally, pure white EL with ideal color coordinates of (0.328, 0.329) and a record&#8208;breaking optoelectronic performance is achieved by introducing additional green carbon dots in LED to fill the deficient green component.

         <title>Dielectric Gels with Microphase Separation for Wide&#8208;Range and Self&#8208;Damping Pressure Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microphase&#8208;separated dielectric gels with remarkable dielectric constant, high mechanical robustness, and substantial damping capabilities have been prepared by a facile method. The article further demonstrates the successful creation of wide&#8208;range, self&#8208;damping pressure sensors with applications in health monitoring, providing new opportunities for soft electronics.








Abstract
Omnipresent vibrations pose a significant challenge to flexible pressure sensors by inducing unstable output signals and curtailing their operational lifespan. Conventional soft sensing materials possess adequate elasticity but prove inadequate in countering vibrations. Moreover, the utilization of conventional highly&#8208;damping materials for sensing is challenging due to their substantial hysteresis. To tackle this dilemma, dielectric gels with controlled in situ microphase separation have been developed, leveraging the miscibility disparity between copolymers and solvents. The resulting gels exhibit exceptional compression stress, remarkable dielectric constant, and exceptional damping capabilities. Furthermore, flexible pressure sensors based on these microphase&#8208;separated gels show a wide detection range and low detection limit, more importantly, excellent sensing performance on vibrating surfaces. This work offers high potentials for applying flexible pressure sensors in complex practical scenarios and opens up new avenues for applications in soft electronics, biomimetic robots, and intelligent sensing.

         <title>A Ternary (P, Se, S) Covalent Inorganic Framework as a Shuttle Effect&#8208;Free Cathode for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ternary covalent inorganic framework, P4Se6S40, has been designed and fabricated via a simple comelting approach, exhibiting high capacity and cyclability as cathodes of Li&#8211;S batteries with even high mass loadings, which is attributed to the synergistic physical/chemical effect of the P&#8211;Se&#8211;S framework with fully exposed active sites, rapid electron/ion transport, and inhibited shuttle effect at source.








Abstract
Developing new cathode materials to avoid shuttle effect of Li&#8211;S batteries at source is crucial for practical high&#8208;energy applications, which, however, remains a great challenge. Herein, a new class of sulfur&#8208;containing ternary covalent inorganic framework (CIF), P4Se6S40, is explored, by simply comelting powders of P, S, and Se. The P4Se6S40 CIF with open framework enables all active sites available during electrochemical reactions, giving a high capacity delivery. Moreover, introducing Se atoms can improve intrinsic electronic conductivity of S chains yet without remarkably compromising the capacity because Se is also electrochemical active to lithium storage. More importantly, Se atoms in S&#8211;Se chains can serve as a heteroatom barrier to block the bonding of S atoms around, effectively avoiding the formation of long&#8208;chain polysulfides during cycling. Besides, stable Li3PS4 with a tetrahedral configuration formed after lithiation works as not only a good ionic conductor to promote Li ion diffusion, but a three&#8208;dimensional spatial barrier and chemical anchor to suppress the dissolution and diffusion of lithium polysulfides (LiPS), further inhibiting the shuttle effect. Consequently, the P4Se6S40 cathode delivers high capacity and excellent capacity retention with even a high loading of 10.5 mg cm&#8722;2 which far surpasses the requirement for commercial applications.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Imaging&#8208;Guided Oxygen Delivery and Controlled Release Improves Photodynamic Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a new theranostic strategy for photoacoustic (PA)&#8208;guided oxygen delivery, controlled release, and photodynamic therapy (PDT). The strategy demonstrates precise thermal&#8208;triggered oxygen release in situ of tumor, evaluated by real&#8208;time multispectral PA imaging of blood oxygen levels during PDT. This developed strategy, assisted by near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II PA imaging, provides a novel approach for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment and therapeutic monitoring.








Abstract
Hypoxia, a prominent hallmark of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), undermines curative outcomes, elevates recurrence rates, and fosters metastasis, particularly during photodynamic therapy (PDT) in clinical settings. Studies indicate that alleviating tumor hypoxia enhances PDT efficacy. However, persistent challenges, including suboptimal oxygen delivery efficiency and absence of real&#8208;time feedback on blood oxygen fluctuations during PDT, considerably impede therapeutic efficacy in tumor treatment. This study addresses these issues using near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) photoacoustic (PA) imaging for tumor&#8208;targeted oxygen delivery and controlled release. For this purpose, a biomimetic oxygen delivery system designated BLICP@O2 is developed, which utilizes hybrid tumor cell membranes and thermosensitive liposomes as oxygen carriers, incorporating the NIR&#8208;II dye IR1048, photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), and perfluorohexane. Upon sequential irradiation at 1064 and 690&#160;nm, BLICP@O2 exhibits significant photothermal and photodynamic effects. Photothermal heating triggers oxygen release, enhancing the photodynamic effect of Ce6. Blood oxygen changes during PDT are tracked by multispectral PA imaging. Enhanced PDT efficacy, mediated by hypoxia relief, is convincingly demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. This work presents an imaging&#8208;guided, dual&#8208;wavelength programmed cascaded treatment strategy for tumor&#8208;targeted oxygen delivery and controlled release, with real&#8208;time efficacy monitoring using PA imaging, offering valuable insights for overcoming challenges in PDT&#8208;based cancer therapy.

         <title>Achieving Reliable and Ultrafast Memristors via Artificial Filaments in Silk Fibroin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the biocompatible silk fibroin (SF) is patterned with on&#8208;demand nanocone array by using thermal scanning probe lithography (t&#8208;SPL) to guide and confine the growth of CFs in the silver/SF/gold (Ag/SF/Au) memristor. Benefiting from the outstanding properties of SF and unique nanocone&#8208;structured electrodes, the memristor shows significantly enhanced switching reliability and ultrafast switching speed.








Abstract
The practical implementation of memristors in neuromorphic computing and biomimetic sensing suffers from unexpected temporal and spatial variations due to the stochastic formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs). Here, the biocompatible silk fibroin (SF) is patterned with an on&#8208;demand nanocone array by using thermal scanning probe lithography (t&#8208;SPL) to guide and confine the growth of CFs in the silver/SF/gold (Ag/SF/Au) memristor. Benefiting from the high fabrication controllability, cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle (temporal) standard deviation of the set voltage for the structured memristor is significantly reduced by &#8776;95.5% (from 1.535 to 0.0686 V) and the device&#8208;to&#8208;device (spatial) standard deviation is also reduced to 0.0648 V. Besides, the statistical relationship between the structural nanocone design and the resultant performance is confirmed, optimizing at the small operation voltage (&#8776;0.5 V) and current (100 nA), ultrafast switching speed (sub&#8208;100 ns), large on/off ratio (104), and the smallest switching slope (SS &lt; 0.01 mV dec&#8722;1). Finally, the short&#8208;term plasticity and leaky integrated&#8208;and&#8208;fire behavior are emulated, and a reliable thermal nociceptor system is demonstrated for practical neuromorphic applications.

Benefiting from the high fabrication controllability, cycle-to-cycle (temporal) standard deviation of the set voltage for the structured memristor is significantly reduced by &#8776;95.5% (from 1.535 to 0.0686 V) and the device-to-device (spatial) standard deviation is also reduced to 0.0648 V. Besides, the statistical relationship between the structural nanocone design and the resultant performance is confirmed, optimizing at the small operation voltage (&#8776;0.5 V) and current (100 nA), ultrafast switching speed (sub-100 ns), large on/off ratio (10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), and the smallest switching slope (SS &amp;lt; 0.01 mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Finally, the short-term plasticity and leaky integrated-and-fire behavior are emulated, and a reliable thermal nociceptor system is demonstrated for practical neuromorphic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boosting Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Activity of Ru Single&#8208;Atom Through Promoting Hydroxyl Adsorption on Ru/WC1&#8722;x Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface between Ru single&#8208;atom and the tungsten carbide (WC1&#8722;x), which exhibits an extremely enhanced activity and stability, is successfully synthesized via in situ high&#8208;temperature annealing strategy. Theoretical and experimental results show that the WC1&#8722;x support can enhance OH adsorption on Ru/WC1&#8208;x interfaces, and promote the Volmer step (H* + OH* &#8594; H2O) in the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) in alkaline conditions continue to pose a significant challenge for the practical implementation of anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells. Developing single&#8208;atom catalysts can accelerate the pace of new HOR catalyst discovery for highly cost&#8208;effective and active HOR performance. However, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for the alkaline HOR have rarely been reported, and fundamental studies on the rational design of SACs are still required. Herein, the design of Ru SAC supported on the tungsten carbide (Ru SA/WC1&#8722;x) via in situ high&#8208;temperature annealing strategy is reported. The resulting Ru SA/WC1&#8722;x catalyst exhibits remarkably enhanced HOR performance in alkaline media, a level of activity that can not be achieved with carbon&#8208;supported Ru SAC. Electrochemical results and density functional theory demonstrate that promoting the hydroxyl adsorption on Ru SA/WC1&#8722;x interfaces, which is derived from the low potential of zero charge of WC1&#8211;x support, has a significant effect on enhancing the HOR performance of SACs. This enhancement leads to 5.8 and 60.1 times higher Ru mass activity of Ru SA/WC1&#8722;x than Ru nanoparticles on carbon and Ru single&#8208;atom on N&#8208;doped carbon, respectively. This work provides new insights into the design of highly active SACs for alkaline HOR.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Noise Level Infrared Quantum Dot Photodiodes with Self&#8208;Screenable Polymeric Optical Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a self&#8208;screenable quantum infrared dot photodiode (QPD) featuring an internal optical filter with a thick polymeric interlayer, effectively achieving ultralow electronic noise levels. The QPD leads to the noise current (&lt;10&#8722;28 A2 Hz&#8722;1) at 80 Hz, resulting in a high D* exceeding 1.31 &#215; 1011 Jones at V = &#8722;1 V under 980 nm.








Abstract
Quantum dot photodiodes (QPDs) have garnered significant attention because of their unparalleled near&#8208;infrared (NIR) detection capabilities, primarily attributable to their size&#8208;dependent bandgap tunability. Nevertheless, the broadband absorption spectrum of QPD engenders substantial noise floor within superfluous visible light regions, notably hindering their use in several emerging applications necessitating the detection of faint micro&#8208;light signals. To overcome these hurdles, a self&#8208;screenable NIR QPD featuring an internal optical filter with a thick polymeric interlayer to reduce electronic noise is demonstrated. This effectively screens out undesirable visible light regions while reducing the ionized defect owing to decreased density of state, yielding an extremely low dark current (&#8776;1010 A cm&#8722;2 at V = &#8722;1&#160;V). Consequently, the electronic noise spectral density is attained at levels below &#8776;10&#8722;27&#8211;10&#8722;28 A2 Hz&#8722;1, and responsivity (R) dropped to 92% within the visible light spectrum.

         <title>Bionic Luminescent Skin as Ultrasensitive Temperature&#8208;Acoustic Sensor for Underwater Information Perception and Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired luminescent skin is employed as the temperature&#8208;acoustic bifunctional sensor for underwater temperature and sound perception and transmission. Moreover, the actual water temperature can be monitored, and water sound information can be recognized by using an artificial neural network. This work proposes a sharkskin&#8208;inspired L&#8208;skin for temperature and acoustic sensing and promotes the development of underwater sensing technology.








Abstract
Bioinspired artificial luminescent skin (L&#8208;skin) integrated with multiple sensing functions significantly promotes the development of smart devices. It is considerably challenging to realize underwater sensing technologies. Here, a sharkskin&#8208;inspired Eu@HOF&#8208;TJ&#8208;1@TA L&#8208;skin (1) is prepared for both temperature and sound sensing. 1 is an ultrathin and flexible temperature sensor, in 298.15&#8211;358.15 K, exhibiting ultrahigh maximum relative sensitivity (97.669% K&#8722;1) and low minimum uncertainty (0.000&#160;952 K). The temperature response mechanism is analyzed deeply. As a waterproofing acoustic sensor, 1 can monitor sound in both air and water with the greatest sound response frequencies of 400 and 300&#160;Hz in air and water, respectively. The maximum sensitivities of 1 in air and water are 6&#160;593&#160;765.2 and 1&#160;346&#160;124.5 cps Pa&#8722;1, respectively. The response times of 1 in air and water are as fast as 20 and 10&#160;ms. The sound response processes of 1 in air and water are simulated by finite element simulation. Moreover, by using sharkskin&#8208;inspired 1, the actual water temperature can be monitored, and a series of water sound information can be recognized by using an artificial neural network. This work proposes a sharkskin&#8208;inspired L&#8208;skin for temperature and acoustic sensing and promotes the development of underwater sensing technology with high performances.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Communication with Lighting: RGB Wavelength Division Multiplexing OLEDs/OPDs Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A visible light communication platform using (R/G/B)&#8208;selective organic photodiode arrays as receivers and (R/G/B) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes as emitters is developed and analyzed to study how the geometry effect of each organic receiver and emitter affects data transmission. Based on this, the first organic material&#8208;based white&#8208;light optical communication system is demonstrated.








Abstract
A multichannel/multicolor visible light communication (VLC) system using entirely organic components, including organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photodiodes (OPDs), is developed to demonstrate indoor lighting applications where the integration of OLEDs and OPDs has significant potential. To achieve this, tricolor (Red/Green/Blue(R/G/B))&#8208;selective OPD arrays for the receiver and tricolor OLED arrays for the emitter are developed. For (R/G/B)&#8208;selective OPDs, a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot electrode to enhance color selectivity and a thick junction structure to effectively accommodate a wide range of driving voltages are introduced. For tricolor OLEDs, fluorescent&#8208;emitting materials are used to enhance the operating frequency in addition to introducing a cavity structure to achieve narrow emission. Utilizing these spectrally refined tricolor OPDs/OLEDs, a VLC system is designed for indoor lighting applications, and a systematic analysis of their signal&#8208;to&#8208;interference ratio dependence on the distance or angle between the transmitter and receiver is performed. The study's findings indicate the importance of emission angle&#8208;dependent wavelength shift of the OLED and the luminosity function, which varies with wavelength, in the R/G/B mixed&#8208;white&#8208;light&#8208;based VLC systems. Finally, the feasibility of VLC using tricolor OPDs/OLEDs in the real&#8208;life context of indoor white&#8208;color lighting is demonstrated, showing that the transmitted data patterns well&#8208;matched the received data patterns.

Based on this, the first organic material-based white-light optical communication system is demonstrated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multichannel/multicolor visible light communication (VLC) system using entirely organic components, including organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photodiodes (OPDs), is developed to demonstrate indoor lighting applications where the integration of OLEDs and OPDs has significant potential. To achieve this, tricolor (Red/Green/Blue(R/G/B))-selective OPD arrays for the receiver and tricolor OLED arrays for the emitter are developed. For (R/G/B)-selective OPDs, a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot electrode to enhance color selectivity and a thick junction structure to effectively accommodate a wide range of driving voltages are introduced. For tricolor OLEDs, fluorescent-emitting materials are used to enhance the operating frequency in addition to introducing a cavity structure to achieve narrow emission. Utilizing these spectrally refined tricolor OPDs/OLEDs, a VLC system is designed for indoor lighting applications, and a systematic analysis of their signal-to-interference ratio dependence on the distance or angle between the transmitter and receiver is performed. The study's findings indicate the importance of emission angle-dependent wavelength shift of the OLED and the luminosity function, which varies with wavelength, in the R/G/B mixed-white-light-based VLC systems. Finally, the feasibility of VLC using tricolor OPDs/OLEDs in the real-life context of indoor white-color lighting is demonstrated, showing that the transmitted data patterns well-matched the received data patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lipid Droplet Targeting Type I Photosensitizer for Ferroptosis via Lipid Peroxidation Accumulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the first lipid droplet (Ld)&#8208;targeting type I photosensitizer (PS) with enhanced superoxide anion (O2&#8722;&#183;) production, termed MNBS, is reported. The newly designed PS selectively localizes at Ld in cells, and causes cellular lipid peroxidation accumulation by generating sufficient O2&#8722;&#183; upon irradiation, and subsequently induces ferroptosis&#8208;mediated chronical photodynamic therapy (PDT), achieving high&#8208;efficient anti&#8208;tumor PDT in hypoxia and normoxia.








Abstract
As an iron&#8208;dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO) mediated cell death pathway, ferroptosis offers promises for anti&#8208;tumor treatment. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an ideal way to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for LPO. However, the conventional PDT normally functions on subcellular organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and lysosome, causing rapid cell death before triggering ferroptosis. Herein, the first lipid droplet (Ld)&#8208;targeting type I photosensitizer (PS) with enhanced superoxide anion (O2&#8722;&#183;) production, termed MNBS, is reported. The newly designed PS selectively localizes at Ld in cells, and causes cellular LPO accumulation by generating sufficient O2&#8722;&#183; upon irradiation, and subsequently induces ferroptosis mediated chronical PDT, achieving high&#8208;efficient anti&#8208;tumor PDT in hypoxia and normoxia. Theoretical calculations and comprehensive characterizations indicate that the Ld targeting property and enhanced O2&#8722;&#183; generation of MNBS originate from the elevated H&#8208;aggregation tendency owing to dispersed molecular electrostatic distribution. Further in vivo studies using MNBS&#8208;encapsulated liposomes demonstrate the excellent anti&#8208;cancer efficacy as well as anti&#8208;metastatic activity. This study offers a paradigm of H&#8208;aggregation reinforced type I PS to achieve ferroptosis&#8208;mediated PDT.

         <title>Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries by Carbon Encapsulation of Liquid Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morphological and phase changes of gallium&#8211;indium liquid metal nanoparticles (EGaIn@C LMNPs)&#160;during the electrochemical reaction process are revealed by in situ TEM measurements in real&#8208;time. The presence of the carbon shell effectively inhibits the volume expansion of the LMNPs during lithiation, and the EGaIn@C LMNPs as a whole can be recovered to their initial state after the discharge&#8211;charge cycle.









Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based metallic liquids, exhibiting high theoretical capacity, are considered a promising anode material for room&#8208;temperature liquid metal alkali&#8208;ion batteries. However, electrochemical performances, especially the cyclic stability, of the liquid metal anode for alkali&#8208;ion batteries are strongly limited because of the volume expansion and unstable solid electrolyte interphase film of liquid metal. Here, the bottleneck problem is resolved by designing carbon encapsulation on gallium&#8211;indium liquid metal nanoparticles (EGaIn@C LMNPs). A superior cycling stability (644&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles at 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) is demonstrated for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, and excellent cycle stability (87&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 2500 cycles at 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) is achieved for sodium&#8208;ion batteries by carbon encapsulation of the liquid metal anode. Morphological and phase changes of EGaIn@C LMNPs during the electrochemical reaction process are revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy measurements in real&#8208;time. The origin for the excellent performance is uncovered, that is the EGaIn@C core&#8211;shell structure effectively suppresses the non&#8208;uniform volume expansion of LMNPs from &#8776;160% to 127%, improves the electrical conductivity of the LMNPs, and exhibits superior electrochemical kinetics and a self&#8208;healing phenomenon. This work paves the way for the applications of room&#8208;temperature liquid metal anodes for high&#8208;performance alkali&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Regioselective Growth of Colloidal Crystals Induced by Depletion Attraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photonic micropatterns are created through single&#8208;step growth of colloidal crystals on lithographically prepatterned substrates with planar surfaces and nano&#8208;needle arrays. When the colloidal assembly is mediated by depletion attraction, the planar surfaces effectively cause heterogeneous nucleation and crystal growth, whereas the nano&#8208;needle arrays inhibit it. This results in regioselective crystallization on the planar areas, yielding high&#8208;resolution structural&#8208;color graphics.








Abstract
Colloidal crystals display photonic stopbands that generate reflective structural colors. While micropatterning offers significant value for various applications, the resolution is somewhat limited for conventional top&#8208;down approaches. In this work, a simple, single&#8208;step bottom&#8208;up approach is introduced to produce photonic micropatterns through depletion&#8208;mediated regioselective growth of colloidal crystals. Lithographically&#8208;featured micropatterns with planar surfaces and nano&#8208;needle arrays as substrates are employed. Heterogeneous nucleation is drastically suppressed on nano&#8208;needle arrays due to minimal particle&#8208;to&#8208;needles overlap of excluded volumes, while it is promoted on planar surfaces with large particle&#8208;to&#8208;plane volume overlap, enabling regioselective growth of colloidal crystals. This strategy allows high&#8208;resolution micropatterning of colloidal photonic crystals, with a minimum feature size as small as 10 &#181;m. Stopband positions, or structural colors, are controllable through concentration and depletant and salt, as well as particle size. Notably, secondary colors can be created through structural color mixing by simultaneously crystallizing two different particle sizes into their own crystal grains, resulting in two distinct reflectance peaks at controlled wavelengths. The simple and highly reproducible method for regioselective colloidal crystallization provides a general route for designing elaborate photonic micropatterns suitable for various applications.

         <title>Strengthening the Hetero&#8208;Molecular Interactions in Giant Dimeric Acceptors Enables Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant dimeric acceptors of Dimer&#8208;QX and Dimer&#8208;2CF are synthesized, without/with trifluoromethyl on quinoxaline core. Dimer&#8208;2CF exhibits stronger hetero&#8208;molecular interaction with donor, forming the smaller domains with ordered molecular packing and more favored vertical phase separation, thus promoting an efficiency of 19.02% and an FF of 80.03% with high stability in devices.








Abstract
Giant dimeric acceptor (G&#8208;Dimer) is becoming one of the most promising organic solar cell (OSC) materials because of its definite structure, long&#8208;term stability, and high efficiency. Strengthening the hetero&#8208;molecular interactions by monomer modification greatly influences the morphology and thus the device performance, but lacks investigation. Herein, two novel quinoxaline core&#8208;based G&#8208;Dimers, Dimer&#8208;QX and Dimer&#8208;2CF, are synthesized. By comparing trifluoromethyl&#8208;substituted Dimer&#8208;2CF and non&#8208;substituted Dimer&#8208;QX, the trifluoromethylation effect on the G&#8208;Dimer is investigated and revealed. The trifluoromethyl with strong electronegativity increases electrostatic potential and reduces surface energy of the G&#8208;Dimer, weakening the homo&#8208;molecular ordered packing but reinforcing the hetero&#8208;molecular interaction with the donor. The strong hetero&#8208;molecular interaction suppresses the fast assembly during the film formation, facilitating small domains with ordered molecular packing in the blend, which is a trade&#8208;off in conventional morphology control. Together with favorable vertical phase separation, efficient charge generation, and reduced bimolecular recombination are concurrently obtained. Hence, the Dimer&#8208;2CF&#8208;based OSCs obtain a cutting&#8208;edge efficiency of 19.02% with fill factor surpassing 80%, and an averaged extrapolated T80 of &#8776;12&#160;000&#160;h under continuous 80 &#176;C heating. This study emphasizes the importance of hetero&#8208;molecular interaction and trifluoromethylation strategy, providing a facile strategy for designing highly efficient and stable OSC materials.

Herein, two novel quinoxaline core-based G-Dimers, Dimer-QX and Dimer-2CF, are synthesized. By comparing trifluoromethyl-substituted Dimer-2CF and non-substituted Dimer-QX, the trifluoromethylation effect on the G-Dimer is investigated and revealed. The trifluoromethyl with strong electronegativity increases electrostatic potential and reduces surface energy of the G-Dimer, weakening the homo-molecular ordered packing but reinforcing the hetero-molecular interaction with the donor. The strong hetero-molecular interaction suppresses the fast assembly during the film formation, facilitating small domains with ordered molecular packing in the blend, which is a trade-off in conventional morphology control. Together with favorable vertical phase separation, efficient charge generation, and reduced bimolecular recombination are concurrently obtained. Hence, the Dimer-2CF-based OSCs obtain a cutting-edge efficiency of 19.02% with fill factor surpassing 80%, and an averaged extrapolated &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;80&lt;/sub&gt; of &#8776;12&#160;000&#160;h under continuous 80 &#176;C heating. This study emphasizes the importance of hetero-molecular interaction and trifluoromethylation strategy, providing a facile strategy for designing highly efficient and stable OSC materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hyperstable Eutectic Core&#8208;Spun Fiber Enabled Wearable Energy Harvesting and Personal Thermal Management Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hyperstable eutectic core&#8208;spun fiber (CSF) achieves synergistic output effect of piezo&#8208;enhanced triboelectricity when external subjects are stressed repeatedly on the CSF, as well as reliable hydrophobicity, and high mid&#8208;infrared emissivity and visible light reflectivity. A monolayer functionalized integrated textile (M&#8208;FIT) is woven from the CSF to enable effective wearable energy (mechanical and droplet energy) harvesting and personal thermal management functions.








Abstract
Electronic textiles have gradually evolved into one of the most important mainstays of flexible electronics owing to their good wearability. However, textile multifunctionality is generally achieved by stacking functional modules, which is not conducive to wearability. Integrating these modules into a single fiber provides a better solution. In this work, a core&#8208;spun functional fiber (CSF) constructed from hyper&#8208;environmentally stable Zn&#8208;based eutectogel as the core layer and polytetrafluoroethylene as the sheath is designed. The CSF achieves a synergistic output effect of piezoelectricity&#8208;enhanced triboelectricity, as well as reliable hydrophobicity, and high mid&#8208;infrared emissivity and visible light reflectivity. A monolayer functionalized integrated textile is woven from the CSF to enable effective energy (mechanical and droplet energy) harvesting and personal thermal management functions. Furthermore, scenarios for the energy supply, motion detection, and outdoor use of electronic fabrics for electronics applications are demonstrated, opening new avenues for the functional integration of electronic textiles.

         <title>Arresting Ion Migration from the ETL Increases Stability in Infrared Light Detectors Based on III&#8208;V Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the stability of III&#8208;V quantum dots&#8208;based infrared photodetector, this work addresses the issue of zinc ion migration, decreasing device performance. Using a hybrid NiOX/poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl) (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA) hole transport layer and inversion of the device structure, this work achieves photodetectors with a quantum efficiency (EQE) of 53% at 970 nm and maintained 95% of their initial performance after 19 h of continuous illuminated operation.








Abstract
III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are of interest in infrared photodetection, and recent developments in CQDs synthesis and surface engineering have improved performance. Here this work investigates photodetector stability, finding that the diffusion of zinc ions from charge transport layers (CTLs) into the CQDs active layer increases trap density therein, leading to rapid and irreversible performance loss during operation. In an effort to prevent this, this work introduces organic blocking layers between the CQDs and ZnO layers; but these negatively impact device performance. The device is then, allowing to use a C60:BCP as top electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) for good morphology and process compatibility, and selecting NiOX as the bottom hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL). The first round of NiOX&#8208;based devices show efficient light response but suffer from high leakage current and a low open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) due to pinholes. This work introduces poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl) (2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) with NiOX NC to form a hybrid HTL, an addition that reduces pinhole formation, interfacial trap density, and bimolecular recombination, enhancing carrier harvesting. The photodetectors achieve 53% external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 970&#160;nm at 1&#160;V applied bias, and they maintain 95% of initial performance after 19 h of continuous illuminated operation. The photodetectors retain over 80% of performance after 80 days of shelf storage.

         <title>Unlocking the Design Paradigm of In&#8208;Plane Heterojunction with Built&#8208;in Bifunctional Anion Vacancy for Unexpectedly Fast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This report highlights a design paradigm of in&#8208;plane heterojunction electrode with built&#8208;in bifunctional anion vacancy, to unlock unexpectedly fast sodium storage. Benefited from a multiscale interfacial synergistic effect, an integrated regulation of volumetric strain, reaction kinetics, and conversion thermodynamics of the electrode can be achieved. Such strategy can be extended to other materials system and showing a potential for universality.








Abstract
Transition metal chalcogenide (TMD) electrodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries exhibit intrinsic shortcomings such as sluggish reaction kinetics, unstable conversion thermodynamics, and substantial volumetric strain effects, which lead to electrochemical failure. This report unlocks a design paradigm of VSe2&#8722;x/C in&#8208;plane heterojunction with built&#8208;in anion vacancy, achieved through an in situ functionalization and self&#8208;limited growth approach. Theoretical and experimental investigations reveal the bifunctional role of the Se vacancy in enhancing the ion diffusion kinetics and the structural thermodynamics of NaxVSe2 active phases. Moreover, this in&#8208;plane heterostructure facilitates complete face contact between the two components and tight interfacial conductive contact between the conversion phases, resulting in enhanced reaction reversibility. The VSe2&#8722;x/C heterojunction electrode exhibits remarkable sodium&#8208;ion storage performance, retaining specific capacities of 448.7 and 424.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at current densities of 5 and 10 A g&#8722;1, respectively. Moreover, it exhibits a high specific capacity of 353.1 mAh g&#8722;1 even under the demanding condition of 100 A g&#8722;1, surpassing most previous achievements. The proposed strategy can be extended to other V5S8&#8722;x and V2O5&#8722;x&#8208;based heterojunctions, marking a conceptual breakthrough in advanced electrode design for constructing high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Halogenated Nonfused Ring Electron Acceptor for Organic Solar Cells with a Record Efficiency of over 17%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three nonfused ring electron acceptors (3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;F, 3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;Cl, and 3TT&#8208;C2) are designed and synthesized with the concept of halogenation. Among them, the fluorinated acceptor 3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;F based devices can deliver the champion power conversion efficiency of over 17% due to enhanced the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, improved the electron mobility, etc.








Abstract
Three nonfused ring electron acceptors (NFREAs), namely, 3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;F, 3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;Cl, and 3TT&#8208;C2, are purposefully designed and synthesized with the concept of halogenation. The incorporation of F or/and Cl atoms into the molecular structure (3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;F and 3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;Cl) enhances the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, improves electron mobility, and regulates the nanofiber morphology of blend films, thus facilitating the exciton dissociation and charge transport. In particular, blend films based on D18:3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;F demonstrate a high charge mobility, an extended exciton diffusion distance, and a well&#8208;formed nanofiber network. These factors contribute to devices with a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 17.19%, surpassing that of 3TT&#8208;C2&#8208;Cl (16.17%) and 3TT&#8208;C2 (15.42%). To the best of knowledge, this represents the highest efficiency achieved in NFREA&#8208;based devices up to now. These results highlight the potential of halogenation in NFREAs as a promising approach to enhance the performance of organic solar cells.

The incorporation of F or/and Cl atoms into the molecular structure (&lt;b&gt;3TT-C2-F&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;3TT-C2-Cl&lt;/b&gt;) enhances the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, improves electron mobility, and regulates the nanofiber morphology of blend films, thus facilitating the exciton dissociation and charge transport. In particular, blend films based on D18:&lt;b&gt;3TT-C2-F&lt;/b&gt; demonstrate a high charge mobility, an extended exciton diffusion distance, and a well-formed nanofiber network. These factors contribute to devices with a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 17.19%, surpassing that of &lt;b&gt;3TT-C2-Cl&lt;/b&gt; (16.17%) and &lt;b&gt;3TT-C2&lt;/b&gt; (15.42%). To the best of knowledge, this represents the highest efficiency achieved in NFREA-based devices up to now. These results highlight the potential of halogenation in NFREAs as a promising approach to enhance the performance of organic solar cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Driven G&#8208;Quartet&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study pioneers the application of machine learning (ML) models to guide the synthesis of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) gels characterized by a high dissymmetry factor (glum) and diverse chiral regulation methods. The relationship between synthesis parameters and the glum value is clarified using ML models, successfully forecasting and producing G&#8208;quartet gels with a maximum glum value of 0.15.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in chiral functional devices. Synthesizing CPL materials with a high dissymmetry factor (glum) remains a significant challenge. Inspired by efficient machine learning (ML) applications in scientific research, this work demonstrates ML&#8208;based techniques for the first time to guide the synthesis of G&#8208;quartet&#8208;based CPL gels with high glum values and multiple chiral regulation strategies. Employing an &#8220;experiment&#8208;prediction&#8208;verification&#8221; approach, this work devises a ML classification and regression model for the solvothermal synthesis of G&#8208;quartet gels in deep eutectic solvents. This process illustrates the relationship between various synthesis parameters and the glum value. The decision tree algorithm demonstrates superior performance across six ML models, with model accuracy and determination coefficients amounting to 0.97 and 0.96, respectively. The screened CPL gels exhibiting a glum value up to 0.15 are obtained through combined ML guidance and experimental verification, among the highest ones reported till now for biomolecule&#8208;based CPL systems. These findings indicate that ML can streamline the rational design of chiral nanomaterials, thereby expediting their further development.

         <title>Bismuth and Chlorine Dual&#8208;Doped Perovskite Chloride as a Phase&#8208;Structure&#8208;Stable and Moisture&#8208;Resistant Solid Electrolyte for Chloride Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bismuth and chlorine dual doping approach is developed to stabilize the cubic structure of perovskite chloride against the extremely low temperature of 213&#160;K and ambient conditions with 40% relative humidity for a long period, thereby yielding the cubic CsSn0.9Bi0.1Cl3.1 solid electrolyte with efficient chloride ion conduction in different symmetric solid cells and various rechargeable chloride ion batteries.








Abstract
Perovskite chloride, an anion conductor, is a promising candidate to be a solid electrolyte for high&#8208;energy and sustainable chloride ion batteries (CIB). However, it suffers from poor structural stability at low temperature and in ambient conditions, which leads to its transformation from an ionic conductor to an insulator. Herein, a bismuth and chlorine dual doping strategy is developed to stabilize the cubic structure of CsSnCl3 in harsh environments. The as&#8208;prepared dual&#8208;doped CsSn0.9Bi0.1Cl3.1 material with an optimized composition maintains its cubic structure at the extremely low temperature of 213&#160;K for 10 days and at 40% relative humidity for 50 days, while the undoped cubic material deteriorates and transforms to a monoclinic phase under these conditions in less than 1 day. Consequently, the dual doping achieves efficient chloride ion conduction that is superior to single bismuth doping due to the introduction of interstitial chlorine facilitating chloride ion transport. Importantly, the practicality of the as&#8208;prepared solid electrolyte is demonstrated in different symmetric solid cells and by various CIBs using the organic electrode couple, a multivalent metal chloride cathode, or a new high&#8208;voltage metal oxychloride cathode.

         <title>Satellite&#8208;Type Sulfur Atom Distribution in Trithiocarbonate Bond&#8208;Bridged Dimeric Prodrug Nanoassemblies: Achieving Both Stability and Activatability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trithiocarbonate bond (&#9472;SC(S)S&#9472;) in homodimeric prodrug nanoassemblies (HDPNs) is introduced to improve their chemical stability while maintaining the on&#8208;demand bioactivation. Meanwhile, trithiocarbonate bond can inhibit antioxidant defense system, leading to up&#8208;regulation of the cellular ROS and apoptosis of tumor cell. These improvements endow the HDPNs with in vivo longevity and tumor specificity, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic outcomes.








Abstract
Homodimeric prodrug nanoassemblies (HDPNs) hold promise for improving the delivery efficiency of chemo&#8208;drugs. However, the key challenge lies in designing rational chemical linkers that can simultaneously ensure the chemical stability, self&#8208;assembly stability, and site&#8208;specific activation of prodrugs. The &#8220;in series&#8221; increase in sulfur atoms, such as trisulfide bond, can improve the assembly stability of HDPNs to a certain extent, but limits the chemical stability of prodrugs. Herein, trithiocarbonate bond (&#9472;SC(S)S&#9472;), with a stable &#8220;satellite&#8208;type&#8221; distribution of sulfur atoms, is developed via the insertion of a central carbon atom in trisulfide bonds. &#9472;SC(S)S&#9472; bond effectively addresses the existing predicament of HDPNs by improving the chemical and self&#8208;assembly stability of homodimeric prodrugs while maintaining the on&#8208;demand bioactivation. Furthermore, &#9472;SC(S)S&#9472; bond inhibits antioxidant defense system, leading to up&#8208;regulation of the cellular ROS and apoptosis of tumor cells. These improvements of &#9472;SC(S)S&#9472; bond endow the HDPNs with in vivo longevity and tumor specificity, ultimately enhancing the therapeutic outcomes. &#9472;SC(S)S&#9472; bond is, therefore, promising for overcoming the bottleneck of HDPNs for efficient oncological therapy.

         <title>Upcycling Waste Thermosetting Polyimide Resins into High&#8208;Performance and Sustainable Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistance Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of sustainable and advanced materials is exploited from waste thermosetting polyimide via a mild and full recovery path, which can be used as adhesive applied in ultralow temperature environment. This waste&#8208;based adhesive shows strong adhesion to various substrates and excellent reusability, opening a wide design space for high&#8208;performance supramolecular materials.








Abstract
Thermosetting polyimide (PI) has attracted extensive attention for its excellent properties, but the approaches to its end&#8208;of&#8208;life management are not sustainable, posing great threat to the ecosystem. Herein, this work proposes a mild, sustainable, and full recovery path for recycling waste carbon fiber reinforced phenylethynyl end&#8208;capped PI resin composites. In addition to recycling reaction reagent and woven carbon fiber, degraded products (DPETI) can be fully and directly used as high&#8208;performance and sustainable adhesives. DPETI exhibits strong adhesion to various surfaces, with a maximum adhesion strength of 1.84&#160;MPa. Due to the strong supramolecular polymerization behavior without solvent dependence, DPETI demonstrates higher adhesive strength of 2.22&#160;MPa in the extreme environment (&#8722;196 &#176;C), which is maintained even after 10 cycles. This work sparks a new thinking for plastic wastes recycling that is to convert unrecyclable wastes into new and sustainable materials, which has the potential to establish new links within circular economies and influence the development of materials science.

         <title>Exploring the Surface Oxidation and Environmental Instability of 2H&#8208;/1T&#8217;&#8208;MoTe2 Using Field Emission&#8208;Based Scanning Probe Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A resistless scanning probe&#8208;based nanolithography method is presented, which allows the controllable patterning of down to single atomic layers of MoTe2. Through this, it is possible to demonstrate for the first time an anisotropic instability of 1T&#8217;&#8208;MoTe2 to aqueous environments. It is furthermore used to fabricate a nanoribbon transistor out of a three atomic layer thick 2H&#8208;MoTe2 nanosheet.








Abstract
An unconventional approach for the resistless nanopatterning 2H&#8208; and 1T&#8217;&#8208;MoTe2 by means of scanning probe lithography is presented. A Fowler&#8211;Nordheim tunneling current of low energetic electrons (E = 30&#8211;60&#160;eV) emitted from the tip of an atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilever is utilized to induce a nanoscale oxidation on a MoTe2 nanosheet surface under ambient conditions. Due to the water solubility of the generated oxide, a direct pattern transfer into the MoTe2 surface can be achieved by a simple immersion of the sample in deionized water. The tip&#8208;grown oxide is characterized using Auger electron and Raman spectroscopy, revealing it consists of amorphous MoO3/MoOx as well as TeO2/TeOx. With the presented technology in combination with subsequent AFM imaging it is possible to demonstrate a strong anisotropic sensitivity of 1T&#8217;&#8208;/(Td)&#8208;MoTe2 to aqueous environments. Finally the discussed approach is used to structure a nanoribbon field effect transistor out of a few&#8208;layer 2H&#8208;MoTe2 nanosheet.

         <title>Photodynamic Modulation of Endoplasmic Reticulum and Mitochondria Network Boosted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
THTTPy&#8208;PTSA, a novel photoactivatable endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#8208;mitochondria sequential targeted probe, subsequent translocation from the ER to mitochondria induces a cascade&#8208;amplification effect, resulting in a robust ER stress and mitochondrial damage to produce ROS. THTTPy&#8208;PTSA promotes immunogenic cell death, leading to increased release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and dendritic cell maturation. Activating the adaptive immune response and manifesting a significant inhibition of tumor growth.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) represents a promising approach for enhancing tumor therapy efficacy by inducing antitumor immune response. However, current ICD inducers often have insufficient endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enrichment and ineffectiveness in tumor immune escape caused by ER&#8208;mitochondria interaction. In this study, a kind of photoactivatable probe, THTTPy&#8208;PTSA, which enables sequential targeting of the ER and mitochondria is developed. THTTPy&#8208;PTSA incorporates p&#8208;Toluenesulfonamide (PTSA) for ER targeting, and upon light irradiation, the tetrahydropyridine group undergoes a photo oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, transforming into a pyridinium group that acts as a mitochondria&#8208;targeting moiety. The results demonstrate that THTTPy&#8208;PTSA exhibits exceptional subcellular translocation from the ER to mitochondria upon light irradiation treatment, subsequently triggers a stronger ER stress response through a cascade&#8208;amplification effect. Importantly, the augmented ER stress leads to substantial therapeutic efficacy in a 4T1 tumor model by eliciting the release of numerous damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby inducing evident and widespread ICD, consequently enhancing the antitumor immune efficacy. Collectively, the findings emphasize the pivotal role of photodynamic modulation of the ER&#8208;mitochondria network, facilitated by THTTPy&#8208;PTSA with precise spatial and temporal regulation, in effectively bolstering the antitumor immune response. This innovative approach presents a promising alternative for addressing the challenges associated with cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Self&#8208;Induced Dual&#8208;Layered Solid Electrolyte Interphase with High Toughness and High Ionic Conductivity for Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable dual&#8208;layered solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)&#160;is constructed in a scalable and low&#8208;loss manner to improve the performance of Li metal batteries. The robust inner inorganic layer enables uniform Li deposition; the outer organic layer further improves the stability of Li/electrolyte interphase. Benefiting from the remarkable effects of this dual&#8208;layered SEI, the Li metal batteries exhibit excellent long&#8208;term cycling performance.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is considered as one of the most promising candidates of anode material for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy batteries, while irreversible chemical reactions always occur on the Li surface to continuously consume active Li, electrolyte. Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer has been regarded as the key component in protecting Li metal anode. Herein, a controllable dual&#8208;layered SEI for Li metal anode in a scalable, low&#8208;loss manner is constructed. The SEI is self&#8208;induced by the predeposited LiAlO2 (LAO) layer during the initial cycles, in which the outer organic layer is produced due to the electrons tunneling through LAO, resulting in the reduction of electrolyte. The robust inner LAO layer can promote uniform Li deposition owing to its favorable mechanical strength and ionic conductivity, and&#160;the outer organic layer can further improve the stability of SEI. Benefiting from the remarkable effects of this dual&#8208;layered SEI, enhanced electrochemical performance of the LAO&#8211;Li anode is achieved. Additionally, a large&#8208;size LAO&#8211;Li sample can be easily obtained, and the preparation of the modified Li metal anode shows huge potential for large&#8208;scale production. This work highlights the tremendous potential of this self&#8208;induced dual&#8208;layered SEI for the commercialization of Li metal anode.

         <title>Perovskite Cathodes for Aqueous and Organic Iodine Batteries Operating Under One and Two Electrons Redox Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The iodine&#8208;rich 2D perovskite materials work as an innovative iodine cathode for high&#8208;performance iodine&#8208;based batteries, which are well suited to diversified electrolytes and two&#8208;electron redox modes, delivering large capacity, high output voltage, and high energy density.








Abstract
Although conversion&#8208;type iodine&#8208;based batteries are considered promising for energy storage systems, stable electrode materials are scarce, especially for high&#8208;performance multi&#8208;electron reactions. The use of tin&#8208;based iodine&#8208;rich 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) ODASnI4 (ODA: 1,8&#8208;octanediamine) perovskite materials as cathode materials for iodine&#8208;based batteries is suggested. As a proof of concept, organic lithium&#8208;perovskite and aqueous zinc&#8208;perovskite batteries are fabricated and they can be operated based on the conventional one&#8208;electron and advanced two&#8208;electron transfer modes. The active elemental iodine in the perovskite cathode provides capacity through a reversible I&#8722;/I+ redox pair conversion at full depth, and the rapid electron injection/extraction leads to excellent reaction kinetics. Consequently, high discharge plateaus (1.71&#160;V vs Zn2+/Zn; 3.41&#160;V vs Li+/Li), large capacity (421 mAh g&#8722;1I), and a low decay rate (1.74&#160;mV&#160;mAh&#8722;1 g&#8722;1I) are achieved for lithium and zinc ion batteries, respectively. This study demonstrates the promising potential of perovskite materials for high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;iodine batteries. Their reactions based on the two&#8208;electron transfer mechanism shed light on similar battery systems aiming for decent operational stability and high energy density.

         <title>Boosting Solid&#8208;State Reconversion Reactivity to Mitigate Lithium Trapping for High Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that by boosting the intrinsic solid&#8208;state reconversion reactivity, the lithium trapping can be effectively mitigated, thereby enhancing the initial Coulombic efficiency. This work presents novel insights into imbuing bulk materials with distinct electrochemical properties of nanomaterials and propels the commercialization of advanced electrode materials.








Abstract
An initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) higher than 90% is crucial for industrial lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but numerous electrode materials are not standards compliant. Lithium trapping, due to i) incomplete solid&#8208;state reaction of Li+ generation and ii) sluggish Li+ diffusion, undermines ICE in high&#8208;capacity electrodes (e.g., conversion&#8208;type electrodes). Current approaches mitigating lithium trapping emphasize ii) nanoscaling (&lt;50&#160;nm) to minimize Li+ diffusion distance, followed by severe solid electrolyte interphase formation and inferior volumetric energy density. Herein,&#160;this work accentuates i) instead, to demonstrate that the lithium trapping can be mitigated by boosting the solid&#8208;state reaction reactivity. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, ternary LiFeO2 anodes, whose discharged products contain highly reactive vacancy&#8208;rich Fe nanoparticles, can alleviate lithium trapping and enable a remarkable average ICE of &#8776;92.77%, much higher than binary Fe2O3 anodes (&#8776;75.19%). Synchrotron&#8208;based techniques and theoretical simulations reveal that the solid&#8208;state reconversion reaction for Li+ generation between Fe and Li2O can be effectively promoted by the Fe&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich local chemical environment. The superior ICE is further demonstrated by assembled pouch cells. This work proposes a novel paradigm of regulating intrinsic solid&#8208;state chemistry to ameliorate electrochemical performance and facilitate industrial applications of various advanced electrode materials.

         <title>Wood&#8208;Derived Freestanding Carbon&#8208;Based Electrode with Hierarchical Structure for Industrial&#8208;Level Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The naturally wood material is transformed into a freestanding carbon electrode by encapsulating the Ni nanoparticles within the N&#8208;doped carbonized wood. Such freestanding carbon electrode exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance in an anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) electrolyzer for industrial&#8208;level hydrogen production.








Abstract
The sustainable and scalable fabrication of low&#8208;cost, efficient, and durable electrocatalysts that operate well at industrial&#8208;level current density is urgently needed for large&#8208;scale implementation of the water splitting to produce hydrogen. In this work, an integrated carbon electrode is constructed by encapsulating Ni nanoparticles within N&#8208;doped carbonized wood framework (Ni@NCW). Such integrated electrode with hierarchically porous structure facilitates mass transfer process for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ni@NCW electrode can be employed directly as a robust electrocatalyst for HER, which affords the industrial&#8208;level current density of 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at low overpotential of 401&#160;mV. The freestanding binder&#8208;free electrode exhibits extraordinary stability for 100&#160;h. An anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) electrolyzer assembled with such freestanding carbon electrode requires only a lower cell voltage of 2.43&#160;V to achieve ampere&#8208;level current of 4.0&#160;A for hydrogen production without significant performance degradation. These advantages reveal the great potential of this strategy in designing cost&#8208;effective freestanding electrode with monometallic, bimetallic, or trimetallic species based on abundant natural wood resources for water splitting.

         <title>Printed Divisional Optical Biochip for Multiplex Visualizable Exosome Analysis at Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A divisional optical biochip is reported for label&#8208;free, rapid, and visualizable multiplex detection of different clinical exosomes in one test, benefiting from the optical amplification of printed nanochains and the precise droplet self&#8208;splitting by patterned surfaces. Further, this biochip, owning high specificity and excellent semiquantitative capability, is expected to be used as a point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing tool in liquid biopsy.








Abstract
Rapid detection of various exosomes is of great significance in early diagnosis and postoperative monitoring of cancers. Here, a divisional optical biochip is reported for multiplex exosome analysis via combining the self&#8208;assembly of nanochains and precise surface patterning. Arising from resonance&#8208;induced near&#8208;field enhancement, the nanochains show distinct color changes after capturing target exosomes for direct visual detection. Then, a series of divisional nanochain&#8208;based biochips conjugated with several specific antibodies are fabricated through designed hydrophilic and hydrophobic patterns. Because of the significant wettability difference, one sample droplet is precisely self&#8208;splitting into several microdroplets enabling simultaneous identification of multiple target exosomes in 30&#160;min with a sensitivity of 6 &#215; 107 particles mL&#8722;1, which is about two orders lower than enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay. Apart from the trace amount detection, excellent semiquantitative capability is demonstrated to distinguish clinical exosomes from glioblastoma patients and healthy people. This method is simple, versatile, and highly efficient that can be extended as a diagnostic tool for many diseases, promoting the development of liquid biopsy.

         <title>Suppressing Rampant and Vertical Deposition of Cathode Intermediate Product via PH Regulation Toward Large&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Durability Zn//MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to mitigate the detrimental effects of dramatic pH increases in Zn//MnO2 batteries upon discharging due to the electrodissolution of MnO2, an electrolyte additive with exceptional pH buffering capability has been introduced. This can effectively suppress rampant and vertical deposition of zinc hydroxide sulfate intermediate product at the cathode, thereby significantly improving the electrochemical performance of Zn//MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Despite great prospects, Zn//MnO2 batteries suffer from rampant and vertical deposition of zinc sulfate hydroxide (ZSH) at the cathode surface, which leads to a significant impact on their electrochemical performance. This phenomenon is primarily due to the drastic increase in the electrolyte pH value upon discharging, which is closely associated with the electrodissolution of Mn&#8208;based active materials. Herein, the pH value change is effectively inhibited by employing an electrolyte additive with excellent pH buffering capability. As such, the formation of ZSH at the cathode is postponed, resulting in the deposition of ZSH in a horizontal arrangement. This strategy can significantly enhance the utilization efficiency of cathode active material, while also enabling a solid electrolyte interphase layer at the Zn anode to address low Zn stripping/plating reversibility. With the optimal electrolyte, the Zn//MnO2 battery realizes a 25.6% increase in the specific capacity at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 compared to that with the baseline electrolyte, great rate capability (161.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1), and superior capacity retention (90.2% over 5,000 cycles). In addition, the pH buffering strategy is highly applicable in hydrogel electrolytes. This work underscores the importance of pH regulation for Zn//MnO2 batteries and provides enlightening insights.

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;phase CoPS, a new metal phosphosulfide for SIBs, in the form of quantum dots, is successfully introduced into a leaf&#8208;shape carbon nanosheet, which is further in situ anchored on a 3D branch&#8208;like N&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber to construct a hierarchical leaf&#8208;branch&#8208;shaped CoPS@C@N&#8208;CNF. Benefiting from the remarkable advantages of unique nanoarchitectures, the CoPS@C@N&#8208;CNF affords a remarkable long&#8208;cycle durability and good rate capability.








Abstract
New&#8208;fashioned electrode hosts for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are elaborately engineered to involve multifunctional active components that can synergistically conquer the critical issues of severe volume deformation and sluggish reaction kinetics of electrodes toward immensely enhanced battery performance. Herein, it is first reported that single&#8208;phase CoPS, a new metal phosphosulfide for SIBs, in the form of quantum dots, is successfully introduced into a leaf&#8208;shaped conductive carbon nanosheet, which can be further in situ anchored on a 3D interconnected branch&#8208;like N&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber (N&#8208;CNF) to construct a hierarchical branch&#8208;leaf&#8208;shaped CoPS@C@N&#8208;CNF architecture. Both double carbon decorations and ultrafine crystal of the CoPS in&#8208;this exquisite architecture hold many significant superiorities, such as favorable train&#8208;relaxation, fast interfacial ion&#8208;migration, multi&#8208;directional migration pathways, and sufficiently exposed Na+&#8208;storage sites. In consequence, the CoPS@C@N&#8208;CNF affords remarkable long&#8208;cycle durability over 10&#160;000 cycles at 20.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and superior rate capability. Meanwhile, the CoPS@C@N&#8208;CNF&#8208;based sodium&#8208;ion full cell renders the potential proof&#8208;of&#8208;feasibility for practical applications in consideration of its high durability over a long&#8208;term cyclic lifespan with remarkable reversible capacity. Moreover, the phase transformation mechanism of the CoPS@C@N&#8208;CNF and fundamental springhead of the enhanced performance are disclosed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, ex situ high&#8208;resolution TEM, and theoretical calculations.

         <title>An Activatable Phototheranostic Probe for Anti&#8208;hypoxic Type I Photodynamic&#8208; and Immuno&#8208;Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phototheranostic probe (CyA) is designed with APN&#8208;activated fluorophotoacoustic signal&#8208;guided type&#8208;I PDT immunotherapy for effective tumor treatment. CyA not only shows potent anti&#8208;hypoxic phototoxicity against tumor cells but also elicits an apparent antitumor immune response. A stronger antitumor effect is achieved using CyA&#8208;mediated type I PDT in combination with immunotherapy.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which utilizes type I photoreactions, has great potential as an effective cancer treatment because of its hypoxia&#8208;tolerant superiority over the commonly used type II pathway. A few type I photosensitizers are exploited; however, they majorly induce cytotoxicity and possess poor tumor specificity and low&#8208;efficient theranostics. To resolve this issue, herein an aminopeptidase N (APN)&#8208;activated type&#160;I&#160;phototheranostic probe (CyA) is reported for anti&#8208;hypoxic PDT in conjunction with immunotherapy for effective cancer treatment. CyA can specifically activate near&#8208;infrared fluorescence, photoacoustic signals, and phototoxicity following APN&#8208;induced substrate cleavage and the subsequent generation of active phototheranostic molecules (such as CyBr). CyA endows specific imaging capabilities and effective phototoxicity toward tumor cells overexpressing APN under both normoxia and hypoxia. In addition, the locally activatable PDT induces systemic antitumor immune responses. More importantly, the integration of localized activated PDT and systemic immunotherapy evokes enhanced therapeutic effects with improved tumor inhibition efficiency in live mice compared with individual treatments. This study aims to present an activatable phototheranostic probe for effective hypoxia&#8208;tolerant PDT and combination therapy.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors: The Impacts of Halogen Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two halogen&#8208;functionalized bithiophene imide dimer&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECS), f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF and f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCl, are synthesized, featuring deep&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and favorable polymer chain packing motif. Polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF delivers a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#181;C* of 90.2 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in organic electrochemical transistors and an excellent power factor of 64.2 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 in organic thermoelectrics. Such results shed light on the impacts of halogen atoms on developing high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type PMIECS.









Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) is a grand challenge, which largely determines their applications in vaious organic electronic devices, such as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, two halogen&#8208;functionalized PMIECs f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF and f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCl built from fused bithiophene imide dimer (f&#8208;BTI2) as the acceptor unit and halogenated thienylene&#8211;vinylene&#8211;thienylene (TVT) as the donor co&#8208;unit are reported. Compared to the control polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVT, the fluorinated f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF shows lower&#8208;positioned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), improved charge transport property, and greater ion uptake capacity. Consequently, f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF delivers a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;&#181;C* of 90.2 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 with a remarkable electron mobility of 0.41 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in OECTs and an excellent power factor of 64.2 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 in OTEs. An OECT&#8208;based inverter amplifier is further demonstrated with voltage gain up to 148&#160;V V&#8722;1, which is among the highest values for OECT inverters. Such results shed light on the impacts of halogen atoms on developing high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type PMIECs.

         <title>Construction of Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive Highly Porous Switchable Frameworks by In Situ Solid&#8208;State Generation of Spiropyran Switches</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A post&#8208;synthetic strategy for the construction of highly porous aromatic frameworks is presented. This approach enables the fabrication of a series of materials with a wide range of properties and applicability in diverse fields.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive molecular systems support within permanently porous materials offer the opportunity to host dynamic functions in multifunctional smart materials. However, the construction of highly porous frameworks featuring external&#8208;stimuli responsiveness, for example by light excitation, is still in its infancy. Here a general strategy is presented to construct spiropyran&#8208;functionalized highly porous switchable aromatic frameworks by modular and high&#8208;precision anchoring of molecular hooks and an innovative in situ solid&#8208;state grafting approach. Three spiropyran&#8208;grafted frameworks bearing distinct functional groups exhibiting various stimuli&#8208;responsiveness are generated by two&#8208;step post&#8208;solid&#8208;state synthesis of a parent indole&#8208;based material. The quantitative transformation and preservation of high porosity are demonstrated by spectroscopic and gas adsorption techniques. For the first time, a highly efficient strategy is provided to construct multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive, yet structurally robust, spiropyran materials with high pore capacity which is proved essential for the reversible and quantitative isomerization in the bulk as demonstrated by solid&#8208;state NMR spectroscopy. The overall strategy allows to construct dynamic materials that undergoes reversible transformation of spiropyran to zwitterionic merocyanine, by chemical and physical stimulation, showing potential for pH active control, responsive gas uptake and release, contaminant removal, and water harvesting.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of multifunctional integrated regioregular tetrapolymer semiconductors with excellent crystallinity, intrinsic stretchability, high mobility, and controllable NIR luminescence is reported. Additionally, the homologous blending strategy is proposed to further enhance the luminescence properties of polymers toward the first&#8208;best comprehensive optoelectronic performance, thereby first realizing the integration of excellent optical, electrical, and mechanical properties into a molecular system.








Abstract
Multifunctional semiconductors integrating unique optical, electrical, mechanical, and chemical characteristics are critical to advanced and emerging manufacturing technologies. However, due to the trade&#8208;off challenges in design principles, fabrication difficulty, defects in existing materials, etc., realizing multiple functions through multistage manufacturing is quite taxing. Here, an effective molecular design strategy is established to prepare a class of multifunctional integrated polymer semiconductors. The pyridal[1,2,3]triazole&#8208;thiophene co&#8208;structured tetrapolymers with full&#8208;backbone coplanarity and considerable inter/intramolecular noncovalent interactions facilitate short&#8208;range order and excellent (re)organization capability of polymer chains, providing stress&#8208;dissipation sites in the film state. The regioregular multicomponent conjugated backbones contribute to dense packing, excellent crystallinity, high crack onset strain over 100%, efficient carrier transport with mobilities exceeding 1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, and controllable near&#8208;infrared luminescence. Furthermore, a homologous blending strategy is proposed to further enhance the color&#8208;tunable luminescent properties of polymers while effectively retaining mechanical and electrical properties. The blended system exhibits excellent field&#8208;effect mobility (&#181;) and quantum yield (&#934;), reaching a record &#934;&#8201;&#183;&#8201;&#181; of 0.43&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Overall, the proposed strategy facilitates a rational design of regioregular semicrystalline intrinsically stretchable polymers with high mobility and color&#8208;tunable intense luminescence, providing unique possibilities for the development of multifunctional integrated semiconductors in organic optoelectronics.

         <title>Continuous Volumetric 3D Printing: Xolography in Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xolography in flow is the first continuous volumetric 3D printing technique based on dual&#8208;color photopolymerization. Inside a specifically designed flow cell, enabling homogeneous printing conditions in the constantly flowing resin, objects with true shape and high resolution can continuously be fabricated, bringing the high throughput fabrication of complex&#8208;shaped building blocks for tissue engineering into reach.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing techniques continue to improve in resolution, geometrical freedom, and production rates, expanding their application range in research and industry. Most established techniques, however, are based on layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer polymerization processes, leading to an inherent trade&#8208;off between resolution and printing speed. Volumetric 3D printing enables the polymerization of freely defined volumes allowing the fabrication of complex geometries at drastically increased production rates and high resolutions, marking the next chapter in light&#8208;based additive manufacturing. This work advances the volumetric 3D printing technique xolography to a continuous process. Dual&#8208;color photopolymerization is performed in a continuously flowing resin, inside a tailored flow cell. Supported by simulations, the flow profile in the printing area is flattened, and resin velocities at the flow cell walls are increased to minimize unwanted polymerization via laser sheet&#8208;induced curing. Various objects are printed continuously and true to shape with smooth surfaces. Parallel object printing paves the way for up&#8208;scaling the continuous production, currently reaching production rates up to 1.75&#160;mm3&#8201;s&#8722;1 for the presented flow cell. Xolography in flow provides a new opportunity for scaling up volumetric 3D printing with the potential to resolve the trade&#8208;off between high production rates and high resolution in light&#8208;based additive manufacturing.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free Ultrafast Construction of Se&#8208;Deficient Heterojunctions of Bimetallic Selenides toward Flexible Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast solvent&#8208;free microwave method is developed to prepare carbon&#8208;coating CoSe2/FeSe2&#8722;x heterostructure with enriched selenium vacancies, which is grown on the surface of waste cloth&#8208;derived carbon cloth. When used as flexible anode, it displays excellent properties in half/full sodium&#8208;ion batteries. This preparation strategy can be also extended to develop other advanced electrodes in metal&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium ion batteries featuring their low&#8208;cost, high safety and excellent mechanical strength have attracted widespread interest in the field of wearable electronic devices. However, the development of such batteries faces great challenges including the construction of interfacial compatible flexible electrode materials and addressing the high safety demands of electrolyte. Here selenium&#8208;vacancies regulated bimetallic selenide heterojunctions anchored on waste cotton cloth&#8208;derived flexible carbon cloth (FCC) with robust interfacial C&#8208;Se&#8208;Co/Fe chemical bonds as a flexible anode material (CCFSF) is proposed by ultrafast microwave pyrolysis method. Rich selenium vacancies and CoSe2/FeSe2&#8722;x heterostructures are synchronously formed that can significantly improve ionic and electronic diffusion kinetics. Additionally, a uniform carbon layer coating on the surface of Se&#8208;deficient heterostructures endows it with outstanding structural stability. The flexible cathode (PB@FCC) is also fabricated by directly growing Prussian blue nanoparticles on the FCC. Furthermore, an advanced flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion pouch cell is assembled by coupling CCFSF anode, PB@FCC cathode with P(VDF&#8208;HFP)&#8208;based gel polymer electrolyte. The full cell not only demonstrates excellent energy storage performance but also robust mechanical flexibility and safety. The present work offers an effective avenue to achieve high safety flexible energy storage device, promoting the development of flexible wearable electronic devices.

Cellular Signaling
Cells communicate through secreted biomolecules, however there are few tools to directly record these signals. In article number 2306704, Chan Ho Park, H. Tom Soh, and co&#8208;workers report that embedding fluorescent aptamer sensors within a biocompatible hydrogel enables tracking of cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell signaling with molecular specificity and high temporal resolution, demonstrated by monitoring of the molecular signals driving slime mold cell migration. This technology should be applicable for studying a wide range of biological systems.

Spontaneous Water Dissociation
In article number 2308027, Vesna Ribi&#263;, Vanja Jordan, Aleksander Re&#269;nik, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that epitaxial rutile fibers grown in acidic conditions are capable of conveying their structurally encoded properties into a neutral medium when re&#8208;immersed. Their very specific translation state triggers spontaneous cracking of the O&#9472;H bond resulting in water dissociation.

Machine Learning
In article number 2310455, Lingyan Feng and co&#8208;workers pioneer the application of machine learning (ML) models to guide the synthesis of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) gels characterized by a high dissymmetry factor (glum) and diverse chiral regulation methods. The relationship between synthesis parameters and the glum value is clarified using ML models, successfully forecasting and producing G&#8208;quartet&#8208;based CPL materials with a maximum glum value of 0.15.

Ultracompact Single&#8208;Photon Sources
In article number 2304495, Yinhui Kan, Changying Zhao, Sergey I. Bozhevolnyi, and co&#8208;workers propose ultracompact chip&#8208;integrated single&#8208;photon sources of linearly polarized vortex beams. The design strategy facilitates the control of the polarization, orbital angular momentum (OAM), and entanglement of multichannel single&#8208;photon emission, enabling simultaneous generation of high&#8208;purity orthogonal linearly polarized single&#8208;photon beams with arbitrary different OAMs.

Dual&#8208;Color Real&#8208;Time Chemosensing
In article number 2306922, Andreas Hennig, Werner M. Nau, and co&#8208;workers describe a system with spatially and optically separated, compartmentalized chemosensors that mimics and temporally resolves two fast reactions in a simple peptide digestion&#8208;resorption network. The lipid&#8208;vesicle&#8208;based method can eventually be extended to mimic related functional cellular pathways, such as signaling, or, more generally, to logic&#8208;gate operations.

         <title>Advancements in Microwave Absorption Motivated by Interdisciplinary Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review traces microwave absorption materials (MAMs) from initial coatings to functional absorbers, summarizes the bottlenecks, and proposes potential solutions like mechanism exploration, material development, novel tool application, and lab&#8208;user proximity. It also details impactful MAMs applications in interdisciplinary fields, highlighting their development status and prospects. This marks the next smart absorber era, driving future MW use.








Abstract
Microwave absorption materials (MAMs) are originally developed for military purposes, but have since evolved into versatile materials with promising applications in modern technologies, including household use. Despite significant progress in bench&#8208;side research over the past decade, MAMs remain limited in their scope and have yet to be widely adopted. This review explores the history of MAMs from first&#8208;generation coatings to second&#8208;generation functional absorbers, identifies bottlenecks hindering their maturation. It also presents potential solutions such as exploring broader spatial scales, advanced characterization, introducing liquid media, utilizing novel toolbox (machine learning, ML), and proximity of lab to end&#8208;user. Additionally, it meticulously presents compelling applications of MAMs in medicine, mechanics, energy, optics, and sensing, which go beyond absorption efficiency, along with their current development status and prospects. This interdisciplinary research direction differs from previous research which primarily focused on meeting traditional requirements (i.e., thin, lightweight, wide, and strong), and can be defined as the next generation of smart absorbers. Ultimately, the effective utilization of ubiquitous electromagnetic (EM) waves, aided by third&#8208;generation MAMs, should be better aligned with future expectations.

         <title>The Electrical Behaviors of Grain Boundaries in Polycrystalline Optoelectronic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a systematic overview of the electrical properties of grain boundaries in polycrystalline optoelectronic materials and covers the impact of doping and passivation on carrier recombination and transport at grain boundaries. Through deliberate and rational manipulation of the grain boundaries, it is possible to achieve high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Polycrystalline optoelectronic materials are widely used for photoelectric signal conversion and energy harvesting and play an irreplaceable role in the semiconductor field. As an important factor in determining the optoelectronic properties of polycrystalline materials, grain boundaries (GBs) are the focus of research. Particular emphases are placed on the generation and height of GB barriers, how carriers move at GBs, whether GBs act as carrier transport channels or recombination sites, and how to change the device performance by altering the electrical behaviors of GBs. This review introduces the evolution of GB theory and experimental observation history, classifies GB electrical behaviors from the perspective of carrier dynamics, and summarizes carrier transport state under external conditions such as bias and illumination and the related band bending. Then the carrier scattering at GBs and the electrical differences between GBs and twin boundaries are discussed. Last, the review describes how the electrical behaviors of GBs can be influenced and modified by treatments such as passivation or by consciously adjusting the distribution of grain boundary elements. By studying the carrier dynamics and the relevant electrical behaviors of GBs in polycrystalline materials, researchers can develop optoelectronics with higher performance.

         <title>Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristors for Three&#8208;Dimensional&#160;In&#8208;Memory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the research progress in self&#8208;rectifying memristors (SRM) and SRM&#8208;based applications including 3D memory, in&#8208;memory computing, neuromorphic computing, and hardware security. Through a comprehensive analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of SRMs in different application scenarios, as well as challenges at the device, 3D integration, and peripheral circuit levels, corresponding research ideas and potential solutions are proposed.








Abstract
Costly data movement in terms of time and energy in traditional von Neumann systems is exacerbated by emerging information technologies related to artificial intelligence. In&#8208;memory computing (IMC) architecture aims to address this problem. Although the IMC hardware prototype represented by a memristor is developed rapidly and performs well, the sneak path issue is a critical and unavoidable challenge prevalent in large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;density crossbar arrays, particularly in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) integration. As a perfect solution to the sneak&#8208;path issue, a self&#8208;rectifying memristor (SRM) is proposed for 3D integration because of its superior integration density. To date, SRMs have performed well in terms of power consumption (aJ level) and scalability (&gt;102&#160;Mbit). Moreover, SRM&#8208;configured 3D integration is considered an ideal hardware platform for 3D IMC. This review focuses on the progress in SRMs and their applications in 3D memory, IMC, neuromorphic computing, and hardware security. The advantages, disadvantages, and optimization strategies of SRMs in diverse application scenarios are illustrated. Challenges posed by physical mechanisms, fabrication processes, and peripheral circuits, as well as potential solutions at the device and system levels, are also discussed.

         <title>Current State and Perspectives of Exfoliated Zeolites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered zeolites join the class of 2D solids that can be dispersed, like graphene, by soft&#8208;chemical treatment to provide unilamellar nanosheets in solution. Aside from solving a 3&#8208;decade old challenge, this enables using zeolites for a top&#8208;down assembly of hierarchical nanocomposites with any type of nanomaterials or compound. Especially valuable benefits include preparation of oriented zeolite films.








Abstract
Zeolites are highly efficient industrial catalysts and sorbents with microporous framework structures. Approximately 10% of the frameworks, but eventually all in the long run, have produced both 3D crystals and 2D layers. The latter can be intercalated and expanded like all 2D materials but proved difficult to exfoliate directly into suspensions of monolayers in solution as precursors for unique synthetic opportunities. Successful exfoliations have been reported recently and are overviewed in this perspective article. The discussion highlights 3 primary challenges in this field, namely finding suitable 2D zeolite preparations that exfoliate directly in high yield, proving uniform layer thickness in solution and identifying applications to exploit the unique synthetic capabilities and properties of exfoliated zeolite monolayers. Four zeolites have been confirmed to exfoliate directly into monolayers: 3 with known structures&#8212;MWW, MFI, and RWR and one unknown, bifer with a unit cell close to ferrierite. The exfoliation into monolayers is confirmed by the combination of 5&#8211;6 characterization techniques including AFM, in situ and in&#8208;plane XRD, and microscopies. The promising areas of development are oriented films and membranes, intimately mixed zeolite phases, and hierarchical nanoscale composites with other active species like nanoparticles and clusters that are unfeasible by solid state processes.

         <title>Challenges and Advances in Rechargeable Batteries for Extreme&#8208;Condition Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable batteries have been widely used in the daily life, but their applications are largely compromised under extreme environments due to various failure mechanisms. This review focuses on the mechanistic understanding of the key challenges that limit the battery performance, and highlights recent new concepts and approaches to address these critical challenges under different extreme conditions.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries are widely used as power sources for portable electronics, electric vehicles and smart grids. Their practical performances are, however, largely undermined under extreme conditions, such as in high&#8208;altitude drones, ocean exploration and polar expedition. These extreme environmental conditions not only bring new challenges for batteries but also incur unique battery failure mechanisms. To fill in the gap, it is of great importance to understand the battery failure mechanisms under different extreme conditions and figure out the key parameters that limit battery performances. In this review, the authors start by investigating the key challenges from the viewpoints of ionic/charge transfer, material/interface evolution and electrolyte degradation under different extreme conditions. This is followed by different engineering approaches through electrode materials design, electrolyte modification and battery component optimization to enhance practical battery performances. Finally, a short perspective is provided about the future development of rechargeable batteries under extreme conditions.

         <title>Designing Hydrogels for Immunomodulation in Cancer Therapy and Regenerative Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting immune systems is a promising strategy for efficient cancer treatment and tissue repair. Hydrogels are intriguing platforms to circumvent the issues associated to systemic immunotherapy, such as short circulation time, poor targeting to action sites, and severe side effects. In this review, the recent advances in designing hydrogels for immunomodulation in cancer therapy and regenerative medicine are summarized.








Abstract
The immune system not only acts as a defense against pathogen and cancer cells, but also plays an important role in homeostasis and tissue regeneration. Targeting immune systems is a promising strategy for efficient cancer treatment and regenerative medicine. Current systemic immunomodulation therapies are usually associated with low persistence time, poor targeting to action sites, and severe side effects. Due to their extracellular matrix&#8208;mimetic nature, tunable properties and diverse bioactivities, hydrogels are intriguing platforms to locally deliver immunomodulatory agents and cells, as well as provide an immunomodulatory microenvironment to recruit, activate, and expand host immune cells. In this review, the design considerations, including polymer backbones, crosslinking mechanisms, physicochemical nature, and immunomodulation&#8208;related components, of the hydrogel platforms, are focused on. The immunomodulatory effects and therapeutic outcomes in cancer therapy and tissue regeneration of different hydrogel systems are emphasized, including hydrogel depots for delivery of immunomodulatory agents, hydrogel scaffolds for cell delivery, and immunomodulatory hydrogels depending on the intrinsic properties of materials. Finally, the remained challenges in current systems and future development of immunomodulatory hydrogels are discussed.

         <title>Pillararene&#8208;Based Supramolecular Polymers for Adsorption and Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular polymer materials have attracted significant attention for wide potential applications in numerous fields, particularly in adsorption and separation, due to the elegant combination of supramolecular chemistry with polymer science. This review highlights the recent advancements in pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular polymers for adsorption and separation applications, with an emphasis on their synthetic strategies, adsorption mechanisms, and separation performances.








Abstract
Supramolecular polymers have attracted increasing attention in recent years due to their perfect combination of supramolecular chemistry and traditional polymer chemistry. The design and synthesis of macrocycles have driven the rapid development of supramolecular chemistry and polymer science. Pillar[n]arenes, a new generation of macrocyclic compounds possessing unique pillar&#8208;shaped structures, nano&#8208;sized cavities, multi&#8208;functionalized groups, and excellent host&#8211;guest complexation abilities, are promising candidates to construct supramolecular polymer materials with enhanced properties and functionalities. This review summarizes recent progress in the design and synthesis of pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular polymers (PSPs) and illustrates their diverse applications as adsorption and separation materials. All performances are evaluated and analyzed in terms of efficiency, selectivity, and recyclability. Typically, PSPs can be categorized into three typical types according to their topologies, including linear, cross&#8208;linked, and hybrid structures. The advances made in the area of functional supramolecular polymeric adsorbents formed by new pillararene derivatives are also described in detail. Finally, the remaining challenges and future perspectives of PSPs for separation&#8208;based materials science are discussed. This review will inspire researchers in different fields and stimulate creative designs of supramolecular polymeric materials based on pillararenes and other macrocycles for effective adsorption and separation of a variety of targets.

         <title>Lipid Nanoparticles Optimized for Targeting and Release of Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the key bottlenecks in lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery, including organ accumulation and endosomal escape, and summarize improvement strategies in detail through mechanistic analysis. It also provides a brief overview of preclinical and clinical applications of LNPs as well as issues faced during formulation production. Finally, recommendations for future challenges and developments of LNP are made. 








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are currently the most promising clinical nucleic acids drug delivery vehicles. LNPs prevent the degradation of cargo nucleic acids during blood circulation. Upon entry into the cell, specific components of the lipid nanoparticles can promote the endosomal escape of nucleic acids. These are the basic properties of lipid nanoparticles as nucleic acid carriers. As LNPs exhibit hepatic aggregation characteristics, enhancing targeting out of the liver is a crucial way to improve LNPs administrated in vivo. Meanwhile, endosomal escape of nucleic acids loaded in LNPs is often considered inadequate, and therefore, much effort is devoted to enhancing the intracellular release efficiency of nucleic acids. Here, different strategies to efficiently deliver nucleic acid delivery from LNPs are concluded and their mechanisms are investigated. In addition, based on the information on LNPs that are in clinical trials or have completed clinical trials, the issues that are necessary to be approached in the clinical translation of LNPs are discussed, which it is hoped will shed light on the development of LNP nucleic acid drugs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the diverse configurations and material selections of flexible energy storage devices, they are driving the development of future flexible electronics in various fields, while maintaining a close connection among them.








Abstract
The field of flexible electronics is a crucial driver of technological advancement, with a strong connection to human life and a unique role in various areas such as wearable devices and healthcare. Consequently, there is an urgent demand for flexible energy storage devices (FESDs) to cater to the energy storage needs of various forms of flexible products. FESDs can be classified into three categories based on spatial dimension, all of which share the features of excellent electrochemical performance, reliable safety, and superb flexibility. In this review, the application scenarios of FESDs are introduced and the main representative devices applied in disparate fields are summarized first. More specifically, it focuses on three types of FESDs in matched application scenarios from both structural and material aspects. Finally, the challenges that hinder the practical application of FESDs and the views on current barriers are presented.

         <title>Recent Advancements in Electrochemical Hydrogen Production via Hybrid Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 4, January 25, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Replacing the anodic oxygen evolution reaction with thermodynamically more favorable oxidation reactions is regarded as a promising strategy to radically reduce the energy required for H2 production from water electrolysis. Here the recent progress of some major types of alternative oxidation reactions for hybrid water splitting has been comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
As one of the most promising approaches to producing high&#8208;purity hydrogen (H2), electrochemical water splitting powered by the renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power has attracted considerable interest over the past decade. However, the water electrolysis process is seriously hampered by the sluggish electrode reaction kinetics, especially the four&#8208;electron oxygen evolution reaction at the anode side, which induces a high reaction overpotential. Currently, the emerging hybrid electrochemical water splitting strategy is proposed by integrating thermodynamically favorable electro&#8211;oxidation reactions with hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode, providing a new opportunity for energy&#8211;efficient H2 production. To achieve highly efficient and cost&#8211;effective hybrid water splitting toward large&#8211;scale practical H2 production, much work has been continuously done to exploit the alternative anodic oxidation reactions and cutting&#8211;edge electrocatalysts. This review will focus on recent developments on electrochemical H2 production coupled with alternative oxidation reactions, including the choice of anodic substrates, the investigation on electrocatalytic materials, and the deep understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms. Finally, some insights into the scientific challenges now standing in the way of future advancement of the hybrid water electrolysis technique are shared, in the hope of inspiring further innovative efforts in this rapidly growing field.

         <title>3D Niche&#8208;Inspired Scaffolds as a Stem Cell Delivery System for the Regeneration of the Osteochondral Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Niche&#8208;inspired scaffolds are designed to mimic the natural healing process with an internal depot of quiescent stem cells, mimicking the bone marrow cavity and an electrospun (ESP) capsule that &#8220;activates&#8221; the cells to migrate into an outer &#8220;differentiation&#8208;inducing&#8221; 3D printed unit. These Matryoshka&#8208;like scaffolds prove capable of regenerating the osteochondral interface in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
The regeneration of the osteochondral unit represents a challenge due to the distinct cartilage and bone phases. Current strategies focus on the development of multiphasic scaffolds that recapitulate features of this complex unit and promote the differentiation of implanted bone&#8208;marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs). In doing so, challenges remain from the loss of stemness during in vitro expansion of the cells and the low control over stem cell activity at the interface with scaffolds in vitro and in vivo. Here, this work scaffolds inspired by the bone marrow niche that can recapitulate the natural healing process after injury. The construct comprises an internal depot of quiescent BMSCs, mimicking the bone marrow cavity, and an electrospun (ESP) capsule that &#8220;activates&#8221; the cells to migrate into an outer &#8220;differentiation&#8208;inducing&#8221; 3D printed unit functionalized with TGF&#8208;&#946; and BMP&#8208;2 peptides. In vitro, niche&#8208;inspired scaffolds retained a depot of nonproliferative cells capable of migrating and proliferating through the ESP capsule. Invasion of the 3D printed cavity results in location&#8208;specific cell differentiation, mineralization, secretion of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and genetic upregulation of collagen II and collagen I. In vivo, niche&#8208;inspired scaffolds are biocompatible, promoted tissue formation in rat subcutaneous models, and regeneration of the osteochondral unit in rabbit models.

         <title>Ultrathin Ambipolar Polyelectrolyte Capacitors Prepared via Layer&#8208;By&#8208;Layer Assembling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Miniaturized solid state capacitors leveraging migration of unipolar ions in a single polyelectrolyte layer sandwiched between metal electrodes, namely, polyelectrolyte capacitors (PECs), have been recently reported with areal capacitance up to 100&#8211;200&#160;nF mm&#8722;2. Nonetheless, application of PECs in consumer and industrial electronics has been hindered so far by their small operational frequency range, up to a few kHz, due to the resistive behavior (phase angle &gt;&#8208;45&#176;) of PECs in the range kHz&#8208;to&#8208;MHz.Here we report on multilayer polyelectrolyte capacitors (mPECs) that leverage as dielectrics an ambipolar nanometer&#8208;thick (down to 10&#160;nm) stack of anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes assembled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer between metal electrodes to eliminate the resistive behavior at frequencies from kHz to MHz. This significantly extends the operational range of mPECs over PECs. Specifically, mPECs with areal capacitance as high as 25&#160;nF mm&#8722;2 at 20&#160;Hz and full capacitive behavior from 10 mHz to 10&#160;MHz are demonstrated using different assembling conditions and anionic/cationic polyelectrolyte pairs. The mPECs reliably operates over time for &gt;300 million cycles, at different biasing voltages up to 3&#160;V and temperatures up to 80&#176;C, showing a reversible capacitive behavior without significant hysteresis.Leveraging the vast amount of anionic and cationic polyelectrolytes available on the market, application of the proposed nanometer&#8208;thick ambipolar polyelectrolyte dielectrics for the fabrication of flexible electronics devices, such as capacitors and field effect transistors, operating at high frequency is envisaged

         <title>Atomic Diffusion Engineered PtSnCu Nanoframes with High&#8208;Index Facets Boost Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical ethanol oxidation is crucial to directly convert a biorenewable liquid fuel with high energy density into electrical energy, but it remains as an inefficient reaction even with the best catalysts. To boost ethanol oxidation, developing multimetallic nanoalloy has emerged as one of the most effective strategies, yet faces a challenge in the rational engineering of multimetallic active&#8208;site ensembles at atomic&#8208;level. Herein, starting from typical PtCu nanocrystals, we developed an atomic Sn diffusion strategy to construct well&#8208;defined Pt47Sn12Cu41 octopod nanoframes, which is enclosed by high&#8208;index facets of n (111)&#8208;(111), such as {331} and {221}. Benefiting from this ternary active&#8208;site ensembles with enlarged lattice spacings and multiple high&#8208;index facets, Pt47Sn12Cu41 achieves a high mass activity of 3.10 A mg&#8722;1Pt and promotes the C&#8208;C bond breaking and oxidation of poisonous CO intermediate, representing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalyst toward ethanol oxidation in acidic electrolyte. Density functional theory calculations have confirmed that the introduction of Sn improves the electroactivity by uplifting the d&#8208;band center through the s&#8208;p&#8208;d coupling. Meanwhile, the strong binding of ethanol and the reduced energy barrier of CO oxidation guarantee a highly efficient ethanol oxidation process with improved Faradic efficiency of C1 products. This work offers a promising strategy for constructing novel multimetallic nanoalloys tailored by atomic metal sites as the efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Bioinspired Gradient Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Ultrafast and Asymmetric Solvent Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by graded porous structures in glomerular filtration membranes, a series of gradient covalent organic framework membranes (GCOMx) are fabricated through a universal synthetic route. The GCOMx exhibit an unprecedented asymmetric solvent transport when applying different membrane sides as the solvent feed surface during filtration. In addition, GCOMx shows significant filtration performance in simulated kidney dialysis, revealing great potential of GCOMx in bionic applications, such as recontamination prevention or unidirectional water retention.








Abstract
Gradients play a pivotal role in membrane technologies, e.g., osmotic energy conversion, desalination, biomimetic actuation, selective separation, and more. In these applications, the compositional gradients are of great relevance for successful function implementation, ranging from solvent separation to smart devices; However, the construction of functional gradient in membranes is still challenging both in scale and directions. Inspired by the specific function&#8208;related, graded porous structures in glomerular filtration membranes, a general approach for constructing gradient covalent organic framework membranes (GCOMx) applying poly (ionic liquid)s (PILs)&#160;as template is reported here. With graded distribution of highly porous covalent organic framework (COF) crystals along the membrane, GCOMx exhibts an unprecedented asymmetric solvent transport when applying different membrane sides as the solvent feed surface during filtration, leading to a much&#8208;enhanced flux (10&#8211;18 times) of the &#8220;large&#8208;to&#8208;small&#8221; pore flow comparing to the reverse direction, verified by hydromechanical theoretical calculations. Upon systematic experiments, GCOMx achieves superior permeance in nonpolar (hexane&#160;&#8776;260.45 LMH bar&#8722;1) and polar (methanol&#160;&#8776;175.93 LMH bar&#8722;1) solvents, together with narrow molecular weight cut&#8208;off (MWCO, 472&#160;g mol&#8722;1) and molecular weight retention onset (MWRO, &lt;182&#160;g mol&#8722;1). Interestingly, GCOMx shows significant filtration performance in simulated kidney dialysis, revealing great potential of GCOMx in bionic applications.

         <title>Bright Circularly Polarized Mechanoluminescence from 0D Hybrid Manganese Halides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized mechanoluminescence (CPML) emissions are achieved in 0D chiral Mn&#8208;based hybrid manganese halides with large conjugate ligands. These compounds exhibit highly bright and sensitive green CPML emissions with an extraordinary antithermal quenching effect, and then are demonstrated as chiral stimuli&#8208;responsive materials in multilevel confidential information encryption.








Abstract
Hybrid metal halides (HMHs) with efficient circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have application prospects in many fields, due to their abundant host&#8211;guest structures and high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY). However, CPLs in HMHs are predominantly excited by light or electricity, limiting their use in multivariate environments. It is necessary to explore a novel excitation method to extend the application of chiral HMHs as smart stimuli&#8208;responsive optical materials. In this work, an enantiomeric pair of 0D hybrid manganese bromides, [H2(2R,4R)&#8208;(+)/(2S,4S)&#8208;(&#8722;)&#8208;2,4&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)pentane]MnBr4 [(R/S)&#8208;1] is presented, which exhibits efficient CPL emissions with near&#8208;unity PLQYs and high dissymmetry factors of &#177; 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Notably, (R/S)&#8208;1 compounds exhibit unprecedented and bright circularly polarized mechanoluminescence (CPML) emissions under mechanical stimulation. Moreover, (R/S)&#8208;1 possess high mechanical force sensitivities with mechanoluminescence (ML) emissions detectable under 0.1 N force stimulation. Furthermore, this ML emission exhibits an extraordinary antithermal quenching effect in the temperature range of 300&#8211;380 K, which is revealed to originate from a thermal activation energy compensation mechanism from trap levels to Mn(II) 4T1 level. Based on their intriguing optical properties, these compounds as chiral force&#8208;responsive materials are demonstrated in multilevel confidential information encryption.

         <title>Deshielding Anions Enable Solvation Chemistry Control of LiPF6&#8208;Based Electrolyte toward Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dilemma of solvation chemistry control for Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)&#8208;based low&#8208;temperature electrolytes is tackled by introducing deshielding anions. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the NO3&#8722; is chosen. Graphite anodes exhibit enhanced capacity retention of &#8776;72.3% at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C than the counterpart electrolyte (32.3%). This strategybypasses the solubility limitation of commonly used LiPF6 and enable its application under extreme conditions.








Abstract
Severe capacity decay under subzero temperatures remains a significant challenge for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to the sluggish interfacial kinetics. Current efforts to mitigate this deteriorating interfacial behavior rely on high&#8208;solubility lithium salts (e.g., Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI), Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI))&#8208;based electrolytes to construct anion participated solvation structures. However, such electrolytes bring issues of corrosion on the current collector and increased costs. Herein, the most commonly used Lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) instead, to establish a peculiar solvation structure with a high ratio of ion pairs and aggregates by introducing a deshielding NO3&#8722; additive for low&#8208;temperature LIBs is utilized. The deshielding anion significantly reduces the energy barrier for interfacial behavior at low temperatures. Benefiting from this, the graphite (Gr) anode retains a high capacity of &#8776;72.3% at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, which is far superior to the 32.3% and 19.4% capacity retention of counterpart electrolytes. Moreover, the LiCoO2/Gr full cell exhibits a stable cycling performance of 100 cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C due to the inhibited lithium plating. This work heralds a new paradigm in LiPF6&#8208;based electrolyte design for LIBs operating at subzero temperatures.

         <title>A Novel N&#8208;Type Molecular Dopant With a Closed&#8208;Shell Electronic Structure Applicable to the Vacuum&#8208;Deposition Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;type materials are known to lag behind p&#8208;type materials in the organic electronics field, which is not only for semiconducting materials but also for n&#8208;type dopants, the status quo of which is not quite satisfactory. Here, a novel n&#8208;type molecular dopant applicable to the vacuum&#8208;deposition process is reported, as well as its applications to organic thermoelectric materials and field&#8208;effect transistors.








Abstract
Rational design, synthesis, and characterization of a new efficient versatile n&#8208;type dopant with a closed&#8208;shell electronic structure are described. By employing the tetraphenyl&#8211;dipyranylidene (DP0) framework with two 7&#960;&#8208;electron systems modified with N,N&#8208;dimethylamino groups as the strong electron&#8208;donating substituent, 2,2&#8242;,6,6&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis[4&#8208;(dimethylamino)phenyl]&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dipyranylidene (DP7), a closed&#8208;shell molecule with an extremely high&#8208;lying energy level of the highest occupied molecular orbital, close to 4.0&#160;eV below the vacuum level, is successfully developed. Thanks to its thermal stability, DP7 is applicable to vacuum deposition, which allows utilization of DP7 in bulk doping for the development of n&#8208;type organic thermoelectric materials and contact doping for reducing contact resistance in n&#8208;type organic field&#8208;effect transistors. As vacuum&#8208;deposition processable n&#8208;type dopants are very limited, DP7 stands out as a useful n&#8208;type dopant, particularly for the latter purpose.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycation&#8208;reinforced (PCR) surface bridging method is developed to achieve robust and sprayable hydrogel coatings onto diverse materials. The polycations provide superior wettability and instant electrostatic interactions with plasma&#8208;treated substrates, leading to ultra&#8208;tough adhesion (&gt;2000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2), remarkable fatigue resistance, and facile construction. This PCR technique offers novel insight for the development of hydrogel hybrid devices.








Abstract
The sprayable hydrogel coatings that can establish robust adhesion onto diverse materials and devices hold enormous potential; however, a significant challenge persists due to monomer hydration, which impedes even coverage during spraying and induces inadequate adhesion post&#8208;gelation. Herein, a polycation&#8208;reinforced (PCR) surface bridging strategy is presented to achieve tough and sprayable hydrogel coatings onto diverse materials. The polycations offer superior wettability and instant electrostatic interactions with plasma&#8208;treated substrates, facilitating an effective spraying application. This PCR&#8208;based hydrogel coatings demonstrate tough adhesion performance to inert PTFE and silicone, including remarkable shear strength (161&#160;&#177;&#160;49&#160;kPa for PTFE), interfacial toughness (198&#160;&#177;&#160;27&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 for PTFE), and notable tolerance to cyclic tension (10&#160;000 cycles, 200% strain, silicone). Meanwhile, this method can be applied to various hydrogel formulations, offering diverse functionalities, including underwater adhesion, lubrication, and drug delivery. Furthermore, the PCR concept enables the conformal construction of durable hydrogel coatings onto sophisticated medical devices like cardiovascular stents. Given its simplicity and adaptability, this approach paves an avenue for incorporating hydrogels onto solid surfaces and potentially promotes untapped applications.

         <title>220&#160;V/50&#160;Hz Compatible Bipolar Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bright bipolar quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) with the external quantum efficiency exceeding 22% are developed by horizontally connecting a regular QLED and an inverted QLED in series using an Al/Ag bridging layer. By connecting multiple bipolar QLEDs in series, the resulting device can be driven directly by a 220&#160;V/50&#160;Hz household power supply without the need for back&#8208;end electronics.








Abstract
Alternating current (AC)&#8208;driven quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are superior to direct current&#8208;driven QLEDs because they can be directly integrated into household AC electricity and have high stability. However, achieving high&#8208;performance AC&#8208;driven QLEDs remains challenging. In this work, a bipolar QLED with coplanar electrodes is realized by horizontally connecting a regular QLED and an inverted QLED in series using an Al bridging layer. The bipolar QLED can be turned on with either a positive or a negative bias voltage, with a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.9%. By replacing the Al with Ag, the resistances of the electron transport layers are effectively reduced, and thus the bipolar QLED shows an enhanced brightness of 16370&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 at 15&#160;V. By connecting multiple bipolar QLEDs in series, the resulting light source can be directly driven by a 220&#160;V/50&#160;Hz household power supply without the need for back&#8208;end electronics. The bipolar QLED can also be realized by vertically stacking a regular QLED and an inverted QLED with a metallic intermediate connection layer. It is demonstrated that the coplanar or vertical bipolar QLEDs could find potential applications in household AC electricity play&#8208;and&#8208;plug solid&#8208;state lighting and single&#8208; or double&#8208;sided displays.

         <title>Recyclable Solid&#8211;Solid Phase Change Materials with Superior Latent Heat via Reversible Anhydride&#8208;Alcohol Crosslinking for Efficient Thermal Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8211;solid phase change materials with superior thermal energy storage capacity and dual recyclability are developed here by reacting anhydride copolymers with polyethylene glycol. Novel combined grafted and crosslinked crystalline structure promises a peak latent heat up to 156.8 J g&#8722;1; reversible anhydride&#8208;alcohol crosslinks enable outstanding recyclability. The potential of efficient solar energy conversion/storage/release has also been explored.








Abstract
Solid&#8211;solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) with crosslinked polymer structures have received sustained interest due to their remarkable shape stability, enabling their application independently without the need for encapsulation or supporting materials. However, the crosslinking structure also compromises their latent heat and poses challenges to their recyclability. Herein, a novel strategy harnessing the internal&#8208;catalyzed reversible anhydride&#8208;alcohol crosslinking reaction to fabricate SSPCMs with superior latent heat and exceptional dual recyclability is presented. Easily accessible anhydride copolymers (e.g., propylene&#8208;maleic anhydride alternating copolymers), provide abundant reactive anhydride sites within the polymer matrix; polyethylene glycol serves as both the grafted phase change component and the crosslinker. The resulting SSPCMs attain a peak latent heat value of 156.8 J g&#8722;1 which surpasses all other reported recyclable crosslinked SSPCMs. The materials also exhibit certain flexibility and a tunable tensile strength ranging from 6.6 to 11.0 MPa. Beyond that, leveraging the reversible anhydride&#8208;alcohol crosslinks, the SSPCMs demonstrate dual recyclability through bond&#8208;exchange remolding and reversible&#8208;dissociation&#8208;enabled dissolving&#8208;recrosslinking without any reactive chemicals. Furthermore, by integrating solar&#8208;thermal conversion fillers like polydopamine nanoparticles, the potential of the system in efficient conversion, storage, and release of solar energy is highlighted.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Activation in ReSe2&#8208;VSe2 Alloy Nanosheets to Boost Water&#8208;Splitting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Re1&#8722;xVxSe2 alloy nanosheets consisted of atomic structures that boost synergically the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction over a wide composition range.








Abstract
It is challenging to control the electronic structure of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) for extended applications in renewable energy devices. Here, ReSe2&#8208;VSe2 (Re1&#8722;xVxSe2) alloy nanosheets over the whole composition range via a colloidal reaction is synthesized. Increasing x makes the nanosheets more metallic and induces a 1T&#8243;&#8208;to&#8208;1T phase transition at x = 0.5&#8211;0.6. Compared to the MoSe2&#8208;VSe2 and WSe2&#8208;VSe2 alloy nanosheets, ReSe2 and VSe2 are mixed more homogeneously at the atomic scale. The alloy nanosheets at x = 0.1&#8211;0.7 exhibit an enhanced electrocatalytic activity toward acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurements reveal that alloying caused the Re and V atoms to be synergically more active in the HER. Gibbs free energy (&#916;GH*) and density of state calculations confirm that alloying and Se vacancies effectively activate the metal sites toward HER. The composition dependence of HER performance is explained by homogenous atomic mixing with the increased Se vacancies. The study provides a strategy for designing new TMD alloy nanosheets with enhanced catalytic activity.

         <title>A Photolithographable Electrolyte for Deeply Rechargeable Zn Microbatteries in On&#8208;Chip Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Caffeine is introduced to ZnSO4 solution, forming a photolithographable electrolyte with an ultraviolet light curable polymer. Zn&#8208;rich interphase is built up over cycling, and stabilizes the Zn anode and hence reversibility of both half and full cells over a broad dimension from several centimeters down to hundreds of micrometers.








Abstract
Zn batteries show promise for microscale applications due to their compatibility with air fabrication but face challenges like dendrite growth and chemical corrosion, especially at the microscale. Despite previous attempts in electrolyte engineering, achieving successful patterning of electrolyte microscale devices has remained challenging. Here, successful patterning using photolithography is enabled by incorporating caffeine into a UV&#8208;crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel electrolyte. Caffeine passivates the Zn anode, preventing chemical corrosion, while its coordination with Zn2+ ions forms a Zn2+&#8208;conducting complex that transforms into ZnCO3 and 2ZnCO3&#183;3Zn(OH)2 over cycling. The resulting Zn&#8208;rich interphase product significantly enhances Zn reversibility. In on&#8208;chip microbatteries, the resulting solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase allows the Zn||MnO2 full cell to cycle for over 700 cycles with an 80% depth of discharge. Integrating the photolithographable electrolyte into multilayer microfabrication creates a microbattery with a 3D Swiss&#8208;roll structure that occupies a footprint of 0.136 mm2. This tiny microbattery retains 75% of its capacity (350 &#181;Ah cm&#8722;2) for 200 cycles at a remarkable 90% depth of discharge. The findings offer a promising solution for enhancing the performance of Zn microbatteries, particularly for on&#8208;chip microscale devices, and have significant implications for the advancement of autonomous microscale devices.

&lt;p&gt;Zn batteries show promise for microscale applications due to their compatibility with air fabrication but face challenges like dendrite growth and chemical corrosion, especially at the microscale. Despite previous attempts in electrolyte engineering, achieving successful patterning of electrolyte microscale devices has remained challenging. Here, successful patterning using photolithography is enabled by incorporating caffeine into a UV-crosslinked polyacrylamide hydrogel electrolyte. Caffeine passivates the Zn anode, preventing chemical corrosion, while its coordination with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions forms a Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-conducting complex that transforms into ZnCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and 2ZnCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;3Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over cycling. The resulting Zn-rich interphase product significantly enhances Zn reversibility. In on-chip microbatteries, the resulting solid-electrolyte interphase allows the Zn||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cell to cycle for over 700 cycles with an 80% depth of discharge. Integrating the photolithographable electrolyte into multilayer microfabrication creates a microbattery with a 3D Swiss-roll structure that occupies a footprint of 0.136 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This tiny microbattery retains 75% of its capacity (350 &#181;Ah cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for 200 cycles at a remarkable 90% depth of discharge. The findings offer a promising solution for enhancing the performance of Zn microbatteries, particularly for on-chip microscale devices, and have significant implications for the advancement of autonomous microscale devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibition of Vanadium Cathodes Dissolution in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathode dissolution significantly limits the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, particularly at low currents. An artificial constructed on V6O13 cathodes (ZnOTf&#8208;LDH) is revealed to repel water, impede vanadium shuttling, and facilitate zinc transport. This suppresses vanadium dissolution and enables stable cycling for over 200 cycles at 200 mA g&#8722;1. The method is applicable to different vanadium oxide cathodes.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) have experienced a rapid surge in popularity, as evident from the extensive research with over 30 000 articles published in the past 5 years. Previous studies on AZIBs have showcased impressive long&#8208;cycle stability at high current densities, achieving thousands or tens of thousands of cycles. However, the practical stability of AZIBs at low current densities (&lt;1C) is restricted to merely 50&#8211;100 cycles due to intensified cathode dissolution. This genuine limitation poses a considerable challenge to their transition from the laboratory to the industry. In this study, leveraging density functional theory (DFT) calculations, an artificial interphase that achieves both hydrophobicity and restriction of the outward penetration of dissolved vanadium cations, thereby shifting the reaction equilibrium and suppressing the vanadium dissolution following Le Chatelier's principle, is described. The approach has resulted in one of the best cycling stabilities to date, with no noticeable capacity fading after more than 200 cycles (&#8776;720&#160;h) at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 (0.47C). These findings represent a significant advance in the design of ultrastable cathodes for aqueous batteries and accelerate the industrialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Bridging the Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalysis by Supramolecular Metal&#8208;Organic Cages with Varied Packing Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of {Cu12} based tetrahedral (Td) metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs) with varied packing modes are self&#8208;assembled, which act as highly active homogeneous catalysts for CO2 cycloaddition with epoxides. The varied packing of Td cages from hexagonal to cubic mode in the MOC enables one&#8208;step heterogenous separation of the catalyst, co&#8208;catalyst, and product, which perfectly bridges the homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Integrating the advantages of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis has proved to be an optimal strategy for developing catalytic systems with high efficiency, selectivity, and recoverability. Supramolecular metal&#8208;organic cages (MOCs), assembled by the coordination of metal ions with organic linkers into discrete molecules, have performed solvent processability due to their tunable packing modes, endowing them with the potential to act as homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts in different solvent systems. Here, the design and synthesis of a series of stable {Cu3} cluster&#8208;based tetrahedral MOCs with varied packing structures are reported. These MOCs, as homogeneous catalysts, not only show high catalytic activity and selectivity regardless of substrate size during the CO2 cycloaddition reaction, but also can be easily recovered from the reaction media through separating products and co&#8208;catalysts by one&#8208;step work&#8208;up. This is because that these MOCs have varied solubilities in different solvents due to the tunable packing of MOCs in the solid state. Moreover, the entire catalytic reaction system is very clean, and the purity of cyclic carbonates is as high as 97% without further purification. This work provides a unique strategy for developing novel supramolecular catalysts that can be used for homogeneous catalysis and recycled in a heterogeneous manner.

         <title>In Situ Reprogramming of Immune Cells Using Synthetic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of in vivo cell reprogramming platforms for in situ cell therapy. Following infusion into the patients, the nanoparticles directly transfer the transgene cargos (plasmid DNA, mRNA, etc.) into the cell of interest (T lymphocytes, macrophages, etc.) and transiently program the targeted cells to express transgenes inside the body.








Abstract
In the past decade, adoptive cell therapy with chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cells has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, the complexity and high costs involved in manufacturing current adoptive cell therapy greatly inhibit its widespread availability and access. To address this, in situ cell therapy, which directly reprograms immune cells inside the body, has recently been developed as a promising alternative. Here, an overview of the recent progress in the development of synthetic nanomaterials is provided to deliver plasmid DNA or mRNA for in situ reprogramming of T cells and macrophages, focusing especially on in situ CAR therapies. Also, the main challenges for in situ immune cell reprogramming are discussed and some approaches to overcome these barriers to fulfill the clinical applications are proposed.

         <title>A Hybrid Nanoadjuvant Simultaneously Depresses PD&#8208;L1/TGF&#8208;&#946;1 and Activates cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway to Overcome Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy Resistance</title>

         <dc:description>
A nanoadjuvant is developed to sensitize cancer radiotherapy via multi&#8208;level immunity activation and activing the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to reverse tumor hypoxia and impair DNA damage repair. This Tpp&#8208;Met@MnO2@Alb system effectively enhances the efficiency of radiotherapy to inhibit the progression of irradiated local and abscopal tumors and tumor lung metastases, offering a long&#8208;term memory of antitumor immunity without discernible side effects.








Abstract
Currently, certain cancer patients exhibit resistance to radiotherapy due to reduced DNA damage under hypoxic conditions and acquired immune tolerance triggered by transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1) and membrane&#8208;localized programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1). Meanwhile, cytoplasm&#8208;distributed PD&#8208;L1 induces radiotherapy resistance through accelerating DNA damage repair (DDR). However, the disability of clinically used PD&#8208;L1 antibodies in inhibiting cytoplasm&#8208;distributed PD&#8208;L1 limits their effectiveness. Therefore, a nanoadjuvant is developed to sensitize cancer to radiotherapy via multi&#8208;level immunity activation through depressing PD&#8208;L1 and TGF&#8208;&#946;1 by triphenylphosphine&#8208;derived metformin, and activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway by generating Mn2+ from MnO2 and producing more dsDNA via reversing tumor hypoxia and impairing DDR. Thus, Tpp&#8208;Met@MnO2@Alb effectively enhances the efficiency of radiotherapy to inhibit the progression of irradiated local and abscopal tumors and tumor lung metastases, offering a long&#8208;term memory of antitumor immunity without discernible side effects. Overall, Tpp&#8208;Met@MnO2@Alb has the potential to be clinically applied for overcoming radio&#8208;immunotherapy resistance.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Ionic Conductors with Tunable Resistance Switching Temperature Enabled by Phase Transformation of Polymer Cocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel phase&#8208;transformable ionic conductors (PTICs) with tunable resistance switching temperature are designed by polymer cocrystal phase. These obtained PTICs have ultrahigh temperature sensitivity in the resistance switching region and can detect tiny temperature variation, allowing for the intelligent applications for overheating warning and heat dissipation.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;transformable ionic conductors (PTICs) show significant prospects for functional applications due to their reversible resistance switching property.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase-transformable ionic conductors (PTICs) show significant prospects for functional applications due to their reversible resistance switching property. However, the representative design principle of PTICs is utilizing the melt-crystallization transition of ionic liquids, and the resistance switching temperatures of such PTICs cannot be tuned as desired. Herein, a new strategy is proposed to design PTICs with on-demand resistance switching temperatures by using the melt-crystallization transition of polymer cocrystal phase, whose melting temperature shows a linear relationship with the polymer compositions. Owing to the melt of polymer cocrystal domains and the tunable migration of ions in the resistance switching region, the obtained PTICs display ultrahigh temperature sensitivity with a superior temperature coefficient of resistance of &#8722;8.50% &#176;C&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; around human body temperature, as compared to various ionic conductors previously reported.

         <title>Simultaneous Enhancement of Thermal Insulation and Impact Resistance in Transparent Bulk Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transparent bulk glass is utilized for light transmission and protection against external hazards, but it is hindered by poor protective properties. Through synergistic effects between nacre&#8208;inspired structures and shear&#8208;stiffening materials, the fabricated glass composite (NSG) demonstrates optimal impact resistance over a wide range of impact velocities. Moreover, NSG exhibits superior light transmittance, thermal insulation, and other comprehensive application properties.








Abstract
Transparent bulk glass is highly demanded in devices and components of daily life to transmit light and protect against external temperature and mechanical hazards. However, the application of glass is impeded by its poor functional performance, especially in terms of thermal isolation and impact resistance. Here, a glass composite integrating the nacre&#8208;inspired structure and shear stiffening gel (SSG) material is proposed. Benefiting from the combination of these two elements, this nacre&#8208;inspired SSG/glass composite (NSG) exhibits superior thermal insulation and impact resistance while maintaining transparency simultaneously. Specifically, the low thermal conductivity of the SSG combined with the anisotropic heat transfer capability of the nacre&#8208;inspired structure enhances the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal insulation of NSG. The deformations over large volumes in nacre&#8208;inspired facesheets promote the deformation region of the SSG core, synergistic effect of tablet sliding mechanism in nacre&#8208;inspired structure and strain&#8208;rate enhancement in SSG material cause the superior impact resistance of overall panels in a wide range of impact velocities. NSG demonstrates outstanding properties such as transparency, light weight, impact resistance, and thermal insulation, which are major concerns for the application in engineering fields. In conclusion, this bioinspired SSG/glass composite opens new avenues to achieve comprehensive performance improvements for transparent structural materials.

         <title>Polymer Donor with a Simple Skeleton and Minor Siloxane Decoration Enables 19% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Side&#8208;chain random copolymer PMQ&#8208;Si605 with a 6,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;methylquinoxaline&#8208;thiophene backbone and 5% siloxane decoration of side chain is synthesized. The polymer with a simple skeleton enables organic solar cells with over 19% efficiency and supplies active layers with processing endurance in high humidity air.








Abstract
Development of polymer donors with simple chemical structure and low cost is of great importance for commercial application of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, side&#8208;chain random copolymer PMQ&#8208;Si605 with a simply 6,7&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;methylquinoxaline&#8208;thiophene backbone and 5% siloxane decoration of side chain is synthesized in comparison with its alternating copolymer PTQ11. Relative to molecular weight (Mn) of 28.3&#160;kg mol&#8722;1 for PTQ11, the random copolymer PMQ&#8208;Si605 with minor siloxane decoration is beneficial for achieving higher Mn up to 51.1&#160;kg mol&#8722;1. In addition, PMQ&#8208;Si605 can show stronger aggregation ability and faster charge mobility as well as more efficient exciton dissociation in active layer as revealed by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. With L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F as acceptor, its PMQ&#8208;Si605 based OSCs display power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.08%, much higher than 16.21% for PTQ11 based devices. With another acceptor BTP&#8208;H2 to optimize the photovoltaic performance of PMQ&#8208;Si605, further elevated PCEs of 18.50% and 19.15% can be achieved with the binary and ternary OSCs, respectively. Furthermore, PMQ&#8208;Si605 based active layers are suitable for processing in high humidity air, an important factor for massive production of OSCs. Therefore, the siloxane decoration on polymer donors is promising, affording PMQ&#8208;Si605 as a high&#8208;performing and low cost candidate.

         <title>Toward the Commercialization of Perovskite Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review first introduces the current status of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules and their potential applications. Then it identifies critical challenges in commercialization and corresponding solutions, including strategies for power conversion efficiency (PCE) enhancement over large areas, stability improvements, toxicity reduction, and so on. Finally, it includes some potential development directions and issues requiring attention in the future.








Abstract
Perovskite (PVSK) photovoltaic (PV) devices are undergoing rapid development and have reached a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1% at the cell level. Tremendous efforts in material and device engineering have also increased moisture, heat, and light&#8208;related stability. Moreover, the solution&#8208;process nature makes the fabrication process of perovskite photovoltaic devices feasible and compatible with some mature high&#8208;volume manufacturing techniques. All these features render perovskite solar modules (PSMs) suitable for terawatt&#8208;scale energy production with a low levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). In this review, the current status of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and modules and their potential applications are first introduced. Then critical challenges are identified in their commercialization and propose the corresponding solutions, including developing strategies to realize high&#8208;quality films over a large area to further improve power conversion efficiency and stability to meet the commercial demands. Finally, some potential development directions and issues requiring attention in the future, mainly focusing on further dealing with toxicity and recycling of the whole device, and the attainment of highly efficient perovskite&#8208;based tandem modules, which can reduce the environmental impact and accelerate the LCOE reduction are put forwarded.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Selective Memtransistors with Magnetized Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;selective memtransistor with magnetized single&#8208;layered graphene on a reactive antiferromagnetic CrI3 is reported. The spin&#8208;dependent hybridization between graphene and CrI3 atomic layers enables the spin&#8208;selective bandgap opening in the single&#8208;layered graphene and the electric field control of magnetization in a specific CrI3 layer, which achieves reliable memtransistor operations based on the electrical control of the magnetic proximity effect.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarized bands in pristine and proximity&#8208;induced magnetic materials are promising building blocks for future devices. Conceptually new memory, logic, and neuromorphic devices are conceived based on atomically thin magnetic materials and the manipulation of their spin&#8208;polarized bands via electrical and optical methods. A critical remaining issue is the direct probe and the optimized use of the magnetic coupling effect in van der Waals heterostructures, which requires further delicate design of atomically thin magnetic materials and devices. Here, a spin&#8208;selective memtransistor with magnetized single&#8208;layered graphene on a reactive antiferromagnetic material, CrI3, is reported. The spin&#8208;dependent hybridization between graphene and CrI3 atomic layers enables the spin&#8208;selective bandgap opening in the single&#8208;layered graphene and the electric field control of magnetization in a specific CrI3 layer. The microscopic working principle is clarified by the first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical analysis of the transport data. Reliable memtransistor operations (i.e., memory and logic device&#8208;combined operations), as well as a spin&#8208;selective probe of Landau levels in the magnetized graphene, are achieved by using the subtle manipulation of the magnetic proximity effect via electrical means.

         <title>Synergy of Pd2+/S2&#8722;&#8208;Doped TiO2 Supported on 2&#8208;Methylimidazolium&#8208;Functionalized Polypyrrole/Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Nitrogen Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd2+&#8208; and S2&#8722;&#8208;doped TiO2 immobilized on 2&#8208;methylimidazolium functionalized polypyrrole/graphene oxide (2&#8208;MeIm/PPy/GO) exhibits the excellent electrocatalytic activity toward nitrogen oxidation reaction due to the synergistic effect of each component. Especially, the sulfate radicals in situ formed on Pb/S&#8211;TiO2@2&#8208;MeIm/PPy/GO further promote nitrogen adsorption and decrease the reaction energy barrier, resulting in the acceleration of nitrogen oxidation reaction.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of nitrate catalyzed by electrochemical nitrogen oxidation reaction (NOR) is considered as an alternative and sustainable approach to the conventional industrial manufacture, but optimizing the electrocatalytic NOR performance and fabricating the efficient NOR electrocatalysts at the design level still encounter great challenges. Herein, unique Pd2+&#8208; and S2&#8722;&#8208;doped TiO2 (Pb/S&#8211;TiO2) nanoparticles are successfully in situ grown on the surface of 2&#8208;methylimidazolium&#8208;functionalized polypyrrole/graphene oxide (2&#8208;MeIm/PPy/GO), which present the typical hierarchical micro&#8208;nanostructures, resulting in the excellent electrocatalytic NOR performance with the highest NO3&#8722; yield of 72.69 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1act. and the maximum Faraday efficiency of 8.92% at 2.04&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) due to the synergistic effect of each component. Due to the doping effect, the appropriate oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is achieved by Ti&#8208;site, where OER principally occurs, providing *O during the non&#8208;electrochemical step of NOR, while the electrocatalytic NOR process as the electrochemical conversion of inert N2 to active *NO intermediates mainly occurs at the Pd&#8208;site. Especially, the sulfate radicals in situ formed on Pb/S&#8211;TiO2@2&#8208;MeIm/PPy/GO further promote nitrogen adsorption and decrease the reaction energy barrier, resulting in the acceleration of NOR. It provides theoretical and practical experience for the design and preparation of NOR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Resistive Memory Devices at the Thinnest Limit: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using 2D monolayer materials as dielectric or channel layers, resistive memory technology can be in principles scaled down to its thinnest limits. This review is aimed to systematically evaluate the potential and challenges of utilizing the thinnest advanced materials for memristor and memtransistor&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
The Si&#8208;based integrated circuits industry has been developing for more than half a century, by focusing on the scaling&#8208;down of transistor. However, the miniaturization of transistors will soon reach its physical limits, thereby requiring novel material and device technologies. Resistive memory is a promising candidate for in&#8208;memory computing and energy&#8208;efficient synaptic devices that can satisfy the computational demands of the future applications. However, poor cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle and device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformities hinder its mass production. 2D materials, as a new type of semiconductor, is successfully employed in various micro/nanoelectronic devices and have the potential to drive future innovation in resistive memory technology. This review evaluates the potential of using the thinnest advanced materials, that is, monolayer 2D materials, for memristor or memtransistor applications, including resistive switching behavior and atomic mechanism, high&#8208;frequency device performances, and in&#8208;memory computing/neuromorphic computing applications. The scaling&#8208;down advantages of promising monolayer 2D materials including graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides, and hexagonal boron nitride are presented. Finally, the technical challenges of these atomic devices for practical applications are elaborately discussed. The study of monolayer&#8208;2D&#8208;material&#8208;based resistive memory is expected to play a positive role in the exploration of beyond&#8208;Si electronic technologies.

         <title>Light Management of Metal Halide Scintillators for High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective considers light propagation in metal halide scintillators as the focus. By correlating the reported spatial resolution with light propagation in various forms, this perspective clarifies and deepens the understanding of untouched yet fundamental issues, namely, material&#8208;form&#8208;associated light propagation in metal halide scintillators, and provides the design rules for their future development.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing need to inspect matter with hyperfine structures requires a revolution in current scintillation detectors, and the innovation of scintillators is revived with luminescent metal halides entering the scene. Notably, for any scintillator, two fundamental issues arise: Which kind of material is suitable and in what form should the material exist? The answer to the former question involves the sequence of certain atoms into specific crystal structures that facilitate the conversion of X&#8208;ray into light, whereas the answer to the latter involves assembling these crystallites into particular material forms that can guide light propagation toward its corresponding pixel detector. Despite their equal importance, efforts are overwhelmingly devoted to improving the X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;light conversion, while the material&#8208;form&#8208;associated light propagation, which determines the optical signal collected for X&#8208;ray imaging, is largely overlooked. This perspective critically correlates the reported spatial resolution with the light&#8208;propagation behavior in each form of metal halides, combing the designing rules for their future development.

         <title>The Construction of Binary Phase Electrolyte Interface for Highly Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triethyl phosphate (TEP)/H2O binary phase electrolyte (BPE) interface is constructed by introducing TEP&#8208;based electrolyte&#8208;wetted hydrophobic polypropylene&#160;separator onto the Zn anode surfaces. BPE interface will induce a Zn2+ solvation structure conversion and the most solvated H2O molecules in Zn2+ solvation structure are removed. Consequently, hydrogen evolution reaction and by&#8208;products are effectively restricted on Zn anode surfaces in BPE.








Abstract
Metal zinc is a promising anode candidate of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries due to high theoretical capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, it often suffers from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), dendrite growth, and formation of by&#8208;products. Herein, a triethyl phosphate (TEP)/H2O binary phase electrolyte (BPE) interface is developed by introducing TEP&#8208;based electrolyte&#8208;wetted hydrophobic polypropylene (PP) separator onto the Zn anode surface. The equilibrium of the BPE interface depends on the comparable surface tensions of H2O&#8208;based and TEP&#8208;based electrolytes on hydrophobic PP separator surfaces. The BPE interface induces Zn2+ solvation structure conversion from [Zn(H2O)x]2+ to [Zn(TEP)n(H2O)y]2+, where most solvated H2O molecules are removed. In [Zn(TEP)n(H2O)y]2+, the residual H2O molecules can be further constrained by the formation of H bonds between TEP and H2O molecules. Consequently, the ionization of solvated H2O molecules is effectively suppressed, and HER and by&#8208;products are effectively restricted on Zn anode surfaces in BPE. As a result, Zn anodes exhibit a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.12% and superior cycling performance of 6000&#160;h, which is much higher than the case in single&#8208;phase aqueous electrolytes. To illustrate the feasibility of BPE in full cells, the Zn/AlxV2O5 batteries are assembled based on the BPE and exhibited enhanced cycling performance.

         <title>The Role of Optical Phonon Confinement in the Infrared Dielectric Response of III&#8211;V Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical phonons are known to become confined when the size of the host crystal approaches atomic limits. This confinement offers a unique yet underexplored pathway toward the modification and design of optical phonons in tailored atomic&#8208;scale devices.

Polar dielectrics are key materials of interest for infrared (IR) nanophotonic applications due to their ability to host phonon&#8208;polaritons that allow for low&#8208;loss, subdiffractional control of light. The properties of phonon&#8208;polaritons are limited by the characteristics of optical phonons, which are nominally fixed for most &#8220;bulk&#8221; materials. Superlattices composed of alternating atomically thin materials offer control over crystal anisotropy through changes in composition, optical phonon confinement, and the emergence of new modes. In particular, the modified optical phonons in superlattices offer the potential for so&#8208;called crystalline hybrids whose IR properties cannot be described as a simple mixture of the bulk constituents. To date, however, studies have primarily focused on identifying the presence of new or modified optical phonon modes rather than assessing their impact on the IR response. This study focuses on assessing the impact of confined optical phonon modes on the hybrid IR dielectric function in superlattices of GaSb and AlSb. Using a combination of first principles theory, Raman, FTIR, and spectroscopic ellipsometry, the hybrid dielectric function is found to track the confinement of optical phonons, leading to optical phonon spectral shifts of up to 20 cm&#8722;1. These results provide an alternative pathway toward designer IR optical materials.

&lt;p&gt;Optical phonons are known to become confined when the size of the host crystal approaches atomic limits. This confinement offers a unique yet underexplored pathway toward the modification and design of optical phonons in tailored atomic-scale devices. This study sheds light on the criteria for, and ramifications of phonon confinement, paving the way for designer phonon applications.

         <title>Near&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Scale Perspective on the Oxidation of Ti3C2Tx MXenes: Insights from Atom Probe Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following oxidation of Ti3C2Tx MXenes, atom probe tomography (APT) reveals that alkalis concentrate in TiO2 nanowires, indicating that their presence influences the oxidation mechanisms and kinetics. These results highlight how APT can be utilized to better understand the functional surface terminations, intercalated ions, or impurities that are inevitable in the wet chemical synthesis of MXenes.








Abstract
MXenes are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides with remarkable properties, bearing great potential for energy storage and catalysis applications. However, their oxidation behavior is not yet fully understood, and there are still open questions regarding the spatial distribution and precise quantification of surface terminations, intercalated ions, and possible uncontrolled impurities incorporated during synthesis and processing. Here, atom probe tomography (APT) analysis of as&#8208;synthesized Ti3C2Tx MXenes reveals the presence of alkali (Li, Na) and halogen (Cl, F) elements as well as unetched Al. Following oxidation of the colloidal solution of MXenes, it is observed that the alkalis are enriched in TiO2 nanowires. Although these elements are tolerated through the incorporation by wet chemical synthesis, they are often overlooked when the activity of these materials is considered, particularly during catalytic testing. This work demonstrates how the capability of APT to image these elements in 3D at the near&#8208;atomic scale can help to better understand the activity and degradation of MXenes, in order to guide their synthesis for superior functional&#160;properties.

         <title>Anisotropic Superconducting Nb2CTx MXene Processed by Atomic Exchange at the Wafer Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting Nb2CTx MXenes is realized through nitrogen doping in an atomic&#8208;exchange process. This is the first time to investigate MXene superconductivity at nanoscale based either on the single&#8208;flake or thin film. The anisotropic 2D superconductivity is successfully uncovered. Besides, processing the superconducting thin film over a 4 in. wafer opens up a space for scalable MXene&#8208;based superconducting devices.








Abstract
Superconductivty has recently been induced in MXenes through surface modification. However, the previous reports have mostly been based on powders or cold&#8208;pressed pellets, with no known reports on the intrinsic superconsucting properties of MXenes at the nanoale. Here, it is developed a high&#8208;temperature atomic exchange process in NH3 atmosphere which induces superconductivity in either singleflakes or thin films&#160;of Nb2CTx MXene. The exchange process between nitrogen atoms and fluorine, carbon, and oxygen atoms in the MXene lattice and related structural adjustments are studied using both experiments and density functional theory. Using either single&#8208;flake or thin&#8208;film devices, an anisotropic magnetic response of the 2D superconducting transformation has been&#160;successfully revealed. The anisotropic superconductivity is further demonstrated using superconducting thin films uniformly deposited over a 4 in. wafers, which opens up the possibility of scalable MXene&#8208;based superconducting devices.

         <title>Heterointerface Design of Perovskite Single Crystals for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution epitaxial growth strategy is proposed to grow high&#8208;quality perovskite single crystal heterojunction with designable heterointerface width. The single crystals possess low dark current and ion migration due to their high energy&#8208;band barrier at the space charge region. Therefore, X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated on the single crystals exhibit stable, high sensitivity, low detection limit, and high spatial resolution during X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite single crystals (MHP&#8208;SCs) are known for their facile fabrication into large sizes using inexpensive solution methods. Owing to their combination of large mobility&#8208;lifetime products and strong X&#8208;ray absorption, they are considered promising materials for efficient X&#8208;ray detection. However, they suffer from large dark currents and severe ion migration, which limit their sensitivity and stability in critical X&#8208;ray detection applications. Herein, a heterointerface design is proposed to reduce both the dark current and ion migration by forming a heterojunction. In addition, the carrier transport performance is significantly improved using heterointerface engineering by designing a gradient band structure in the SCs. The SC heterojunction detectors exhibit a high sensitivity of 3.98 &#215; 105 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with a low detection limit of 12.2 nGyair s&#8722;1 and a high spatial resolution of 10.2 lp mm&#8722;1 during imaging. These values are among the highest reported for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MHP X&#8208;ray detectors. Moreover, the detectors show excellent stability under continuous X&#8208;ray irradiation and maintainclear X&#8208;ray imaging after 240 d. This study provides novel insights into the design and fabrication of X&#8208;ray detectors with high detection efficiency and stability, which are beneficial for developing inexpensive, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging equipment.

         <title>Highly Reliable Van Der Waals Memory Boosted by a Single 2D Charge Trap Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
PbI2 is a unique 2D charge trap medium to offer atomically smooth interfaces, uniformly distributed traps and high&#8208;integration feasibility for reliable memories and artificial synapses. The spontaneously formed iodine vacancies in PbI2 cause the charge trapping/releasing in 2D semiconducting channel such as MoS2, WS2, and WSe2, leading to the significantly better comprehensive performance compared to previous 2D charge trap memories.








Abstract
Charge trap materials that can store carriers efficiently and controllably are desired for memory applications. 2D materials are promising for highly compacted and reliable memory mainly due to their ease of constructing atomically uniform interfaces, however, remain unexplored as being charge trap media. Here it is discovered that 2D semiconducting PbI2 is an excellent charge trap material for nonvolatile memory and artificial synapses. It is simple to construct PbI2&#8208;based charge trap devices since no complicated synthesis or additional defect manufacturing are required. As a demonstration, MoS2/PbI2 device exhibits a large memory window of 120&#160;V, fast write speed of 5 &#181;s, high on&#8208;off ratio around 106, multilevel memory of over 8 distinct states, high reliability with endurance up to 104 cycles and retention over 1.2 &#215; 104 s. It is envisioned that PbI2 with ionic activity caused by the natively formed iodine vacancies is unique to combine with unlimited 2D materials for versatile van der Waals devices with high&#8208;integration and multifunctionality.

&lt;p&gt;Charge trap materials that can store carriers efficiently and controllably are desired for memory applications. 2D materials are promising for highly compacted and reliable memory mainly due to their ease of constructing atomically uniform interfaces, however, remain unexplored as being charge trap media. Here it is discovered that 2D semiconducting PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is an excellent charge trap material for nonvolatile memory and artificial synapses. It is simple to construct PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based charge trap devices since no complicated synthesis or additional defect manufacturing are required. As a demonstration, MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; device exhibits a large memory window of 120&#160;V, fast write speed of 5 &#181;s, high on-off ratio around 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, multilevel memory of over 8 distinct states, high reliability with endurance up to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cycles and retention over 1.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; s. It is envisioned that PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with ionic activity caused by the natively formed iodine vacancies is unique to combine with unlimited 2D materials for versatile van der Waals devices with high-integration and multifunctionality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Measuring Solvent Exchange in Silica Nanoparticles with Rotor&#8208;Based Fluorophore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic solvent exchange process within the silica nanoparticles is monitored with millisecond time resolution by embedding rotor&#8208;based fluorophores in the silica matrix. The additional validations is further demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a promising strategy for investigating nanoscale transport diffusion in micropores.








Abstract
Measuring the diffusivity of molecules is the first step toward understanding their dependence and controlling diffusion, but the challenge increases with the decrease of molecular size, particularly for non&#8208;fluorescent and non&#8208;reactive molecules such as solvents. Here, the capability to monitor the solvent exchange process within the micropores of silica with millisecond time resolution is demonstrated, by simply embedding a rotor&#8208;based fluorophore (thioflavin T) in colloidal silica nanoparticles. Basically, the silica provides an extreme case of viscous microenvironment, which is affected by the polarity of the solvents. The fluorescence intensity traces can be well fitted to the Fickian diffusion model, allowing analytical solution of the diffusion process, and revealing the diffusion coefficients. The validation experiments, involving the water&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol and ethanol&#8208;to&#8208;water solvent exchange, the comparison of different drying conditions, and the variation in the degree of cross&#8208;linking in silica, confirmed the effectiveness and sensitivity of this method for characterizing diffusion in silica micropores. This work focuses on the method development of measuring diffusivity and the high temporal resolution in tracking solvent exchange dynamics over a short distance (within 165&#160;nm) opens enormous possibilities for further studies.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Responsive Breathing Transition of Conductive Hydrogel for Broadband Kinetic Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive hydrogel, engineered with a PEDOT:PSS network featuring dynamic crosslinking points, exhibits electro&#8208;responsive behavior for efficient energy storage. The high&#8208;density charge surfaces enable breathing transitions under voltage, offering superior frequency compatibility. The flexible energy harvester based on such hydrogel reclaims kinetic energy, suggesting topological&#8208;structure engineering of hydrogels as a promising route for ambient energy management.








Abstract
Reclaiming kinetic energy from vibrating machines holds great promise for sustainable energy harvesting technologies. Nevertheless, the impulsive current induced by vibrations is incompatible with conventional energy storage devices. The energy&#8208;management system necessitates novel designs of soft materials for lightweight, miniaturized, and integrated high&#8208;frequency electrochemical devices. Here, this work develops a conductive hydrogel with an electro&#8208;responsive polymeric network. The electro&#8208;responsive breathing transition of the crosslinking points facilitates the expeditious formation of a localized electrolyte layer. This layer features an exceedingly high local charge density, surpassing that of a saturated electrolyte solution by an order of magnitude, and thus enabling rapid charge transport under the influence of an applied voltage. The micro&#8208;capacitor based on the gel exhibits record&#8208;high capacitance of &#8776;2 mF cm&#8722;2 when the frequency of energy input reaches up to 104&#160;Hz. This work also demonstrates a prototype battery charger that harvests energy from a running car engine. This study presents a feasible strategy for waste energy recycling using integrated electrochemical devices, opening a new avenue for ambient energy management.

         <title>Labile Coordination Interphase for Regulating Lean Ion Dynamics in Reversible Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CA zinc&#8208;coordinated interphase that protects zinc anodes from chemical corrosion is developed. Zn2+ ions selectively bind to histidine and carboxylate ligands, creating a coordination environment with high affinity and fast diffusion due to thermodynamic stability and kinetic lability. This labile coordination interphase improves cycling with dendrite&#8208;free zinc plating/stripping reversibility, leading to high&#8208;energy lean&#8208;electrolyte zinc ion batteries with long cycling life.








Abstract
Rechargeability in zinc (Zn) batteries is limited by anode irreversibility. The practical lean electrolytes exacerbate the issue, compromising the cost benefits of zinc batteries for large&#8208;scale energy storage. In this study, a zinc&#8208;coordinated interphase is developed to avoid chemical corrosion and stabilize zinc anodes. The interphase promotes Zn2+ ions to selectively bind with histidine and carboxylate ligands, creating a coordination environment with high affinity and fast diffusion due to thermodynamic stability and kinetic lability. Experiments and simulations indicate that interphase regulates dendrite&#8208;free electrodeposition and reduces side reactions. Implementing such labile coordination interphase results in increased cycling at 20 mA cm&#8722;2 and high reversibility of dendrite&#8208;free zinc plating/stripping for over 200 hours. A Zn||LiMn2O4 cell with 74.7 mWh g&#8722;1 energy density and 99.7% Coulombic efficiency after 500 cycles realized enhanced reversibility using the labile coordination interphase. A lean&#8208;electrolyte full cell using only 10 &#181;L mAh&#8722;1 electrolyte is also demonstrated with an elongated lifespan of 100 cycles, five times longer than bare Zn anodes. The cell offers a higher energy density than most existing aqueous batteries. This study presents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design for low&#8208;electrolyte, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries by modulating coordination interphases on Zn anodes.

         <title>Instant Protection Spray for Anti&#8208;Infection and Accelerated Healing of Empyrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An instant protection spray based on an angle layout can form a hydrogel film on burns in 30 s. The spray&#8208;loaded microparticles formed from probiotic extracts and flavones can provide a physical and anti&#8208;infection barrier for burns and promote healing, together with the hydrogel film.








Abstract
Distinct from common injuries, deep burns often require a chronic recovery cycle for healing and long&#8208;term antibiotic treatment to prevent infection. The rise of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria has caused antibiotics to no longer be perfect, and continuous drug use can easily lead to repeated infection and even death. Inspired by wild animals that chew plants to prevent wound infection, probiotic extracts with a structure similar to the tailspike of phage are obtained from Lactobacillus casei and combined with different flavones to design a series of nonantibiotic bactericides. These novel antibacterial agents are combined with a rapid gelation spray with a novel cross&#8208;angle layout to form an instant protection spray (IPS) and provide a physical and anti&#8208;infectious barrier for burns within 30 s. This IPS is able to sterilize 100.00% and 96.14% of multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In addition, it is found to effectively reduce inflammation in MRSA&#8208;infected burns in rats and to promote tissue healing.

Multicatalytic synergistic chemical transformation is a highly efficient and imperative approach for engineering gels in a sustainable way. Through Lignin aluminum nanoparticles (AlNPs)&#8208;aluminum ions (Al3+) catalytic system, a sustainable, environmentally adaptable, flame&#8208;retardant, conductive, self&#8208;healing, and multifaceted organohydrogel is engineered. The organohydrogel concurrently combines the advantages of both hydrogels and organogels, broadening the scope and applications of the gel&#8208;system into a wide range of industries.








Abstract
A sustainable and efficient multicatalytic chemical transformation approach is devised for the development of all&#8208;biobased environmentally adaptable polymers and gels with multifunctional properties. The catalytic system, utilizing Lignin aluminum nanoparticles (AlNPs)&#8208;aluminum ions (Al3+), synergistically combines multiple catalytic cycles to create robust, mechanically stable, and versatile organohydrogels. Single catalytic cycles alone fail to achieve desired results, highlighting the importance of cooperatively combining different cycles for successful outcomes. The transformation involves free radical crosslinking, reversible quinone&#8208;catechol reactions, and an autocatalytic mechanism, resulting in a dual crosslinking strategy that incorporates both covalent and ionic crosslinking. This approach creates a dynamic gel system with combined energy dissipation and storage mechanisms. The engineered organohydrogels demonstrate vital multifunctionalities such as good thermal stability, self&#8208;healing, and adhesive properties, flame&#8208;retardancy, mechanical resilience and durability, conductivity, viscoelastic properties, environmental adaptability, and resistance to extreme conditions such as freezing and drying. The developed catalytic technology and resulting gels hold significant potential for applications in flexible electronics, energy storage, actuators, and sensors.

         <title>Inhibiting Endothelial Cell&#8208;Mediated T Lymphocyte Apoptosis with Integrin&#8208;Targeting Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate Filaments for Chemoimmunotherapy of Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>

SN38&#8208;HKD/RGDR nanofibers simultaneously induce immunogenic cell death of cancer cells and downregulate Fas ligand expression on tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells (TECs). The treatment promotes antitumor immunity and reduces TEC&#8208;mediated T&#8208;cell apoptosis, significantly inhibiting the growth of primary TNBC tumors and pulmonary metastasis.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells (TECs) limit antitumor immunity via inducing apoptosis of infiltrating T lymphocytes through a Fas ligand (FasL) mediated mechanism. Herein, this work creates a peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC) by linking 7&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (SN38) to hydrophilic segments with either RGDR or HKD motif at their C&#8208;terminus through a glutathione&#8208;responsive linker. The PDCs spontaneously assemble into filaments in aqueous solution. The PDC filaments containing 1% of SN38&#8208;RGDR (SN38&#8208;HKD/RGDR) effectively target triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and TECs with upregulated expression of integrin, and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells and FasL downregulation of TECs. SN38&#8208;HKD/RGDR increases infiltration, activity, and viability of CD8+ T cells, and thus inhibits the growth of primary tumors and pulmonary metastasis. This study highlights the synergistic modulation of cancerous cells and TECs with integrin&#8208;targeting PDC filaments as a promising strategy for TNBC chemoimmunotherapy.

         <title>A Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Self&#8208;Assembled Bio&#8208;Macromolecule Film for Stable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) assembly method is deployed to deposit a robust dual&#8208;polymer layer on zinc anode, which effectively smoothens out the pristine rough surface of zinc foil, and also buffers the volume change caused by Zn plating/stripping. Four LbL layers are found the best, which significantly diminish zinc dendrite growth and elongate the cycle life of zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIB) up to 14 000 cycles.








Abstract
Side reactions on zinc metal (Zn) anodes are formidable issues that cause limited battery life of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Here, a facile and controllable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly technique is deployed to construct an ion&#8208;conductive and mechanically robust electrolyte/anode interface for stabilizing the Zn anode. The LbL film consists of two natural and biodegradable bio&#8208;macromolecules, chitosan (CS) and sodium alginate (SA). It is shown that such an LbL film tailors the solvation sheath of Zn ions and facilitates the oriented deposition of Zn. Symmetric cells with the four double layers of CS/SA ((CS/SA)4&#8211;Zn) exhibit stable cycles for over 6500&#160;h. The (CS/SA)4&#8211;Zn||H2V3O8 coin cell maintains a specific capacity of 125.5 mAh g&#8722;1 after 14&#160;000 cycles. The pouch cell with an electrode area of 5 &#215; 7 cm2 also presents a capacity retention of 83% for over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. No obvious dendrites are observed after long cycles in both symmetric and full cells. Given the cost&#8208;effective material and fabrication, and environmental friendliness of the LbL films, this Zn protection strategy may boost the industrial application of AZIBs.

         <title>A Transformable Supramolecular Bispecific Cell Engager for Augmenting Natural Killer and T Cell&#8208;Based Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular bispecific&#8208;cell&#8208;engager (Supra&#8208;BiCE) that simultaneously targets TIGIT on NK/T cells and PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cells is fabricated by co&#8208;assembly of two immune checkpoint blocking peptides. Supra&#8208;BiCE creates artificial connections between NK/T cells with tumor cells as well as blocking both check points, thus increasing infiltration and activation of NK and T cells at tumor site and boosting tumor inhibition rate.








Abstract
Immune cells are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy, yet their therapeutic effectiveness is often hampered by limited tumor infiltration and inhibitory tumor microenvironments. An alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;responsive and transformable supramolecular bis&#8208;specific cell engager (Supra&#8208;BiCE) to harness natural killer (NK)/T cells for effective cancer immunotherapy is introduced here. The Supra&#8208;BiCE, consisting of both SA&#8208;P (a phosphorylated peptide targeting and blocking programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1)) and SA&#8208;T (a phosphorylated peptide targeting and blocking T cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT)) is constructed by a simple co&#8208;assembling strategy. Upon intravenous administration, Supra&#8208;BiCE self&#8208;assembles into nanoribbons and interacts with NK/T cells via TIGIT. Notably, these nanoribbons undergo transformation into long nanofibrils within ALP&#8208;overexpressing tumor regions, resulting in enhanced binding affinities of Supra&#8208;BiCE to both PD&#8208;L1 and TIGIT. Consequently, this leads to the accumulation and retention of NK/T cells within tumor regions. Furthermore, the combinatorial blockade of checkpoints by Supra&#8208;BiCE activates infiltrating NK/T cells. Moreover, the adjustable peptide ratio in Supra&#8208;BiCE enables customization for optimal therapeutic effects against distinct tumor types. Particularly, Supra&#8208;BiCE (T:P = 1:3) achieved 98.27% tumor suppression rate against colon carcinoma model. Overall, this study offers a promising tool for engaging NK and T cells for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Photocatalyst to Optimize Hydroxyl Radical Production Pathways for Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>

Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks with metal single&#8208;atom coordination (Pd2+@Tp&#8208;TAPT) with high yield of &#8226;OH through an optimal conversion way has high activity in photodegradation of phenolic pollutants (10&#160;ppm phenol within 10&#160;min) and high selectivity in photocatalytic nitrogen fixation (189.63&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for NH4+), which provides guidance for the application of photocatalytic technology in environmental remediation and energy storage.








Abstract
Ring&#8208;opening of phenol in wastewater is the pivotal step in photocatalytic degradation. The highly selective generation of catalytical active species (&#8226;OH) to facilitate this process presents a significant scientific challenge. Therefore, a novel approach for designing photocatalysts with single&#8208;atom containment in metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (M&#8208;COFs) is proposed. The selection of imine&#8208;linked COFs containing abundant N and O&#8208;chelate sites provides a solid foundation for anchoring metal atom. These dispersed metal atom possess rapid accumulation and transfer capabilities for photogenerated electrons, while the periodic &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure in 2D&#8208;COFs establishes an effective platform. Additionally, the Lewis acid properties of imine bonds in COFs can enhance the adsorption capacity toward gases with Lewis base properties, such as O2 and N2. It is demonstrated that the Pd2+@Tp&#8208;TAPT, designed based on this concept, exhibits efficient oxygen adsorption and follows the reaction pathway of O2&#8594;&#8226;O2&#8722;&#8594;H2O2&#8594;&#8226;OH with high selectivity, thereby achieving completely degradation of refractory phenol through photocatalysis within 10 min.

&lt;p&gt;Metal-covalent organic frameworks with metal single-atom coordination (Pd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;@Tp-TAPT) with high yield of &#8226;OH through an optimal conversion way has high activity in photodegradation of phenolic pollutants (10&#160;ppm phenol within 10&#160;min) and high selectivity in photocatalytic nitrogen fixation (189.63&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), which provides guidance for the application of photocatalytic technology in environmental remediation and energy storage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ring-opening of phenol in wastewater is the pivotal step in photocatalytic degradation. The highly selective generation of catalytical active species (&#8226;OH) to facilitate this process presents a significant scientific challenge. Therefore, a novel approach for designing photocatalysts with single-atom containment in metal-covalent organic frameworks (M-COFs) is proposed. The selection of imine-linked COFs containing abundant N and O-chelate sites provides a solid foundation for anchoring metal atom. These dispersed metal atom possess rapid accumulation and transfer capabilities for photogenerated electrons, while the periodic &#960;-conjugated structure in 2D-COFs establishes an effective platform. Additionally, the Lewis acid properties of imine bonds in COFs can enhance the adsorption capacity toward gases with Lewis base properties, such as O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is demonstrated that the Pd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;@Tp-TAPT, designed based on this concept, exhibits efficient oxygen adsorption and follows the reaction pathway of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;&#8226;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8594;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;&#8226;OH with high selectivity, thereby achieving completely degradation of refractory phenol through photocatalysis within 10 min. It is anticipated that the selective generation of catalytic active species via advanced material design concepts will serve as a significant reference for achieving precise material catalysis in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasound Nanobubble Coupling Agent for Effective Noninvasive Deep&#8208;Layer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound nanobubbles and aminated hyaluronic acid prepared by the double emulsification method are crosslinked with aldehyde&#8208;based hyaluronic acid via dynamic covalent bonds through the Schiff base reaction to produce an innovative ultrasound&#8211;nanobubble coupling agent. By amplifying the cavitation effect of ultrasound, drugs can be efficiently transferred through the double barrier of the skin and delivered to deep layers.








Abstract
Conventional coupling agents (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, methylcellulose, and polyurethane) are unable to efficiently transport drugs through the skin's dual barriers (the epidermal cuticle barrier and the basement membrane barrier between the epidermis and dermis) when exposed to ultrasound, hindering deep and noninvasive transdermal drug delivery. In this study, nanobubbles prepared by the double emulsification method and aminated hyaluronic acid are crosslinked with aldehyde&#8208;based hyaluronic acid by dynamic covalent bonding through the Schiff base reaction to produce an innovative ultrasound&#8208;nanobubble coupling agent. By amplifying the cavitation effect of ultrasound, drugs can be efficiently transferred through the double barrier of the skin and delivered to deep layers. In an in vitro model of isolated porcine skin, this agent achieves an effective penetration depth of 728&#160;&#181;m with the parameters of ultrasound set at 2&#160;W, 650&#160;kHz, and 50% duty cycle for 20&#160;min. Consequently, drugs can be efficiently delivered to deeper layers noninvasively. In summary, this ultrasound nanobubble coupling agent efficiently achieves deep&#8208;layer drug delivery by amplifying the ultrasonic cavitation effect and penetrating the double barriers, heralding a new era for noninvasive drug delivery platforms and disease treatment.

         <title>Chiroptical Switching of Electrochromic Polymer Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Homogeneous chiral electrochromics using chiral assembly of conjugated polymers have been developed through a transient solidification process with molecular chiral templates. The circular dichroism can be tuned by adjusting the doping level of the electrochemically active polymer films. The differential circularly polarized transmission in the chiral see&#8208;through display can make a well&#8208;resolved color change, demonstrating proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept devices for information encryption.








Abstract
The interaction between light and chiroptical polymers plays a crucial role in chiroptics, spintronics, and chiral&#8208;spin selectivity. Despite considerable successes in creating dissymmetric polymer films, the elucidation of chiroptical activities under electrochemical switching remains unexplored. Here homogeneous chiral electrochromics is reported using chiral assembly of conjugated polymers through a transient solidification process with molecular chiral templates. In their neutral state, the chiral electrochromic polymers directly produce a remarkably dissymmetric polarization&#8208;dependent transmittance. The circular dichroism (CD) and dissymmetric transmission can be tuned by adjusting the doping level of the electrochemically active polymer films. Under high levels of oxidation, the chiroptical activities are reversed with strong bleaching in the visible, leading to formation of monosignate CD spectra over the infrared region. The matching between circular polarization handedness and chirality of chiroptical polymers makes a distinct impact on optical contrast and color switching dynamics due to the flipped chiroptical activities through polymer redox reactions. The differential circularly polarized transmission in the chiral see&#8208;through display can make a well&#8208;resolved color change in human eyes, demonstrating proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept devices for 3D imaging and information encryption. This work serves as a foundation to develop advanced on&#8208;chip fabrication of circular polarization&#8208;multiplexed display in flexible and highly integrated platforms.

         <title>A Tunable Soft Silicone Bioadhesive for Secure Anchoring of Diverse Medical Devices to Wet Biological Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silicone&#8208;based bioadhesive designed to create strong bonds between silicone devices and biological tissues is presented here. It combines wet tissue adhesion with long&#8208;term integration, transitioning from nonpermeable to permeable over time to facilitate cell migration. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to commercial adhesives, with no adverse reactions observed in rats, promising versatile applications in medical device adhesion.








Abstract
Silicone is utilized widely in medical devices for its compatibility with tissues and bodily fluids, making it a versatile material for implants and wearables. To effectively bond silicone devices to biological tissues, a reliable adhesive is required to create a long&#8208;lasting interface. BioAdheSil, a silicone&#8208;based bioadhesive designed to provide robust adhesion on both sides of the interface is introduced here, facilitating bonding between dissimilar substrates, namely silicone devices and tissues. The adhesive's design focuses on two key aspects: wet tissue adhesion capability and tissue&#8208;infiltration&#8208;based long&#8208;term integration. BioAdheSil is formulated by mixing soft silicone oligomers with siloxane coupling agents and absorbents for bonding the hydrophobic silicone device to hydrophilic tissues. Incorporation of biodegradable absorbents eliminates surface water and controls porosity, while silane crosslinkers provide interfacial strength. Over time, BioAdheSil transitions from nonpermeable to permeable through enzyme degradation, creating a porous structure that facilitates cell migration and tissue integration, potentially enabling long&#8208;lasting adhesion. Experimental results demonstrate that BioAdheSil outperforms commercial adhesives and elicits no adverse response in rats. BioAdheSil offers practical utility for adhering silicone devices to wet tissues, including long&#8208;term implants and transcutaneous devices. Here, its functionality is demonstrated through applications such as tracheal stents and left ventricular assist device lines.

         <title>High&#8208;Sulfur Loading and Single Ion&#8208;Selective Membranes for High&#8208;Energy and Durable Decoupled Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;membrane decoupled aqueous Zn&#8211;S battery is achieved by decoupling the S/Cu2S cathode and Zn/Zn(OH)42&#8722; anode, which presents an energy density of 3988 Wh kgs&#8722;1 (based on sulfur mass). The high areal energy density and long operational life originate from the high&#8208;sulfur loading cathode and newly designed single ion&#8208;selective membrane.








Abstract
The decoupled battery design is promising for breaking the energy density limit of traditional aqueous batteries. However, the complex battery configuration and low&#8208;selective separator membranes restrict their energy output and service time. Herein, a zinc&#8211;sulfur decoupled aqueous battery is achieved by designing a high&#8208;mass loading sulfur electrode and single ion&#8208;selective membrane (ISM). A vertically assembled nanosheet network constructed with the assistance of a magnetic field enables facile electron and ion conduction in thick sulfur electrodes, which is conducive to boosting the cell&#8208;level energy output. For the tailored ISM, the Na ions anchored on its skeleton effectively prevent the crossover of OH&#8722; or Cu2+, facilitating the transport of Na+ and ensuring structural and mechanical stability. Consequently, the Zn&#8211;S aqueous battery achieves a reversible energy density of 3988&#160;Wh kgs&#8722;1 (by sulfur mass), stable operation over 300 cycles, and an energy density of 53.2 mWh cm&#8722;2. The sulfur&#8208;based decoupled system may be of immediate benefit toward safe, reliable, and affordable static energy storage.

         <title>Universal Stripe Symmetry of Short&#8208;Range Charge Density Waves in Cuprate Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetry of charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave (CDW) in copper&#8208;oxide superconductors is an important clue for the longstanding conundrum of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity. This novel RIXS mapping study corroborates unidirectional stripe as a fundamental symmetry of CDWs across cuprate materials. This remarkable universality provides a new perspective on the unified organizing principle of CDW and its role in the phase diagram of copper&#8208;oxide superconductors.








Abstract
The omnipresence of charge density waves (CDWs) across almost all cuprate families underpins a common organizing principle. However, a longstanding debate of whether its spatial symmetry is stripe or checkerboard remains unresolved. While CDWs in lanthanum&#8208; and yttrium&#8208;based cuprates possess a stripe symmetry, distinguishing these two scenarios is challenging for the short&#8208;range CDW in bismuth&#8208;based cuprates. Here, high&#8208;resolution resonant inelastic x&#8208;ray scattering is employed to uncover the spatial symmetry of the CDW in Bi2Sr2 &#8722; xLaxCuO6 + &#948;. Across a wide range of doping and temperature, anisotropic CDW peaks with elliptical shapes are found in reciprocal space. Based on Fourier transform analysis of real&#8208;space models, the results are interpreted as evidence of unidirectional charge stripes, hosted by mutually 90&#176;&#8208;rotated anisotropic domains. This work paves the way for a unified symmetry and microscopic description of CDW order in&#160;cuprates.

         <title>Polymer Coating with Balanced Coordination Strength and Ion Conductivity for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) limits the unrestricted 2D diffusion of zinc ions through soft coordination and the partially quaternized derivative (q&#8208;P2VP) further enables a balance between coordination trapping and ion transporting, leading to a rapid ion migration speed and a lower capacity decay.








Abstract
Decorating Zn anodes with functionalized polymers is considered as an effective strategy to inhibit dendrite growth. However, this normally brings extra interfacial resistance rendering slow reaction kinetics of Zn2+. Herein, a poly(2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P2VP) coating with modulated coordination strength and ion conductivity for dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode is reported. The P2VP coating favors a high electrolyte wettability and rapid Zn2+ migration speed (Zn2+ transfer number, tZn2+ = 0.58). Electrostatic potential calculation shows that P2VP mildly coordinates with Zn2+ (adsorption energy = &#8722;0.94&#160;eV), which promotes a preferential deposition of Zn along the (002) crystal plane. Notably, the use of partially (26%) quaternized P2VP (q&#8208;P2VP) further reduces the interfacial resistance to 126 &#937;, leading to a high ion migration speed (tZn2+ = 0.78) and a considerably low nucleation overpotential (18&#160;mV). As a result of the synergistic effect of mild coordination and partial electrolysis, the overpotential of the q&#8208;P2VP&#8208;decorated Zn anode retains at a considerably low level (&#8776;46&#160;mV) over 1000&#160;h at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled (NH4)2V6O16&#183;1.5H2O || glass fiber || q&#8208;P2VP&#8208;Zn full cell reveals a lower average capacity decay rate of only 0.018% per cycle within 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1.

         <title>Synergistic Pharmacological Therapy to Modulate Glial Cells in Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, a nanogel that can selectively release active compounds in microglial cells and astrocytes in the spinal cord is developed and evaluated using expansion microscopy. Two administration schemes are tested in a spinal cord injury mouse model. Early treatment with Rolipram&#8208;loaded nanogel improves motor performance; late phase treatment has the opposite effect, worsening motor recovery due to widespread degeneration.








Abstract
Current treatments for modulating the glial&#8208;mediated inflammatory response after spinal cord injury (SCI) have limited ability to improve recovery. This is quite likely due to the lack of a selective therapeutic approach acting on microgliosis and astrocytosis, the glia components most involved after trauma, while maximizing efficacy and minimizing side effects. A new nanogel that can selectively release active compounds in microglial cells and astrocytes is developed and characterized. The degree of selectivity and subcellular distribution of the nanogel is evaluated by applying an innovative super&#8208;resolution microscopy technique, expansion microscopy. Two different administration schemes are then tested in a SCI mouse model: in an early phase, the nanogel loaded with Rolipram, an anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, achieves significant improvement in the animal's motor performance due to the increased recruitment of microglia and macrophages that are able to localize the lesion. Treatment in the late phase, however, gives opposite results, with worse motor recovery because of the widespread degeneration. These findings demonstrate that the nanovector can be selective and functional in the treatment of the glial component in different phases of SCI. They also open a new therapeutic scenario for tackling glia&#8208;mediated inflammation after neurodegenerative events in the central nervous system.

         <title>A Dynamically Stable Mixed Conducting Interphase for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamically stable mixed conducting interphase (S&#8208;MCI) is proposed by a stress self&#8208;limiting mechanism to achieve the compatibility of Li metal with composite sulfide electrolytes. The S&#8208;MCI can efficiently reduce Li nucleation overpotential, uniformize Li&#8208;ion flux and promote Li kinetics, leading to the suppression of Li dendrite penetration in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (ASSLMBs) employing sulfide solid electrolytes have attracted increasing attention owing to superior safety and high energy density. However, the instability of sulfide electrolytes against Li metal induces the formation of two types of incompetent interphases, solid electrolyte&#160;interphase (SEI) and mixed conducting interphase (MCI), which significantly blocks rapid Li&#8208;ion transport and induces uneven Li deposition and continuous interface degradation. In this contribution, a dynamically stable mixed conducting interphase (S&#8208;MCI) is proposed by in situ stress self&#8208;limiting reaction to achieve the compatibility of Li metal with composite sulfide electrolytes (Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) and Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS)). The rational design of composite electrolytes&#160;utilizes the expansion stress induced by the electrolyte decomposition to in turn constrain the further decomposition of LGPS. Consequently, the S&#8208;MCI inherits the high dynamical stability of LPSCl&#8208;derived SEI and the lithiophilic affinity of Li&#8211;Ge alloy in LGPS&#8208;derived MCI. The Li||Li symmetric cells with the protection of S&#8208;MCI can operate stably for 1500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Li||NCM622 full cells present stable cycling for 100 cycles at 0.1 C with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.7%. This work sheds fresh insight into constructing electrochemically stable interphase for high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs.

         <title>Polarization Reversal of Group IV&#8211;VI Semiconductors with Pucker&#8208;Like Structure: Mechanism Dissecting and Function Demonstration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The miniaturized image band identification and enhancement system can be achieved by utilizing a polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector with polarization reversal capability. The photodetector is constructed using in&#8208;plane pucker&#8208;like group IV&#8211;VI semiconductors MX (M&#160;=&#160;Ge, Sn; X&#160;=&#160;S, Se), leveraging the intrinsic differences in transition probabilities of charge carriers.








Abstract
Polarization imaging presents advantages in capturing spatial, spectral, and polarization information across various spectral bands. It can improve the perceptual ability of image sensors and has garnered more applications. Despite its potential, challenges persist in identifying band information and implementing image enhancement using polarization imaging. These challenges often necessitate integrating spectrometers or other components, resulting in increased complexities within image processing systems and hindering device miniaturization trends. Here, the characteristics of anisotropic absorption reversal are systematically elucidated in pucker&#8208;like group IV&#8211;VI semiconductors MX (M&#160;=&#160;Ge, Sn; X&#160;=&#160;S, Se) through theoretical predictions and experimental validations. Additionally, the fundamental mechanisms behind anisotropy reversal in different bands are also explored. The photodetector is constructed by utilizing MX as a light&#8208;absorbing layer, harnessing polarization&#8208;sensitive photoresponse for virtual imaging. The results indicate that the utilization of polarization reversal photodetectors holds advantages in achieving further multifunctional integration within the device structure while simplifying its configuration, including band information identification and image enhancement. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of polarization reversal mechanisms and presents a promising and reliable approach for achieving dual&#8208;band image band identification and image enhancement without additional auxiliary components.

         <title>The One&#8208;Stop Integrated Nanoagent Based on Photothermal Therapy for Deep Infection Healing and Inflammation Inhibition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>

The 2TT&#8208;mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs are designed and fabricated to eliminate bacterial biofilms and facilitate the MRSA&#8208;infected abscess wound healing. The ROS&#8208;scavenging, O2&#8208;producing, and regulation of macrophage polarization mechanisms based on multiple enzymatic activities and the photothermal property are revealed. Herein, a reasonable antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammation approach against infected wounds and a reference for other hypoxia&#8208;relative inflammatory diseases is demonstrated.








Abstract
Chronic wounds caused by bacterial infections are a major challenge in medical fields. The hypoxia condition extremely induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and upregulates the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor, both of which can increase the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 subtype macrophages production while reducing the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 subtype macrophages. Besides, bacteria&#8208;formed biofilms can hinder the penetration of therapeutic agents. Encouraged by natural motors automatically executing tasks, hypothesized that supplying sufficient oxygen (O2) would simultaneously drive therapeutic agent movement, rescue the hypoxic microenvironment, and disrupt the vicious cycle of inflammation. Here, small organic molecule&#8208;based nanoparticles (2TT&#8208;mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs) that possess high photothermal conversion efficiency and enzymatic activities are developed, including superoxide dismutase&#8208;, catalase&#8208;, and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activity. 2TT&#8208;mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs exhibit superior ROS&#8208;scavenging and O2 production abilities that synergistically relieve inflammation, alleviate hypoxia conditions, and promote their deep penetration in chronic wound tissues. Transcriptome analysis further demonstrates that 2TT&#8208;mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs inhibit biological activities inside bacteria. Furthermore, in vivo experiments prove that 2TT&#8208;mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs&#8208;based hyperthermia can effectively eliminate bacteria in biofilms to promote wound healing.

         <title>Intrinsic Polarized Electric Field Induces a Storing Mechanism to Achieve Energy Storing Catalysis in V2C MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
V2C MXene exhibits a ferroelectric&#8208;like intrinsic polarization electric field, enabling the storage of internal electrons within the structural layer and holes on its surface while maintaining separation. Achievement of the single&#8208;phase energy storage effect. Surface termination is adjusted to enhance its energy storage capacity. Consequently, it demonstrates effective dark catalysis and full&#8208;spectrum photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Efficient storage and separation of holes and electrons pose significant challenges for catalytic reactions, particularly in the context of single&#8208;phase catalysis. Herein, V2C MXene, with its intrinsic polarized electric field, successfully overcomes this obstacle. To enhance hole storage, a multistep etching process is employed under reducing conditions to control the content of surface termination groups, thus exposing more defective active sites. The intrinsically polarized electric field confines holes to the surface of the layer and free electrons within the layer, leading to a lag in e&#8722; release compared to h+. The quantities of stored holes and electrons are measured to be 18.13&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1 and 106.37 &#181;mol g&#8722;1, respectively. Under dark, V2C demonstrates excellent and stable dark&#8208;catalytic performance, degrading 57.91% of tetracycline (TC 40&#160;mg L&#8722;1) and removing 23% of total organic carbon (TOC) after 140 min. In simulated sunlight and near&#8208;infrared light, the corresponding degradation rates reach 72.24% and 79.54%, with corresponding TOC removal rates of 49% and 48%, respectively. The hole and electron induced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects contribute to a long&#8208;lasting and enhanced broad&#8208;spectrum mineralization of V2C MXene. This study provides valuable insights into the research and application of all&#8208;weather MXene energy storage catalytic materials.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable ITO&#8208;Free Organic Solar Cells Based on Squaraine N&#8208;Doped Quaternary Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A squaraine&#8208;based n&#8208;doping strategy is developed to optimize the molecular crystallinity and nanomorphology of nonfullerene&#8208;based ternary bulk heterojunctions. Combined with indium&#8208;tin&#8208;oxide&#8208;free column&#8208;patterned microcavity architecture and interfacial engineering, an impressive efficiency over 19% is achieved for the resulting quaternary organic solar cells, with an extrapolated lifetime of &#8776;23 years based on accelerated aging test.









Abstract
Simultaneously achieving high efficiency and robust device stability remains a significant challenge for organic solar cells (OSCs). Solving this challenge is highly dependent on the film morphology of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive blends; however, there is a lack of rational control strategy. Herein, it is shown that the molecular crystallinity and nanomorphology of nonfullerene&#8208;based BHJ can be effectively controlled by a squaraine&#8208;based doping strategy, leading to an increase in device efficiency from 17.26% to 18.5% when doping 2&#160;wt% squaraine into the PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9:PC71BM ternary BHJ. The efficiency is further improved to 19.11% (certified 19.06%) using an indium&#8208;tin&#8208;oxide&#8208;free column&#8208;patterned microcavity (CPM) architecture. Combined with interfacial modification, CPM quaternary OSC excitingly shows an extrapolated lifetime of &#8776;23 years based on accelerated aging test, with the mechanism behind enhanced stability well studied. Furthermore, a flexible OSC module with a high and stable efficiency of 15.2% and an overall area of 5 cm2 is successfully fabricated, exhibiting a high average output power for wearable electronics. This work demonstrates that OSCs with new design of BHJ and device architecture are highly promising to be practical relevance with excellent performance and stability.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Independent Synchronized ROS Generation and Hypoxia Prodrug Activation with Z&#8208;Scheme Heterostructure Sonosensitizer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tirapazamine (TPZ) loaded BiOCl&#8208;Au&#8208;Ag2S Z&#8208;scheme heterostructure is designed to efficiently separate electron and hole with high redox potentials. Under ultrasound irradiation, the generated holes react with water to produce hydroxyl radicals, while the electrons activate TPZ, leading to the synergistic sonodynamic and hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs therapy, negating the need for O2.








Abstract
Combination therapy has emerged as a promising approach for effective tumor treatment. However, the combination of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs (HAPs) has not been explored due to the contradictory requirement of oxygen (O2) for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the necessity to avoid O2 for the activation of HAPs. In this study, this challenge is addressed by developing BiOCl&#8208;Au&#8208;Ag2S Z&#8208;scheme heterostructure nanoparticles loaded with tirapazamine (TPZ) to achieve O2&#8208;independent therapy. These nanoparticles demonstrate efficient electron&#8211;hole separation under ultrasound irradiation while maintaining a high redox potential. The generated holes react with water to efficiently produce hydroxyl radicals, while the electrons autonomously activate TPZ, negating the need for O2. In vitro and in vivo assessments validate the effective tumor elimination by these Z&#8208;scheme nanoparticles without disrupting the hypoxic environment. This innovative design overcomes the limitations associated with O2 requirement in SDT and introduces a novel strategy for HAP activation and synergistic therapy between ROS and HAPs&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>Halide Heterogeneous Structure Boosting Ionic Diffusion and High&#8208;Voltage Stability of Sodium Superionic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries heavily hinges on the development of a Na+ conductor that features high conductivity, (electro)chemical stability, and deformability. In this study, the halide heterogeneous structure electrolytes incorporating a UCl3&#8208;type high&#8208;coordination framework and amorphous low&#8208;coordination phase achieves the high Na+ conductivity (2.7 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, RT) and good solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion battery performance.








Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SSSBs) heavily hinges on the development of an superionic Na+ conductor (SSC) that features high conductivity, (electro)chemical stability, and deformability. The construction of heterogeneous structures offers a promising approach to comprehensively enhancing these properties in a way that differs from traditional structural optimization. Here, this work exploits the structural variance between high&#8208; and low&#8208;coordination halide frameworks to develop a new class of halide heterogeneous structure electrolytes (HSEs). The halide HSEs incorporating a UCl3&#8208;type high&#8208;coordination framework and amorphous low&#8208;coordination phase achieves the highest Na+ conductivity (2.7 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature, RT) among halide SSCs so far. By discerning the individual contribution of the crystalline bulk, amorphous region, and interface, this work unravels the synergistic ion conduction within halide HSEs and provides a comprehensive explanation of the amorphization effect. More importantly, the excellent deformability, high&#8208;voltage stability, and expandability of HSEs enable effective SSSB integration. Using a cold&#8208;pressed cathode electrode composite of uncoated Na0.85Mn0.5Ni0.4Fe0.1O2 and HSEs, the SSSBs present stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 91.0% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C.

         <title>High Mechanical Strength Alloy&#8208;like Minerals Prepared by Inorganic Ionic Co&#8208;cross&#8208;linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops inorganic ionic co&#8208;cross&#8208;linking by using calcium carbonate oligomers and calcium phosphate oligomers (CCOs and CPOs) to produce a group of compounds with the chemical formulas Ca(CO3)x(PO4)2(1&#8208;x)/3 (0 &lt; x &lt; 1), referred to as CaCPs. They exhibit molecular homogeneity, a single&#8208;transition temperature and adjustable chemical compositions, and they are readily transformed to high strength alloy&#8208;like minerals (ALMs) by heat&#8208;induced crystallization.








Abstract
Alloys often combine different metals to generate superior mechanical properties. However, it is challenging to prepare high mechanical strength minerals with similar strategies. Using calcium carbonate (CaC) and calcium phosphate (CaP) as examples, this work synthesizes a group of compounds with the chemical formulas Ca(CO3)x(PO4)2(1&#8208;x)/3 (0 &lt; x &lt; 1, CaCPs) by cross&#8208;linking ionic oligomers. Unlike mixtures, these CaCPs exhibit a single temperature for the phase transition from amorphous to crystallized CaC (calcite) and CaP (hydroxyapatite). By heat&#8208;induced synchronous crystallization, dual&#8208;phase CaC/CaP with continuous crystallized boundaries are resembled to alloy&#8208;like minerals (ALMs). The mechanical properties of the ALMs are adjusted by tailoring their chemical compositions to reach a hardness of 5.6&#160;GPa, which exceed those of control calcite and hydroxyapatite samples by 430% and 260%, respectively. This strategy expands the chemical scope of inorganic materials and holds promise for preparing high&#8208;performance minerals.

         <title>Delayed Crystallization Kinetics Allowing High&#8208;Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Photovoltaics with Superior Upscaled Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upscale manufacturing is critical for future practical applications. An all&#8208;polymer ternary system that enables a champion efficiency of 19% in small&#8208;area devices is developed here, and the delayed crystallization kinetics of all&#8208;polymer system benefitted optimized morphology is unveiled, thus leading to a record efficiency of 16.26% in large&#8208;area module with 19.3 cm2.








Abstract
Though encouraging performance is achieved in small&#8208;area organic photovoltaics (OPVs), reducing efficiency loss when evoluted to large&#8208;area modules is an important but unsolved issue. Considering that polymer materials show benefits in film&#8208;forming processability and mechanical robustness, a high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;polymer OPV module is demonstrated in this work. First, a ternary blend consisting of two polymer donors, PM6 and PBQx&#8208;TCl, and one polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;IT, is developed, with which triplet state recombination is suppressed for a reduced energy loss, thus allowing a higher voltage; and donor&#8211;acceptor miscibility is compromised for enhanced charge transport, thus resulting in improved photocurrent and fill factor; all these contribute to a champion efficiency of 19% for all&#8208;polymer OPVs. Second, the delayed crystallization kinetics from solution to film solidification is achieved that gives a longer operation time window for optimized blend morphology in large&#8208;area module, thus relieving the loss of fill factor and allowing a record efficiency of 16.26% on an upscaled module with an area of 19.3 cm2. Besides, this all&#8208;polymer system also shows excellent mechanical stability. This work demonstrates that all&#8208;polymer ternary systems are capable of solving the upscaled manufacturing issue, thereby enabling high&#8208;efficiency OPV modules.

         <title>Scalable Printing of Metal Nanostructures through Superluminescent Light Projection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the superluminescent light projection (SLP) technique to rapidly print sub&#8208;diffraction metallic nanostructures, as small as 210&#160;nm, with light that is a billion times less intense than femtosecond lasers. As SLP is 480&#215; faster and 35&#215; less expensive than femtosecond laser printing, it breaks the traditional resolution versus cost and rate tradeoff in metal printing.








Abstract
Direct printing of metallic nanostructures is highly desirable but current techniques cannot achieve nanoscale resolutions or are too expensive and slow. Photoreduction of solvated metal ions into metallic nanoparticles is an attractive strategy because it is faster than deposition&#8208;based techniques. However, it is still limited by the resolution versus cost tradeoff because sub&#8208;diffraction printing of nanostructures requires high&#8208;intensity light from expensive femtosecond lasers. Here, this tradeoff is overcome by leveraging the spatial and temporal coherence properties of low&#8208;intensity diode&#8208;based superluminescent light. The superluminescent light projection (SLP) technique is presented to rapidly print sub&#8208;diffraction nanostructures, as small as 210&#160;nm and at periods as small as 300&#160;nm, with light that is a billion times less intense than femtosecond lasers. Printing of arbitrarily complex 2D nanostructured silver patterns over 30&#160;&#181;m&#160;&#215;&#160;80&#160;&#181;m areas in 500&#160;ms time scales is demonstrated. The post&#8208;annealed nanostructures exhibit an electrical conductivity up to 1/12th that of bulk silver. SLP is up to 480 times faster and 35 times less expensive than printing with femtosecond lasers. Therefore, it transforms nanoscale metal printing into a scalable format, thereby significantly enhancing the transition of nano&#8208;enabled devices from research laboratories into real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Achieving Desired Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells via Binary&#8208;Dilution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo planar heterojunction (P&#8208;PHJ) is successfully fabricated by binary&#8208;dilution strategy (PM6 is mixed with micro acceptor BO&#8208;4Cl and L8&#8208;BO is mixed with micro donor PM6, respectively), which not only remains donor/acceptor (D/A) vertical distribution of binary planar heterojunction (P&#8208;BHJ), but gains larger D/A interpenetrating regions. The formation of ideal active layer morphology promotes excellent charge dynamics, and boosts the PCE of P&#8208;PHJ from 17.67% to 19.32%.








Abstract
The sequential deposition process has demonstrated the great possibility to achieve a photolayer architecture with an ideal gradient phase separation morphology, which has a vital influence on the physical processes that determine the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the controllable preparation of pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (P&#8208;PHJ) with gradient distribution has not been effectively elucidated. Herein, a binary&#8208;dilution strategy is proposed, the PM6 solution with micro acceptor BO&#8208;4Cl and the L8&#8208;BO solution with micro donor PM6 respectively, to form P&#8208;PHJ film. This architecture exists good donor (D) and acceptor (A) vertical gradient distribution and larger D/A interpenetrating regions, which promotes exciton generation and dissociation, shortens charge transport distance and optimizes carrier dynamics. Moreover, the dilution of PM6 by BO&#8208;4Cl promotes the regulation of active layer aggregation size and phase purity, thus alleviating energy disorder and voltage loss. As a result, the P&#8208;PHJ device exhibits an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 19.32% with an excellent short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.92&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, much higher than planar binary heterojunction (17.67%) and ternary bulk heterojunction (18.49%) devices. This research proves a simple but effective method to provide an avenue for constructing desirable active layer morphology and high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Low&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells for Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taurine is employed as the buried interface bridge to fabricate hole transport layer free low&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, leading to a high efficiency of 22.50% with an impressive VOC of 0.911 V, enabling all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells with an efficiency of 26.03%.








Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap (LBG,&#160;Eg&#160;&#8776;1.25&#160;eV)&#160;tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play critical roles in&#160;constructing efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) that can surpass the efficiency limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. However, the traditional poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hole transport layer (HTL) in LBG PSCs usually restricts device efficiency and stability. Here, a strategy of employing 2&#8208;aminoethanesulfonic acid (i.e., taurine) as the interface bridge to fabricate efficient HTL&#8208;free LBG PSCs with improved optoelectronic properties of the perovskite absorbers at the buried contacts is reported. Taurine&#8208;modified ITO substrate has lower optical losses, better energy level alignment, and higher charge transfer capability than PEDOT:PSS HTL, leading to significantly improved open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and short&#8208;circuit current density of corresponding devices. The best&#8208;performing LBG PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.50% and an impressive VOC of 0.911&#160;V is realized, enabling all&#8208;perovskite TSCs with an efficiency of 26.03%. The taurine&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free TSCs have highly increased stability, retaining more than 90% and 80% of their initial PCEs after constant operation under 1&#8208;sun illumination for 600&#160;h and under 55&#160;&#176;C thermal stress for 950&#160;h, respectively. This work provides a facile strategy for fabricating efficient and stable perovskite devices with a simplified HTL&#8208;free architecture.

         <title>Natural Polyphenolic Nanodots for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal protocol to prepare natural polyphenolic nanodots by heating in aqueous solution without unacceptable additives is reported. The nanodots are able to not only inhibit amyloid&#8208;&#946; fibrillization and trigger the fibril disaggregation, but mitigate the amyloid&#8208;&#946;&#8208;plaque&#8208;induced cascade impairments including normalizing oxidative microenvironment, altering microglial polarization, and rescuing neuronal death and synaptic loss.








Abstract
The abnormal amyloid&#8208;&#946; accumulation is essential and obbligato in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and natural polyphenols exhibit great potential as amyloid aggregation inhibitors. However, the poor metabolic stability, low bioavailability, and weak blood&#8211;brain barrier crossing ability of natural polyphenol molecules fail to meet clinical needs. Here, a universal protocol to prepare natural polyphenolic nanodots is developed by heating in aqueous solution without unacceptable additives. The nanodots are able to not only inhibit amyloid&#8208;&#946; fibrillization and trigger the fibril disaggregation, but mitigate the amyloid&#8208;&#946;&#8208;plaque&#8208;induced cascade impairments including normalizing oxidative microenvironment, altering microglial polarization, and rescuing neuronal death and synaptic loss, which results in significant improvements in recognition and cognition deficits in transgenic mice. More importantly, natural polyphenolic nanodots possess stronger antiamyloidogenic performance compared with small molecule, as well as penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier. The excellent biocompatibility further guarantees the potential of natural polyphenolic nanodots for clinical applications. It is expected that natural polyphenolic nanodots provide an attractive paradigm to support the development of the therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease.

A 2D van der Waals heterostructure&#8208;based multifunctional floating gate memory device is fabricated, which exhibits superior nonvolatile electronic/optoelectronic memory behaviors when subjected to intense stimuli and volatile memory behaviors after weakening the input stimuli.

Abstract
The demand for economical and efficient data processing has led to a surge of interest in neuromorphic computing based on emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials in recent years. As a rising van der Waals (vdW) p&#8208;type Weyl semiconductor with many intriguing properties, tellurium (Te) has been widely used in advanced electronics/optoelectronics. However, its application in floating gate (FG) memory devices for information processing has never been explored. Herein, an electronic/optoelectronic FG memory device enabled by Te&#8208;based 2D vdW heterostructure for multimodal reservoir computing (RC) is reported. When subjected to intense electrical/optical stimuli, the device exhibits impressive nonvolatile electronic memory behaviors including &#8776;108 extinction ratio, &#8776;100 ns switching speed, &gt;4000 cycles, &gt;4000&#8208;s retention stability, and nonvolatile multibit optoelectronic programmable characteristics. When the input stimuli weaken, the nonvolatile memory degrades into volatile memory. Leveraging these rich nonlinear dynamics, a multimodal RC system with high recognition accuracy of 90.77% for event&#8208;type multimodal handwritten digit&#8208;recognition is demonstrated.

         <title>Electrochemical and Biocatalytic Signal&#8208;Controlled Payload Release from a Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), ZIF&#8208;8, which is stable at neutral pH in aqueous solutions and dissolves under acidic conditions, is loaded with a fluorescent dye as a model payload species. The pH is decreased by electrochemical or biocatalytic reactions resulting in the MOF dissolution and the payload release. The studied systems represent signal&#8208;responding materials for delivering (bio)molecules within biomedical applications.








Abstract
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), ZIF&#8208;8, which is stable at neutral and slightly basic pH values in aqueous solutions and destabilized/dissolved under acidic conditions, is loaded with a pH&#8208;insensitive fluorescent dye, rhodamine&#8208;B isothiocyanate, as a model payload species. Then, the MOF species are immobilized at an electrode surface. The local (interfacial) pH value is rapidly decreased by means of an electrochemically stimulated ascorbate oxidation at +0.4&#160;V (Ag/AgCl/KCl). Oxygen reduction upon switching the applied potential to &#8722;0.8&#160;V allows to return the local pH to the neutral/basic pH, then stopping rapidly the release process. The developed method allows electrochemical control over stimulated or inhibited payload release processes from the MOF. The pH variation proceeds in a thin film of the solution near the electrode surface. The switchable release process is realized in a buffer solution and undiluted human serum. As the second option, the pH decrease stimulating the release process is achieved upon an enzymatic reaction using esterase and ester substrate. This approach potentially allows the release activation controlled by numerous enzymes assembled in complex biocatalytic cascades. It is expected that related electrochemical or biocatalytic systems can represent novel signal&#8208;responding materials with switchable features for delivering (bio)molecules within biomedical applications.

         <title>Simultaneous Enhancement of Efficiency and Operational&#8208;Stability of Mesoscopic Perovskite Solar Cells via Interfacial Toughening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of a self&#8208;assembled monolayer at the interface in mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) results in simultaneous enhancement of mechanical reliability, operational&#8208;stability, and power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE). Threefold increase in the interfacial toughness in a PSC with PCE of over 24% is responsible for T80 (duration at 80% initial PCE retained) of &#8776;18&#160;000&#160;h. Possible underlying mechanisms are elucidated.








Abstract
The combined effects of compact TiO2 (c&#8208;TiO2) electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) are investigated without and with mesoscopic TiO2 (m&#8208;TiO2) on top, and without and with an iodine&#8208;terminated silane self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM), on the mechanical behavior, opto&#8211;electronic properties, photovoltaic (PV) performance, and operational&#8208;stability of solar cells based on metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHPs). The interfacial toughness increases almost threefold in going from c&#8208;TiO2 without SAM to m&#8208;TiO2 with SAM. This is attributed to the synergistic effect of the m&#8208;TiO2/MHP nanocomposite at the interface and the enhanced adhesion afforded by the iodine&#8208;terminated silane SAM. The combination of m&#8208;TiO2 and SAM also offers a significant beneficial effect on the photocarriers extraction at the ETL/MHP interface, resulting in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 24% and 20% for 0.1 and 1&#160;cm2 active areas, respectively. These PSCs also have exceptionally long operational&#8208;stability lives: extrapolated T80 (duration at 80% initial PCE retained) is &#8776;18&#160;000 and 10&#160;000&#160;h for 0.1 and 1&#160;cm2 active areas, respectively. Postmortem characterization and analyses of the operational&#8208;stability&#8208;tested PSCs are performed to elucidate the possible mechanisms responsible for the long operational&#8208;stability.

         <title>Advancements of Intense Terahertz Field Focusing on Metallic Nanoarchitectures for Monitoring Hidden Interatomic Gas&#8208;Matter Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed terahertz (THz) methodology enables the real&#8208;time tracking of interatomic and interfacial gas&#8208;matter interactions, gas adsorption, hydrogenation, metal phase changes, and water&#8208;forming reactions in the resonance frequency and transmittance domains. Robust THz nanoscopic probes reveal the underlying pathway and lattice dynamics inside the hidden stage of palladium during hydrogen/oxygen exposure and the subsequent catalytic reaction.








Abstract
With the advancements of nanotechnology, innovative photonic designs coupled with functional materials provide a unique way to acquire, share, and respond effectively to information. It is found that the simple deposition of a 30&#160;nm&#8208;thick palladium nanofilm on a terahertz (THz) metasurface chip with a 14&#160;nm&#8208;wide effective nanogap of asymmetric materials and geometries allows the tracking of both interatomic and interfacial gas&#8211;matter interactions, including gas adsorption, hydrogenation (or dehydrogenation), metal phase changes, and unique water&#8208;forming reactions. Combinatorial analyses by simulation and experimental measurements demonstrate the distinct nanostructures, which leads to significant light&#8208;matter interactions and corresponding THz absorption in a real&#8208;time, highly repeatable, and reliable manner. The complex lattice dynamics and intrinsic properties of metals influenced by hydrogen gas exposure are also thoroughly examined using systematically controlled ternary gas mixture devices that mimic normal temperature and pressure. Furthermore, the novel degrees of freedom are utilized to analyze various physical phenomena, and thus, analytical methods that enable the tracking of unknown hidden stages of water&#8208;forming reactions resulting in water growth are introduced. A single exposure of the wave spectrum emphasizes the robustness of the proposed THz nanoscopic probe, bridging the gap between fundamental laboratory research and industry.

         <title>Nonreciprocal Heat Circulation Metadevices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Having developed a comprehensive thermal scattering theory that describes the nonreciprocal transmission properties of temperature field effectively, a metadevice that supports both dynamic and steady&#8208;state nonreciprocal heat transfer is created. It uncovers the unique multiple&#8208;scattering effect at steady state, which is anticipated to lead to intriguing applications in thermal energy utilization and thermal information processing.








Abstract
Thermal nonreciprocity typically stems from nonlinearity or spatiotemporal variation of parameters. However, constrained by the inherent temperature&#8208;dependent properties and the law of mass conservation, previous works have been compelled to treat dynamic and steady&#8208;state cases separately. Here, by establishing a unified thermal scattering theory, the creation of a convection&#8208;based thermal metadevice which supports both dynamic and steady&#8208;state nonreciprocal heat circulation is reported. The nontrivial dependence between the nonreciprocal resonance peaks and the dynamic parameters is observed and the unique nonreciprocal mechanism of multiple scattering is revealed at steady state. This mechanism enables thermal nonreciprocity in the initially quasi&#8208;symmetric scattering matrix of the three&#8208;port metadevice and has been experimentally validated with a significant isolation ratio of heat fluxes. The findings establish a framework for thermal nonreciprocity that can be smoothly modulated for dynamic and steady&#8208;state heat signals, it may also offer insight into other heat&#8208;transfer&#8208;related problems or even other fields such as acoustics and mechanics.

&lt;p&gt;Having developed a comprehensive thermal scattering theory that describes the nonreciprocal transmission properties of temperature field effectively, a metadevice that supports both dynamic and steady-state nonreciprocal heat transfer is created. It uncovers the unique multiple-scattering effect at steady state, which is anticipated to lead to intriguing applications in thermal energy utilization and thermal information processing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermal nonreciprocity typically stems from nonlinearity or spatiotemporal variation of parameters. However, constrained by the inherent temperature-dependent properties and the law of mass conservation, previous works have been compelled to treat dynamic and steady-state cases separately. Here, by establishing a unified thermal scattering theory, the creation of a convection-based thermal metadevice which supports both dynamic and steady-state nonreciprocal heat circulation is reported. The nontrivial dependence between the nonreciprocal resonance peaks and the dynamic parameters is observed and the unique nonreciprocal mechanism of multiple scattering is revealed at steady state. This mechanism enables thermal nonreciprocity in the initially quasi-symmetric scattering matrix of the three-port metadevice and has been experimentally validated with a significant isolation ratio of heat fluxes. The findings establish a framework for thermal nonreciprocity that can be smoothly modulated for dynamic and steady-state heat signals, it may also offer insight into other heat-transfer-related problems or even other fields such as acoustics and mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Photothermal Anti&#8208;/Deicing Enabled by 3D Cu2&#8208;xS Encapsulated Phase Change Materials Mixed Superhydrophobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs) with Cu2&#8208;xS shells are designed to realize LSPR modulation. The MPCMs possess full&#8208;spectrum absorption, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and thermal storage capacity. Based on MPCMs, a multifunctional photothermal phase&#8208;change superhydrophobic composite coating is developed to achieve efficient anti&#8208;/deicing. The MPCMs and composite coatings provide a promising strategy for solar energy utilization and advanced anti&#8208;/deicing applications.








Abstract
Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces are one of the most promising anti&#8208;/deicing materials, yet they are limited by the low energy density and intermittent nature of solar energy. Here, a coupling solution based on microencapsulated phase change materials (MPCMs) that integrates photothermal effect and phase change thermal storage is proposed. Dual&#8208;shell octahedral MPCMs with Cu2O as the first layer and 3D Cu2&#8208;xS as the second layer for the first time is designed. By morphology and phase manipulation of the Cu2&#8208;xS shell, the local surface plasmonic heating modulation of MPCMs is realized, and the MPCM reveals full&#8208;spectrum high absorption with a photothermal conversion efficiency up to 96.1%. The phase change temperature and enthalpy remain in good consistency after 200 cycles. Multifunctional photothermal phase&#8208;change superhydrophobic composite coatings are fabricated by combining the hydrolyzed and polycondensation products of octadecyl trichlorosilane and the dual&#8208;shell MPCM. The multifunctional coatings exhibit excellent anti&#8208;/deicing performance under low temperature and high humidity conditions. This work not only provides a new approach for the design of high&#8208;performance MPCMs but also opens up an avenue for the anti&#8208;icing application of photothermal phase&#8208;change superhydrophobic composite coatings.

         <title>Intestine&#8208;Targeted Explosive Hydrogel Microsphere Promotes Uric Acid Excretion for Gout Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microspheres achieve a slow release of uricase in the small intestine, where dopamine undergoes an in situ&#160;polymerization reaction mucosa, significantly upregulating the uric acid transporter protein of epithelial cells. A&#160;unique induction pathway is developed through in situ modulation of intestinal mucosal layer, enabling efficient intestinal excretion of uric acid for gout therapy.








Abstract
Uric acid metabolism disorder triggers metabolic diseases, especially gout. However, increasing uric acid excretion remains a challenge. Here, an accelerative uric acid excretion pathway via an oral intestine&#8208;explosive hydrogel microsphere merely containing uricase and dopamine is reported. After oral administration, uricase is exposed and immobilized on intestinal mucosa along with an in situ dopamine polymerization via a cascade reaction triggered by the intestinal specific environment. By this means, trace amount of uricase is required to in situ up&#8208;regulate uric acid transporter proteins of intestinal epithelial cells, causing accelerated intestinal uric acid excretion. From in vitro data, the uric acid in fecal samples from gout patients could be significantly reduced by up to 37% by the mimic mucosa&#8208;immobilized uricase on the isolated porcine tissues. Both hyperuricemia and acute gouty arthritis in vivo mouse models confirm the uric acid excretion efficacy of intestine&#8208;explosive hydrogel microspheres. Fecal uric acid excretion is increased around 30% and blood uric acid is reduced more than 70%. In addition, 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing showed that the microspheres optimized intestinal flora composition as well. In conclusion, a unique pathway via the intestine in situ regulation to realize an efficient uric acid intestinal excretion for gout therapy is developed.

         <title>Selective Control of Phases and Electronic Structures of Monolayer TaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer 1H and 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films are selectively grown by varying the substrate temperature, and a new 2 &#215; 2 superstructure is observed upon further annealing the 1H films, leading to gap opening up to room temperature as revealed by photoemission measurements. This work demonstrates the selective control of phases and electronic structures of monolayer TaTe2 film.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) films exhibit rich phases and superstructures, which can be controlled by the growth conditions as well as post&#8208;growth annealing treatment. Here, the selective growth of monolayer TaTe2 films with different phases as well as superstructures using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is reported. Monolayer 1H&#8208;TaTe2 and 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films can be selectively controlled by varying the growth temperature, and their different electronic structures are revealed through the combination of angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements (ARPES) and first&#8208;principles calculations. Moreover, post&#8208;growth annealing of the 1H&#8208;TaTe2 film further leads to a transition from a 19&#215;19$\sqrt {19}{\times }\sqrt {19}$ superstructure to a new 2 &#215; 2 superstructure, where two gaps are observed in the electronic structure and persist up to room temperature. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal the role of the phonon instability in the formation of superstructures and the effect of local atomic distortions on the modified electronic structures. This work demonstrates the manipulation of the rich phases and superstructures of monolayer TaTe2 films by controlling the growth kinetics and post&#8208;growth&#160;annealing.

         <title>Robust Photothermal Icephobic Surface with Mechanical Durability of Multi&#8208;Bioinspired Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;bioinspired structured microspine array inspired by honeycomb and cactus thorn (i.e., MAHC) with the characterization of mechanical durability achieves robust photothermal icephobicity in cold or low&#8208;temperature environments with potentially intense abrasion, which can be applied on curvature surface (e.g., copper alloy transmission line) of overhead high&#8208;speed rail and trains in transportation fields.








Abstract
Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces are potential to become ideal anti&#8208;/deicing surfaces due to their rapid water removal, icing delay, and photothermal deicing performance. Here, a robust photothermal icephobic surface with mechanical durability is shown that is integrated with a microspine array inspired by honeycomb and cactus thorn (i.e., MAHC), which is developed by a laser&#8208;layered microfabrication strategy. The maximum stress on the microspine of the MAHC is reduced by &#8776;2/3, due to the protection of the bionic honeycomb structure. Even after 200 linear abrasions by a steel blade, the MAHC remains superior water repellency with a water contact angle of 150.7&#176; and roll&#8208;off angles of 10.3&#176;, stable icing delay time (578.2 s), and rapidly photothermal deicing capabilities (401 s). As the MAHC is fabricated on a curvature surface such as a copper alloy transmission line for an overhead high&#8208;speed rail, a stable photothermal anti&#8208;/deicing in a low&#8208;temperature environment still can be achieved effectively. The freezing rain covering the functional transmission line completely slides off within 758 s under one sun illumination. This studying offers insight into the design of novel materials with stable anti&#8208;icing/icephobic structures, which would be extended into some applied realms, for example, transportation fields or power systems in cold or low&#8208;temperature climates.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Casting Strategy Empowers High&#8208;Boiling Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with Over 18.5% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hot&#8208;casting strategy assists in the fast and synchronous molecular assembly in the active layer, which contributes to preferable vertical phase separation, donor/acceptor ratio, and molecular stacking. The profitable morphology is beneficial to charge generation and extraction, leading to top&#8208;ranked device efficiencies based on different matrixes and high&#8208;boiling solvents.








Abstract
Most top&#8208;rank organic solar cells (OSCs) are manufactured by the halogenated solvent chloroform, which possesses a narrow processing window due to its low&#8208;boiling point. Herein, based on two high&#8208;boiling solvents, halogenated solvent chlorobenzene (CB) and non&#8208;halogenated green solvent ortho&#8208;xylene (OX), preparing active layers with the hot solution is put forward to enhance the performance of the OSCs. In situ test and morphological characterization clarify that the hot&#8208;casting strategy assists in the fast and synchronous molecular assembly of both donor and acceptor in the active layer, contributing to preferable donor/acceptor ratio, vertical phase separation, and molecular stacking, which is beneficial to charge generation and extraction. Based on the PM6:BO&#8208;4Cl, the hot&#8208;casting OSCs with a wide processing window achieve efficiencies of 18.03% in CB and 18.12% in OX, which are much higher than the devices processed with room temperature solution. Moreover, the hot&#8208;casting devices with PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 deliver a remarkable fill factor&#160;of 80.31% and efficiency&#160;of 18.52% in OX, representing the record value among binary devices with green solvent. This work demonstrates a facile strategy to manipulate the molecular distribution and arrangement for boosting the efficiency of OSCs with high&#8208;boiling solvents.

         <title>A Novel Superparamagnetic Multifunctional Nerve Scaffold: A Remote Actuation Strategy to Boost In Situ Extracellular Vesicles Production for Enhanced Peripheral Nerve Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Mag&#8208;gel with applied rotating magnetic field (RMF) serves as a mechano&#8208;stimulative platform to exert micro/nanoscale forces to nearby Schwann cells, which can subsequently scale up local extracellular vesicles (EVs)&#160;production both in vitro and in vivo. As a non&#8208;invasive strategy, application of an RMF to manipulate the local EVs production via the Mag&#8208;gel offers a remote time&#8208;scheduled approach to optimize the process of peripheral nerve regeneration.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have inherent advantages over cell&#8208;based therapies in regenerative medicine because of their cargos of abundant bioactive cues. Several strategies are proposed to tune EVs production in vitro. However, it remains a challenge for manipulation of EVs production in vivo, which poses significant difficulties for EVs&#8208;based therapies that aim to promote tissue regeneration, particularly for long&#8208;term treatment of diseases like peripheral neuropathy. Herein, a superparamagnetic nanocomposite scaffold capable of controlling EVs production on&#8208;demand is constructed by incorporating polyethyleneglycol/polyethyleneimine modified superparamagnetic nanoparticles into a polyacrylamide/hyaluronic acid double&#8208;network hydrogel (Mag&#8208;gel). The Mag&#8208;gel is highly sensitive to a rotating magnetic field (RMF), and can act as mechano&#8208;stimulative platform to exert micro/nanoscale forces on encapsulated Schwann cells (SCs), an essential glial cell in supporting nerve regeneration. By switching the ON/OFF state of the RMF, the Mag&#8208;gel can scale up local production of SCs&#8208;derived EVs (SCs&#8208;EVs) both in vitro and in vivo. Further transcriptome sequencing indicates an enrichment of transcripts favorable in axon growth, angiogenesis, and inflammatory regulation of SCs&#8208;EVs in the Mag&#8208;gel with RMF, which ultimately results in optimized nerve repair in vivo. Overall, this research provides a noninvasive and remotely time&#8208;scheduled method for fine&#8208;tuning EVs&#8208;based therapies to accelerate tissue regeneration, including that of peripheral nerves.

         <title>Electron Oscillation&#8208;Induced Splitting Electroluminescence from Nano&#8208;LEDs&#160;for Device&#8208;Level Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasimple nanoscale light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) based on a three&#8208;dimensional confined electron system is demonstrated. By employing the non&#8208;carrier injection nano LED (NCI&#8208;nLED), a device&#8208;level encryption is proposed, in which multiple pulses acts as carriers for transmitted digital information, providing an alternative encryption platform and method for converting digital signals to optical signals.








Abstract
Data security is a major concern in digital age, which generally relies on algorithm&#8208;based mathematical encryption. Recently, encryption techniques based on physical principles are emerging and being developed, leading to the new generation of encryption moving from mathematics to the intersection of mathematics and physics. Here, device&#8208;level encryption with ideal security is ingeniously achieved using modulation of the electron&#8211;hole radiative recombination in a GaN&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode (LED). When a nano&#8208;LED is driven in the non&#8208;carrier injection mode, the oscillation of confined electrons can split what should be a single light pulse into multiple pulses. The morphology (amplitude, shape, and pulse number) of those history&#8208;dependent multiple pulses that act as carriers for transmitted digital information depends highly on the parameters of the driving signals, which makes those signals mathematically uncrackable and can increase the volume and security of transmitted information. Moreover, a hardware and software platform are designed to demonstrate the encrypted data transmission based on the device&#8208;level encryption method, enabling recognition of the entire ASCII code table. The device&#8208;level encryption based on splitting electroluminescence provides an encryption method during the conversion process of digital signals to optical signals and can improve the security of LED&#8208;based communication.

         <title>Simultaneous Catalytic Acceleration of White Phosphorus Polymerization and Red Phosphorus Potassiation for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of I2 can simultaneously catalyze the acceleration of white phosphorus polymerization and enhance red phosphorus potassiation for high&#8208;performance potassium&#8208;ion batteries. The P/C composites with an I2 catalyst deliver excellent cycling stability (358&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and excellent rate performance (200&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Red phosphorus (P) as an anode material of potassium&#8208;ion batteries possesses ultra&#8208;high theoretical specific capacity (1154&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). However, owing to residual white P during the preparation and sluggish kinetics of K&#8208;P alloying limit its practical application. Seeking an efficient catalyst to address the above problems is crucial for the secure preparation of red P anode with high performance. Herein, through the analysis of the activation energies in white P polymerization, it is revealed that the highest occupied molecular orbital energy of I2 (&#8722;7.40&#160;eV) is in proximity to P4 (&#8722;7.25&#160;eV), and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy of I2 molecule (&#8722;4.20&#160;eV) is lower than that of other common non&#8208;metallic molecules (N2, S8, Se8, F2, Cl2, Br2). The introduction of I2 can thus promote the breaking of the P&#9472;P bond and accelerate the polymerization of white P molecules. Besides, the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations show that I2 can enhance the kinetics of P&#8208;K alloying. The as&#8208;obtained red P/C composites with I2 deliver excellent cycling stability (358&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1). This study establishes catalysis as a promising pathway to tackle the challenges of P anode for alkali metal ion batteries.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Materials Based on a Functional Unit Combination Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional unit combination strategy is developed to fabricate purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials. In this strategy, the folding units are responsible for spin&#8211;orbit coupling enhancement while diverse luminescent core units contribute to tunable color/lifetime, which facilitates the construction of a series of new molecules with high&#8208;efficiency, color/lifetime&#8208;tunable, and photo&#8208;responsive dynamic RTP.








Abstract
A rational molecular design strategy facilitates the development of a purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) material system with precisely regulated luminescence properties, which surely promotes its functional integration and intelligent application. Here, a functional unit combination strategy is proposed to design novel RTP molecules combining a folding unit with diverse luminescent cores. The different luminescent cores are mainly responsible for tunable RTP properties, while the folding unit contributes to the spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC) enhancement, which makes the RTP material design as workable as the building block principle. By this strategy, a series of color/lifetime&#8208;tunable RTP materials is achieved with unique photo&#8208;responsive RTP enhancement when subjected to UV irradiation, which expands their application scenarios in reusable privacy tags, advanced &#8220;4D&#8221; encryption, and phase separation analysis of blended polymers. This work suggests a simple and effective strategy to design purely organic RTP materials with tunable color and lifetime, and also provides new application options for photo&#8208;responsive dynamic RTP materials.

         <title>18.6% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by a Wide Bandgap Polymer Donor Based on Benzo[1,2&#8208;d:4,5&#8208;d&#8242;]bisthiazole</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide bandgap polymer donor based on benzobisthiazole is designed with deep energy level, high planar structure, and good crystallinity, which endows the good complementary absorption, energy level match, and fibril&#8208;like morphology with polymer acceptors, and thus realizes high power conversion efficiencies of 17.15% and 18.60% in the binary and ternary blend all&#8208;polymer solar cells.








Abstract
The limited selection of wide bandgap polymer donors for all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) is a bottleneck problem restricting their further development and remains poorly studied. Herein, a new wide bandgap polymer, namely PBBTz&#8208;Cl, is designed and synthesized by bridging the benzobisthiazole acceptor block and chlorinated benzodithiophene donor block with thiophene units for application as an electron donor in all&#8208;PSCs. PBBTz&#8208;Cl not only possesses wide bandgap and deep energy levels but also displays strong absorption, high&#8208;planar structure, and good crystallinity, making it a promising candidate for application as a polymer donor in organic solar cells. When paired with the narrow bandgap polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT, a fibril&#8208;like morphology forms, which facilitates exciton dissociation and charge transport, contributing to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.15% of the corresponding all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, when introducing another crystalline polymer acceptor BTP&#8208;2T2F into the PBBTz&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT host blend, the absorption ditch in the range of 600&#8211;750&#160;nm is filled, and the blend morphology is further optimized with the trap density reducing. As a result, the ternary blend all&#8208;PSCs achieve a significantly improved PCE of 18.60%, which is among the highest values for all&#8208;PSCs to date.

         <title>A Universal Strategy for Synthesis of 2D Ternary Transition Metal Phosphorous Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controllable synthesis of transition metal phosphorous chalcogenides (TMPCs) based on subtracting elements mechanism is reported. Among them, the SnPS3 exhibits effective nonlinear susceptibility &#967;(2) of 8.41&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;11&#160;m&#160;V&#8722;1. The CdPSe3 photodetector displays high responsivity (582&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1) and detectivity (3.19&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;Jones). This research will pave the way for exploration of ternary TMPCs in optical and photoelectric detection.








Abstract
The 2D ternary transition metal phosphorous chalcogenides (TMPCs) have attracted extensive research interest due to their widely tunable band gap, rich electronic properties, inherent magnetic and ferroelectric properties. However, the synthesis of TMPCs via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is still challenging since it is difficult to control reactions among multi&#8208;precursors. Here, a subtractive element growth mechanism is proposed to controllably synthesize the TMPCs. Based on the growth mechanism, the TMPCs including FePS3, FePSe3, MnPS3, MnPSe3, CdPS3, CdPSe3, In2P3S9, and SnPS3 are achieved successfully and further confirmed by Raman, second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The typical TMPCs&#8211;SnPS3 shows a strong SHG signal at 1064&#160;nm, with an effective nonlinear susceptibility &#967;(2) of 8.41&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;11&#160;m&#160;V&#8722;1, which is about 8 times of that in MoS2. And the photodetector based on CdPSe3 exhibits superior detection performances with responsivity of 582&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1, high detectivity of 3.19&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;Jones, and fast rise time of 611&#160;&#181;s, which is better than most previously reported TMPCs&#8208;based photodetectors. These results demonstrate the high quality of TMPCs and promote the exploration of the optical properties of 2D TMPCs for their applications in optoelectronics.

         <title>Cd&#8208;Free Pure Sulfide Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 Solar Cell with Over 800&#160;mV Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Enabled by Phase Evolution Intervention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ge cap layer is applied atop the Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) precursor to enable phase evolution intervention during sulfurization. It defers the crystallization of CZTS to higher temperatures, thereby reducing grain boundaries and enhancing crystallinity in the final CZTS film. With this strategy, an exceptional open&#8208;circuit voltage exceeding 800 mV and a champion efficiency of 10.7% Cd&#8208;free CZTS solar cells are demonstrated.








Abstract
The Cd&#8208;free Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) solar cell is an ideal candidate for producing low&#8208;cost clean energy through green materials owing to its inherent environmental friendliness and earth abundance. Nevertheless, sulfide CZTS has long suffered from severe open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficits, limiting the full exploitation of performance potential and further progress. Here, an effective strategy is proposed to alleviate the nonradiative VOC loss by manipulating the phase evolution during the critical kesterite phase formation stage. With a Ge cap layer on the precursor, premature CZTS grain formation is suppressed at low temperatures, leading to fewer nucleation centers at the initial crystallization stage. Consequently, the CZTS grain formation and crystallization are deferred to high temperatures, resulting in enhanced grain interior quality and less unfavorable grain boundaries in the final film. As a result, a champion efficiency of 10.7% for Cd&#8208;free CZTS solar cells with remarkably high VOC beyond 800&#160;mV (63.2% Schockley&#8211;Queisser limit) is realized, indicating that nonradiative recombination is effectively inhibited. This strategy may advance other compound semiconductors seeking high&#8208;quality crystallization.

         <title>Synthesis of Ultra&#8208;Incompressible and Recoverable Carbon Nitrides Featuring CN4 Tetrahedra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully saturated polymeric carbon nitrides are one of the holy grails of material sciences due to their expected exceptional superhardness. Here, the high&#8208;pressure synthesis of three novel carbon nitrides comprised of corner&#8208;sharing CN4 tetrahedra is reported. They are recoverable to ambient conditions and stable in air, feature ultra&#8208;incompressibility, superhardness, and other attractive properties such as piezoelectricity and fluorescence.








Abstract
Carbon nitrides featuring three&#8208;dimensional frameworks of CN4 tetrahedra are one of the great aspirations of materials science, expected to have a hardness greater than or comparable to diamond. After more than three decades of efforts to synthesize them, no unambiguous evidence of their existence has been delivered. Here, the high&#8208;pressure high&#8208;temperature synthesis of three carbon&#8211;nitrogen compounds, tI14&#8208;C3N4, hP126&#8208;C3N4, and tI24&#8208;CN2, in laser&#8208;heated diamond anvil cells, is reported. Their structures are solved and refined using synchrotron single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction. Physical properties investigations show that these strongly covalently bonded materials, ultra&#8208;incompressible and superhard, also possess high energy density, piezoelectric, and photoluminescence properties. The novel carbon nitrides are unique among high&#8208;pressure materials, as being produced above 100&#160;GPa they are recoverable in air at ambient conditions.

Zinc Anodes
As the world seeks alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries, rechargeable zinc&#8208;based batteries emerge as a promising alternative due to their low cost, abundance, and safety. Their adoption, however, is limited by low efficiency and dendritic growth issues. In article number 2306145, Richard B. Kaner and co&#8208;workers introduce a zinc&#8208;coordinated interphase that enhances stability and prevents dendrites, significantly improving battery performance and lifespan. This innovation paves the way for zinc batteries as a more practical and sustainable option for energy storage.

Next&#8208;Generation Photodetectors
The van der Waals junction, which is newly flourishing, shows extraordinary performance and versatile manipulation routes. In article number 2301197, Weida Hu and co&#8208;workers systematically review most manipulation mechanisms for van der Waals junctions, which could potentially catch the opportunities in next&#8208;generation photodetectors toward ultrasensitivity, multidimensions, large&#8208;area arrays, and more intelligent integration.

Gas Sensing
Light&#8208;assisted investigation of gas&#8211;matter interactions have been regarded challenging area of study. A real&#8208;time and highly reliable gas&#8208;molecule&#8208;sensing scheme, employing an asymmetric nanogap architecture with distinct compositional metals, allows the study of nanoscale gas dynamics and water forming. Maximized light absorption and an enhanced terahertz field are realized, opening up new routes for analyzing molecular dynamics behavior. More details can be found in article number 2308975 by Yong&#8208;Sang Ryu, Minah Seo, and co&#8208;workers.

MXenes
In article number 2305183, Se&#8208;Ho Kim, Baptiste Gault, and co&#8208;workers report how impurities are detected on MXenes by careful nanoscale compositional mapping via atom probe tomography. The impurities remain attached upon oxidation of the MXene sheets that roll upon themselves. The presence of these impurities has often been overlooked, but is poised to play a role on the activity and stability of MXenes.

         <dc:description>
Powered by flagella beating, functionalized microalgae robots are demonstrated to move through various biological fluids, water matrices and harsh environments, while performing diverse tasks toward critical biomedical and environmental applications. This review introduces the design, preparation, fabrication, unique functions and latest progress and applications of microalgae&#8208;based biohybrid microrobots, leveraging the attractive self&#8208;propulsion capability of natural microalgae and the versatile modalities of functional materials.








Abstract
The integration of microorganisms and engineered artificial components has shown considerable promise for creating biohybrid microrobots. The unique features of microalgae make them attractive candidates as natural actuation materials for the design of biohybrid microrobotic systems. In this review, microalgae&#8208;based biohybrid microrobots are introduced for diverse biomedical and environmental applications. The distinct propulsion and phototaxis behaviors of green microalgae, as well as important properties from other photosynthetic microalga systems (blue&#8208;green algae and diatom) that are crucial to constructing powerful biohybrid microrobots, will be described first. Then the focus is on chemical and physical routes for functionalizing the algae surface with diverse reactive materials toward the fabrication of advanced biohybrid microalgae robots. Finally, representative applications of such algae&#8208;driven microrobots are presented, including drug delivery, imaging, and water decontamination, highlighting the distinct advantages of these active biohybrid robots, along with future prospects and challenges.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Based Bioaffinity Assays: From the Research Laboratory to the Market</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically discusses advances in nanoparticle&#8208;based labels (yellow) combined with biorecognition elements (green) and suitable readout schemes for the design of new bioaffinity assays. The route of nanoparticle&#8208;based assays from the bench to real sample analysis and commercialization follows a rugged path winding between many challenges and benefits.








Abstract
Advances in the development of new biorecognition elements, nanoparticle&#8208;based labels as well as instrumentation have inspired the design of new bioaffinity assays. This review critically discusses the potential of nanoparticles to replace current enzymatic or molecular labels in immunoassays and other bioaffinity assays. Successful implementations of nanoparticles in commercial assays and the need for rapid tests incorporating nanoparticles in different roles such as capture support, signal generation elements, and signal amplification systems are highlighted. The limited number of nanoparticles applied in current commercial assays can be explained by challenges associated with the analysis of real samples (e.g., blood, urine, or nasal swabs) that are difficult to resolve, particularly if the same performance can be achieved more easily by conventional labels. Lateral flow assays that are based on the visual detection of the red&#8208;colored line formed by colloidal gold are a notable exception, exemplified by SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 rapid antigen tests that have moved from initial laboratory testing to widespread market adaption in less than two years.

         <title>Comprehensive Understandings of Hydrogen Bond Chemistry in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review is provided on the application and key factors of hydrogen bond chemistry in various aqueous batteries, encompassing electrode materials, electrolytes, separators, and binders. Accurate insights are presented to utilize hydrogen bond chemistry in order to address a range of key factors that hinder electrochemical performance, aiming to drive the progress of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous batteries are emerging as highly promising contenders for large&#8208;scale grid energy storage because of uncomplicated assembly, exceptional safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. The unique aqueous electrolyte with a rich hydrogen bond (HB) environment inevitably has a significant impact on the electrode materials and electrochemical processes. While numerous reviews have focused on the materials design and assembly of aqueous batteries, the utilization of HB chemistry is overlooked. Herein, instead of merely compiling recent advancements, this review presents a comprehensive summary and analysis of the profound implication exerted by HB on all components of the aqueous batteries. Intricate links between the novel HB chemistry and various aqueous batteries are ingeniously constructed within the critical aspects, such as self&#8208;discharge, structural stability of electrode materials, pulverization, solvation structures, charge carrier diffusion, corrosion reactions, pH sensitivity, water splitting, polysulfides shuttle, and H2S evolution. By adopting a vantage point that encompasses material design, binder and separator functionalization, electrolyte regulation, and HB optimization, a critical examination of the key factors that impede electrochemical performance in diverse aqueous batteries is conducted. Finally, insights are rendered properly based on HB chemistry, with the aim of propelling the advancement of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aqueous batteries.

         <title>Nanomedicine Combats Drug Resistance in Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the discovered drug resistance mechanisms for lung cancer chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy are introduced. Recent advances of organic, inorganic, and bio&#8208;derived nanomedicines for drug&#8208;resistant lung cancer treatment are summarized. The engineering design, customized delivery, current challenges, and clinical translation of nanomedicine for lung cancer are discussed.








Abstract
Lung cancer is the second most prevalent cancer and the leading cause of cancer&#8208;related death worldwide. Surgery, chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy are currently available as treatment methods. However, drug resistance is a significant factor in the failure of lung cancer treatments. Novel therapeutics have been exploited to address complicated resistance mechanisms of lung cancer and the advancement of nanomedicine is extremely promising in terms of overcoming drug resistance. Nanomedicine equipped with multifunctional and tunable physiochemical properties in alignment with tumor genetic profiles can achieve precise, safe, and effective treatment while minimizing or eradicating drug resistance in cancer. Here, this work reviews the discovered resistance mechanisms for lung cancer chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy, and outlines novel strategies for the development of nanomedicine against drug resistance. This work focuses on engineering design, customized delivery, current challenges, and clinical translation of nanomedicine in the application of resistant lung cancer.

Abstract
Chirality introduces a new dimension of functionality to materials, unlocking new possibilities across various fields. When integrated with plasmonic hybrid nanostructures, this attribute synergizes with plasmonic and other functionalities, resulting in unprecedented chiroptical materials that push the boundaries of the system's capabilities. Recent advancements have illuminated the remarkable chiral light&#8211;matter interactions within chiral plasmonic hybrid nanomaterials, allowing for the harnessing of their tunable optical activity and hybrid components. These advancements have led to applications in areas such as chiral sensing, catalysis, and spin optics. Despite these promising developments, there remains a need for a comprehensive synthesis of the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art knowledge, as well as a thorough understanding of the construction techniques and practical applications in this field. This review begins with an exploration of the origins of plasmonic chirality and an overview of the latest advancements in the synthesis of chiral plasmonic hybrid nanostructures. Furthermore, representative emerging categories of hybrid nanomaterials are classified and summarized, elucidating their versatile applications. Finally, the review engages with the fundamental challenges associated with chiral plasmonic hybrid nanostructures and offer insights into the future prospects of this advanced field.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced approaches to prohibit dendrite growth, suppress side reactions, and promote reaction kinetics of Zn metal anodes are essential for practical Zn metal batteries. In this review, the effects of electrical&#8208;related electrostatic interaction and electrical field regulation on the Zn2+ ions migration and deposition behavior in aqueous Zn metal batteries, with an emphasis on the challenges and prospects, are summarized.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are considered as competitive candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their excellent safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the inevitable dendrite growth, severe hydrogen evolution, surface passivation, and sluggish reaction kinetics of Zn metal anodes hinder the practical application of Zn metal batteries. Detailed summaries and prospects have been reported focusing on the research progress and challenges of Zn metal anodes, including electrolyte engineering, electrode structure design, and surface modification. However, the essential electrical mechanisms that significantly influence Zn2+ ions migration and deposition behaviors have not been reviewed yet. Herein, in this review, the regulation mechanisms of electrical&#8208;related electrostatic repulsive/attractive interactions on Zn2+ ions migration, desolvation, and deposition behaviors are systematically discussed. Meanwhile, electric field regulation strategies to promote the Zn2+ ions diffusion and uniform Zn deposition are comprehensively reviewed, including enhancing and homogenizing electric field intensity inside the batteries and adding external magnetic/pressure/thermal field to couple with the electric field. Finally, future perspectives on the research directions of the electrical&#8208;related strategies for building better Zn metal batteries in practical applications are offered.

         <title>Next&#8208;Generation Photodetectors beyond Van Der Waals Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines a unique category of van der Waals materials that support novel devices for high&#8208;performance detection. Based on the insight into the unique properties of the material systems and the underlying microscopic mechanisms, emerging trends in junction devices are discussed, a new morphology of photodetectors is proposed, and some potential innovative directions in the subject area are suggested.








Abstract
With the continuous advancement of nanofabrication techniques, development of novel materials, and discovery of useful manipulation mechanisms in high&#8208;performance applications, especially photodetectors, the morphology of junction devices and the way junction devices are used are fundamentally revolutionized. Simultaneously, new types of photodetectors that do not rely on any junction, providing a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio and multidimensional modulation, have also emerged. This review outlines a unique category of material systems supporting novel junction devices for high&#8208;performance detection, namely, the van der Waals materials, and systematically discusses new trends in the development of various types of devices beyond junctions. This field is far from mature and there are numerous methods to measure and evaluate photodetectors. Therefore, it is also aimed to provide a solution from the perspective of applications in this review. Finally, based on the insight into the unique properties of the material systems and the underlying microscopic mechanisms, emerging trends in junction devices are discussed, a new morphology of photodetectors is proposed, and some potential innovative directions in the subject area are suggested.

         <title>Emerging Xene&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts: Theory, Synthesis, and Catalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis, precise characterization, and catalytic applications of emerging Xene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations are the focus of this review. It is envisioned that this timely review can shed light on new designs of high&#8208;performance Xene&#8208;related single&#8208;atom nanoplatforms for next&#8208;generation chemical and energy conversion.








Abstract
In recent years, the emergence of novel 2D monoelemental materials (Xenes), e.g., graphdiyne, borophene, phosphorene, antimonene, bismuthene, and stanene, has exhibited unprecedented potentials for their versatile applications as well as addressing new discoveries in fundamental science. Owing to their unique physicochemical, optical, and electronic properties, emerging Xenes have been regarded as promising candidates in the community of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) as single&#8208;atom active sites or support matrixes for significant improvement in intrinsic activity and selectivity. In order to comprehensively understand the relationships between the structure and property of Xene&#8208;based SACs, this review represents a comprehensive summary from theoretical predictions to experimental investigations. Firstly, theoretical calculations regarding both the anchoring of Xene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom active sites on versatile support matrixes and doping/substituting heteroatoms at Xene&#8208;based support matrixes are briefly summarized. Secondly, controlled synthesis and precise characterization are presented for Xene&#8208;based SACs. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities for the development of Xene&#8208;based SACs are highlighted.

         <title>Photochemically Activated 3D Printing Inks: Current Status, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enabling precision control over photochemical reactions is essential for designing advanced photoresists with diverse functionalities. Herein, recent advances in photoresist design for light&#8208;driven 3D printing are evaluated. The discussed photoresists are classified into chemistries that function photoinitiator&#8208;free and those that require a photoinitiator to proceed, enabling a comprehensive understanding of their capabilities, limitations, and realistic possibilities for the near future.








Abstract
3D printing with light is enabled by the photochemistry underpinning it. Without fine control over the ability to photochemically gate covalent bond formation by the light at a certain wavelength and intensity, advanced photoresists with functions spanning from on&#8208;demand degradability, adaptability, rapid printing speeds, and tailored functionality are impossible to design. Herein, recent advances in photoresist design for light&#8208;driven 3D printing applications are critically assessed, and an outlook of the outstanding challenges and opportunities is provided. This is achieved by classing the discussed photoresists in chemistries that function photoinitiator&#8208;free and those that require a photoinitiator to proceed. Such a taxonomy is based on the efficiency with which photons are able to generate covalent bonds, with each concept featuring distinct advantages and drawbacks.

         <title>Atomic Distance Engineering in Metal Catalysts to Regulate Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 3, January 18, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic distance has an important influence on the symmetry and electronic structure of active metal atom. It is classified into three types, namely, the bond length between metal and coordination atom, the distance between single&#8208;atom sites and the arrangement spacing of metal atoms, and their corresponding design strategies and improvement on catalytic performance are systematically summarized and discussed.








Abstract
It is very important to understand the structure&#8211;performance relationship of metal catalysts by adjusting the microstructure of catalysts at the atomic scale. The atomic distance has an essential influence on the composition of the environment of active metal atom, which is a key factor for the design of targeted catalysts with desired function. In this review, we&#160;discuss and summarize strategies for changing the atomic distance from three aspects and relate their effects on the reactivity of catalysts. First, the effects of regulating bond length between metal and coordination atom at one single&#8208;atom site on the catalytic performance are introduced. The bond lengths are affected by the strain effect of the support and high&#8208;shell doping and can evolve during the reaction. Next, the influence of the distance between single&#8208;atom sites on the catalytic performance is discussed. Due to the space matching of adsorption and electron transport, the catalytic performance can be adjusted with the shortening of site distance. In addition, the effect of the arrangement spacing of the surface metal active atoms on the catalytic performance of metal nanocatalysts is studied. Finally, a comprehensive summary and outlook of the relationship between atomic distance and catalytic performance is given.

Abstract
Piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric materials are considered unique biomedical materials due to their dielectric crystals and asymmetric centers that allow them to directly convert various primary forms of energy in the environment, such as sunlight, mechanical energy, and thermal energy, into secondary energy, such as electricity and chemical energy. These materials possess exceptional energy conversion ability and excellent catalytic properties, which have led to their widespread usage within biomedical fields. Numerous biomedical applications have demonstrated great potential with these materials, including disease treatment, biosensors, and tissue engineering. For example, piezoelectric materials are used to stimulate cell growth in bone regeneration, while pyroelectric materials are applied in skin cancer detection and imaging. Ferroelectric materials have even found use in neural implants that record and stimulate electrical activity in the brain. This paper reviews the relationship between ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric effects and the fundamental principles of different catalytic reactions. It also highlights the preparation methods of these three materials and the significant progress made in their biomedical applications. The review concludes by presenting key challenges and future prospects for efficient catalysts based on piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric nanomaterials for biomedical applications.

         <title>Sb&#8208;Doped Cs3TbCl6 Nanocrystals for Highly Efficient Narrow&#8208;Band Green Emission and X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional Sb&#8208;doped lanthanide halide nanocrystals are reported. The origin of the narrower enhanced green PL emission is mainly attributed to highly localized exciton distribution, Cl&#8722;&#8208;Tb3+ charge transition process, and effective thermally activated exciton energy transfer. It indicates that the Sb&#8208;doped nanocrystals serve as a promising nanoscintillator, which has versatile application prospects for lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Metal halide nanocrystals (NCs) with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are desirable for lighting, display, and X&#8208;ray detection. Herein, the novel lanthanide&#8208;based halide NCs are committed to designing and optimizing the optical and scintillating properties, so as to unravel the PL origin, exciton dynamics, and optoelectronic applications. Sb&#8208;doped zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) Cs3TbCl6 NCs exhibit a green emission with a narrow full width of half maximum of 8.6&#160;nm, and the best PLQY of 48.1% is about three times higher than that of undoped NCs. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that 0D crystalline and electronic structures make the exciton highly localized on [TbCl6]3&#8722; octahedron, which boosts the Cl&#8722;&#8208;Tb3+ charge transfer process, thus resulting in bright Tb3+ emission. More importantly, the introduction of Sb3+ not only facilitates the photon absorption transition, but also builds an effective thermally boosting energy transfer channel assisted by [SbCl6]3&#8722;&#8208;induced self&#8208;trapped state, which is responsible for the PL enhancement. The high luminescence efficiency and negligible self&#8208;absorption of the Cs3TbCl6: Sb nanoscintillator enable a more sensitive X&#8208;ray detection response compared with undoped sample. The study opens a new perspective to deeply understand the excited state dynamics of metal halide NCs, which helps to design high&#8208;performance luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <title>GSH/pH Dual Activatable Cross&#8208;linked and Fluorinated PEI for Cancer Gene Therapy Through Endogenous Iron De&#8208;Hijacking and in Situ ROS Amplification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The GSH/pH dual activatable fluorinated PEI system is used to transfect MTS&#8208;KR&#8208;SOD and Cas&#8208;CA IX plasmids into B16&#8208;F10 cancer cells in vitr and in vivo. Decreased intracellular pH caused by the knockdown of CA IX de&#8208;hijacked Fe2+ from ferritin, ignited H2O2 fuel triggered by laser irradiated MTS&#8208;KillerRed&#8208;SOD for enhanced ferroptosis. Thus, achieving cascade&#8208;amplify ROS cytotoxicity by photodynamic&#8208;assisted endogenous chemodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Ferroptosis&#8208;related cancer therapy is limited by insufficient Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pair and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for producing lethal hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH). Although exogenous iron or ROS&#8208;producing drugs can enhance ferroptosis, exploiting endogenous iron (labile iron pool, LIP) stored in ferritin and promoting ROS generation may be safer. Herein, a metal/drug&#8208;free nanomedicine is developed for responsive LIP release and H2O2 generation on the mitochondria membranes, amplifying hydroxyl radical production to enhance ferroptosis&#8208;mediated antitumor effects. A glutathione(GSH)/pH dual activatable fluorinated and cross&#8208;linked polyethyleneimine (PEI) with dialdehyde polyethylene glycol layer nanocomplex loaded with MTS&#8208;KR&#8208;SOD (Mitochondria&#8208;targeting&#8208;sequence&#8208;KillerRed&#8208;Superoxide Dismutase) and CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;CA IX (Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX)) plasmids (FP@MC) are developed for enhanced ferroptosis through endogenous iron de&#8208;hijacking and in situ ROS amplification. Two plasmids are constructed to knockdown CA IX and translate KillerRed&#8208;SOD recombinant protein specifically on mitochondria membranes, respectively. The CA IX knockdown acidifies the intracellular environment, leading the release of LIP from ferritin as a &#8220;flare&#8221; to initiate endogenous chemodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, MTS&#8208;KR&#8208;SOD generates H2O2 when irradiated by a 590&#160;nm laser to assist chemodynamic therapy, leading to ROS amplification for mitochondria damage and lipid peroxide accumulation. The combined therapeutic effects aggravate cancer ferroptosis and suppress tumor growth, providing a new paradigm for amplifying ROS and iron ions to promote ferroptosis&#8208;related cancer therapy.

         <title>Over 18% Efficiency Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 300&#160;nm Thick Active Layer Enabled by an Oligomeric Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) with high thickness tolerance are realized via introducing an oligomer DY&#8208;TF as third component. Upon addition of DY&#8208;TF, the crystallinity of the host blend is improved and a well&#8208;defined morphology with vertical phase separation is formed, yielding an efficiency of 18.23%, which represents the highest efficiency value for 300 nm&#8208;thick OSCs thus far.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency thickness&#8208;insensitive organic solar cells (OSCs) is crucially important for the mass production of solar panels. However, increasing the active layer thickness usually induces a substantial loss in efficiency. Herein, a ternary strategy in which an oligomer DY&#8208;TF is incorporated into PM6:L8&#8208;BO system as a guest component is adopted to break this dilemma. The S&#183;&#183;&#183;F intramolecular noncovalent interactions in the backbone endow DY&#8208;TF with a high planarity. Upon the addition of DY&#8208;TF, the crystallinity of the blend is effectively improved, leading to increased charge carrier mobility, which is highly desirable in the fabrication of thick&#8208;film devices. As a result, thin&#8208;film PM6:L8&#8208;BO:DY&#8208;TF&#8208;based device (110&#160;nm) shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.13%. Impressively, when the active layer thickness increases to 300&#160;nm, an efficiency of 18.23% (certified as 17.8%) is achieved, representing the highest efficiency reported for 300 nm thick OSCs thus far. Additionally, blade&#8208;coated thick device (300&#160;nm) delivers a promising PCE of 17.38%. This work brings new insights into the construction of efficient OSCs with high thickness tolerance, showing great potential for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing of large&#8208;area solar cells.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Multi&#8208;Objective Optimization for Cu&#8211;Sb&#8211;S Photo&#8208;Electrocatalytic Materials&#8217; Discovery</title>

A closed&#8208;loop workflow combining synthesis, deposition, characterization is used to explore Cu&#8211;Sb&#8211;S oxide films for efficient water reduction. The workflow narrows down optimal conditions for high photo&#8208;electrocatalytic activity by optimizing for proxy objectives, including bandgap, Cu1+/Cu ratio, and film uniformity. This results in the successful identification of an optimal material composition through multi&#8208;objective constrained optimization techniques.








Abstract
Copper antimony sulfides are regarded as promising catalysts for photo&#8208;electrochemical water splitting because of their earth abundance and broad light absorption. The unique photoactivity of copper antimony sulfides is dependent on their various crystalline structures and atomic compositions. Here, a closed&#8208;loop workflow is built, which explores Cu&#8211;Sb&#8211;S compositional space to optimize its photo&#8208;electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water, by integrating a high&#8208;throughput robotic platform, characterization techniques, and machine learning (ML) optimization workflow. The multi&#8208;objective optimization model discovers optimum experimental conditions after only nine cycles of integrated experiments&#8211;machine learning loop. Photocurrent testing at 0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) confirms the expected correlation between the materials&#8217; properties and photocurrent. An optimum photocurrent of &#8722;186&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2 is observed on Cu&#8211;Sb&#8211;S in the ratio of 9:45:46 in the form of single&#8208;layer coating on F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) glass with a corresponding bandgap of 1.85&#160;eV and 63.2% Cu1+/Cu species content. The targeted intelligent search reveals a nonobvious CuSbS composition that exhibits 2.3 times greater activity than baseline results from random sampling.

         <title>Electrochemically Responsive 3D Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel method using carbon nanotube&#8208;tin composites to develop electrochromic reconfigurable three&#8208;dimensional&#160;microstructures. These microstructures respond to external stimuli and can change the shape/color continuously with low&#8208;power electric input through an electrochemical process. The method enables parallel production of thousands of microstructures, while their design is optimized for large strokes and high cyclability using finite element analysis.








Abstract
Responsive nanomaterials are being developed to create new unique functionalities such as switchable colors and adhesive properties or other programmable features in response to external stimuli. While many existing examples rely on changes in temperature, humidity, or pH, this study aims to explore an alternative approach relying on simple electric input signals. More specifically, 3D electrochromic architected microstructures are developed using carbon nanotube&#8211;Tin (Sn) composites that can be reconfigured by lithiating Sn with low power electric input (&#8776;50 nanowatts). These microstructures have a continuous, regulated, and non&#8208;volatile actuation determined by the extent of the electrochemical lithiation process. In addition, this proposed fabrication process relies only on batch lithographic techniques, enabling the parallel production of thousands of 3D microstructures. Structures with a 30&#8211;97% change in open&#8208;end area upon actuation are demonstrated and the importance of geometric factors in the response and structural integrity of 3D architected microstructures during electrochemical actuation is highlighted.

         <title>A Wearable Touch&#8208;Activated Device Integrated with Hollow Microneedles for Continuous Sampling and Sensing of Dermal Interstitial Fluid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully&#8208;integrated touch&#8208;activated wearable device is developed for continuous sampling and electrochemical analysis of interstitial fluid. The elastic self&#8208;recovery of the vacuum generation system enables a wide range of negative pressures and extraction rates. The developed device can successfully detect glucose and pH levels and holds the potential for continuous sensing of multiple biomarkers in extracted interstitial fluid.








Abstract
Dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) is emerging as a rich source of biomarkers that complements conventional biofluids such as blood and urine. However, the impact of ISF sampling in clinical applications has been limited owing to the challenges associated with extraction. The implementation of microneedle&#8208;based wearable devices that can extract dermal ISF in a pain&#8208;free and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use manner has attracted growing attention in recent years. Here, a fully integrated touch&#8208;activated wearable device based on a laser&#8208;drilled hollow microneedle (HMN) patch for continuous sampling and sensing of dermal ISF is introduced. The developed platform can produce and maintain the required vacuum pressure (as low as &#8776; &#8722;53&#160;kPa) to collect adequate volumes of ISF (&#8776;2&#160;&#181;L needle&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) for medical applications. The vacuum system can be activated through a one&#8208;touch finger operation. A parametric study is performed to investigate the effect of microneedle array size, vacuum pressure, and extraction duration on collected ISF. The capability of the proposed platform for continuous health monitoring is further demonstrated by the electrochemical detection of glucose and pH levels of ISF in animal models. This HMN&#8208;based system provides an alternative tool to the existing invasive techniques for ISF collection and sensing for medical diagnosis and treatment.

         <dc:description>
A fiber&#8208;integrated force probe using a spring FP cavity for general&#8208;uses is proposed. The force&#8208;sensitivity and resolution reach (0.436 &#177; 0.007) nmnN&#8208;1 and (40.0 &#177; 0.7) pN, respectively, representing the highest precisions among all fiber&#8208;based nanomechanical probes. Typically, it uses the sensor to explore the micro&#8208;scale nonlinear problems in fluid mechanics. It anticipates the easy&#8208;to&#8208;use force probe will generate significant impacts for accurate force&#8208;detection.








Abstract
Developing microscale sensors capable of force measurements down to the scale of piconewtons is of fundamental importance for a wide range of applications. To date, advanced instrumentations such as atomic force microscopes and other specifically developed micro/nano&#8208;electromechanical systems face challenges such as high cost, complex detection systems and poor electromagnetic compatibility. Here, it presents the unprecedented design and 3D printing of general fiber&#8208;integrated force sensors using spring&#8208;composed Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities. It calibrates these microscale devices employing varied&#8208;diameter &#956;$\umu$ m&#8208;scale silica particles as standard weights. The force sensitivity and resolution reach values of (0.436 &#177; 0.007) nmnN&#8208;1 and (40.0 &#177; 0.7) pN, respectively, which are the best resolutions among all fiber&#8208;based nanomechanical probes so far. It also measured the non&#8208;linear airflow force distributions produced from a nozzle with an orifice of 2 &#956;$\umu$ m, which matches well with the full&#8208;sized simulations. With further customization of their geometries and materials, it anticipates the easy&#8208;to&#8208;use force probe can well extend to many other applications such as air/fluidic turbulences sensing, micro&#8208;manipulations, and biological sensing.

         <title>Buried&#8208;Metal&#8208;Grid Electrodes for Efficient Parallel&#8208;Connected Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unfavorable conductivity of existing transparent conducting oxide electrodes restricts the development of large&#8208;area perovskite solar cells. Herein, buried&#8208;metal&#8208;grid tin&#8208;doped indium oxide electrodes are developed based on a photolithography technique. Such electrodes with greatly enhanced conductivity and low&#8208;height metal steps help increase device performance and mitigate performance loss while upscaling cell area.








Abstract
The limited conductivity of existing transparent conducting oxide (TCO) greatly restricts the further performance improvement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for large&#8208;area devices. Herein, buried&#8208;metal&#8208;grid tin&#8208;doped indium oxide (BMG ITO) electrodes are developed to minimize the power loss caused by the undesirable high sheet resistance of TCOs. By burying 140&#8208;nm&#8208;thick metal grids into ITO using a photolithography technique, the sheet resistance of ITO is reduced from 15.0 to 2.7 &#937; sq&#8722;1. The metal step of BMG over ITO has a huge impact on the charge carrier transport in PSCs. The PSCs using BMG ITO with a low metal step deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) significantly better than that of their counterparts with higher metal steps. Moreover, compared with the pristine ITO&#8208;based PSCs, the BMG ITO&#8208;based PSCs show a smaller PCE decrease when scaling up the active area of devices. The parallel&#8208;connected large&#8208;area PSCs with an active area of 102.8 mm2 reach a PCE of 22.5%. The BMG ITO electrodes are also compatible with the fabrication of inverted&#8208;structure PSCs and organic solar cells. The work demonstrates the great efficacy of improving the conductivity of TCO by BMG and opens up a promising avenue for constructing highly efficient large&#8208;area PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;The unfavorable conductivity of existing transparent conducting oxide electrodes restricts the development of large-area perovskite solar cells. Herein, buried-metal-grid tin-doped indium oxide electrodes are developed based on a photolithography technique. Such electrodes with greatly enhanced conductivity and low-height metal steps help increase device performance and mitigate performance loss while upscaling cell area.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited conductivity of existing transparent conducting oxide (TCO) greatly restricts the further performance improvement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially for large-area devices. Herein, buried-metal-grid tin-doped indium oxide (BMG ITO) electrodes are developed to minimize the power loss caused by the undesirable high sheet resistance of TCOs. By burying 140-nm-thick metal grids into ITO using a photolithography technique, the sheet resistance of ITO is reduced from 15.0 to 2.7 &#937; sq&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The metal step of BMG over ITO has a huge impact on the charge carrier transport in PSCs. The PSCs using BMG ITO with a low metal step deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) significantly better than that of their counterparts with higher metal steps. Moreover, compared with the pristine ITO-based PSCs, the BMG ITO-based PSCs show a smaller PCE decrease when scaling up the active area of devices. The parallel-connected large-area PSCs with an active area of 102.8 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; reach a PCE of 22.5%. The BMG ITO electrodes are also compatible with the fabrication of inverted-structure PSCs and organic solar cells. The work demonstrates the great efficacy of improving the conductivity of TCO by BMG and opens up a promising avenue for constructing highly efficient large-area PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Smart Microneedles with &#8220;Offensive and Defensive&#8221; Effects for Intervertebral Disc Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a new strategy for intervertebral disc repair. The high&#8208;strength smart microneedles are designed to extracellularly &#8220;offend&#8221; the inflammatory microenvironment and mitigate damage to cells, and intracellularly increase the level of cytoprotective heat shock proteins to enhance defense against the hostile microenvironment, achieving &#8220;offensive and defensive&#8221; effects, and ultimately promoting the repair of intervertebral disc.








Abstract
Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a global public health issue. The injury of annulus fibrosus (AF) caused by acupuncture or discectomy can trigger IVDD again. However, there is currently no suitable method for treating AF injury. In this study, the high&#8208;strength smart microneedles (MNs) which can penetrate the AF tissue through a local and minimally invasive method, and achieve remote control of speeded&#8208;up release of the drug and hyperthermia by the Near Infrared is developed. The PDA/GelMA composite MNs loaded with diclofenac sodium are designed to extracellularly &#8220;offend&#8221; the inflammatory microenvironment and mitigate damage to cells, and intracellularly increase the level of cytoprotective heat shock proteins to enhance the defense against the hostile microenvironment, achieving &#8220;offensive and defensive&#8221; effects. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the synergistic treatment of photothermal therapy and anti&#8208;inflammation effectively reduces inflammation, inhibits cell apoptosis, and promotes the synthesis of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In vivo experiments show that the MNs mitigate the inflammatory response, promote ECM deposition, reduce the level of apoptosis, and restore the biomechanical properties of the intervertebral disc (IVD) in rats. Overall, this high&#8208;strength smart MNs display promising &#8220;offensive and defensive&#8221; effects that can provide a new strategy for IVD repair.

         <title>Aramid Nanodielectrics for Ultraconformal Transparent Electronic Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aramid nanodielectrics (ANDs) with self&#8208;delaminated characteristics are developed, enabling any skin&#8208;like electronics easily exfoliated from the processing substrates after complicated nanofabrication. In addition, ANDs are mechanically strong, chemically and thermally stable, transparent and breathable, therefore are ideal substrates for soft electronics. Compliant epidermal electrodes and ultraconformal carbon nanotube transistors based on ANDs are further demonstrated with superior performance.








Abstract
On&#8208;skin electronics require minimal thicknesses and decent transparency for conformal contact, imperceptible wearing, and visual aesthetics. It is challenging to search for advanced ultrathin dielectrics capable of supporting the active components while maintaining bending softness, easy handling, and wafer&#8208;scale processability. Here, self&#8208;delaminated aramid nanodielectrics (ANDs) are demonstrated, enabling any skin&#8208;like electronics easily exfoliated from the processing substrates after complicated nanofabrication. In addition, ANDs are mechanically strong, chemically and thermally stable, transparent and breathable, therefore are ideal substrates for soft electronics. As demonstrated, compliant epidermal electrodes comprising silver nanowires and ANDs can successfully record high&#8208;quality electromyogram signals with low motion artifacts and satisfying sweat and water resistance. Furthermore, ANDs can serve as both substrates and dielectrics in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with a merely 160&#8208;nm thickness, which can be operated within 4&#160;V with on/off ratios of 1.4 &#177; 0.5 &#215; 105, mobilities of 39.9 &#177; 2.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and negligible hysteresis. The ultraconformal FETs can function properly when wrapped around human hair without any degradation in performance.

         <title>Growth, Distribution, and Photosynthesis of Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii in 3D Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Studying spatiotemporal cell growth within engineered living materials is key to identifying shape parameters for improved material functionality. In photosynthetic microalgae&#8208;based living materials, both carbon source availability and light penetration&#160;are found to be limiting factors for cell growth. Taking advantage of location&#8208;specific growth patterns, photosynthetic living materials are designed and printed for increased CO2 consumption.








Abstract
Engineered living materials (ELMs) are a novel class of functional materials that typically feature spatial confinement of living components within an inert polymer matrix to recreate biological functions. Understanding the growth and spatial configuration of cellular populations within a matrix is crucial to predicting and improving their responsive potential and functionality. Here, this work investigates the growth, spatial distribution, and photosynthetic productivity of eukaryotic microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) in three&#8208;dimensionally shaped hydrogels in dependence of geometry and size. The embedded C. reinhardtii cells photosynthesize and form confined cell clusters, which grow faster when located close to the ELM periphery due to favorable gas exchange and light conditions. Taking advantage of location&#8208;specific growth patterns, this work successfully designs and prints photosynthetic ELMs with increased CO2 capturing rate, featuring high surface to volume ratio. This strategy to control cell growth for higher productivity of ELMs resembles the already established adaptations found in multicellular plant leaves.

         <title>Data&#8208;Driven Discovery of Organic Electronic Materials Enabled by Hybrid Top&#8208;Down/Bottom&#8208;Up Design</title>

&#8216;Top&#8208;down&#8217; and &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; methods are combined to facilitate the fragment&#8208;based discovery of organic electronic materials. A dataset of 117K synthesized molecules is curated and used as a building block library. Statistical models are trained on this dataset, enabling accurate prediction of excited state properties. This approach allows for efficient screening of over a million molecular candidates for singlet fission.








Abstract
The high&#8208;throughput exploration and screening of molecules for organic electronics involves either a &#8216;top&#8208;down&#8217; curation and mining of existing repositories, or a &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8217; assembly of user&#8208;defined fragments based on known synthetic templates. Both are time&#8208;consuming approaches requiring significant resources to compute electronic properties accurately. Here, &#8216;top&#8208;down&#8216; is combined with &#8216;bottom&#8208;up&#8216; through automatic assembly and statistical models, thus providing a platform for the fragment&#8208;based discovery of organic electronic materials. This study generates a top&#8208;down set of 117K synthesized molecules containing structures, electronic and topological properties and chemical composition, and uses them as building blocks for bottom&#8208;up design. A tool is developed to automate the coupling of these building blocks at their C(sp2/sp)&#8208;H bonds, providing a fundamental link between the two dataset construction philosophies. Statistical models are trained on this dataset and a subset of resulting top&#8208;down/bottom&#8208;up compounds, enabling on&#8208;the&#8208;fly prediction of ground and excited state properties with high accuracy across organic compound space. With access to ab initio&#8208;quality optical properties, this bottom&#8208;up pipeline may be applied to any materials design campaign using existing compounds as building blocks. To illustrate this, over a million molecules are screened for singlet fission. tThe leading candidates provide insight into the features promoting this multiexciton&#8208;generating&#160;process.

Both are time-consuming approaches requiring significant resources to compute electronic properties accurately. Here, &#8216;top-down&#8216; is combined with &#8216;bottom-up&#8216; through automatic assembly and statistical models, thus providing a platform for the fragment-based discovery of organic electronic materials. This study generates a top-down set of 117K synthesized molecules containing structures, electronic and topological properties and chemical composition, and uses them as building blocks for bottom-up design. A tool is developed to automate the coupling of these building blocks at their C(sp2/sp)-H bonds, providing a fundamental link between the two dataset construction philosophies. Statistical models are trained on this dataset and a subset of resulting top-down/bottom-up compounds, enabling on-the-fly prediction of ground and excited state properties with high accuracy across organic compound space. With access to ab initio-quality optical properties, this bottom-up pipeline may be applied to any materials design campaign using existing compounds as building blocks. To illustrate this, over a million molecules are screened for singlet fission. tThe leading candidates provide insight into the features promoting this multiexciton-generating&#160;process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquid Metal&#8208;Based Stable and Stretchable Zn&#8208;Ion Battery for Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable and stretchable fibrous Zn&#8208;ion battery is developed by utilizing a dendrite&#8208;free liquid metal@Zn anode, which can be well&#8208;integrated with a liquid metal&#8208;based fibrous sensor, Joule heater, and wireless charging device for smart multifunctional electronic textiles.








Abstract
Electronic textiles harmoniously interact with the human body and the surrounding environment, offering tremendous interest in smart wearable electronics. However, their wide application faces challenges due to the lack of stable and stretchable power electrodes/devices with multifunctional design. Herein, an intrinsically stretchable liquid metal&#8208;based fibrous anode for a stable Zn&#8208;ion battery (ZIB) is reported. Benefiting from the liquid feature and superior deformability of the liquid metal, optimized Zn ion concentration distribution and Zn (002) deposition behavior are observed, which result in dendrite&#8208;free performance even under stretching. With a strain of 50%, the ZIB maintains a high capacity of 139.8 mAh cm&#8722;3 (corresponding to 83.0% of the initial value) after 300 cycles, outperforming bare Zn fiber&#8208;based ZIB. The fibrous ZIB seamlessly integrates with the sensor, Joule heater, and wirelessly charging device, which provides a stable power supply for human signal monitoring and personal thermal management, holding promise for the application of wearable multifunctional electronic textiles.

         <title>Synergetic Sn Incorporation&#8208;Zn Substitution in Copper&#8208;Based Sulfides Enabling Superior Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synergetic Sn incorporation and Zn substitution strategy is proposed to develop a superior copper&#8208;based sulfide anode in Na&#8208;ion battery, which exhibits high Na&#8208;ion storage capacity, ultrastable cycling performance, superior rate capability, and ultrafast charging feature. Furthermore, the critical roles of Sn and Zn in synergistically promoting the Na&#8208;ion storage performance are clarified.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal sulfides have been regarded as perspective anode candidates for high&#8208;energy Na&#8208;ion batteries. Their application, however, is precluded severely by either low charge storage or huge volumetric change along with sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an effective synergetic Sn incorporation&#8208;Zn substitution strategy is proposed based on copper&#8208;based sulfides. First, Na&#8208;ion storage capability of copper sulfide is significantly improved via incorporating an alloy&#8208;based Sn element. However, this process is accompanied by sacrifice of structural stability due to the high Na&#8208;ion uptake. Subsequently, to maintain the high Na&#8208;ion storage capacity, and concurrently improve cycling and rate capabilities, a Zn substitution strategy (taking partial Sn sites) is carried out, which could significantly promote Na&#8208;ion diffusion/reaction kinetics and relieve mechanical strain&#8211;stress within the crystal framework. The synergetic Sn incorporation and Zn substitution endow copper&#8208;based sulfides with high specific capacity (&#8776;560 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1), ultrastable cyclability (80 k cycles with &#8776;100% capacity retention), superior rate capability up to 200 A g&#8722;1, and ultrafast charging feature (&#8776;4 s per charging with &#8776;190 mAh g&#8722;1 input). This work provides in&#8208;depth insights for developing superior anode materials via synergetic multi&#8208;cation incorporation/substitution, aiming at solving their intrinsic issues of either low specific capacity or poor cyclability.

         <title>Ag Nanoparticle&#8208;Induced Surface Chloride Immobilization Strategy Enables Stable Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ formation of AgCl by the combination of free Cl&#8722; with oxidized Ag nanoparticles in the presence of an electric field effectively repel free Cl&#8722; through strong common&#8208;ion repulsive effect. As&#8208;prepared NiFe&#8208;LDH@Ag exhibits superior corrosion resistance and unprecedented stability at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for more than 5000&#160;h in alkaline saline electrolyte.








Abstract
Although hydrogen gas (H2) storage might enable offshore renewable energy to be stored at scale, the commercialization of technology for H2 generation by seawater electrolysis depends upon the development of methods that avoid the severe corrosion of anodes by chloride (Cl&#8722;) ions. Here, it is revealed that the stability of an anode used for seawater splitting can be increased by more than an order of magnitude by loading Ag nanoparticles on the catalyst surface. In experiments, an optimized NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH)@Ag electrode displays stable operation at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline saline electrolyte and seawater for over 5000 and 2500&#160;h, respectively. The impressive long&#8208;term durability is more than 20 times that of an unmodified NiFe&#8208;LDH anode. Meticulous characterization and simulation reveals that in the presence of an applied electric field, free Cl&#8722; ions react with oxidized Ag nanoparticles to form stable AgCl species, giving rise to the formation of a Cl&#8722;&#8208;free layer near the anode surface. Because of its simplicity and effectiveness, it is anticipated that the proposed strategy to immobilize chloride ions on the surface of an anode has the potential to become a crucial technology to control corrosion during large&#8208;scale electrolysis of seawater to produce hydrogen.

         <title>Fe Cluster Modified Co9S8 Heterojunction: Highly Efficient Photoelectrocatalyst for Overall Water Splitting and Flexible Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, outstanding photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalysts are successfully synthesized by thermal annealing of polydopamine coated CdS and ZIF&#8208;67. Additionally, based on the spatial confinement of the N&#8208;doped carbon skeleton and the electronic structure regulation of the Fe cluster, the Co9S8&#8208;Fe heterojunction substantially facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs and further enhances the photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalytic overall water splitting.








Abstract
Designing bifunctional low&#8208;cost photo&#8208;assisted electrocatalysts for converting solar and electric energy into hydrogen energy remains a huge challenge. Herein, a heterojunction (Fe cluster modified Co9S8 loaded on carbon nanotubes, Co9S8&#8208;Fe@CNT)&#160;for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is demonstrated. Benefiting from the good electronic conductivity and spatial confinement of the carbon skeleton, as well as the electronic structure regulation of the Fe cluster, Co9S8&#8208;Fe@CNT exhibits excellent catalytic performance with a low overpotential of 150&#160;mV for OER and 135&#160;mV for HER at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Upon light irradiation, holes and electrons are generated in the valence band and conduction band of the Co9S8, respectively. Part of the charges are transferred to the interface to facilitate the catalytic reaction, while the remaining are transferred by the electrode. When working as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, the performance can reach 1.33&#160;V at under light conditions, which is significantly better than 1.52&#160;V in a dark environment. Theoretical calculations revealed lowered Gibbs free energy (&#8710;GH*) of the heterojunction with the effect of Fe modification of Co9S8. This work sheds a new light in designing novel photoelectrochemical materials to convert solar and electric energy into chemical energy.

         <title>Uracil Induced Simultaneously Strengthening Grain Boundaries and Interfaces Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells with Superior Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small molecular uracil additive is developed to passivate the defects of the perovskite film and enhance the interface binding force between perovskite film and substrate. The device delivers a champion efficiency of 24.23%. The device exhibits superior operational stability maintaining over 90% of its initial efficiency after tracking for 6000 h at the maximum power point.








Abstract
The operational stability is a huge obstacle to further commercialization of perovskite solar cells. To address this critical issue, in this work, uracil is introduced as a &#8220;binder&#8221; into the perovskite film to simultaneously improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability. Uracil can efficiently passivate defects and strengthen grain boundaries to enhance the stability of perovskite films. Moreover, the uracil also strengthens the interface between the perovskite and the Tin oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer to increase the binding force. The uracil&#8208;modified devices deliver a champion PCE of 24.23% (certificated 23.19%) with negligible hysteresis at active area of 0.0625 cm2. In particular, the optimal device exhibits over 90% of its initial PCE after tracking for &#8776;6000 h at its maximum power point under continuous light, indicating its superior operational stability. Moreover, the devices also show great reproducibility in both PCE and operational stability.

         <title>An Industrially Applicable Passivation Strategy for Significantly Improving Cyclability of Zinc Metal Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An industrially applicable passivation strategy of zinc plating by a simple dipping treatment is adopted to grow trivalent chromium conversion films (TCCF) as artificial interphases for Zn metal anodes. The facile preparation process and superior electrochemical performance of TCCF@Zn offer an exciting possibility for the practicability of metallic zinc anodes in aqueous zinc batteries.








Abstract
The cycling instability of metallic Zn anodes hinders the practicability of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, though aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries may be the most credible alternative technology for future electrochemical energy storage applications. Commercially available trivalent chromium conversion films (TCCF) are successfully employed as robust artificial interphases on Zn metal anodes (ZMAs). Fabricated through a simple immersion method, the TCCF&#8208;protected Zn (TCCF@Zn) electrode enables a superlow nucleation overpotential for Zn plating of 6.9&#160;mV under 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outstanding Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1600 cycles in Zn||Cu asymmetric cells and superior cyclability in symmetric Zn||Zn batteries at 0.2, 2, and 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 2500&#160;h and 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1200&#160;h. More importantly, the TCCF@Zn||V2O5 full cell exhibits a specific capacity of 118.5 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention of 53.4% at 3 A g&#8722;1 for 3000 cycles, which is considerably larger than that of the pristine Zn||V2O5 full cell (59.7 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention of 25.7%). This study demonstrates a highly efficient and low&#8208;cost surface modification strategy derived from an industrially applicable trivalent chromium passivation technique aimed at obtaining dendrite&#8208;free ZMAs with high reversibility for practical Zn batteries in the near future.

         <title>Surface Energy Engineering of Buried Interface for Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The abundant oxygen&#8208;related defects seriously impair the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, a novel surface energy engineering (SEE) is developed by applying a surfactant HFSTA on the surface of the TiO2 substrate. By combining the passivation of TiO2, crystallization process modulation and stress relief, PCE of 25.03% is achieved on champion device along with improved stability.








Abstract
The abundant oxygen&#8208;related defects (e.g., O vacancies, O&#8211;H) in the TiO2 electron transport layer results in high surface energy, which is detrimental to effective carrier extraction and seriously impairs the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, novel surface energy engineering (SEE) is developed by applying a surfactant of heptadecafluorooctanesulfonate tetraethylammonium (HFSTA) on the surface of the TiO2. Theoretical calculations show that the HFSTA&#8208;TiO2 is less prone to form O vacancies, leading to lower surface energy, thus improving the carrier&#8208;extraction efficiency. The experimental results show that superior perovskite film is obtained due to the reduced heterogeneous nucleation sites and improved crystallization process on the modified TiO2. Furthermore, the flexible long alkyl chains in HFSTA considerably relieve the compressive stresses at the buried interface. By combining the passivation of TiO2, crystallization process modulation, and stress relief, a champion PCE up to 25.03% is achieved. The device without encapsulation sustains 92.2% of its initial PCE after more than 2500&#160;h storage under air ambient with relative humidity of 25&#8211;30%. The SEE of a buried interface paves a new way toward high&#8208;efficiency, stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Impact of Anodic Oxidation Reactions in the Performance Evaluation of High&#8208;Rate CO2/CO Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this perspective, several impacts of anodic oxidation of liquid products in terms of performance evaluation, e.g., misestimation of the Faradaic efficiency, are elaborated. It is revealed that dynamic change of the anolyte (i.e., pH and composition) not only brings a shift of anodic potentials, but also affects the chemical stability of the anode catalyst.








Abstract
The membrane&#8208;electrode assembly (MEA) approach appears to be the most promising technique to realize the high&#8208;rate CO2/CO electrolysis, however there are major challenges related to the crossover of ions and liquid products from cathode to anode via the membrane and the concomitant anodic oxidation reactions (AORs). In this perspective, by combining experimental and theoretical analyses, several impacts of anodic oxidation of liquid products in terms of performance evaluation are investigated. First, the crossover behavior of several typical liquid products through an anion&#8208;exchange membrane is analyzed. Subsequently, two instructive examples (introducing formate or ethanol oxidation during electrolysis) reveals that the dynamic change of the anolyte (i.e., pH and composition) not only brings a slight shift of anodic potentials (i.e., change of competing reactions), but also affects the chemical stability of the anode catalyst. Anodic oxidation of liquid products can also cause either over&#8208; or under&#8208;estimation of the Faradaic efficiency, leading to an inaccurate assessment of overall performance. To comprehensively understand fundamentals of AORs, a theoretical guideline with hierarchical indicators is further developed to predict and regulate the possible AORs in an electrolyzer. The perspective concludes by giving some suggestions on rigorous performance evaluations for high&#8208;rate CO2/CO electrolysis in an MEA&#8208;based setup.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new lipid coating approach is reported in which the lipid composition is optimized through a combination of biomimetic and systematic variation approaches for the custom design of nanocarrier for precision drug delivery. Nanocarriers coated with the optimized lipids offer unique advantages in terms of bioavailability and efficiency in tumor targeting, tumor penetration, cellular uptake, and drug release.








Abstract
The plasma membranes (PM) of mammalian cells contain diverse lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates that are important for systemic recognition and communication in health and disease. Cell membrane coating technology that imparts unique properties of natural plasma membranes to the surface of encapsulated nanoparticles is thus becoming a powerful platform for drug delivery, immunomodulation, and vaccination. However, current coating methods fail to take full advantage of the natural systems because they disrupt the complex and functionally essential features of PMs, most notably the chemical diversity and compositional differences of lipids in two leaflets of the PM. Herein, a new lipid coating approach is reported in which the lipid composition is optimized through a combination of biomimetic and systematic variation approaches for the custom design of nanocarrier systems for precision drug delivery. Nanocarriers coated with the optimized lipids offer unique advantages in terms of bioavailability and efficiency in tumor targeting, tumor penetration, cellular uptake, and drug release. This pilot study provides new insight into the rational design and optimization of nanocarriers for cancer chemotherapeutic drugs and lays the foundation for further customization of cell membrane&#8208;mimicking nanocarriers through systematic incorporation of other components.

         <title>Biotoxicity of Halide Perovskites in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the fast&#8208;paced development of perovskite solar cells as a potential silicon&#8208;based solar cell replacement, it is crucial to thoroughly evaluate the environmental and health safety. This work assesses the biotoxicity of heavy metals in perovskite materials, providing insights into understanding their potential risks and guiding further investigations in mammalian systems and environmental sustainability of perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
Halide perovskites are crystalline semiconductors with exceptional optoelectronic properties, rapidly developing toward large&#8208;scale applications. Lead (II) (Pb2+) is the core element used to prepare halide perovskites. Pb2+ can displace key 2+ elements, including calcium, zinc and iron, that regulate vital physiological functions. Sn2+ can replace Pb2+ within the perovskite structure and, if accidentally dispersed in the environment, it readily oxidizes to Sn4+, which is compatible with physiological functions and thus potentially safe. The 3+ salt bismuth (III) (Bi3+) is also potentially safe for the same reason and useful to prepare double perovskites. Here, this work studies the biotoxicity of Pb, Sn, and Bi perovskites in mice for the first time. This work analyses histopathology and growth of mice directly exposed to perovskites and investigate the development of their offspring generation. This study provides the screening of organs and key physiological functions targeted by perovskite exposure to design specific studies in mammalians.

         <title>High&#8208;Stroke, High&#8208;Output&#8208;Force, Fabric&#8208;Lattice Artificial Muscles for Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of fabric&#8208;lattice artificial muscles with large contraction ratios, high output forces, and diverse configurations is proposed by connecting a group of fabric chambers and layers into a lattice. This artificial muscle can be designed with desired performance and configuration to enable high&#8208;performance soft robots, including the powerful robotic elbow, the assistive shoulder exosuit, and the adaptive soft gripper.








Abstract
Artificial muscles, providing safe and close interaction between humans and machines, are essential in soft robotics. However, their insufficient deformation, output force, or configurability usually limits their applications. Herein, this work presents a class of lightweight fabric&#8208;lattice artificial muscles (FAMs) that are pneumatically actuated with large contraction ratios (up to 87.5%) and considerable output forces (up to a load of 20&#160;kg, force&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio of over 250). The developed FAMs consist of a group of active air chambers that are zigzag connected into a lattice through passive connecting layers. The geometry of these fabric components is programmable to convert the in&#8208;plane lattice of FAMs into out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations (e.g., arched and cylindrical) capable of linear/radial contraction. This work further demonstrates that FAMs can be configured for various soft robotic applications, including the powerful robotic elbow with large motion range and high load capability, the well&#8208;fitting assistive shoulder exosuit that can reduce muscle activity during abduction, and the adaptive soft gripper that can grasp irregular objects. These results show the unique features and broad potential of FAMs for high&#8208;performance soft robots.

         <title>High&#8208;Performing and Capacitive&#8208;Matched Triboelectric Implants Driven by Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrasound&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerator using a high&#8208;dielectric composite not only improves the output of the device, but also improves the connectivity between the energy harvester and the circuit, enabling the semipermanent use and miniaturization of implantable medical devices. These triboelectric implants provide a significant step toward permanently implantable devices for controlling human organs and treating various diseases.








Abstract
In implantable bioelectronics, which aim for semipermanent use of devices, biosafe energy sources and packaging materials to protect devices are essential elements. However, research so far has been conducted in a direction where they cannot coexist. Here, the development of capacitance&#8208;matched triboelectric implants driven is reported by ultrasound under 500&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 safe intensity and realize a battery&#8208;free, miniatured, and wireless neurostimulator with full titanium (Ti) packaging. The triboelectric implant with high dielectric composite, which has ultralow output impedance, can efficiently deliver sufficient power to generate the stimulation pulse without an energy&#8208;storing battery, despite ultrasound attenuation due to the Ti, and has the highest energy transmission efficiency among those reported so far. In vivo study using a rat model demonstrated that the proposed device system is an effective solution for relieving urinary symptoms. These achievements provide a significant step toward permanently implantable devices for controlling human organs and treating various diseases.

         <title>Dendritic Nanomedicine with Boronate Bonds for Augmented Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy via Synergistic Modulation of Tumor Immune Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a feasible strategy of integrating epirubicin (Epi) and NLG919 within a target group&#8208;shieldable dendritic delivery system. Epi is served as a chemotherapeutic drug and a robust immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing agent, and NLG919 inhibited IDO1 activity to downregulate the generation of kynurenine (Kyn), leading to a reduction in the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells and reeducation of the tumor immune microenvironment.








Abstract
Unsatisfied tumor accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs and a complicated immunosuppressive microenvironment diminish the immune response rate and the therapeutic effect. Surface modification of these drugs with target ligands can promote their cellular internalization, but the modified drugs may be subjected to unexpected immune recognition and clearance. Herein, a phenylboronic acid (PBA) group&#8208;shieldable dendritic nanomedicine that integrates an immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing agent (epirubicin, Epi) and an indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxgenase 1 (IDO1) inhibitor (NLG919) is reported for tumor chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. This NLG919&#8208;loaded Epi&#8208;conjugated PEGylated dendrimers bridged with boronate bonds (NLG919@Epi&#8208;DBP) maintains a stable nanostructure during circulation. Under a moderate acidic condition, the PBA group exposes to the sialic acid residue on the tumor cell membrane to enhance the internalization and penetration of NLG919@Epi&#8208;DBP. At pH 5.0, NLG919@Epi&#8208;DBP rapidly disassembles to release the incorporated Epi and NLG919. Epi triggers robust ICD of tumor cells that evokes strong immune response. In addition, inhibition of the IDO1 activity downregulates the metabolism of L&#8208;tryptophan to kynurenine, leading to a reduction in the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells and modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. Collectively, this promising strategy has been demonstrated to evoke robust immune response as well as remodel the immunosuppressive microenvironment for an enhanced chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effect.

Collectively, this promising strategy has been demonstrated to evoke robust immune response as well as remodel the immunosuppressive microenvironment for an enhanced chemo-immunotherapeutic effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Amphibious Polymer Materials with High Strength and Superb Toughness in Various Aquatic and Atmospheric Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicate nanostructure design with nanophase separation and crystalline domains leads to an amphibious polymer material with outstanding mechanical performance in both hydrated and dehydrated states, affording a hydrogel with a toughness of up to 214.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 and a plastic with a toughness of up to 430.9&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. In addition, the hydrogel exhibits excellent stability in acidic, alkaline, and saline aqueous environments.








Abstract
Herein, the fabrication of amphibious polymer materials with outstanding mechanical performances, both underwater and in the air is reported. A polyvinyl alcohol/poly(2&#8208;methoxyethylacrylate) (PVA/PMEA) composite with multiscale nanostructures is prepared by combining solvent exchange and thermal annealing strategies, which contributes to nanophase separation with rigid PVA&#8208;rich and soft PMEA&#8208;rich phases and high&#8208;density crystalline domains of PVA chains, respectively. Benefiting from the multiscale nanostructure, the PVA/PMEA hydrogel demonstrates excellent stability in harsh (such as acidic, alkaline, and saline) aqueous solutions, as well as superior mechanical behavior with a breaking strength of up to 34.8&#160;MPa and toughness of up to 214.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. Dehydrating the PVA/PMEA hydrogel results in an extremely robust plastic with a breaking strength of 65.4&#160;MPa and toughness of 430.9&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. This study provides a promising phase&#8211;structure engineering route for constructing high&#8208;performance polymer materials for complex load&#8208;bearing environments.

         <title>Photoinduced Nonvolatile Memory Transistor Based on Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Incorporating Fused &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Organic Ligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this manuscript, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are synthesized by incorporating fused &#960;&#8208;conjugated pyrene&#8208;O&#8208;ethyl&#8208;ammonium (POE) ligands and a systematic study is conducted to obtain enhanced performance and reliable Transistors. The optimized (POE)2SnI4 transistors show remarkable photoresponse, stable storage&#8208;erase cycles and competitive retention performance. Importantly, a 2D perovskite&#8208;only transistor with a multi&#8208;level memory behavior is described.








Abstract
Perovskites field&#8208;effect transistors (PeFETs) have been intensively investigated for their application in detector and synapse. However, synapse based on PeFETs is still very difficult to integrate excellent charge carrier transporting ability, photosensitivity, and nonvolatile memory effects into one device, which is very important for developing bionic electronic devices and edge computing. Here, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are synthesized by incorporating fused &#960;&#8209;conjugated pyrene&#8208;O&#8208;ethyl&#8208;ammonium (POE) ligands and a systematic study is conducted to obtain enhanced performance and reliable PeFETs. The optimized (POE)2SnI4 transistors display the hole mobility over 0.3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, high repeatability, and operational stability. Meanwhile, the derived photo memory devices show remarkable photoresponse, with a switching ratio higher than 105, high visible light responsivity (&gt;4&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1), and stable storage&#8208;erase cycles, as well as competitive retention performance (104&#160;s). The photoinduced memory behavior can be benefiting from the insulating nature of quantum&#8208;well in 2D perovskite under dark and its excellent light sensitivity. The excellent photo memory behaviors have been maintained after 40 days in a N2 atmosphere. Finally, a 2D perovskite&#8208;only transistors with a multi&#8208;level memory behavior (16 distinct states) is described by controlling incident light pulse. This work provides broader attention toward 2D perovskite and optoelectronic application.

         <title>Spectral Tuning of High&#8208;Harmonic Generation with Resonance&#8208;Gradient Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel resonance&#8208;gradient metasurfaces are designed and fabricated with varying geometrical parameters that translate into resonant frequencies dependence on one of the coordinates of the metasurface. This general concept is applied to observe the resonant enhancement of the third and fifth harmonics generated from the gradient metasurfaces being used in conjunction with a tunable excitation laser to provide a wide spectral coverage of resonantly&#8208;enhanced tunable generation of multiple optical harmonics.








Abstract
High&#8208;index dielectric subwavelength structures and metasurfaces are capable of enhancing light&#8208;matter interaction by orders of magnitude via geometry&#8208;dependent optical resonances. This enhancement, however, comes with a fundamental limitation of a narrow spectral range of operation in the vicinity of one or few resonant frequencies. Here, this limitation is tackled by introducing an innovative and practical approach to achieve spectrally tunable enhancement of light&#8208;matter interaction with resonant metasurfaces. Resonance&#8208;gradient metasurfaces are designed and fabricated with varying geometrical parameters that translate into resonant frequencies dependence on one of the coordinates of the metasurface. The metasurfaces are composed of bone&#8208;like nanoresonators, which are made of germanium and support high&#8208;quality optical resonances in the mid&#8208;IR spectral range. The concept is applied to observe the resonant enhancement of the third and fifth harmonics generated from the gradient metasurfaces being used in conjunction with a tunable excitation laser to provide a wide spectral coverage of resonantly&#8208;enhanced tunable generation of multiple optical&#160;harmonics.

The dual&#8208;functional sensory device exhibits efficient molecular packing and excellent free&#8208;charge generation yield by quantifying charge&#8208;carrier dynamics, resulting in a high output power density of over 94 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 for OPVs, under dim indoor illumination (LED 1000 lx). Moreover, it demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed device by developing a single&#8208;pixel image sensor for practical indoor operation in commercial settings.








Abstract
The development of organic&#8208;based optoelectronic technologies for the indoor Internet of Things market, which relies on ambient energy sources, has increased, with organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and photodetectors (OPDs) considered promising candidates for sustainable indoor electronic devices. However, the manufacturing processes of standalone OPVs and OPDs can be complex and costly, resulting in high production costs and limited scalability, thus limiting their use in a wide range of indoor applications. This study uses a multi&#8208;component photoactive structure to develop a self&#8208;powering dual&#8208;functional sensory device with effective energy harvesting and sensing capabilities. The optimized device demonstrates improved free&#8208;charge generation yield by quantifying charge carrier dynamics, with a high output power density of over 81 and 76 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 for rigid and flexible OPVs under indoor conditions (LED 1000&#160;lx (5200 K)). Furthermore, a single&#8208;pixel image sensor is demonstrated as a feasible prototype for practical indoor operating in commercial settings by leveraging the excellent OPD performance with a linear dynamic range of over 130&#160;dB in photovoltaic mode (no external bias). This apparatus with high&#8208;performance OPV&#8208;OPD characteristics provides a roadmap for further exploration of the potential, which can lead to synergistic effects for practical multifunctional applications in the real world by their mutual relevance.

         <title>Thermochromic Printable and Multicolor Polymeric Composite Based on Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative thermochromic composite consisting of a 2D perovskite and a nonionic block copolymer is developed. It exhibits excellent performance, allowing 80% transmittance modulation in the visible range, taking only a few seconds to switch from the bleached to the colored state (and vice versa) and providing a wide range of colors when heated at 70&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (PVKs) are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications thanks to their outstanding photophysical properties and easy synthesis. Herein, a new PVK&#8208;based thermochromic composite is demonstrated. It can reversibly switch from a transparent state (transmittance &gt; 80%) at room temperature to a colored state (transmittance &lt; 10%) at high temperature, with very fast kinetics, taking only a few seconds to go from the bleached to the colored state (and vice versa). X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calometry, rheological, and optical measurements carried out during heating/cooling cycles reveal that thermochromism in the material is based on a reversible process of PVK disassembly/assembly mediated by intercalating polymeric chains, through the formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds between polymer and perovskite. Therefore, differently from other thermochromic perovskites, that generally work with the adsorption/desorption of volatile molecules, the system is able to perform several heating/cooling cycles regardless of environmental conditions. The color and transition temperature (from 70 to 120&#160;&#176;C) can be tuned depending on the type of perovskite. Moreover, this thermochromic material is printable and can be deposited by cheap techniques, paving the way for a new class of smart coatings with an unprecedented range of colors.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Enzyme Co&#8208;Expressed Nanomedicine for Anti&#8208;Metastasis Tumor Therapy by Up&#8208;Regulating Cellular Oxidative Stress and Depleting Cholesterol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor invasion and metastasis are the main causes of death in cancer patients. To overcome the limitations of current anti&#8208;tumor metastasis therapy, a novel multiple&#8208;enzymes co&#8208;expressed cholesterol oxidase loaded Co&#9472;PN3 single&#8208;atom nanozyme that can destroy the lipid raft structure and inhibiting lamellipodia formation through a cholesterol depletion and oxidative stress up&#8208;regulation strategy, effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis, is constructed.








Abstract
Tumor cells movement and migration are inseparable from the integrity of lipid rafts and the formation of lamellipodia, and lipid rafts are also a prerequisite for the formation of lamellipodia. Therefore, destroying the lipid rafts is an effective strategy to inhibit tumor metastasis. Herein, a multi&#8208;enzyme co&#8208;expressed nanomedicine: cholesterol oxidase (CHO) loaded Co&#9472;PN3 single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Co&#9472;PN3 SA/CHO) that can up&#8208;regulate cellular oxidative stress, disrupt the integrity of lipid rafts, and inhibit lamellipodia formation to induce anti&#8208;metastasis tumor therapy, is developed. In this process, Co&#9472;PN3 SA can catalyze oxygen (O2)&#160;and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) via oxidase&#8208;like and Fenton&#8208;like properties. The doping of P atoms optimizes the adsorption process of the intermediate at the active site and enhances the ROS generation properties of nanomedicine. Meantime, O2 produced by catalase&#8208;like catalysis can combine with excess cholesterol to generate more H2O2 under CHO catalysis, achieving enhanced oxidative damage to tumor cells. Most importantly, cholesterol depletion in tumor cells also disrupts the integrity of lipid rafts and inhibits the formation of lamellipodia, greatly inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells. This strategy by up&#8208;regulating cellular oxidative stress and depleting cellular cholesterol constructs a new idea for anti&#8208;metastasis&#8211;oriented cancer therapy strategies.

         <title>Photoelectrons Sequentially Regulate Antibacterial Activity and Osseointegration of Titanium Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Au&#8208;RE/TiO2 coating of titanium implant can generate electron under near infrared light (NIR) illumination. In vivo and in vitro explorations prove the photoelectron&#8208;responsive titanium implants can sequentially regulate antibacterial activity and osseointegration through upconversion, providing a new solution for those patients with post&#8208;implantation infection and poor osseointegration.








Abstract
Titanium implants are widely used ; however, implantation occasionally fails due to infections during the surgery or poor osseointegration after the surgery. To solve the problem, an intelligent functional surface on titanium implant that can sequentially eradicate bacteria biofilm at the initial period and promote osseointegration at the late period of post&#8208;surgery time is designed. Such surfaces can be excited by near infrared light (NIR), with rare earth nanoparticles to upconvert the NIR light to visible range and adsorb by Au nanoparticles, supported by titanium oxide porous film on titanium implants. Under NIR irradiation, the implant converts the energy of phonon to hot electrons and lattice vibrations, while the former flows directly to the contact substance or partially reacts with the surrounding to generate reactive oxygen species, and the latter leads to the local temperature increase. The biofilm or microbes on the implant surface can be eradicated by NIR treatment in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the surface exhibits superior biocompatibility for cell survival, adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation, which provides the foundation for osseointegration. In vivo implantation experiments demonstrate osseointegration is also promoted. This work thus demonstrates NIR&#8208;generated electrons can sequentially eradicate biofilms and regulate the osteogenic process, providing new solutions to fabricate efficient implant surfaces.

         <title>A Janus&#8208;ROS Healing System Promoting Infectious Bone Regeneration via Sono&#8208;Epigenetic Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus&#8208;reactive oxygen species healing system based on alendronate&#8208;mediated defective metal&#8211;organic framework sonosensitizer is developed, which can effectively clear Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections and promote osteogenic differentiation under differential ultrasonic irradiation for infectious bone regeneration.








Abstract
Elimination of bacterial infections and simultaneously promoting osteogenic differentiation are highly required for infectious bone diseases. Massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage cells, while low ROS concentrations as a molecular signal can regulate cellular fate. In this study, a Janus&#8208;ROS healing system is developed for infectious bone regeneration. An alendronate (ALN)&#8208;mediated defective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) sonosensitizer is prepared, which can effectively clear Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections and promote osteogenic differentiation under differential ultrasonic irradiation. In the presence of zirconium&#8211;phosphate coordination, the ALN&#8208;mediated porphyrin&#8208;based MOF (HN25) with a proper defect has great sonodynamic antibacterial efficiency (98.97%, 15&#160;min) and bone&#8208;targeting ability. Notably, under low&#8208;power ultrasound irradiation, HN25 can increase the chromatin accessibility of ossification&#8208;related genes and FOXO1 to promote bone repair through low ROS concentrations. Animal models of paravertebral infection, fracture with infection, and osteomyelitis demonstrate that HN25 successfully realizes the targeted and potent repair of various infectious bone tissues through rapid MRSA elimination, inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting bone regeneration. The results show that high catalytic efficiency and bioactive MOF can be constructed using pharmaceutical&#8208;mediated defect engineering. The Janus&#8208;ROS treatment is also a promising therapeutic mode for infectious tissue regeneration.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel tandem photon avalanches (TPA) strategy for various emitters with huge optical nonlinearity up to 41st&#8208;order through interfacial energy transfer is presented. The avalanched 800&#8208;nm Tm3+ emission non&#8208;radiatively pumps Er3+ to exhibit bright PA at a low threshold. Efficient avalanching behaviors are also observed for Ho3+, Ce3+, and blue emission of Tm3+ through the TPA mechanism.








Abstract
Photon avalanche has received continuous attention owing to its superior nonlinear dynamics and promising advanced applications. However, its impact is limited due to the intrinsic energy levels as well as the harsh requirements for the composites and sizes of doped materials. Here, with a universal mechanism named tandem photon avalanche (TPA), giant optical nonlinear response up to 41st&#8208;order in erbium ions, one of the most important lanthanide emitters, has been achieved on the nanoscale through interfacial energy transfer process. After capturing energy directly from the avalanched energy state 3H4 of Tm3+ (800&#8208;nm emission), erbium ions also exhibit bright green and red PA emissions with intensities comparable to that of Tm3+ at a low excitation threshold (7.1 kWcm&#8722;2). Using the same strategy, effective PA looping cycles are successfully activated in Ce3+ and Ho3+. Additionally, Yb3+&#8208;mediated networks are constructed to further propagate PA effects to lowly&#8208;doped Tm3+, enabling 475&#8208;nm PA emission. The newly proposed TPA strategy provides a facile route for generating photon avalanche not only from erbium ions but also from various emitters in multilayered core&#8211;shell nanoparticles.

         <title>Piezoionic High Performance Hydrogel Generator and Active Protein Absorber via Microscopic Porosity and Phase Blending</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potent piezoionic electricity is achieved in a porous and phase hybrid hydrogel, taking advantage of the engineered differences in flow velocities between sodium and chloride ions upon mechanical stimuli. Dynamic voltages up to 600&#160;mV and effective protein adsorptions are obtained. Potential application in nerve function adjustment, mimetic tactile sensors, hydrogel P/N heterojunction building, and enzyme immobilization are proposed.








Abstract
Generating electricity in hydrogel is very important but remains difficult. Hydrogel with electricity generation capability is more capable in bio&#8208;relevant tasks such as tissue engineering, artificial skin, or medical treatment, because electricity is indispensable in regulating physiological activities. Here, a porous and phase blending hydrogel structure for effective piezoionic electricity generation is developed. Dynamic electric field is generated taking advantage of the difference in streaming speeds of sodium and chloride in the material. Microscopic porosity and hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic phase blending are the two key factors for prominent piezoionic performance. Voltages as high as 600&#160;mV are first realized in hydrogels in response to medical ultrasound stimulation. The hydrogel structure is also subjective to effective substance exchange and can actively enrich proteins from surroundings under mechanical stimuli. Preliminary applications in neural stimulation, constructing complex spatial&#8208;temporal chemical and electric field distribution patterns, mimetic tactile sensor, sample pretreatment in fast detection, and enzyme immobilization are demonstrated.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Non&#8208;Metallic Fenton&#8208;Active Center Construction for Extensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;metallic &#8220;Fenton&#8208;active&#8221; center construction strategy is proposed to catalyze the decomposition of H2O2 and H2O and enhance &#183;OH yield using Bi0.44Ba0.06Na0.5TiO2.97 nanocrystals. The built&#8208;in electric field and electron&#8208;rich oxygen vacancies promote &#183;OH yield even in the tumor area with a low H2O2 concentration, resulting in extensive cellular damage and enhanced cell&#8208;killing efficiency by activating the necroptosis pathway.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is an emerging tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive cancer therapeutic strategy based on Fenton/Fenton&#8208;like reactions. However, the effectiveness of CDT is subject to the slow kinetic rate and non&#8208;homogeneous distribution of H2O2. In this study, a conceptual non&#8208;metallic &#8220;Fenton&#8208;active&#8221; center construction strategy is proposed to enhance CDT efficiency using Bi0.44Ba0.06Na0.5TiO2.97 (BNBT&#8208;6) nanocrystals. The separated charge carriers under a piezoelectric&#8208;induced electric field synchronize the oxidation of H2O and reduction of H2O2, which consequently increases hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) yield even under low H2O2 levels. Moreover, acceptor doping induces electron&#8208;rich oxygen vacancies to facilitate the dissociation of H2O2 and H2O and further promote &#183;OH generation. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that BNBT&#8208;6 induces extensive intracellular oxidative stress and enhances cell&#8208;killing efficiency by activating necroptosis in addition to the conventional apoptotic pathway. This study proposes a novel design approach for nanomaterials used in CDT and presents a new treatment strategy for apoptosis&#8208;resistant tumors.

         <title>An Ultrafast Air Self&#8208;Charging Zinc Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrafast air self&#8208;charging Zn/polyaniline@Pt/C (Zn/PANI@Pt/C) battery is developed. Benefiting from the Pt/C catalysis, the reaction kinetics of the redox reaction between PANI and O2 is accelerated and the redox potential difference between them is extended due to the reduced overpotential of oxygen reduction reaction. Therefore, the Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries exhibit superior self&#8208;charging performance compared with typical Zn/PANI batteries.








Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging power systems possess the capability of energy harvesting, conversion, and storage simultaneously. However, in general, their self&#8208;charging rate is slow and the batteries cannot be oxidized to the fully charged state due to the weak oxidizability of O2. Herein, an ultrafast air self&#8208;charging aqueous zinc battery is designed by constructing a polyaniline@Pt/C (PANI@Pt/C)&#160;composite cathode. The introduction of Pt/C catalyst endows the redox reaction between PANI and O2 with fast reaction kinetics and extended redox potential difference. Therefore, the self&#8208;charging rate of the Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries is effectively accelerated and they can be self&#8208;charged to fully charged state. Furthermore, the PANI can be recharged by O2 simultaneously during discharging process to compensate the consumed electrical energy, achieving prolonged energy supply. In addition, the PANI@Pt/C cathodes can be directly used as the cathodes of flexible self&#8208;charging zinc batteries due to their excellent mechanical properties. As a proof of concept, flexible soft&#8208;packaged Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries are fabricated and displayed stable electrochemical performance and self&#8208;rechargeability even at different bending states. A route is provided here to design ultrafast chemical self&#8208;charging energy storage devices and the horizons of flexible energy storage devices are broadened.

         <title>Synergizing a Large Ordinary Nernst Effect and Axis&#8208;Dependent Conduction Polarity in Flat Band KMgBi Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The layered flat band material, KMgBi, simultaneously exhibits axis&#8208;dependent conduction polarity, which produces a large transverse thermoelectric effect (&#8776;46 &#181;V K&#8722;1), and ordinary Nernst effect (ONE) that greatly boosts this effect (&#8776;198 &#181;V K&#8722;1) with a 1.4 T magnetic field. The presence of both effects in one material enables an experimental understanding on their synergistic combination for transverse thermoelectric devices.








Abstract
The exploration of quantum materials in which an applied thermo/electrical/magnetic field along one crystallographic direction produces an anisotropic response has led to unique functionalities. Along these lines, KMgBi is a layered, narrow gap semiconductor near a critical state between multiple Dirac phases due to the presence of a flat band near the Fermi level.

&lt;p&gt;The layered flat band material, KMgBi, simultaneously exhibits axis-dependent conduction polarity, which produces a large transverse thermoelectric effect (&#8776;46 &#181;V K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and ordinary Nernst effect (ONE) that greatly boosts this effect (&#8776;198 &#181;V K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with a 1.4 T magnetic field. The presence of both effects in one material enables an experimental understanding on their synergistic combination for transverse thermoelectric devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exploration of quantum materials in which an applied thermo/electrical/magnetic field along one crystallographic direction produces an anisotropic response has led to unique functionalities. Along these lines, KMgBi is a layered, narrow gap semiconductor near a critical state between multiple Dirac phases due to the presence of a flat band near the Fermi level. The valence band is highly anisotropic with minimal cross-plane dispersion, which, in combination with an isotropic conduction band, enables axis-dependent conduction polarity. Thermopower and Hall measurements indicate dominant p-type conduction along the cross-plane direction, and n-type conduction along the in-plane direction, leading to a significant zero-field transverse thermoelectric response when the heat flux is at an angle to the principal crystallographic directions. Additionally, a large Ordinary Nernst effect (ONE) is observed with an applied field.&#160; It arises from the ambipolar term in the Nernst effect, whereby the Lorentz force on electrons and holes makes them drift in opposite directions so that the resulting Nernst voltage becomes a function of the difference between their partial thermopowers, greatly enhancing the ONE. It is proven that axis-dependent polarity&#160;can synergistically enhance the ONE, in addition to leading to a zero-field transverse thermoelectric performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanical Actuation via Homeomorphic Transformations of Topological Solitons within Polymer Coatings</title>

The response of a topological soliton embedded in a liquid crystal network. Upon thermal stimulus, complex reversible modulations are observed. For example, a field of valleys turn into protrusions with a modulation of 40%. The results are in agreement with the numerical model. This technology is expected to broaden the range of applications from tunable optical devices to tribology applications.








Abstract
Topological solitons are currently under investigation for their exotic properties, especially in nonlinear physics, optics, and material sciences. However, challenges of robust generation and limited stability over time have hindered their practical uses. To address this issue, an approach is developed to form structured arrays of solitons in films of polymerizable liquid crystals. Their complex molecular architecture is preserved by in situ photopolymerization forming a stable liquid crystal network. Most excitingly, their properties are advanced to include responsiveness functions. When thermally actuated, these topological solitons mediate the reconfiguration of surface topographies. Complex shape changes occur depending on the intrinsic complex spatial distribution of the director, which may even lead to full shape inversion and topographical changes as high as &#8776;40% of the initial thickness. Conversely, the shape changes provide information on the initial director profile, which is consistent with the mathematical model. The soliton&#8208;containing polymer coatings are applicable in multiple domains, ranging from tunable optics to haptics, and from shape&#8208;coupled sensing systems to temperature&#8208;coupled heat management.

         <title>A Cardiac&#8208;Targeted Nanozyme Interrupts the Inflammation&#8208;Free Radical Cycle in Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inflammation&#8208;free radicals cycle after myocardial infarction (MI) leads to heart failure and patient death. This work creates a Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme for cardiac&#8208;targeted myocardial infarction therapy, with powerful anti&#8208;inflammatory and free radical scavenging properties. In mice and beagle dog MI models, it can improve cardiac function and reduce scarring, showing potential for clinical use in heart disease.








Abstract
Severe systemic inflammation following myocardial infarction (MI) is a major cause of patient mortality. MI&#8208;induced inflammation can trigger the production of free radicals, which in turn ultimately leads to increased inflammation in cardiac lesions (i.e., inflammation&#8208;free radicals cycle), resulting in heart failure and patient death. However, currently available anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs have limited efficacy due to their weak anti&#8208;inflammatory effect and poor accumulation at the cardiac site. Herein, a novel Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme is developed for targeted therapy of MI, which is generated by coordinating Fe3+ and anti&#8208;inflammatory drug curcumin (Cur) with further modification of tannic acid (TA). Such Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme exhibits excellent free radicals scavenging and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties by reducing immune cell infiltration, promoting macrophage polarization toward the M2&#8208;like phenotype, suppressing inflammatory cytokine secretion, and blocking the inflammatory free radicals cycle. Furthermore, due to the high affinity of TA for cardiac tissue, Fe&#8208;Cur@TA shows an almost tenfold greater in cardiac retention and uptake than Fe&#8208;Cur. In mouse and preclinical beagle dog MI models, Fe&#8208;Cur@TA nanozyme preserves cardiac function and reduces scar size, suggesting promising potential for clinical translation in cardiovascular disease.

         <title>Scalable Solution&#8208;Processed Hybrid Electron Transport Layers for Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an electron transport layer ink is designed using hybrid fullerenes composed of mixed C60, phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester, and indene&#8208;C60 bisadduct. This electron transport layer exhibits high conductivity, good energy&#8208;level alignment, and low interfacial nonradiative recombination. The all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.3% (aperture area = 20.25 cm2).








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells offer the potential to surpass the Shockley&#8211;Queisser (SQ) limit efficiency of single&#8208;junction solar cells while maintaining the advantages of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;productivity solution processing. However, scalable solution processing of electron transport layer (ETL) in p&#8208;i&#8208;n structured perovskite solar subcells remains challenging due to the rough perovskite film surface and energy level mismatch between ETL and perovskites. Here, scalable solution processing of hybrid fullerenes (HF) with blade&#8208;coating on both wide&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.80 eV) and narrow&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.25 eV) perovskite films in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules is developed. The HF, comprising a mixture of fullerene (C60), phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester, and indene&#8208;C60 bisadduct, exhibits improved conductivity, superior energy level alignment with both wide&#8208; and narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites, and reduced interfacial nonradiative recombination when compared to the conventional thermal&#8208;evaporated C60. With scalable solution&#8208;processed HF as the ETLs, the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.3% (aperture area = 20.25 cm2). This study paves the way to all&#8208;solution processing of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar modules in the future.

         <title>Optical Nonlinearity Enabled Super&#8208;Resolved Multiplexing Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexing is of great significance in biology, medicine, and microscopic imaging. Here, a new approach is introduced using the optical nonlinearity of lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for super&#8208;resolved multiplexing microscopy. By applying a vortex beam, imaging resolution is enhanced and UCNPs are differentiated based on their distinctive nonlinearities. This enables a complementary dimension to spectral, temporal, and polarized dimensions for nanoscale multiplexing.








Abstract
Optical multiplexing for nanoscale object recognition is of great significance within the intricate domains of biology, medicine, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and microscopic imaging. Traditionally, the multiplexing dimensions of nanoscopy are limited to emission intensity, color, lifetime, and polarization. Here, a novel dimension, optical nonlinearity, is proposed for super&#8208;resolved multiplexing microscopy. This optical nonlinearity is attributable to the energy transitions between multiple energy levels of the doped lanthanide ions in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), resulting in unique optical fingerprints for UCNPs with different compositions. A vortex beam is applied to transport the optical nonlinearity onto the imaging point&#8208;spread function (PSF), creating a robust super&#8208;resolved multiplexing imaging strategy for differentiating UCNPs with distinctive optical nonlinearities. The composition information of the nanoparticles can be retrieved with variations of the corresponding PSF in the obtained image. Four channels multiplexing super&#8208;resolved imaging with a single scanning, applying emission color and nonlinearity of two orthogonal imaging dimensions with a spatial resolution higher than 150&#160;nm (1/6.5&#955;), are demonstrated. This work provides a new and orthogonal dimension &#8211; optical nonlinearity &#8211; to existing multiplexing dimensions, which shows great potential in bioimaging, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, microarray assays, deep tissue multiplexing detection, and high&#8208;density data storage.

Four channels multiplexing super-resolved imaging with a single scanning, applying emission color and nonlinearity of two orthogonal imaging dimensions with a spatial resolution higher than 150&#160;nm (1/6.5&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;), are demonstrated. This work provides a new and orthogonal dimension &#8211; optical nonlinearity &#8211; to existing multiplexing dimensions, which shows great potential in bioimaging, anti-counterfeiting, microarray assays, deep tissue multiplexing detection, and high-density data storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Band Structure Engineering and Orbital Orientation Control Constructing Dual Active Sites for Efficient Sulfur Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interaction trend among redox reactions affect evolutionarily electrocatalytic activity. Using WS2 as an example, band structure engineering and orbital orientation control are combined to construct Li&#8722;S and S&#8722;B dual&#8208;coordination, accurately modulating the interaction trend to accelerate the rate&#8208;determined process. This work presents a dual&#8208;coordination design for advancing evolutionarily catalytic activity, helping with effective catalyst design for practical Li&#8722;S batteries.








Abstract
The kinetics difference among multistep electrochemical processes leads to the accumulation of soluble polysulfides and thus shuttle effect in lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. While the interaction between catalysts and representative species has been reported, the root of the kinetics difference, interaction change among redox reactions, remains unclear, which significantly impedes the catalysts design for Li&#8722;S batteries. Here, this work deciphers the interaction change among electrocatalytic sulfur reactions, using tungsten disulfide (WS2) a model system to demonstrate the efficiency of modifying electrocatalytic selectivity via dual&#8208;coordination design. Band structure engineering and orbital orientation control are combined to guide the design of WS2 with boron dopants and sulfur vacancies (B&#8722;WS2&#8722;x), accurately modulating interaction with lithium and sulfur sites in polysulfide species for relatively higher interaction with short&#8208;chain polysulfides. The modified interaction trend is experimentally confirmed by distinguishing the kinetics of each electrochemical reaction step, indicating the effectiveness of the designed strategy. An Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with B&#8722;WS2&#8722;x delivers a gravimetric energy density of up to 417.6 Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 3.6&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1 and negative/positive ratio of 1.2. This work presents a dual&#8208;coordination strategy for advancing evolutionarily catalytic activity, offering a rational strategy to develop effective catalysts for practical Li&#8722;S batteries.

The heterogeneous integration of cesium lead bromide LEDs and molybdenum disulfide&#8208;based thin&#8208;film transistors enables the fabrication of active&#8208;matrix perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode (PeLED) display. The single&#8208;source evaporation method enables the deposition of uniform perovskite thin films over large areas. The fabricated active&#8208;matrix display exhibits excellent brightness control capability and a high switching speed, indicating the potential of PeLED as a promising light source.








Abstract
The uniform deposition of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) and their integration with backplane thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) remain challenging for large&#8208;area display applications. Herein, an active&#8208;matrix PeLED display fabricated via the heterogeneous integration of cesium lead bromide LEDs and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)&#8208;based TFTs is presented. The single&#8208;source evaporation method enables the deposition of highly uniform perovskite thin films over large areas. PeLEDs are integrated with MoS2 TFTs to fabricate an active&#8208;matrix PeLED display with an 8 &#215; 8 array, which exhibits excellent brightness control capability and high switching speed. This study demonstrates the potential of PeLEDs as candidates for next&#8208;generation displays and presents a novel approach for fabricating optoelectronic devices via the heterogeneous integration of 2D materials and perovskites, thereby paving the way toward the fabrication of practical future optoelectronic systems.

         <title>Breadmaking&#8208;Inspired Antioxidant Porous Yeast Microcarriers for Stem Cell Delivery in Diabetic Wound Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work represents an innovative application of breadmaking principle in the creation of porous microcarriers for adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ADSCs) delivery (ADSC@YMC) to treat diabetic wound. Simultaneously, the release of glutathione (GSH) from the yeast imparts antioxidative qualities to the microcarriers, ultimately extending the viability and retention of ADSCs.








Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;based therapies have exhibited significant promise in the treatment of diabetic ulcers (DU). Nevertheless, enhancing the survival rate and functionality of transplanted stem cells poses a substantial challenge. In this study, inspired by the breadmaking process, yeast microcarriers (YMC) are devised as vehicles for stem cells to address these challenges. The fabrication of YMC involves the amalgamation of microfluidic emulsification with yeast&#8208;mediated fermentation, yielding microcarriers with outstanding biocompatibility, high porosity, and antioxidant activity. Adipose&#8208;derived stem cells (ADSCs) seeded onto YMC display remarkable cell viability and retain their cellular functions effectively. Additionally, YMC boast a rich glutathione content and exhibit remarkable ROS scavenging ability, thus shielding the ADSCs from oxidative stress. In vivo experiments further substantiate that ADSC@YMC implementation significantly lowered ROS levels in diabetic wounds, resulting in enhanced stem cell retention and improved angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and tissue regeneration. These results highlight the potential of ADSC@YMC as a promising platform for delivering stem cell in the treatment of diabetic wounds.

         <title>Massively Scalable Self&#8208;Assembly of Nano and Microparticle Monolayers via Aerosol Assisted Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled colloidal lithography provides a cost effective and simple strategy to produce submicron and nanoscale lithography. However, current self&#8208;assembly strategies have proved very challenging to scale and maintain highly ordered nanostructured arrays. A novel aerosol&#8208;based strategy is demonstrated to increase colloidal self&#8208;assembly rates as high as 268 cm2 min&#8722;1 and new physical mechanisms governing the self&#8208;assembly are discussed.








Abstract
An extremely rapid process for self&#8208;assembling well&#8208;ordered, nano, and microparticle monolayers via a novel aerosolized method is presented. The novel technique can reach monolayer self&#8208;assembly rates as high as 268 cm2 min&#8722;1 from a single aerosolizing source and methods to reach faster monolayer self&#8208;assembly rates are outlined. A new physical mechanism describing the self&#8208;assembly process is presented and new insights enabling high&#8208;efficiency nanoparticle monolayer self&#8208;assembly are developed. In addition, well&#8208;ordered monolayer arrays from particles of various sizes, surface functionality, and materials are fabricated. This new technique enables a 93&#215; increase in monolayer self&#8208;assembly rates compared to the current state of the art and has the potential to provide an extremely low&#8208;cost option for submicron nanomanufacturing.

A monocomponent and size&#8208;adjustable nano&#8208;computed tomography (CT) contrast agent is developed by utilizing a reactive oxygen species&#8208;responsive platform and a fluorogen with aggregation function for improved in vivo tumor CT imaging. The nano&#8208;CT contrast agent displays tumor&#8208;targeting property and can rapidly aggregate in tumor regions after activation, enhancing its retention efficiency and extending the imaging time window.








Abstract
Computed tomography (CT) is a widely utilized noninvasive diagnostic tool in clinical practice. However, the commonly employed small molecular iodinated contrast agents (ICAs) in clinical CT imaging have limitations such as nonspecific distribution in body, rapid clearance through kidneys, etc., leading to a narrow imaging time window. In contrast, existing nano&#8208;sized ICAs face challenges like structural uncertainty, poor reproducibility, low iodine content, and uniformity issues. In this study, a novel approach is presented utilizing the aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) to design and fabricate a kind of monocomponent nano&#8208;sized ICA (namely, BioDHU&#8208;CT NPs) that exhibits a unique aggregation effect upon activation. The small sized BioDHU&#8208;CT nanoparticles exhibit excellent tumor targeting capabilities and can release ICA modified with AIEgen with a high release efficiency up to 88.45%, under the activation of reactive oxygen species highly expressed in tumor regions. The released ICA performs in situ aggregation capability in the tumor region, which can enhance the retention efficiency of CT contrast agents, extending the imaging time window and improving the imaging quality in tumor regions.

         <title>Rational Medium&#8208;Range Charge Transfer Strategy Toward Highly Efficient Violet&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Narrowed Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the wide&#8208;bandgap emitter fusing two ultraviolet multiple resonance fragments via a unique double&#8208;halide cyclized coupling reaction is presented. The resulting molecule can simultaneously achieve efficient violet&#8208;blue emission and narrowed spectra. The fabricated violet&#8208;blue electroluminescent device exhibits ideal performances with a high maximum external quantum efficiency of 20.5%.








Abstract
The spectral narrowing engineering of pure&#8208;organic emitters attracts great research interests in realizing high color purity. Here, the adjusted medium&#8208;range charge transfer (MCT) strategy of TIC&#8208;BO with rigid planar structure by fusing two typical UV&#8208;emitting multiple resonance (MR) fragments via the ingenious double&#8208;halide cyclized coupling reaction is reported. The resulting TIC&#8208;BO with MCT nature shows efficient violet&#8208;blue emission in dilute toluene and evaporated host&#8211;guest films, and desirably narrowed spectra are achieved by the suppression of structural relaxation and the shortened charge transfer states. The single&#8208;doped device with TIC&#8208;BO as emitter shows narrowed violet&#8208;blue electroluminescence peaked at 428&#160;nm with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 43&#160;nm (0.28&#160;eV), and the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.160, 0.050). A maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 20.50% is achieved, which is among the best results of the corresponding violet&#8208;blue emitting region. Further introduction of a stronger electron&#8208;donating carbazole group makes TIC&#8208;BNO exhibit red&#8208;shifted sky&#8208;blue emission with MR&#8208;dominant properties, and good device performance is received with EQEmax of 34.58%. The outstanding performances of TIC&#8208;BO successfully demonstrate the significance and prospect of the proposed molecular design strategy.

         <title>Correlating Single&#8208;Atomic Ruthenium Interdistance with Long&#8208;Range Interaction Boosts Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ru&#8208;based correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs) with different and precise single&#8208;atomic interdistances are constructed via a combination of planar organometallic molecular design and &#960;&#8211;&#960; molecule&#8211;carbon nanotube confinement, for systematic investigation of the structure&#8211;activity relationship at the atomic level, precisely manipulating the electrostatic force using the atomic structure and leading to severalfold enhancement in the activity of c&#8208;SACs with multimetal sites.








Abstract
Correlated single&#8208;atom catalysts (c&#8208;SACs) with tailored intersite metal&#8211;metal interactions are superior to conventional catalysts with isolated metal sites. However, precise quantification of the single&#8208;atomic interdistance (SAD) in c&#8208;SACs is not yet achieved, which is essential for a crucial understanding and remarkable improvement of the correlated metal&#8208;site&#8208;governed catalytic reaction kinetics. Here, three Ru c&#8208;SACs are fabricated with precise SAD using a planar organometallic molecular design and &#960;&#8211;&#960; molecule&#8211;carbon nanotube confinement. This strategy results in graded SAD from 2.4 to 9.3 &#197; in the Ru c&#8208;SACs, wherein tailoring the Ru SAD into 7.0 &#197; generates an exceptionally high turnover frequency of 17.92 H2 s&#8722;1 and a remarkable mass activity of 100.4 A mg&#8722;1 under 50 and 100 mV overpotentials, respectively, which is superior to all the Ru&#8208;based catalysts reported previously. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations confirm that Ru SAD has a negative correlation with its d&#8208;band center owing to the long&#8208;range interactions induced by distinct local atomic geometries, resulting in an appropriate electrostatic potential and the highest catalytic activity on c&#8208;SACs with 7.0 &#197; Ru SAD. The present study promises an attractive methodology for experimentally quantifying the metal SAD to provide valuable insights into the catalytic mechanism of c&#8208;SACs.

A nano/genetically engineered sonosensitive extracellular vesicles are rationally designed for ultrasound nanomedicine&#8208;triggered tumor immuno&#8208;reediting therapeutic by efficiently inducing tumor immunogenic PANoptosis and iteratively boosting cancer innate immunity cycle. This specific regulated cell death renders tumor cells highly immunogenic through maximally activating damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby reprogramming negative immune microenvironment and advancing positive adaptive antitumor immune response.








Abstract
The cancer&#8208;immune cycle conceptualized the mechanisms of driving T cell responses to tumors, but w as limited by immunological ignorance elicited by tumor inherent immunoediting, which failed to initiate and maintain adaptive immunity. Targeting specific vulnerabilities of cell death patterns may provide unique opportunities to boost T cell antitumor immunological effects. Here an ultrasound nanomedicine&#8208;triggered tumor immuno&#8208;reediting therapeutic strategy using nano/genetically engineered extracellular vesicles, which can induce tumor highly immunogenic PANoptosis and iteratively start&#8208;up the energization of cancer innate immunity cycle by repeatedly liberating damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby priming sufficient antigen&#8208;specific T cells and shaping protective immune response through activating cGAS&#8208;STING signaling pathways, is reported. Aided by immune checkpoint blockade, the reprogramming of immune microenvironment further facilitated a prompt bridging of innate and adaptive immunity, and remarkably suppressed metastatic and rechallenged tumor growth. Thus, targeting PANoptotic cell death provides a catcher against immune escape and a positive&#8208;feedback immune activation gateway for overcoming immune resistance to intractable cancers.

         <title>Intrafibrillar Crosslinking Enables Decoupling of Mechanical Properties and Structure of a Composite Fibrous Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the controllable intrafibrillar photocrosslinking, a composite fibrous hydrogel enables the variation in hydrogel stiffness without changing its architecture. For fibroblasts seeded on this gel, a sole increase in gel stiffness results in stronger contraction forces and activation.








Abstract
The fibrous network of an extracellular matrix (ECM) possesses mechanical properties that convey critical biological functions in cell mechanotransduction. Engineered fibrous hydrogels show promise in emulating key aspects of ECM structure and functions. However, varying hydrogel mechanics without changing its architecture remains a challenge. A composite fibrous hydrogel is developed to vary gel stiffness without affecting its structure by controlling intrafibrillar crosslinking. The hydrogel is formed from aldehyde&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals and gelatin methacryloyl that provide the capability of intrafibrillar photocrosslinking. By varying the degree of gelatin functionalization with methacryloyl groups and/or photoirradiation time, the hydrogel's elastic modulus is changed by more than an order of magnitude, while preserving the same fiber diameter and pore size. The hydrogel is used to seed primary mouse lung fibroblasts and test the role of ECM stiffness on fibroblast contraction and activation. Increasing hydrogel stiffness by stronger intrafibrillar crosslinking results in enhanced fibroblast activation and increased fibroblast contraction force, yet at a reduced contraction speed. The developed approach enables the fabrication of biomimetic hydrogels with decoupled structural and mechanical properties, facilitating studies of ECM mechanics on tissue development and disease progression.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fibrous network of an extracellular matrix (ECM) possesses mechanical properties that convey critical biological functions in cell mechanotransduction. Engineered fibrous hydrogels show promise in emulating key aspects of ECM structure and functions. However, varying hydrogel mechanics without changing its architecture remains a challenge. A composite fibrous hydrogel is developed to vary gel stiffness without affecting its structure by controlling intrafibrillar crosslinking. The hydrogel is formed from aldehyde-modified cellulose nanocrystals and gelatin methacryloyl that provide the capability of intrafibrillar photocrosslinking. By varying the degree of gelatin functionalization with methacryloyl groups and/or photoirradiation time, the hydrogel's elastic modulus is changed by more than an order of magnitude, while preserving the same fiber diameter and pore size. The hydrogel is used to seed primary mouse lung fibroblasts and test the role of ECM stiffness on fibroblast contraction and activation. Increasing hydrogel stiffness by stronger intrafibrillar crosslinking results in enhanced fibroblast activation and increased fibroblast contraction force, yet at a reduced contraction speed. The developed approach enables the fabrication of biomimetic hydrogels with decoupled structural and mechanical properties, facilitating studies of ECM mechanics on tissue development and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Boron and Nitrogen Isotope Effects on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride crystals with controlled concentrations of the boron (10B and 11B) and nitrogen (14N and 15N) isotopes are synthesized and their optical properties are measured, including their Raman spectra. This provides a method for tailoring hBN's optical and nuclear spin properties for specific applications.








Abstract
The unique physical, mechanical, chemical, optical, and electronic properties of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) make it a promising 2D material for electronic, optoelectronic, nanophotonic, and quantum devices. Here, the changes in hBN's properties induced by isotopic purification in both boron and nitrogen are reported. Previous studies on isotopically pure hBN have focused on purifying the boron isotope concentration in hBN from its natural concentration (&#8776;20 at% 10B, 80 at% 11B) while using naturally abundant nitrogen (99.6 at% 14N, 0.4 at% 15N), that is, almost pure 14N. In this study, the class of isotopically purified hBN crystals to 15N is extended. Crystals in the four configurations, namely h10B14N, h11B14N, h10B15N, and h11B15N, are grown by the metal flux method using boron and nitrogen single isotope (&gt; 99%) enriched sources, with nickel plus chromium as the solvent. In&#8208;depth Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies demonstrate the high quality of the monoisotopic hBN crystals with vibrational and optical properties of the 15N&#8208;purified crystals at the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of currently available 14N&#8208;purified hBN. The growth of high&#8208;quality h10B14N, h11B14N, h10B15N, and h11B15N opens exciting perspectives for thermal conductivity control in heat management, as well as for advanced functionalities in quantum technologies.

         <title>Architecture of Vanadium&#8208;Based MXene Dysregulating Tumor Redox Homeostasis for Amplified Nanozyme Catalytic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vanadium&#8208;based MXene nanoplatform is constructured for amplified nanozyme catalytic/ photothermal therapy, which displays favorable photothermal effect and nanozyme&#8208;catalyzed efficacy. Tumor hypoxia is relieved and lower thermal resistance contributes to photothermal therapy for further promoting enzycatalytic activity, which leads to a significant disruption of redox homeostasis and inhibition of tumor growth.








Abstract
Taking the significance of the special microenvironment for tumor cell survival into account, disrupting tumor redox homeostasis is highly prospective for improving therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a multifunctional 2D vanadium&#8208;based MXene nanoplatform, V4C3/atovaquone@bovine albumin (V4C3/ATO@BSA, abbreviated as VAB) has been elaborately constructed for ATO&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalytic/photothermal therapy. The redox homeostasis within the tumor cells is eventually disrupted, showing a remarkable anti&#8208;tumor effect. The VAB nanoplatform with mixed vanadium valence states can induce a cascade of catalyzed reactions in the tumor microenvironment, generating plenty of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with effective glutathione consumption to amplify oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the stable and strong photothermal effect of VAB under near&#8208;infrared irradiation not only causes the necrosis of tumor cells, but also improves its peroxidase&#8208;like activity. In addition, the release of ATO can effectively alleviate endogenous oxygen consumption to limit triphosadenine formation and inhibit mitochondrial respiration. As a result, the expression of heat shock proteins is effectively suppressed to overcome thermoresistance and the production of ROS can be further promoted due to mitochondrial injury. Moreover, VAB also presents high photoacoustic and photothermal imaging performances. In brief, the multifunctional nanoplatform can provide ATO&#8208;enhanced nanozyme catalytic/photothermal therapy with broadening the biomedical applications of vanadium&#8208;based MXene.

         <title>A Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Based on Li0.95Na0.05FePO4 for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible composite solid electrolyte based on Li0.95Na0.05FePO4 with excellent interface compatibility by a simple preparation method. Due to its excellent interfacial stability with lithium metal and cathodes, the lithium metal battery of Li||LFP at 0.5 C current density shows excellent cycling stability (151.5 mAh g&#8722;1 for 500 cycles, 96.5% capacity retention, and 99.3%).








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) play a crucial role in developing lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with high safety and energy density. Exploring SSEs with excellent comprehensive performance is the key to achieving the practical application of LMBs. In this work, the great potential of Li0.95Na0.05FePO4 (LNFP) as an ideal SSE due to its enhanced ionic conductivity and reliable stability in contact with lithium metal anode is demonstrated. Moreover, LNFP&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) are prepared to further improve electronic insulation and interface stability. The CSE containing 50 wt% of LNFP (LNFP50) shows high ionic conductivity (3.58 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and good compatibility with Li metal anode and cathodes. Surprisingly, the LMB of Li|LNFP50|LiFePO4 cell at 0.5 C current density shows good cycling stability (151.5 mAh g&#8722;1 for 500 cycles, 96.5% capacity retention, and 99.3% Coulombic efficiency), and high&#8208;energy LMB of Li|LNFP50|Li[Ni0.8Co0.1Mn0.1]O2 cell maintains 80% capacity retention after 170 cycles, which are better than that with traditional liquid electrolytes (LEs). This investigation offers a new approach to commercializing SSEs with excellent comprehensive performance for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts
In article number 2310699, Bowen Jiang, Cheng Chen, Zongkui Kou, and co&#8208;workers report the precise manipulation of single&#8208;atomic Ru interdistances via a planar organometallic molecular design. Assembling the Ru interdistance to a rational level produces long&#8208;range interaction for electrocatalysis, whereas the unassembled ones are &#8220;on tiptoes&#8221; outside electrocatalysis.

Microneedle Patches
Due to the challenges associated with the extraction of dermal interstitial fluid (ISF), the impact of ISF sampling in clinical applications has been limited. In article number 2304704, Levent Beker and co&#8208;workers propose a fully integrated wearable device that leverages a versatile hollow microneedle patch for ISF extraction using touch&#8208;activated vacuum pressure. The developed device can continuously sample and detect ISF biomarkers for long periods.

Living Hydrogels
When embedded inside 3D&#8208;printed hydrogels, cells from the eukaryotic microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grow in clusters predominantly located in the hydrogel periphery, where they benefit from increased gas exchange and access to light. CO2 capture efficiency increases proportionally with the exposed surface area of the living hydrogels. These findings, presented by Kunal Masania, Marie&#8208;Eve Aubin&#8208;Tam, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2305505 provide design parameters for the development of highly efficient 3D photosynthetic living materials.

Super&#8208;Resolved Multiplexing Microscopy
The optical nonlinearity of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles can be transported by a vortex excitation beam onto the imaging point spread function for differentiating single nanoparticles. In article number 2308844, Chaohao Chen, Faliang Cheng, Lan Fu, Xiaoxue Xu, Fan Wang, and co&#8208;workers propose a novel and efficient dimension, optical nonlinearity, for super&#8208;resolved multiplexing microscopy and demonstrate its orthogonal capacity to emission color in a four&#8208;channel multiplexed imaging.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Super-Resolved Multiplexing Microscopy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The optical nonlinearity of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles can be transported by a vortex excitation beam onto the imaging point spread function for differentiating single nanoparticles. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202308844"&gt;2308844&lt;/a&gt;, Chaohao Chen, Faliang Cheng, Lan Fu, Xiaoxue Xu, Fan Wang, and co-workers propose a novel and efficient dimension, optical nonlinearity, for super-resolved multiplexing microscopy and demonstrate its orthogonal capacity to emission color in a four-channel multiplexed imaging.

Lanthanide Halide Nanocrystals
Novel luminescent 0D lanthanide halide nanocrystals with bright narrow&#8208;band green emission are reported by Peigeng Han, Kun Zhao, Ruifeng Lu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2302140. The introduction of an ns2&#8208;cation dopant not only optimizes the crystallinity, but also greatly boosts the photoluminescence efficiency up to 48.1%. Furthermore, Cs3TbCl6:2.5%Sb nanocrystals are proved to serve as a promising nanoscintillator, which has versatile application prospects for lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging.

Electrochemical Microactuators
In article number 2304517, Mahdi Hamidinejad, Michael De Volder, and co&#8208;workers introduce a new type of ultralow&#8208;power electrochemical microactuator. These microsctructures are made out of lithographically defined 3D carbon nanotube architectures that are loaded with active materials that can alloy with lithium. Upon electrochemical lithiation and delithiation of that material, the microstructures are actuated reversibly.

         <title>Micro&#8208;/Nanohierarchical Structures Physically Engineered on Surfaces: Analysis and Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recent decades, significant progress has been achieved in micro&#8208;/nanohierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces. This review summarizes the recent advances in the development of such structures, provides a classification of their basic constituents according to function and shape, and discusses the related fabrication strategies, ways of combining basic components, potential applications, and future research directions.








Abstract
The high demand for micro&#8208;/nanohierarchical structures as components of functional substrates, bioinspired devices, energy&#8208;related electronics, and chemical/physical transducers has inspired their in&#8208;depth studies and active development of the related fabrication techniques. In particular, significant progress has been achieved in hierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces, which offer the advantages of wide&#8208;range material compatibility, design diversity, and mechanical stability, and numerous unique structures with important niche applications have been developed. This review categorizes the basic components of hierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces according to function/shape and comprehensively summarizes the related advances, focusing on the fabrication strategies, ways of combining basic components, potential applications, and future research directions. Moreover, the physicochemical properties of hierarchical structures physically engineered on surfaces are compared based on the function of their basic components, which may help to avoid the bottlenecks of conventional single&#8208;scale functional substrates. Thus, the present work is expected to provide a useful reference for scientists working on multicomponent functional substrates and inspire further research in this field.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembled Carbon Nitride Nanostructures for Photocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;inspired supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is an elegant bottom&#8208;up strategy to synthesize high surface area carbon nitride with superior morphological features and other semiconducting and catalytic properties in a facile and eco&#8208;friendly manner. The current review article provides a bird's eye view of supramolecular self&#8208;assembly synthesis of carbon nitride nanostructures and their photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting application and provides a comprehensive outlook.








Abstract
Fast production of hydrogen and oxygen in large amounts at an economic rate is the need of the hour to cater to the needs of the most awaited hydrogen energy, a futuristic renewable energy solution. Production of hydrogen through simple water splitting via visible light photocatalytic approach using sunlight is considered as one of the most promising and sustainable approaches for generating clean fuels. For this purpose, a variety of catalytic techniques and novel catalysts have been investigated. Among these catalysts, carbon nitride is presently deemed as one of the best candidates for the visible light photocatalysis due to its unique molecular structure and adequate visible&#8208;range bandgap. Its bandgap can be further engineered by structural and morphological manipulation or by doping/hybridization. Among numerous synthetic approaches for carbon nitrides, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is one of the recently developed elegant bottom&#8208;up strategies as it is bio&#8208;inspired and provides a facile and eco&#8208;friendly route to synthesize high surface area carbon nitride with superior morphological features and other semiconducting and catalytic properties. The current review article broadly covers supramolecular self&#8208;assembly synthesis of carbon nitride nanostructures and their photocatalytic water&#8208;splitting applications and provides a comprehensive outlook on future directions.

         <title>The Material World of 3D&#8208;Bioprinted and Microfluidic&#8208;Chip Models of Human Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials are essential components of disease models as they more precisely replicate interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix. In this review, the use of biomaterials in advanced 3D&#8208;bioprinted and microfluidic&#8208;chip in vitro models of human liver fibrosis are discussed, highlighting how mechanical and biochemical properties of the materials are explored to mimic the disease microenvironment in vitro.








Abstract
Biomaterials are extensively used to mimic cell&#8211;matrix interactions, which are essential for cell growth, function, and differentiation. This is particularly relevant when developing in vitro disease models of organs rich in extracellular matrix, like the liver. Liver disease involves a chronic wound&#8208;healing response with formation of scar tissue known as fibrosis. At early stages, liver disease can be reverted, but as disease progresses, reversion is no longer possible, and there is no cure. Research for new therapies is hampered by the lack of adequate models that replicate the mechanical properties and biochemical stimuli present in the fibrotic liver. Fibrosis is associated with changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix that directly influence cell behavior. Biomaterials could play an essential role in better emulating the disease microenvironment. In this paper, the recent and cutting&#8208;edge biomaterials used for creating in vitro models of human liver fibrosis are revised, in combination with cells, bioprinting, and/or microfluidics. These technologies have been instrumental to replicate the intricate structure of the unhealthy tissue and promote medium perfusion that improves cell growth and function, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of the impact of material hints and cell&#8211;material interactions in a tridimensional context is provided.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks and Their Composites for Chronic Wound Healing: From Bench to Bedside</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article highlights recent representative research progress using metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their composites with antibacterial effects and pro&#8208;angiogenic activity for the treatment of chronic wounds.








Abstract
Chronic wounds are characterized by delayed and dysregulated healing processes. As such, they have emerged as an increasingly significant threat. The associated morbidity and socioeconomic toll are clinically and financially challenging, necessitating novel approaches in the management of chronic wounds. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are an innovative type of porous coordination polymers, with low toxicity and high eco&#8208;friendliness. Documented anti&#8208;bacterial effects and pro&#8208;angiogenic activity predestine these nanomaterials as promising systems for the treatment of chronic wounds. In this context, the therapeutic applicability and efficacy of MOFs remain to be elucidated. It is, therefore, reviewed the structural&#8211;functional properties of MOFs and their composite materials and discusses how their multifunctionality and customizability can be leveraged as a clinical therapy for chronic wounds.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Ion Engineering Strategies toward High Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes and names various types of multi&#8208;ion engineering strategies. The recent advances of aqueous multi&#8208;ion zinc&#8208;based batteries are presented, and the reaction mechanisms, application effects, merits, and disadvantages of different multi&#8208;ion strategies are comprehensively evaluated to provide guidance for the development of ideal aqueous multi&#8208;ion zinc&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
As alternatives to batteries with organic electrolytes, aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (AZBs) have been intensively studied. However, the sluggish kinetics, side reactions, structural collapse, and dissolution of the cathode severely compromise the commercialization of AZBs. Among various strategies to accelerate their practical applications, multi&#8208;ion engineering shows great feasibility to maintain the original structure of the cathode and provide sufficient energy density for high&#8208;performance AZBs. Though multi&#8208;ion engineering strategies could solve most of the problems encountered by AZBs and show great potential in achieving practical AZBs, the comprehensive summaries of the batteries undergo electrochemical reactions involving more than one charge carrier is still in deficiency. The ambiguous nomenclature and classification are becoming the fountainhead of confusion and chaos. In this circumstance, this review overviews all the battery configurations and the corresponding reaction mechanisms are investigated in the multi&#8208;ion engineering of aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries. By combing through all the reported works, this is the first to nomenclate the different configurations according to the reaction mechanisms of the additional ions, laying the foundation for future unified discussions. The performance enhancement, fundamental challenges, and future developing direction of multi&#8208;ion strategies are accordingly proposed, aiming to further accelerate the pace to achieve the commercialization of AZBs with high performance.

Abstract
Atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) oxide crystals have garnered considerable attention because of their remarkable physical properties and potential for versatile applications. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in the design, preparation, and application of ultrathin 2D oxides, providing many opportunities for new&#8208;generation advanced technologies. This review focuses on the controllable preparation of 2D oxide crystals and their applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Based on their bonding nature, the various types of 2D oxide crystals are first summarized, including both layered and nonlayered crystals, as well as their current top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up synthetic approaches. Subsequently, in terms of the unique physical and electrical properties of 2D oxides, recent advances in device applications are emphasized, including photodetectors, field&#8208;effect transistors, dielectric layers, magnetic and ferroelectric devices, memories, and gas sensors. Finally, conclusions and future prospects of 2D oxide crystals are presented. It is hoped that this review will provide comprehensive and insightful guidance for the development of 2D oxide crystals and their device applications.

         <title>Nanoscale Metal Particle Modified Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst: Synthesis, Characterization, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the latest development of nanoscale metal particle modified single&#8208;atom catalysts (NMP&#8208;SACs) from the aspects of synthesis, characterization techniques, and catalytic applications. The mechanism behind their superior performance in various catalytic applications is discussed. The review ends with relevant challenges and perspectives of NMP&#8208;SACs in the future.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted considerable attention in heterogeneous catalysis because of their well&#8208;defined active sites, maximum atomic utilization efficiency, and unique unsaturated coordinated structures. However, their effectiveness is limited to reactions requiring active sites containing multiple metal atoms. Furthermore, the loading amounts of single&#8208;atom sites must be restricted to prevent aggregation, which can adversely affect the catalytic performance despite the high activity of the individual atoms. The introduction of nanoscale metal particles (NMPs) into SACs (NMP&#8208;SACs) has proven to be an efficient approach for improving their catalytic performance. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to systematically introduce the synthesis, characterization, and application of NMP&#8208;SACs and the mechanisms behind their superior catalytic performance. This review first presents and classifies the different mechanisms through which NMPs enhance the performance of SACs. It then summarizes the currently reported synthetic strategies and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques of NMP&#8208;SACs. Moreover, their application in electro/thermo/photocatalysis, and the reasons for their superior performance are discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of NMP&#8208;SACs for the future design of advanced catalysts are addressed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 2, January 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress with regard to MXene&#8208;based current collectors for rechargeable batteries is systematically reviewed. The application of MXene in the current collector has achieved considerable achievements due to its unique structure, large surface area, and high conductivity. Up to now, various effective strategies have been presented and achieved positive effects, such as vacuum filtration, freeze&#8208;drying and in situ electrodeposition, etc.








Abstract
As an indispensable component of rechargeable batteries, the current collector plays a crucial role in supporting the electrode materials and collecting the accumulated electrical energy. However, some key issues, like uneven resources, high weight percentage, electrolytic&#160;corrosion, and high&#8208;voltage instability, cannot meet the growing need for rechargeable batteries. In recent years, MXene&#8208;based current collectors have achieved considerable achievements due to its unique structure, large surface area, and high conductivity. The related research has increased significantly. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review of this area is seldom. Herein the applications and progress of MXene in current collector are systematically summarized and discussed. Meanwhile, some challenges and future directions are presented.

         <title>Pericardial Delivery of SDF&#8208;1&#945; Puerarin Hydrogel Promotes Heart&#160;Repair and Electrical Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the SDF&#8208;1&#945;/CXCR4 is effective for MI treatment, excessive monocytes/macrophages recruitment or activation can cause unwanted inflammation simultaneously. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling. The degradable SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE hydrogel simultaneously enhances the recruitment of endogenous cells and reverses the adverse effects, which improves cardiac function and reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.








Abstract
The stromal&#8208;derived factor 1&#945;/chemokine receptor 4 (SDF&#8208;1&#945;/CXCR4)&#160;axis contributes to myocardial protection after myocardial infarction (MI) by recruiting endogenous stem cells into the ischemic tissue. However, excessive inflammatory macrophages are also recruited simultaneously, aggravating myocardial damage. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling, leading to inhomogeneities in ventricular conduction and retarded conduction velocity. It is highly desirable to selectively recruit the stem cells but block the inflammation. In this work, SDF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;encapsulated Puerarin (PUE) hydrogel (SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE) is capable of enhancing endogenous stem cell homing and simultaneously polarizing the recruited monocyte/macrophages into a repairing phenotype. Flow cytometry analysis of the treated heart tissue shows that endogenous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, hemopoietic stem cells, and immune cells are recruited while SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE efficiently polarizes the recruited monocytes/macrophages into the M2 type. These macrophages influence the preservation of connexin 43 (Cx43) expression which modulates intercellular coupling and improves electrical conduction. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the improved &#8220;soil&#8221;, the recruited stem cells mediate an improved cardiac function by preventing deterioration, promoting neovascular architecture, and reducing infarct size. These findings demonstrate a promising therapeutic platform for MI that not only facilitates heart regeneration but also reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

         <title>Modulating Charge Separation of Oxygen&#8208;Doped Boron Nitride with Isolated Co Atoms for Enhancing CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolated Co atoms are successfully anchored on oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (Co/BNF) to enhance photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. The uniformly dispersed Co atoms with a CoO2N1 coordination geometry play an essential role in promoting the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and lowering the reaction energy barriers, thus boosting the activity and selectivity of Co/BNF for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
To alleviate the greenhouse effect and address the related energy crisis, solar&#8208;driven reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to value&#8208;added products is considered as a sustainable strategy. However, the insufficient separation and rapid recombination of photogenerated charge carriers during photocatalysis greatly limit their reduction efficiency and practical application potential. Here, isolated Cobalt (Co) atoms are successfully decorated into oxygen&#8208;doped boron nitride (BN)&#160;via an in situ pyrolysis method, achieving greatly improved catalytic activity and selectivity to the carbon monoxide (CO) product. X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectroscopy demonstrates that the isolated Co atoms are stabilized by the O and N atoms with an unsaturated CoO2N1 configuration. Further experimental investigation and theoretical simulations confirm that the decorated Co atoms not only work as the real active center during the CO2 reduction process, but also perform as the electron pump to promote the electron/hole separation and transfer, resulting in greatly accelerated reaction kinetics and improved activity. In addition, the CoO2N1 coordination geometry is favorable to the conversion from *CO2 to *COOH, which shall be considered as a selectivity&#8208;determining step for the evolution of the CO products. The surface modulation strategy at the atomic level opens a new avenue for regulating the reaction kinetics for photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Assisted Surface Modification of Lithium&#8208;Rich Manganese&#8208;Based Oxide toward High Anionic Redox Reversibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;assisted modification is introduced for the construction of SnS2&#8722;x&#8722;&#963;Oy coating and sulfur atoms substituting lattice oxygen. The sulfur anions in the lattice enhance the reversibility of the anionic redox by modulating the band of the redox&#8208;active center. The additional coating effectively traps the escaping active oxygen, and the trapped oxygen and coating return to the pristine upon discharge.








Abstract
Energy storage via anionic redox provides extra capacity for lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes at high voltage but causes gradual structural collapse and irreversible capacity loss with generation of On&#8722; (0 &#8804; n &lt; 2) species upon deep oxidation. Herein, the stability and reversibility of anionic redox reactions are enhanced by a simple sulfur&#8208;assisted surface modification method, which not only modulates the material's energy band allowing feasible electron release from both bonding and antibonding bands, but also traps the escaping On&#8722; via an as&#8208;constructed SnS2&#8722;x&#8722;&#963;Oy coating layer and return them to the host lattice upon discharge. The regulation of anionic redox inhibits the irreversible structural transformation and parasitic reactions, maintaining the specific capacity retention of as&#8208;modified cathode up to 94% after 200 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1, along with outstanding voltage stability. The reported strategy incorporating energy band modulation and oxygen trapping is promising for the design and advancement of other cathodes storing energy through anion redox.

         <title>Modular Aptamer Switches for the Continuous Optical Detection of Small&#8208;Molecule Analytes in Complex Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A duplex&#8208;bubble switch architecture enables precise modulation of kinetics and thermodynamics without prior knowledge of the ligand binding site. Its integration with fiber&#8208;optic probes and applicability in real&#8208;time optical detection by achieving reversible and binding&#8208;induced fluorescence responses to dopamine and cortisol in complex matrices are demonstrated. This approach promises a universal solution for rapid aptamer&#8208;based sensor development in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aptamers are a promising class of affinity reagents because signal transduction mechanisms can&#160;be built into the reagent, so that they can directly produce a physically measurable output signal upon target binding. However, endowing the signal transduction functionality into an aptamer remains a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process that can compromise its affinity or specificity and typically requires knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure. In this work, a design architecture that can convert an existing aptamer into a &#8220;reversible aptamer switch&#8221; whose kinetic and thermodynamic properties can be tuned without a priori knowledge of the ligand binding domain or its structure is described. Finally, by combining these aptamer switches with evanescent&#8208;field&#8208;based optical detection hardware that minimizes sample autofluorescence, this study demonstrates the first optical biosensor system that can continuously measure multiple biomarkers (dopamine and cortisol) in complex samples (artificial cerebrospinal fluid and undiluted plasma) with second and subsecond&#8208;scale time responses at physiologically relevant concentration ranges.

         <title>Electrochemical Evolution of Ru&#8208;Based Polyoxometalates into Si,W&#8208;Codoped RuOx for Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils the synthesis of a robust, bifunctional electrocatalyst via the electrochemical evolution of Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates into Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx (RuSiW) for efficient acidic water splitting. Exploiting the synergistic effects of Si and W codoping, RuSiW catalyst achieves remarkable activity and stability for acidic hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Despite intensive studies over decades, the development of electrocatalysts for acidic water splitting still relies on platinum group metals, especially Pt and Ir, which are scarce, expensive, and poorly sustainable. Because such problems can be alleviated, Ru&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts such as rutile RuO2 have recently emerged. However, RuO2 has a relatively low activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and low stability for oxygen evolution reactions (OER) under acidic conditions. In this study, the synthesis of a RuOx&#8208;based bifunctional catalyst (RuSiW) for acidic water splitting via the electrochemical evolution from Ru&#8208;based polyoxometalates at cathodic potentials is reported. RuSiW consists of the nanocrystalline RuO2 core and Si,W&#8208;codoped RuOx shell. RuSiW exhibits outstanding HER and OER activity comparable to Pt/C and RuO2, respectively, with high stability. Computational analysis suggests that the codoping of RuOx with W and Si synergistically improves the HER activity of otherwise poor RuO2 by shifting the d&#8208;band center and optimizing atomic configurations beneficial for proper hydrogen adsorption. This study provides insights into the design and synthesis of unprecedented bifunctional electrocatalysts using catalytically inactive and less explored elements, such as Si and W.

         <title>Humidity/Oxygen&#8208;Insensitive Organic Synaptic Transistors Based on Optical Radical Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The improvement of the stability and environmental durability of organic electronics is a challenge for the promising applications in universal environments. Herein, a stable organic photosynaptic transistor based on a photoinitiator is developed with broad operation capabilities in vacuum, dried air, and high&#8208;humidity environment. This design provides a promising platform for long&#8208;term stable organic synaptic electronics.








Abstract
For most organic synaptic transistors based on the charge trapping effect, different atmosphere conditions lead to significantly different device performance. Some devices even lose the synaptic responses under vacuum or inert atmosphere. The stable device performance of these organic synaptic transistors under varied working environments with different humidity and oxygen levels can be a challenge. Herein, a moisture&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;insensitive organic synaptic device based on the organic semiconductor and photoinitiator molecules is reported. Unlike the widely reported charge trapping effect, the photoinduced free radical is utilized to realize the photosynaptic performance. The resulting synaptic transistor displays typical excitatory postsynaptic current, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, learning, and forgetting behaviors. Furthermore, the device exhibits decent and stable photosynaptic performances under high humidity and vacuum conditions. This type of organic synaptic device also demonstrates high potential in ultraviolet B perception based on its environmental stability and broad ultraviolet detection capability. Finally, the contrast&#8208;enhanced capability of the device is successfully validated by the single&#8208;layer&#8208;perceptron/double&#8208;layer network based Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology pattern recognition. This work could have important implications for the development of next&#8208;generation environment&#8208;stable organic synaptic devices and systems.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional MXene&#8208;Based Bioanode for Wearable Self&#8208;Charging Biosupercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional MXene&#8208;based bioanode is prepared with a 3D hierarchical structure for wearable self&#8208;charging biosupercapacitors. The device is designed in the &#8220;island&#8211;bridge&#8221; structure, and successfully realizes conformal and adhesion with human skin in a flexible environment. The skin&#8208;mountable device exhibits superior energy harvesting and storing performance from human sweat under both relaxed and stretching conditions.








Abstract
As a reliable energy&#8208;supply platform for wearable electronics, biosupercapacitors combine the characteristics of biofuel cells and supercapacitors to harvest and store the energy from human's sweat. However, the bulky preparation process and deep embedding of enzyme active sites in bioelectrodes usually limit the energy&#8208;harvesting process, retarding the practical power&#8208;supply sceneries especially during the complicated in vivo motion. Herein, a MXene/single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube/lactate oxidase hierarchical structure as the dual&#8208;functional bioanode is designed, which can not only provide a superior 3D catalytic microenvironment for enzyme accommodation to harvest energy from sweat, but also offers sufficient capacitance to store energy via the electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor. A wearable biosupercapacitor is fabricated in the &#8220;island&#8211;bridge&#8221; structure with a composite bioanode, active carbon/Pt cathode, polyacrylamide hydrogel substrate, and liquid metal conductor. The device exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage&#160;of 0.48&#160;V and the high power density of 220.9 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The compact conformal adhesion with skin is successfully maintained under stretching/bending conditions. After repeatedly stretching the devices, there is no significant power attenuation in pulsed output. The unique bioelectrode structure and attractive energy harvesting/storing properties demonstrate the promising potential of this biosupercapacitor as a micro self&#8208;powered platform of wearable electronics.

         <title>Enhancing the Carrier Transport in Monolayer MoS2 through Interlayer Coupling with 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacing of monolayer MoS2 with 2DCOF films determines a major enhancement in the charge transport through the 2D semiconductor. Electron doping intensity is amplified by the superlattice's long&#8208;range order, while the lattice vibration is suppressed by the high mechanical stiffness yielding a confinement effect. The MoS2 /2D&#8208;COF heterostructures represent a novel strategy to develop high&#8208;performance 2D electronics.








Abstract
The coupling of different 2D materials (2DMs) to form van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) is a powerful strategy for adjusting the electronic properties of 2D semiconductors, for applications in opto&#8208;electronics and quantum computing. 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) represents an archetypical semiconducting, monolayer thick versatile platform for the generation of hybrid vdWH with tunable charge transport characteristics through its interfacing with molecules and assemblies thereof. However, the physisorption of (macro)molecules on 2D MoS2 yields hybrids possessing a limited thermal stability, thereby jeopardizing their technological applications. Herein, the rational design and optimized synthesis of 2D covalent organic frameworks (2D&#8208;COFs) for the generation of MoS2/2D&#8208;COF vdWHs exhibiting strong interlayer coupling effects are reported. The high crystallinity of the 2D&#8208;COF films makes it possible to engineer an ultrastable periodic doping effect on MoS2, boosting devices&#8217; field&#8208;effect mobility at room temperature. Such a performance increase can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the efficient interfacial electron transfer process and the pronounced suppression of MoS2&#8217;s lattice vibration. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept work validates an unprecedented approach for the efficient modulation of the electronic properties of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides toward high&#8208;performance (opto)electronics for CMOS digital circuits.

Interactions between poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) core&#8208;shell silica nanoparticles (5&#8211;50) nm and major barriers associated with oral delivery are studied. Ultrasmall nanoparticles (&lt;10 nm) rapidly diffuse through intestinal mucus, passively permeate intestinal epithelial cell layers, and are found in mouse urine after oral gavage. Together with earlier in vivo results, suggest these nanoparticles are promising candidates for oral administration.








Abstract
Oral delivery, while a highly desirable form of nanoparticle&#8208;drug administration, is limited by challenges associated with overcoming several biological barriers. Here, the authors study how fluorescent and poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) core&#8208;shell silica nanoparticles sized 5 to 50&#160;nm interact with major barriers including intestinal mucus, intestinal epithelium, and stomach acid. From imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy studies using quasi&#8208;total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, diffusion of nanoparticles through highly scattering mucus is progressively hindered above a critical hydrodynamic size around 20&#160;nm. By studying Caco&#8208;2 cell monolayers mimicking the intestinal epithelia, it is observed that ultrasmall nanoparticles below 10&#160;nm diameter (Cornell prime dots, [C&#8217; dots]) show permeabilities correlated with high absorption in humans from primarily enhanced passive passage through tight junctions. Particles above 20&#160;nm diameter exclusively show active transport through cells. After establishing C&#8217; dot stability in artificial gastric juice, in vivo oral gavage experiments in mice demonstrate successful passage through the body followed by renal clearance without protein corona formation. Results suggest C&#8217; dots as viable candidates for oral administration to patients with a proven pathway towards clinical translation and may generate renewed interest in examining silica as a food additive and its effects on nutrition and health.

         <title>MOFs for Ultrahigh Efficiency Pulsed Laser Micropropulsion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>

Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which are composed of metal cations and organic ligands forming ordered structures through coordination, with their unique composition eliminating the problem of local hot zones and uneven mixing encountered in laser micropropulsion (LMP), allowing for enhanced propulsion efficiency.








Abstract
Conventional propellant materials, such as polymers and single metal elements, have long been investigated for their potential in pulsed laser micropropulsion (LMP) technology. However, achieving superior LMP efficiency through physical mixing of these materials remains a significant challenge. This study presents a paradigm shift by introducing porous crystalline polymers, known as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), as novel propellants in pulsed LMP. MOFs are composed of metal cations and organic ligands that form ordered structures through coordination, eliminating the problem of local hot zones arising from uneven physical mixing encountered in LMP. In direct comparison to conventional polymers and single element targets, MOFs exhibit substantially higher LMP efficiency. By precisely tailoring the metal atom fraction within MOFs, an extraordinary ultrahigh efficiency of 51.15% is achieved in pulsed LMP, surpassing the performance of similar materials previously reported in the literature. This pioneering application of MOFs not only revolutionizes the field of LMP but also opens up new frontiers for MOF utilization in various energy applications.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Biohybrid Microstructures Enable Transplantation and Vascularization of Microtissues in the Anterior Chamber of the Eye</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transplanting 3D&#8208;printed biohybrid microstructures to the anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) with the aim of vascular engraftment is investigated. The ACE is an ideal platform for studying interactions between host tissues and transplant, as well as for biomedical device trans/&#8208;implantation. The results identify pupillary dynamics as an effective factor involved in graft integrity to the host. Microstructures that provide a more static configuration lead to successful vascularization even in a no&#8208;contact mode (to the vessel source) and a fluidic microenvironment.








Abstract
Hybridizing biological cells with man&#8208;made sensors enable the detection of a wide range of weak physiological responses with high specificity. The anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) is an ideal transplantation site due to its ocular immune privilege and optical transparency, which enable superior noninvasive longitudinal analyses of cells and microtissues. Engraftment of biohybrid microstructures in the ACE may, however, be affected by the pupillary response and dynamics. Here, sutureless transplantation of biohybrid microstructures, 3D printed in IP&#8208;Visio photoresin, containing a precisely localized pancreatic islet to the ACE of mice is presented. The biohybrid microstructures allow mechanical fixation in the ACE, independent of iris dynamics. After transplantation, islets in the microstructures successfully sustain their functionality for over 20 weeks and become vascularized despite physical separation from the vessel source (iris) and immersion in a low&#8208;viscous liquid (aqueous humor) with continuous circulation and clearance. This approach opens new perspectives in biohybrid microtissue transplantation in the ACE, advancing monitoring of microtissue&#8211;host interactions, disease modeling, treatment outcomes, and vascularization in engineered tissues.

         <title>Conducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Intrinsic Aqueous Dispersibility for Conductive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable, dispersible conductive particles are simply afforded via acid crystallization of commercial poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) in solution. The particles feature a tunable internal surfactant which enables intrinsic aqueous processibility for incorporation within hydrogels without complex additives or surfactants. The particles are loaded into a resin and printed via microstereolithography, offering hydrogels with biocompatibility, structural fidelity, and high conductivity (1&#8211;10 S cm&#8722;1).








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels are promising materials with mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conduction to interface living tissue (ionic signal transmission) with medical devices (electronic signal transmission). The hydrogel form factor also uniquely bridges the wet/soft biological environment with the dry/hard environment of electronics. The synthesis of hydrogels for bioelectronics requires scalable, biocompatible fillers with high electronic conductivity and compatibility with common aqueous hydrogel formulations/resins. Despite significant advances in the processing of carbon nanomaterials, fillers that satisfy all these requirements are lacking. Herein, intrinsically dispersible acid&#8208;crystalized PEDOT:PSS nanoparticles (ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX) are reported which are processed through a facile and scalable nonsolvent induced phase separation method from commercial PEDOT:PSS without complex instrumentation. The particles feature conductivities of up to 410 S cm&#8722;1, and when compared to other common conductive fillers, display remarkable dispersibility, enabling homogeneous incorporation at relatively high loadings within diverse aqueous biomaterial solutions without additives or surfactants. The aqueous dispersibility of the ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX particles also allows simple incorporation into resins designed for microstereolithography without sonication or surfactant optimization; complex biomedical structures with fine features (&lt; 150 &#181;m)&#160;are&#160;printed with up to 10% particle loading . The ncrys&#8208;PEDOTX particles overcome the challenges of traditional conductive fillers, providing a scalable, biocompatible, plug&#8208;and&#8208;play platform for soft organic bioelectronic materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Area&#8208;Emissive White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistor for Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniform area&#8208;emissive white OLET device with an efficiency of 13.9% is realized by incorporating phosphorescent blue emissive and fluorescent yellow emissive guests in the active layer based on a unique lateral&#8208;integrated device configuration, which is the highest value in the field and demonstrates great potential for full&#8208;color display as backlight source for the first time.








Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;performance white organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) with uniform area emission is crucial for smart display technologies but remains greatly challenging. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency uniform area&#8208;emissive OLETs based on a unique lateral&#8208;integrated device configuration which incorporates efficient energy transfer of phosphorescent and fluorescent guests, enabling color&#8208;tunable and white emission, are demonstrated. Through precisely regulating the energy transfer between host and guests, high external quantum efficiency of 13.9% for white&#8208;emission OLETs is achieved due to the improved high exciton utilization and light outcoupling efficiency which is the highest value reported so far for OLETs and prevents exciton&#8208;charge annihilation and electrode photon losses. Moreover, good loop stability is also achieved, along with effective gate tunability and ultralow driving voltage of below 5&#160;V. Finally, a 4 &#215; 6 white&#8208;emission OLET array for full&#8208;color display is demonstrated for the first time, suggesting its great potential applications for advanced display technologies.

Finally, a 4 &#215; 6 white-emission OLET array for full-color display is demonstrated for the first time, suggesting its great potential applications for advanced display technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ defect healing treatment is reported to rejuvenate the aged perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), which could effectively heal the surface matrix defects and revive the morphology of aged PQDs, substantially improving the optoelectronic properties and orientation of PQD solids. Consequently, solar cells fabricated using rejuvenated PQDs show comparable photovoltaic performance with the control solar cells.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation solar cells owing to its remarkable optoelectronic properties and solution processability. However, the optoelectronic properties of PQDs suffer from severe degradation in storage due to the dynamically binding ligands, predominantly affecting photovoltaic applications. Herein, an in situ defect healing treatment (DHT) is reported to effectively rejuvenate aged PQDs. Systematically, experimental studies and theoretical calculations are performed to fundamentally understand the causes leading to the recovered optoelectronic properties of aged PQDs. The results reveal that the I3&#8722; anions produced from tetra&#8208;n&#8208;octylammonium iodide and iodine could strongly anchor on the surface matrix defects of aged PQDs, substantially diminishing the nonradiative recombination of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, an DHT could also renovate the morphology of aged PQDs and thus improve the stacking orientation of PQD solids, substantially ameliorating charge carrier transport within PQD solids. Consequently, by using a DHT, the PQD solar cell (PQDSC) yields a high efficiency of up to 15.88%, which is comparable with the PQDSCs fabricated using fresh PQDs. Meanwhile, the stability of PQDSCs fabricated using the rejuvenated PQDs is also largely improved.

         <title>In Situ Formation of 2D Perovskite Seeding for Record&#8208;Efficiency Indoor Perovskite Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the issue of efficiency loss due to increased cell size for indoor perovskite photovoltaics by developing an in situ pre&#8208;nucleation strategy is addressed. A trace amount of &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution, which spontaneously reacts with PbI2 to form 2D perovskite seed crystals to facilitate 3D perovskite growth.








Abstract
With 40% efficiency under room light intensity, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) will be promising power supplies for low&#8208;light applications, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and indoor electronics, shall they become commercialized. Herein, &#946;&#8208;alaninamide hydrochloride (AHC) is utilized to spontaneously form a layer of 2D perovskite nucleation seeds for improved film uniformity, crystallization quality, and solar cell performance. It is found that the AHC addition indeed improves film quality as demonstrated by better uniformity, lower trap density, smaller lattice stress, and, as a result, a 10&#8208;fold increase in charge carrier lifetime. Consequently, not only does the small&#8208;area (0.09 cm2) PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency of 42.12%, the large&#8208;area cells (1.00 cm2, and 2.56 cm2) attain efficiency as high as 40.93%, and 40.07% respectively. All of these are the highest efficiency values for indoor photovoltaic cells with similar sizes, and more importantly, they represent the smallest efficiency loss due to area scale&#8208;up. This work provides a new method to fabricate high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs (i&#8208;PSCs) for IoT devices with great potential in large&#8208;area printing technology.

         <title>A Practical Approach Toward Highly Reproducible and High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Films Based on an Aging Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quality and reproducibility of perovskite thin films are severely influenced by spin&#8208;coating parameters and annealing conditions. Here, a facile and cost&#8208;effective aging treatment is developed to improve film coverage and uniformity. The resulting devices achieve higher device performance reproducibility and impressive operational stability under both air and vacuum conditions.








Abstract
Solution processing of hybrid perovskite semiconductors is a highly promising approach for the fabrication of cost&#8208;effective electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, challenges with this approach lie in overcoming the controllability of the perovskite film morphology and the reproducibility of device efficiencies. Here, a facile and practical aging treatment (AT) strategy is reported to modulate the perovskite crystal growth to produce sufficiently high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films with improved homogeneity and full&#8208;coverage morphology. The resulting AT&#8208;films exhibit fewer defects, faster charge carrier transfer/extraction, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination compared with reference. The AT&#8208;devices achieve a noticeable improvement in the reproducibility, operational stability, and photovoltaic performance of devices, with the average efficiency increased by 16%. It also demonstrates the feasibility and scalability of AT strategy in optimizing the film morphology and device performance for other perovskite components including MAPbI3, (MAPbBr3)15(FAPbI3)85, and Cs0.05(MAPbBr3)0.17(FAPbI3)0.83. This method opens an effective avenue to improve the quality of perovskite films and photovoltaic devices in a scalable and reproducible manner.

         <title>Sampling the Materials Space for Conventional Superconducting Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;scale, machine&#8208;learning&#8208;accelerated study of conventional superconducting materials is presented, wherein the transition temperatures of approximately 200 000 metallic compounds are evaluated, all of which are close to the convex hull of thermodynamic stability to maximize the probability of synthesizability. This work is complemented with a detailed examination of several interesting materials, including nitrides, hydrides, and intermetallic compounds.








Abstract
A large scale study of conventional superconducting materials using a machine&#8208;learning accelerated high&#8208;throughput workflow is performed, starting by creating a comprehensive dataset of around 7000 electron&#8211;phonon calculations performed with reasonable convergence parameters. This dataset is then used to train a robust machine learning model capable of predicting the electron&#8211;phonon and superconducting properties based on structural, compositional, and electronic ground&#8208;state properties. Using this machine, the transition temperatures (Tc) of approximately 200&#160;000 metallic compounds are evaluated, all of which are on the convex hull of thermodynamic stability (or close to it) to maximize the probability of synthesizability. Compounds predicted to have Tc values exceeding 5&#160;K are further validated using density&#8208;functional perturbation theory. As a result, 541 compounds with Tc values surpassing 10&#160;K, encompassing a variety of crystal structures and chemical compositions, are identified. This work is complemented with a detailed examination of several interesting materials, including nitrides, hydrides, and intermetallic compounds. Particularly noteworthy is LiMoN2, which is predicted to be superconducting in the stoichiometric trigonal phase, with a Tc exceeding 38&#160;K. LiMoN2 has previously been synthesized in this phase, further heightening its potential for practical&#160;applications.

         <title>Atomic Zincophilic Sites Regulating Microspace Electric Fields for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>

The CoSA/C additive with strong Zn affinity can preferentially absorb on the Zn surface in which the curvature&#8208;adjusted absorption enables a self&#8208;adaptive distribution. Atomic zincophilic Co&#8208;N3 sites with strong charge polarization effect redistribute the microspace electric field and ion flux, thus guiding uniform Zn deposition. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping guarantees a sustainable regulation.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their intrinsic advantages. However, Zn tends to deposit irregularly and forms dendrites driven by the uneven space electric field distribution near the Zn&#8208;electrolyte interphase. Herein it is demonstrated that trace addition of Co single atom anchored carbon (denoted as CoSA/C) in the electrolyte regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn&#8208;electrolyte interphase and unifies Zn deposition. Through preferential adsorption of CoSA/C on the Zn surface, the atomically dispersed Co&#8208;N3 with strong charge polarization effect can redistribute the local space electric field and regulate ion flux. Moreover, the dynamic adsorption/desorption of CoSA/C upon plating/stripping offers sustainable long&#8208;term regulation. Therefore, Zn||Zn symmetric cells with CoSA/C electrolyte additive deliver stable cycling up to 1600&#160;h (corresponding to a cumulative plated capacity of 8 Ah cm&#8722;2) at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, demonstrating the sustainable feature of microspace electric field regulation at high current density and capacity.

         <title>Engineering A Boron&#8208;Rich Interphase with Nonflammable Electrolyte toward Stable Li||NCM811 Cells Under Elevated Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of boron&#8208;rich CEI is proposed by selecting salts and solvents with reasonable HOMO levels, which can stabilize the NCM811 at both RT and high temperature by suppressing the degradation of particles and decreasing the consumption of electrolytes. Besides, it improves the flame&#8208;retardancy to decrease the safety risk of NCM811||Li battery.








Abstract
Despite the high energy of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode, it still suffers serious decay due to the continuous solvents decomposition and unstable cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers, especially under high temperatures. The intense exothermic reaction between delithiated NCM811 and flammable electrolyte, on the other hand, pushes the batteries to their safety limit. Herein, these two issues are tackled via engineering the electrolytes, that is, utilizing salts with higher HOMO levels and nonflammable solvents with lower HOMO levels, to reduce the massive decomposition of solvents and improve battery safety under elevated temperatures. Consequently, a thin and boron&#8208;rich CEI is generated, which effectively inhibited the side reactions, thus improving the cycling stability and safety. Deviated from the highly concentrated electrolytes which heavily relies on the usage of massive salts, the electrolyte recipe can introduce a robust inorganic&#8208;rich CEI but use much less salt (i.e., dilute electrolyte), and thus, offer an encouraging alternative toward practical applications. As such, the NCM811 cathode exhibits a high&#8208;capacity retention of 81.2% after 950 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C and 75% after 300 cycles at 55&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a universal electrolyte design strategy for designing stable and safe high&#8208;temperature electrolytes for the NCM811 cathode.

         <title>Covalently Functionalized Nanopores for Highly Selective Separation of Monovalent Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functionalized graphene nanopores exhibit distinct monovalent ions transport behaviors including transport&#8208;rectification and exquisite intercation or anion/cation selectivity through precise pore structure and surface functional groups regulation. These prominent performances not only strongly rely on the ultra&#8208;low permeability resistance of atomically thin graphene but also attribute to the synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions.








Abstract
Biological ion channels possess prominent ion transport performances attributed to their critical chemical groups across the continuous nanoscale filters. However, it is still a challenge to imitate these sophisticated performances in artificial nanoscale systems. Herein, this work develops the strategy to fabricate functionalized graphene nanopores in pioneer based on the synergistic regulation of the pore size and chemical properties of atomically thin confined structure through decoupling etching combined with in situ covalent modification. The modified graphene nanopores possess asymmetric ion transport behaviors and efficient monovalent metal ions sieving (K+/Li+ selectivity &#8776;48.6). Meanwhile, it also allows preferential transport for cations, the resulting membranes exhibit a K+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 76 and a H+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 59.3. The synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions imposing a higher energy barrier for Cl&#8722; or Li+ across nanopores lead to ultra&#8208;selective H+ or K+ transport. Further, the functionalized graphene nanopores generate a power density of 25.3&#160;W m&#8722;2 and a conversion efficiency of 33.9%, showing potential application prospects in energy conversion. The theoretical studies quantitatively match well with the experimental results. The feasible preparation of functionalized graphene nanopores paves the way toward direct investigation on ion transport mechanism and advanced design in devices.

Schematic of threshold response in the MAPbI3:Ag&#8208;based artificial nociceptor neurons and threshold firing of output current. The mechano&#8208;nociceptive system, utilizing halide perovskites&#8208;based memristors with a force sensing resistor, demonstrates the capability to detect detrimental impacts through sensitization responses. Scaling up to a 5 &#215; 5 crossbar array, the artificial skin system achieves successful stereoscopic nociception of uneven impulses.








Abstract
Numerous efforts for emulating organ systems comprised of multiple functional units have driven substantial advancements in bio&#8208;realistic electronics and systems. The resistance change behavior observed in diffusive memristors shares similarities with the potential change in biological neurons. Here, the diffusive threshold switching phenomenon in Ag&#8208;incorporated organometallic halide perovskites is utilized to demonstrate the functions of afferent neurons. Halide perovskites&#8208;based diffusive memristors show a low threshold voltage of &#8776;0.2&#160;V with little variation, attributed to the facile migration of Ag ions uniformly dispersed within the halide matrix. Based on the reversible and reliable volatile threshold switching, the memristors successfully demonstrate fundamental nociceptive functions including threshold firing, relaxation, and sensitization. Furthermore, to replicate the biological mechano&#8208;nociceptive phenomenon at a system level, an artificial mechano&#8208;nociceptive system is built by integrating a diffusive memristor with a force&#8208;sensing resistor. The presented system is capable of detecting and discerning the detrimental impact caused by a heavy steel ball, effectively exhibiting the corresponding sensitization response. By further extending the single nociceptive system into a 5 &#215; 5 array, successful stereoscopic nociception of uneven impulses is achieved in the artificial skin system through array&#8208;scale sensitization. These results represent significant progress in the field of bio&#8208;inspired electronics and systems.

         <title>Inkjet Printed Photonic Cellulose Nanocrystal Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patterned arrays of photonic cellulose nanocrystal microfilms are prepared by inkjet printing. By dispensing directly through an oil layer, the printing and drying processes can be decoupled, which avoids the coffee stain effect and enables complex arrays to be produced. By adjusting the formulation of each individual drop via overprinting and coalescence, a spectrum of colors can be printed on&#8208;demand.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;sourced cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated, birefringent nanoparticles that can undergo cholesteric self&#8208;assembly in water to produce vibrant, structurally colored films. As such, they are an ideal candidate for use as sustainable and cost&#8208;effective inks in the printing of scalable photonic coatings and bespoke patterns. However, the small volume and large surface area of a sessile CNC drop typically leads to rapid evaporation, resulting in microfilms with a coffee&#8208;stain&#8208;like morphology and very weak coloration. Here, it is demonstrated that inkjet printing of CNC drops directly through an immiscible oil layer can immediately inhibit water loss, resulting in reduced internal mass flows and greater time for cholesteric self&#8208;assembly. The color of each microfilm is determined by the initial composition of the drop, which can be tuned on&#8208;demand by exploiting the overprinting and coalescence of multiple smaller drops of different inks. This enables the production of multicolored patterns with complex optical behaviors, such as angle&#8208;dependent color and polarization&#8208;selective reflection. Finally, the array can be made responsive to stimuli (e.g., UV light, polar solvent) by the inclusion of a degradable additive.

     alt="Inkjet Printed Photonic Cellulose Nanocrystal Patterns"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterned arrays of photonic cellulose nanocrystal microfilms are prepared by inkjet printing. By dispensing directly through an oil layer, the printing and drying processes can be decoupled, which avoids the coffee stain effect and enables complex arrays to be produced. By adjusting the formulation of each individual drop via overprinting and coalescence, a spectrum of colors can be printed on-demand.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally-sourced cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated, birefringent nanoparticles that can undergo cholesteric self-assembly in water to produce vibrant, structurally colored films. As such, they are an ideal candidate for use as sustainable and cost-effective inks in the printing of scalable photonic coatings and bespoke patterns. However, the small volume and large surface area of a sessile CNC drop typically leads to rapid evaporation, resulting in microfilms with a coffee-stain-like morphology and very weak coloration. Here, it is demonstrated that inkjet printing of CNC drops directly through an immiscible oil layer can immediately inhibit water loss, resulting in reduced internal mass flows and greater time for cholesteric self-assembly. The color of each microfilm is determined by the initial composition of the drop, which can be tuned on-demand by exploiting the overprinting and coalescence of multiple smaller drops of different inks. This enables the production of multicolored patterns with complex optical behaviors, such as angle-dependent color and polarization-selective reflection. Finally, the array can be made responsive to stimuli (e.g., UV light, polar solvent) by the inclusion of a degradable additive. This suite of functional properties promotes inkjet-printed photonic CNC arrays for smart colorimetric labeling or optical anticounterfeiting applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressing Bulk Strain and Surface O2 Release in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes by Just Tuning the Li Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A coherent thin spinel&#8208;like structure is formed on the surface of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides by controlling the Li content during the synthesis. The combined in situ XRD and atomic&#8208;scale imaging of the structural evolution reveal that the surface layer simultaneously suppresses the bulk strain accumulation and surface O2 release, resulting in outstanding electrochemical performance and structural stability.








Abstract
Layered oxides represent a prominent class of cathodes employed in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The structural degradation of layered cathodes causes capacity decay during cycling, which is generally induced by anisotropic lattice strain in the bulk of cathode particle and oxygen release at the surface. However, particularly in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) that undergo intense oxygen redox reactions, the challenge of simultaneously addressing bulk and surface issues through a singular modification technique remains arduous. Here a thin (1&#8208;nm) and coherent spinel&#8208;like phase is constructed on the surface of LLOs particle to suppress bulk strain and surface O2 release by just adjusting the amount of lithium source during synthesis. The spinel&#8208;like phase hinders the surface O2 release by accommodating O2 inside the surface layer, while the trapped O2 in the bulk impedes strain evolution by &#8776;70% at high voltages compared with unmodified LLOs. Consequently, the enhanced structural stability leads to an improved capacity retention of 97.6% and a high Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.5% after 100 cycles at 0.1&#176;C. These findings provide profound mechanistic insights into the functioning of surface structure and offer guidance for synthesizing high&#8208;capacity cathodes with superior cyclability.

         <title>Manipulating Surface Band Bending of III&#8208;Nitride Nanowires with Ambipolar Charge&#8208;Transfer Characteristics: A Pathway Toward Advanced Photoswitching Logic Gates and Encrypted Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reports a novel postepitaxy method: thickness&#8208;tunable carbon layer decoration to continuously manipulate the surface band bending of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors for the first time. Enabled by the accurate modulation of the thickness of carbon layers, a spectrally distinctive bipolar photoresponse with a controllable polarity&#8208;switching&#8208;point over a wide spectrum range can be achieved, further demonstrating reprogrammable photoswitching logic gates and secured image transmission system.








Abstract
The operational principle of semiconductor devices critically relies on the band structures that ultimately govern their charge&#8208;transfer characteristics. Indeed, the precise orchestration of band structure within semiconductor devices, notably at the semiconductor surface and corresponding interface, continues to pose a perennial conundrum. Herein, for the first time, this work reports a novel postepitaxy method: thickness&#8208;tunable carbon layer decoration to continuously manipulate the surface band bending of III&#8208;nitride semiconductors. Specifically, the surface band bending of p&#8208;type aluminum&#8208;gallium&#8208;nitride (p&#8208;AlGaN) nanowires grown on n&#8208;Si can be precisely controlled by depositing different carbon layers as guided by theoretical calculations, which eventually regulate the ambipolar charge&#8208;transfer behavior between the p&#8208;AlGaN/electrolyte and p&#8208;AlGaN/n&#8208;Si interface in an electrolyte environment. Enabled by the accurate modulation of the thickness of carbon layers, a spectrally distinctive bipolar photoresponse with a controllable polarity&#8208;switching&#8208;point over a wide spectrum range can be achieved, further demonstrating reprogrammable photoswitching logic gates &#8220;XOR&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221;, and &#8220;NOT&#8221; in a single device. Finally, this work constructs a secured image transmission system where the optical signals are encrypted through the &#8220;XOR&#8221; logic operations. The proposed continuous surface band tuning strategy provides an effective avenue for the development of multifunctional integrated&#8208;photonics systems implemented with nanophotonics.

         <title>Dynamically Adaptive Bubbling for Upgrading Oxygen Evolution Reaction Using Lamellar Fern&#8208;Like Alloy Aerogel Self&#8208;Standing Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) as a self&#8208;standing electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation. LFA not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities.








Abstract
Adopting renewable electricity to produce &#8220;green&#8221; hydrogen has been a critical challenge because at a high current density the mass transfer capability of most catalytic electrodes deteriorates significantly. Herein, a unique lamellar fern&#8208;like alloy aerogel (LFA) electrode, showing a unique dynamically adaptive bubbling capability and can effectively avoid stress concentration caused by bubble aggregation is reported. The LFA electrode is intrinsically highly catalytic&#8208;active and shows a highly porous, resilient, hierarchically ordered, and well&#8208;percolated conductive network. It not only shows superior gas evacuation capability but also exhibits significantly improved stability at high current densities, showing the record lowest oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential of 244&#160;mV at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stably over 6000 h. With the merits of mechanical robustness, excellent electron transport, and efficient bubble evacuation, LFA can be self&#8208;standing catalytic electrode and&#160;gas diffusion layers in anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE), which can achieve 3000 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at a low voltage of 1.88&#160;V and can sustain stable electrolysis at 2000&#8201;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 1300 h. This strategy can be extended to various gas evolution reactions as a general design rule for multiphase catalysis applications.

         <title>Regulating Crystal Orientation via Ligand Anchoring Enables Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells and Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulfonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors is proposed, which significantly promotes the desired (001) crystal orientation. Thus, opaque and semitransparent 1.66 eV bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells realize efficiencies of 22.40% and 20.13%, respectively. Furthermore, four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells deliver a remarkable efficiency of 28.06%.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells have attracted considerable interest for their potential applications in tandem solar cells. However, the predominant obstacles impeding their widespread adoption are substantial open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit and severe photo&#8208;induced halide segregation. To tackle these challenges, a crystal orientation regulation strategy by introducing dodecyl&#8208;benzene&#8208;sulfonic&#8208;acid as an additive in perovskite precursors is proposed. This method significantly promotes the desired crystal orientation, passivates defects, and mitigates photo&#8208;induced halide phase segregation in perovskite films, leading to substantially reduced nonradiative recombination, minimized VOC deficits, and enhanced operational stability of the devices. The resulting 1.66&#160;eV bandgap methylamine&#8208;free perovskite solar cells achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.40% (certified at 21.97%), with the smallest VOC deficit recorded at 0.39&#160;V. Furthermore, the fabricated semitransparent WBG devices exhibit a competitive PCE of 20.13%. Consequently, four&#8208;terminal tandem cells comprising WBG perovskite top cells and 1.25&#160;eV bandgap perovskite bottom cells showcase an impressive PCE of 28.06% (stabilized 27.92%), demonstrating great potential for efficient multijunction tandem solar cell applications.

This method significantly promotes the desired crystal orientation, passivates defects, and mitigates photo-induced halide phase segregation in perovskite films, leading to substantially reduced nonradiative recombination, minimized &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; deficits, and enhanced operational stability of the devices. The resulting 1.66&#160;eV bandgap methylamine-free perovskite solar cells achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.40% (certified at 21.97%), with the smallest &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; deficit recorded at 0.39&#160;V. Furthermore, the fabricated semitransparent WBG devices exhibit a competitive PCE of 20.13%. Consequently, four-terminal tandem cells comprising WBG perovskite top cells and 1.25&#160;eV bandgap perovskite bottom cells showcase an impressive PCE of 28.06% (stabilized 27.92%), demonstrating great potential for efficient multijunction tandem solar cell applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Kagome Lattice for Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kagome (kgm)&#160;topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are rationally designed for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. COF&#8208;954 shows high and stable photocatalytic hydrogen production performance in water, 3% NaCl solution, and seawater. The water&#8208;drainage experiments also suggest the potential of COF&#8208;954 in the practical applications for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have shown great advantages as photocatalysts for hydrogen evolution. However, the effect of linkage geometry and type of linkage on the extent of &#960;&#8208;electron conjugation in the plane of the framework and photocatalytic properties of COFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, two Kagome (kgm) topologic oligo(phenylenevinylene)&#8208;based COFs are designed and synthesized for boosting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution via a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy. Under visible light irradiation, COF&#8208;954 with 5 wt% Pt as cocatalyst exhibits high hydrogen evolution rate (HER) of 137.23&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming most reported COF&#8208;based photocatalysts. More importantly, even in natural seawater, COF&#8208;954 shows an average HER of 191.70&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8211;vis) light irradiation. Additionally, the water&#8208;drainage experiments indoors and outdoors demonstrate that 25 and 8&#160;mL hydrogen gas could be produced in 80 min under UV&#8211;vis light and natural sunlight, respectively, corresponding to a high HER of 167.41 and 53.57&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1. This work not only demonstrates an effective design strategy toward highly efficient COF&#8208;based photocatalysts, but also shows the great potential of using the COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Narrowband Hetero[6]helicenes Showing Circularly Polarized Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Toward High&#8208;Performance OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A helical extension strategy is introduced to engineer deep&#8208;blue hetero[6]helicene&#8208;based emitters for circularly polarized OLEDs. Besides satisfactory chiroptical performance, this strategy endows the emitters with enhanced quantum yield and narrower emission bands compared to their precursor. The devices display record efficiencies, high color purity, and distinct circularly polarized electroluminescence, marking a significant advance in chiroptical materials for high&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
Helicenes exhibit substantial potential as circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) active molecules. However, their application in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) is typically hindered by the challenge of integrating both high color purity and efficient triplet&#8208;harvesting capability, particularly in the blue spectral region. Herein, a series of hetero[6]helicene&#8208;based emitters that is strategically engineered through the helical extension of a deep&#8208;blue double&#8208;boron&#8208;based multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) motif, is introduced. Importantly, the helical extension does not cause apparent structural deformation or perturb frontier molecular orbitals; thus, preserving the deep&#8208;blue emission and MR&#8208;TADF characteristics of the parent molecule. This approach also leads to reduced reorganization energy, resulting in emitters with narrower linewidth and higher photoluminescence quantum yield. Further, the helical motif enhances the racemization barrier and leads to improved CPL performance with luminescence dissymmetry factor values up to 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Exploiting these merits, devices incorporating the chiral dopants demonstrate deep&#8208;blue emission within the Broadcast Service Television 2020 color&#8208;gamut range, record external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) up to 29.3%, and have distinctive circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals. Overall, the authors&#8217; findings underscore the helical extension as a promising strategy for designing narrowband chiroptical materials and advancing high&#8208;definition displays.

         <title>Gold&#8208;Nanolayer&#8208;Derived Zincophilicity Suppressing Metallic Zinc Dendrites and Its Efficacy in Improving Electrochemical Stability of Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

From the initial Zn deposition, a Zn&#8208;Au alloy grows from the Au&#8208;coating layer. This further results in smooth Zn deposition, which stabilizes long&#8208;term Zn stripping/plating without Zn dendrite via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217;.








Abstract
Herein, an Au&#8208;coating layer adjusted on the surface of a Zn metal electrode that effectively suppresses the dendrite growth as well as the mechanisms underlying the dendrite suppression as a result of the zincophilic character of Au is introduced. For the Au&#8208;coated Zn metal symmetric cell, uniform deposition of Zn&#8208;derived compounds&#160;was revealed by operando synchrotron tomography. Microscopic studies demonstrate that the Au&#8208;coating layer is induced to form a new Zn&#8211;Au alloy during the initial Zn deposition, resulting in stabilized long&#8208;term stripping/plating of Zn via the &#8216;embracing effect&#8217; that intimately accommodates Zn deposition for further cycles. This property supports the successful operation of symmetrical cells up to 50 mA cm&#8722;2. According to Zn electrodeposition simulation, it is verified that the suppression of dendrite growth is responsible for the electro&#8208;conducting Au nanolayer that uniformly distributes the electric field and protects the Zn electrode from corrosion, ultimately promoting uniform Zn growth. The compatibility of the Au&#8208;coating layer for full cell configuration is verified using NaV3O8 as a cathode material over 1&#160;000 cycles. This finding provides a new pathway for the enhancement of the electrochemical performance of ZIBs by suppressing the dendritic growth of Zn by means of a zincophilic Au nanolayer.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolyte Thin Films for Pseudocapacitive Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slow evaporation from a pure water solution provides high charging rate pseudocapacitive conjugated polyelectrolyte films that are stable in aqueous electrolytes. Key to stability is increased crystallinity and a high electrolyte concentration for decreasing interchain electrostatic repulsion. This strategy may be applied for integrating organic mixed ionic electronic conductors in applications such as batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, or electrochemical sensors.








Abstract
A subclass of organic semiconductors known as conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) is characterized by a conjugated backbone with ionic pendant groups. The water solubility of CPEs typically hinders applications of thin films in aqueous media. Herein, it is reported that films of an anionic CPE, namely CPE&#8208;K, drop cast from water produces single&#8208;component solid&#8208;state pseudocapacitive electrodes that are insoluble in aqueous electrolyte. That X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments reveal a more structurally ordered film, relative to the as&#8208;obtained powder from chemical synthesis, and dynamic light scattering measurements show an increase in aggregate particle size with increasing [KCl] indicate that CPE&#8208;K films are insoluble because of tight interchain contacts and electrostatic screening by the electrolyte. CPE&#8208;K film electrodes can maintain 85% of their original capacitance (84 F g&#8722;1) at 500 A g&#8722;1 and exhibit excellent cycling stability, where a capacitance retention of 93% after 100&#160;000 cycles at a current density of 35 A g&#8722;1. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to use initially water soluble ionic&#8208;organic materials in aqueous electrolytes, by increasing the electrolyte concentration. This strategy can be applied to the application of conjugated polyelectrolytes in batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, and electrochemical sensors, where fast electron and ion transport are required.

CPE-K film electrodes can maintain 85% of their original capacitance (84 F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 500 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and exhibit excellent cycling stability, where a capacitance retention of 93% after 100&#160;000 cycles at a current density of 35 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to use initially water soluble ionic-organic materials in aqueous electrolytes, by increasing the electrolyte concentration. This strategy can be applied to the application of conjugated polyelectrolytes in batteries, organic electrochemical transistors, and electrochemical sensors, where fast electron and ion transport are required.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Surface&#8208;to&#8208;Bulk Modification of High&#8208;Voltage and Long&#8208;Life LiCoO2 Cathode with Concentration Gradient Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The essence of the currently proposed one&#8208;step multi&#8208;modification strategy for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode candidates&#160;lies in its &#8243;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8243; functionality, which systematically and comprehensively considers both the localized environment (e.g., TM&#9472;O bonding state, Li/Co migration pathway, TM&#8208;derived catalytic site for electrolyte decomposition) and the overall architecture (e.g., cathode/electrolyte interface reinforcement, gliding stacking faults reformation).








Abstract
Raising the charging cut&#8208;off voltage of layered oxide cathodes can improve their energy density. However, it inevitably introduces instabilities regarding both bulk structure and surface/interface. Herein, exploiting the unique characteristics of high&#8208;valence Nb5+ element, a synchronous surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk&#8208;modified LiCoO2 featuring Li3NbO4 surface coating layer, Nb&#8208;doped bulk, and the desired concentration gradient architecture through one&#8208;step calcination is achieved. Such a multifunctional structure facilitates the construction of high&#8208;quality cathode/electrolyte interface, enhances Li+ diffusion, and restrains lattice&#8208;O loss, Co migration, and associated layer&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase distortion. Therefore, a stable operation of Nb&#8208;modified LiCoO2 half&#8208;cell is achieved at 4.6&#160;V (90.9% capacity retention after 200 cycles). Long&#8208;life 250&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 4.7&#160;V&#8208;class 550&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cells assembled with graphite and thin Li anodes are harvested (both beyond 87% after 1600 and 200 cycles). This multifunctional one&#8208;step modification strategy establishes a technological paradigm to pave the way for high&#8208;energy density and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion cathode materials.

         <title>Designing Chemically Replaced Interfacial Layer via Unveiling the Influence of Zn Crystal Facets for Practical Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unveiling the effect of Zn crystal facets in Sn&#8208;based chemical replacement reaction (CRR), a Sn&#8208;based interfacial architecture (ZnTCF@Sn) via a novel two&#8208;step CRR is developed. Owing to its unique crystallographic (high zincophilicity and surface energy), morphological (abundant active sites and uniform current/Zn2+ flux), and compositional (suppressed side reactions of metallic Sn) merits, ZnTCF@Sn can approach a practical Zn&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Zn metal anodes (ZMAs) undergo irregular deposition and unfavorable side reactions, which hinders the practical application of aqueous rechargeable Zn metal batteries (ARZMBs). Chemical replacement reaction (CRR) strategies can achieve stable ZMAs, but the effect of the crystal facets of metallic Zn as reductants remains poorly understood. In this study, based on the observation that preferentially exposed Zn crystal facets affect the surface characteristics of chemically replaced layers in Sn&#8208;based CRR, a multifunctional Sn&#8208;based interfacial layer (ZnTCF@Sn) is designed on the Zn with textured crystal facets using a novel two&#8208;step CRR process. ZnTCF@Sn simultaneously provides abundant zincophilic sites and high surface energy and homogenizes the distribution of current/Zn2+ flux, resulting in fast electrochemical kinetics and dendrite&#8208;free deposition. Furthermore, the uniform Sn coverage on the ZnTCF@Sn surface inhibits side reactions and enhances reversibility during Zn deposition/dissolution. Thus, the ZnTCF@Sn achieves exceptional cyclability over 1200&#160;h even under harsh operating conditions with a cumulative capacity of 24 Ah cm&#8722;2. This study contributes to the development of practical ARZMBs by providing new insights into the effect of the Zn crystal facets on the surface modification of ZMAs through various CRRs.

         <title>Targeting DNA Damage and Repair Machinery via Delivering WEE1 Inhibitor and Platinum (IV) Prodrugs to Stimulate STING Pathway for Maximizing Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a glutathione&#8208;responsive nanoparticle loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775), which can increase DNA damage, activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon gene (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, ultimately enhancing chemo&#8208;immunotherapy for bladder cancer. Moreover, the nanoparticle elicits long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors when combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Both cisplatin&#8208;based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs)&#8208;based immunotherapy are the first&#8208;line treatments for patients with advanced bladder cancer. Cancer cells can develop resistance to cisplatin through extensive DNA repair, while a low response rate to ICBs is mostly due to the presence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and low PD&#8208;L1 expression. Herein, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP2) loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775) is designed. NP2 can be triggered by GSH in cancer cells, and the released MK1775 can inhibit the activity of WEE1 protein, which ultimately increases DNA damage by cisplatin. Genome&#8208;wide RNA sequencing first reveals that NP2 can inhibit DNA repair machinery by interfering with the cell cycle and significantly activate the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. Tumor growth is significantly inhibited by NP2 in vivo. As innate and adaptive immune responses are stimulated, the immunosuppressive microenvironment is modified, and the &#8220;immune cold tumor&#8221; is transformed into an &#8220;immune hot tumor". In addition, NP2 can upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, thereby increasing the response rate of PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) and eliciting long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>Energy Band Engineering Guided Design of Bidirectional Catalyst for Reversible Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and understanding of the relationship between structure and performance are essential. Under the guidance of energy band engineering, a highly efficient catalyst is designed and shows obvious bidirectional effect for CO2 redox. This work offers new avenues for designing excellent electrocatalysts in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;CO2 batteries arouse great interest in the context of carbon neutralization, but their practicability is severely hindered by the sluggish CO2 redox reaction kinetics at the cathode, which brings about formidable challenges such as high overpotential and low Coulombic efficiency. For the complex multi&#8208;electron transfer process, the design of catalysts at the molecular or atomic level and the understanding of the relationship between electron state and performance are essential for the CO2 redox. However, little attention is paid to it. In this work, using Co3S4 as a model system, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the adjusted d&#8208;band and p&#8208;band centers of Co3S4 with the introduction of Cu and sulfur vacancies are hybridized between CO2 and Li species, respectively, which is conducive to the adsorption of reactants and the decomposition of Li2CO3, and the experimental results further verify the effectiveness of energy band engineering. As a result, a highly efficient bidirectional catalyst is produced and shows an ultra&#8208;small voltage gap of 0.73&#160;V and marvelous Coulombic efficiency&#160;of 92.6%, surpassing those of previous catalysts under similar conditions. This work presents an effective catalyst design and affords new insight into the high&#8208;performance cathode catalyst materials for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

In this work, using Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a model system, density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the adjusted &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-band centers of Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with the introduction of Cu and sulfur vacancies are hybridized between CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Li species, respectively, which is conducive to the adsorption of reactants and the decomposition of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and the experimental results further verify the effectiveness of energy band engineering. As a result, a highly efficient bidirectional catalyst is produced and shows an ultra-small voltage gap of 0.73&#160;V and marvelous Coulombic efficiency&#160;of 92.6%, surpassing those of previous catalysts under similar conditions. This work presents an effective catalyst design and affords new insight into the high-performance cathode catalyst materials for Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A new super fuel cell (SFC) with single&#8208;atomic Pt on hollow porous carbon nanorods catalyst has super&#8208;high output ability through two creations of &#8220;oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) + electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC)&#8221; parallel discharging and self&#8208;charging to overcome sluggish ORR process. The promising SFC offers a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra&#8208;low Pt loading.








Abstract
Pursuing high power density with low platinum catalysts loading is a huge challenge for developing high&#8208;performance fuel cells (FCs). Herein, a new super fuel cell (SFC) is proposed with ultrahigh output power via specific electric double&#8208;layer capacitance (EDLC) + oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) parallel discharge, which is achieved using the newly prepared catalyst, single&#8208;atomic platinum on bimetallic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived hollow porous carbon nanorods (PtSA/HPCNR). The PtSA&#8208;1.74/HPCNR&#8208;based SFC has a 3.4&#8208;time higher transient specific power density and 13.3&#8208;time longer discharge time with unique in situ self&#8208;charge and energy storage ability than 20% Pt/C&#8208;based FCs. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscope, and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the synergistic effect of Pt single&#8208;atoms anchored on carbon defects significantly boosts its electron transfer, ORR catalytic activity, durability, and rate performance, realizing rapid &#8220; ORR+EDLC&#8221; parallel discharge mechanism to overcome the sluggish ORR process of traditional FCs. The promising SFC leads to a new pathway to boost the power density of FCs with extra&#8208;low Pt loading.

         <title>High&#8208;Reversibility Sulfur Anode for Advanced Aqueous Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8596;Na2S conversion is identified as a promising anodic reaction with low potential. The viability of S anode is established in S&#8211;I2 battery that uses a cost&#8208;effective and scalable sulfonated polysulfone membrane to mitigate &#8220;shuttle effects.&#8221; Compared to Zn anode, S anode avoids dendrite formation and hydrogen evolution, and it can withstand super&#8208;high utilization (100% vs &lt; 1% for Zn).








Abstract
Despite being extensively explored as cathodes in batteries, sulfur (S) can function as a low&#8208;potential anode by changing charge carriers in electrolytes. Here, a highly reversible S anode that fully converts from S80 to S2&#8722; in static aqueous S&#8211;I2 batteries by using Na+ as the charge carrier is reported. This S anode exhibits a low potential of &#8722;0.5&#160;V (vs standard hydrogen electrode) and a near&#8208;to&#8208;theoretical capacity of 1404&#160;mA h g&#8722;1. Importantly, it shows significant advantages over the widely used Zn anode in aqueous media by obviating dendrite formation and H2 evolution. To suppress &#8220;shuttle effects&#8221; faced by both S and I2 electrodes, a scalable sulfonated polysulfone (SPSF) membrane is proposed, which is superior to commercial Nafion in cost (US$1.82 m&#8722;2&#160;vs $3500 m&#8722;2) and environmental benignity. Because of its ultra&#8208;high selectivity in blocking polysulfides/iodides, the battery with SPSF displays excellent cycling stability. Even under 100% depth of discharge, the battery demonstrates high capacity retention of 87.6% over 500 cycles, outperforming Zn&#8211;I2 batteries with 3.1% capacity under the same conditions. These findings broaden anode options beyond metals for high&#8208;energy, low&#8208;cost, and fast&#8208;chargeable batteries.

         <title>Reinforcing the Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases of Lithium Metal Batteries Employing Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte based on trifluoromethoxybenzene cosolvent is proposed for lithium metal batteries with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes, through a comparative study of three fluorinated aromatic cosolvents. The generated solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on anodes and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in organic cation&#8208;derived species on cathodes enable stable cycling of Li/LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cells.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with nickel&#8208;rich cathodes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, but the lack of sufficiently protective electrode/electrolyte interphases (EEIs) limits their cyclability. Herein, trifluoromethoxybenzene is proposed as a cosolvent for locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolytes (LCILEs) to reinforce the EEIs. With a comparative study of a neat ionic liquid electrolyte (ILE) and three LCILEs employing fluorobenzene, trifluoromethylbenzene, or trifluoromethoxybenzene as cosolvents, it is revealed that the fluorinated groups tethered to the benzene ring of the cosolvents not only affect the electrolytes&#8217; ionic conductivity and fluidity, but also the EEIs&#8217; composition via adjusting the contribution of the 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (Emim+) and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide anion. Trifluoromethoxybenzene, as the optimal cosolvent, leads to a stable cycling of LMBs employing 5 mAh cm&#8722;2 lithium metal anodes (LMAs), 21&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05 (NCA) cathodes, and 4.2&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1 electrolytes for 150 cycles with a remarkable capacity retention of 71%, thanks to a solid electrolyte interphase rich in inorganic species on LMAs and, particularly, a uniform cathode/electrolyte interphase rich in Emim+&#8208;derived species on NCA cathodes. By contrast, the capacity retention under the same condition is only 16%, 46%, and 18% for the neat ILE and the LCILEs based on fluorobenzene and benzotrifluoride, respectively.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Polyoxometalates Act as Superchaotropic Membrane Carriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic anions of the polyoxometalate type display a new biological activity: They efficiently transport cationic peptides across lipidic and cellular membranes. This function is related to their superchaotropic nature, resulting in strong and concomitant interactions with peptides and lipids. Mixed&#8208;metal Keggin&#8208;type anions show the required hydrolytic stability and sufficiently low charge density that are prerequisites for the desirable carrier utility.








Abstract
Polyoxometalates (POMs) are known antitumoral, antibacterial, antiviral, and anticancer agents and considered as next&#8208;generation metallodrugs. Herein, a new biological functionality in neutral physiological media, where selected mixed&#8208;metal POMs are sufficiently stable and able to affect membrane transport of impermeable, hydrophilic, and cationic peptides (heptaarginine, heptalysine, protamine, and polyarginine) is reported. The uptake is observed in both, model membranes as well as cells, and attributed to the superchaotropic properties of the polyoxoanions. In view of the structural diversity of POMs these findings pave the way toward their biomedical application in drug delivery or for cell&#8208;biological uptake studies with biological effector molecules or staining agents.

Herein, a new biological functionality in neutral physiological media, where selected mixed-metal POMs are sufficiently stable and able to affect membrane transport of impermeable, hydrophilic, and cationic peptides (heptaarginine, heptalysine, protamine, and polyarginine) is reported. The uptake is observed in both, model membranes as well as cells, and attributed to the superchaotropic properties of the polyoxoanions. In view of the structural diversity of POMs these findings pave the way toward their biomedical application in drug delivery or for cell-biological uptake studies with biological effector molecules or staining agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recycled Tandem Catalysts Promising Ultralow Overpotential Li&#8208;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One critical challenge&#160;of lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries&#160;is to develop highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts with precise structure. A tandem catalyst with an in&#8208;built electric field is elaborately recycled from the spent batteries and exhibits remarkable bidirectional activities. This work affords new opportunities to fabricate low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation to engineer better Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;carbon dioxide (Li&#8208;CO2) batteries are regarded as a prospective technology to relieve the pressure of greenhouse emissions but are confronted with sluggish CO2 redox kinetics and low energy efficiency. Developing highly efficient and low&#8208;cost catalysts to boost bidirectional activities is craved but remains a huge challenge. Herein, derived from the spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, a tandem catalyst is subtly synthesized and significantly accelerates the CO2 reduction and evolution reactions (CO2RR and CO2ER) kinetics with an in&#8208;built electric field (BEF). Combining with the theoretical calculations and advanced characterization techniques, this work reveals that the designed interface&#8208;induced BEF regulates the adsorption/decomposition of the intermediates during CO2RR and CO2ER, endowing the recycled tandem catalyst with excellent bidirectional activities. As a result, the spent electronics&#8208;derived tandem catalyst exhibits remarkable bidirectional catalytic performance, such as an ultralow voltage gap of 0.26&#160;V and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 92.4%. Profoundly, this work affords new opportunities to fabricate low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts from recycled spent electronics and inspires fresh perceptions of interfacial regulation including but not limited to BEF to engineer better Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Thermochromic Photonic Crystal Paper with Integrated Multilayer Structure and Fast Thermal Response: A Waterproof and Mechanically Stable Material for Structural&#8208;Colored Thermal Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic&#8208;SiO2 photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para) multilayer film is fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing. The fast thermal response enables high&#8208;resolution and grayscale printing. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure ensures good stability in daily liquids and enhances its mechanical stability for better user experience.








Abstract
Thermochromic photonic crystals are promising materials for thermal printing due to their unfaded colors under chemical/illuminated environments and the absence of toxic chemicals. However, the slow thermochromic response, the multistep printing procedures, the use of inks or developing liquids, and the requirement of expensive parts in printers limit their applications. Here, a thermochromic polyurethane/hydrophobic&#8208;SiO2 photonic crystal/paraffin (PU/HPO&#8208;SiO2&#8208;PC/Para)&#160;film with an integrated multilayer structure is fabricated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state and single&#8208;step thermal printing that is fully compatible with commercial printers. The fast thermochromic response in milliseconds enables high&#8208;resolution and grayscale printing as the paraffin infiltration and the color change can be finely controlled in a microscale range. The integrated and hydrophobic multilayer structure renders the thermochromic film good stability in daily liquids, which addresses the long&#8208;existing concern of print fading. Meanwhile, the integrated multilayer structure also enhances the mechanical stability when it is deposited on fibrous paper so that people can fold, cut, or staple the thermal papers, and make notes confidently in practical usage.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Modulated Ionic Polymer as an Adaptable Electron Transport Material for Optically Switchable Pixel&#8208;Free Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive photosensitive ionic polymer comprising photocrosslinkable moieties and electron transport moieties enables organic light&#8208;emitting devices to be switched by external optical direct writing and erasing. Independent solution&#8208;processed electron transport layer (ETL) using photo&#8208;modulated ionic polymer realizes the fabrication of optically switchable pixel&#8208;free displays (OSPFDs) with tunable illuminants and seamless imaging capability.








Abstract
In addition to electrically driven organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED)&#160;displays that rely on complicated and costly circuits for switching individual pixel illumination, developing a facile approach that structures pixel&#8208;free light&#8208;emitting displays with exceptional precision and spatial resolution via external photo&#8208;modulation holds significant importance for advancing consumer electronics. Here, optically switchable organic light&#8208;emitting pixel&#8208;free displays (OSPFDs) are presented and fabricated by judiciously combining an adaptive photosensitive ionic polymer as electron transport materials (ETM) with external photo&#8208;modulation as the switching mode while ensuring superior illumination performance and seamless imaging capability. By irradiating the solution&#8208;processed OSPFDs with light at specific wavelengths, efficient and reversible tuning of both electron transport and electroluminescence is achieved simultaneously. This remarkable control is achieved by altering the energetic matching within OSPFDs, which also exhibits a high level of universality and adjustable flexibility in the three primary color&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting displays. Moreover, the ease of creating and erasing desired pixel&#8208;free emitting patterns through a non&#8208;invasive photopatterning process within a single OSPFD is demonstrated, thereby rendering this approach promising for commercial displaying devices and highly precise pixelated illuminants.

         <title>Fabrication of Oriented Polycrystalline MOF Superstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have progressed beyond powdery and single&#8208;crystalline materials towards polycrystalline superstructures. A current challenge is&#160;the fabrication of superstructures with defined crystalline orientation to access anisotropic properties. This perspective examines methods for the fabrication of oriented MOF superstructures (colloidal assembly, external fields, heteroepitaxial ceramic&#8208;to&#8208;MOF, and other emerging methods), to promote the development of systems with oriented pore channels.








Abstract
The field of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) has progressed beyond the design and exploration of powdery and single&#8208;crystalline materials. A current challenge is the fabrication of organized superstructures that can harness the directional properties of the individual constituent MOF crystals. To date, the progress in the fabrication methods of polycrystalline MOF superstructures has led to close&#8208;packed structures with defined crystalline orientation. By controlling the crystalline orientation, the MOF pore channels of the constituent crystals can be aligned along specific directions: these systems possess anisotropic properties including enhanced diffusion along specific directions, preferential orientation of guest species, and protection of functional guests. In this perspective, we&#160;discuss the current status of MOF research in the fabrication of oriented polycrystalline superstructures focusing on the specific crystalline directions of orientation. Three methods are examined in detail: the assembly from colloidal MOF solutions, the use of external fields for the alignment of MOF particles, and the heteroepitaxial ceramic&#8208;to&#8208;MOF growth. This perspective aims at promoting the progress of this field of research and inspiring the development of new protocols for the preparation of MOF systems with oriented pore channels, to enable advanced MOF&#8208;based devices with anisotropic properties.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphoteric organic salt, 4FPEAPSA, is applied as the buried interface bridged layer to induce large&#8208;grain perovskite film with uniform morphology. 4FPEAPSA treatment can facilitate the matchable energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface, reducing defect recombination loss. Such a multi&#8208;functional bridged layer enables a high efficiency of 25.03% and preferable stability in the inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs).








Abstract
Synergistic morphology and defects management at the buried perovskite interface are challenging but crucial for the further improvement of inverted perovskite solar cells (PerSCs). Herein, an amphoteric organic salt, 2&#8208;(4&#8208;fluorophenyl)ethylammonium&#8208;4&#8208;methyl benzenesulfonate (4FPEAPSA), is designed to optimize the film morphology and energy level alignment at the perovskite buried interface. 4FPEAPSA treatment promotes the growth of a void&#8208;free, coarse&#8208;grained, and hydrophobic film by inducing the crystal orientation. Besides, the dual&#8208;functional 4FPEAPSA can chemically interact with the perovskite film, and passivate the defects of iodine and formamidine vacancies, tending to revert the fermi level of perovskite to its defect&#8208;free state. Meanwhile, the formation of a p&#8208;type doping buried interface can facilitate the interfacial charge extraction and transport of PerSCs for reduced carrier recombination loss. Consequently, 4FPEAPSA treatment improves the efficiency of the perovskite devices to 25.03% with better storage, heat, and humidity stability. This work contributes to strengthening the systematic understanding of the perovskite buried interface, providing a synergetic approach to realize precise morphology control, effective defect suppression, and energy level alignment for efficient PerSCs.

         <title>Selenophene Substitution Enabled High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors for Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Glucose Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With selenophene substitution, the resulting polymers demonstrate enhanced charge transport properties and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities, resulting in unprecedented performance for n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors. These advancements hold great promise for various biosensing applications, exemplified by the successful development of a highly sensitive glucose sensor.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) are essential for realizing organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs)&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors, but their development still remains a great challenge. Herein, by devising two novel n&#8208;type polymers (f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;SVSCN and f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN) containing varying selenophene contents together with their thiophene&#8208;based counterpart as the control, it is demonstrated that gradually increasing selenophene loading in polymer backbones can simultaneously yield lowered lowest unoccupied molecular orbital levels, boosted charge&#8208;transport properties, and improved ion&#8208;uptake capabilities. Therefore, a remarkable volumetric capacitance (C*) of 387.2 F cm&#8722;3 and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OECT electron mobility (&#181;e,OECT) of 0.48 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are synchronously achieved for f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN having the highest selenophene content, yielding an unprecedented geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm) of 71.4 S cm&#8722;1 and record figure of merit (&#181;C*) value of 191.2 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for n&#8208;type OECTs. Thanks to such excellent performance of f&#8208;BSeI2g&#8208;SVSCN&#8208;based OECTs, a glucose sensor with a remarkably low detection limit of 10&#160;nMm and decent selectivity is further implemented, demonstrating the power of selenophene substitution strategy in enabling high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type PMIECs for biosensing applications.

         <title>Unraveling the Coupling Effect between Cathode and Anode toward Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Butler&#8211;Volmer equation fundamentally describes the relationship between electrode overpotential and local current densities. Inspired by the equation, a binary descriptor (IBD) is proposed to guide the design of sulfur cathodes. This descriptor can evaluate the influence of mass transport and charge transfer on reaction kinetics, and unravel the coupling effect between sulfur cathode and Li anode.








Abstract
The localized reaction heterogeneity of the sulfur cathode and the uneven Li deposition on the Li anode are intractable issues for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries under practical operation. Despite impressive progress in separately optimizing the sulfur cathode or Li anode, a comprehensive understanding of the highly coupled relationship between the cathode and anode is still lacking. In this work, inspired by the Butler&#8211;Volmer equation, a binary descriptor (IBD) assisting the rational structural design of sulfur cathode by simultaneously considering the mass&#8208;transport index (Imass) and the charge&#8208;transfer index (Icharge) is identified, and subsequently the relationship between IBD and the morphological evolution of Li anode is established. Guided by the IBD, a scalable electrode providing interpenetrated flow channels for efficient mass/charge transfer, full utilization of active sulfur, and mechanically elastic support for aggressive electrochemical reactions under practical conditions is reported. These characteristics induce a homogenous distribution of local current densities and reduced reaction heterogeneity on both sides of the cathode and anode. Impressive energy density of 318&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 473&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 in an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell can be achieved by the design concept. This work offers a promising paradigm for unlocking the interaction between cathode and anode and designing high&#8208;energy practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>A Layered Bi2Te3@PPy Cathode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries: Mechanism and Application in Printed Flexible Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors analyze the reaction mechanism of Bi2Te3&#8208;based cathode for zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) and demonstrate that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. The authors also demonstrate the great application prospect of aqueous ZIBs in flexible electronics via jet printing technology.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost, safe, and environmental&#8208;friendly rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising as next&#8208;generation energy storage devices for wearable electronics among other applications. However, sluggish ionic transport kinetics and the unstable electrode structure during ionic insertion/extraction hamper their deployment. Herein, a new cathode material based on a layered metal chalcogenide (LMC), bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), coated with polypyrrole (PPy) is proposed. Taking advantage of the PPy coating, the Bi2Te3@PPy composite presents strong ionic absorption affinity, high oxidation resistance, and high structural stability. The ZIBs based on Bi2Te3@PPy cathodes exhibit high capacities and ultra&#8208;long lifespans of over 5000 cycles. They also present outstanding stability even under bending. In addition, here the reaction mechanism is analyzed using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and computational tools and it is demonstrated that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. Overall, this work not only shows the great potential of LMCs as ZIB cathode materials and the advantages of PPy coating, but also clarifies the charge/discharge mechanism in rechargeable ZIBs based on LMCs.

By synthesizing a random terpolymer PBDB&#8208;TFCl and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation and reinforced molecular packing are obtained. Resulting flexible organic solar modules exhibit maximum power conversion efficiency of 12.7% and excellent mechanical properties and photostability.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) possess excellent operation stability and mechanical robustness than other types of organic solar cells, thereby attracting considerable attention for wearable flexible electron devices. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;PSCs are still lagging behind those of small&#8208;molecule&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based systems owing to the limitation of photoactive materials and unsatisfactory blend morphology. In this work, a novel terpolymer, denoted as PBDB&#8208;TFCl (poly4,8&#8208;bis(5&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;4&#8208;fluorothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8243;]dithiophene&#8208;1,3&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;5,7&#8208;di(thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;4H,8H&#8208;benzo[1,2&#8208;c:4,5&#8208;c&#8243;]dithiophene&#8208;4,8&#8208;dione&#8208;4,8&#8208;bis(4&#8208;chloro&#8208;5&#8208;(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene), is used as an electron donor coupled with a ternary strategy to optimize the performance of all&#8208;PSCs. The addition of PBDB&#8208;TCl unit deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level, reducing voltage losses. Moreover, the introduction of the guest donor (D18&#8208;Cl) effectively regulates the phase&#8208;transition kinetics of PBDB&#8208;TFCl:D18&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT during the film formation, leading to ideal size of aggregations and enhanced crystallinity. PBDB&#8208;TFCl:D18&#8208;Cl:PY&#8208;IT devices exhibit a PCE of 18.6% (certified as 18.3%), judged as the highest value so far obtained with all&#8208;PSCs. Besides, based on the ternary active layer, the manufactured 36 cm2 flexible modules exhibit a PCE of 15.1%. Meanwhile, the ternary PSCs exhibit superior photostability and mechanical stability. In summary, the proposed strategy, based on molecular design and the ternary strategy, allows optimization of the all&#8208;polymer blend morphology and improvement of the photovoltaic performance for stable large&#8208;scale flexible PSCs.

         <title>How Photogenerated I2 Induces I&#8208;Rich Phase Formation in Lead Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photogenerated I2 in the mixed I&#8208;Br perovskite induces I&#8208;rich phase formation through a chemical chain reaction. The Br&#8722; binding strength in the perovskite regulates the chemical chain reaction and thus the I&#8208;rich phase formation. This study demonstrates the increasing of Br&#8208;binding strength and eliminating of defects leading to I2 photogeneration in the lattice to stabilize the mixed I&#8208;Br perovskite.








Abstract
Bandgap tunability of lead mixed halide perovskites (LMHPs) is a crucial characteristic for versatile optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, LMHPs show the formation of iodide&#8208;rich (I&#8208;rich) phase under illumination, which destabilizes the semiconductor bandgap and impedes their exploitation. Here, it is shown that how I2, photogenerated upon charge carrier trapping at iodine interstitials in LMHPs, can promote the formation of I&#8208;rich phase. I2 can react with bromide (Br&#8722;) in the perovskite to form a trihalide ion I2Br&#8722; (I&#948;&#8722;&#8208;I&#948;+&#8208;Br&#948;&#8722;), whose negatively charged iodide (I&#948;&#8722;) can further exchange with another lattice Br&#8722; to form the I&#8208;rich phase. Importantly, it is observed that the effectiveness of the process is dependent on the overall stability of the crystalline perovskite structure. Therefore, the bandgap instability in LMHPs is governed by two factors, i.e., the density of native defects leading to I2 production and the Br&#8722; binding strength within the crystalline unit. Eventually, this study provides rules for the design of chemical composition in LMHPs to reach their full potential for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Grain Engineering of Sb2S3 Thin Films to Enable Efficient Planar Solar Cells with High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work achieves large&#8208;grained Sb2S3 films by incorporating Ce3+ into the precursor solution for hydrothermal deposition. The formation of ultrathin Ce2S3 at the CdS/Sb2S3 interface is proposed to mediate the nucleation and growth of Sb2S3 grains. Planar Sb2S3 solar cells are achieved with an open&#8208;circuit voltage&#160;close to 800 mV (the highest reported to date), along with competitive efficiencies up to 7.66%.








Abstract
Sb2S3 is a promising environmentally friendly semiconductor for high performance solar cells. But, like many other polycrystalline materials, Sb2S3 is limited by nonradiative recombination and carrier scattering by grain boundaries (GBs). This work shows how the GB density in Sb2S3 films can be significantly reduced from 1068&#160;&#177;&#160;40&#160;to 327&#160;&#177;&#160;23&#160;nm &#181;m&#8722;2 by incorporating an appropriate amount of Ce3+ into the precursor solution for Sb2S3 deposition. Through extensive characterization of structural, morphological, and optoelectronic properties, complemented with computations, it is revealed that a critical factor is the formation of an ultrathin Ce2S3 layer at the CdS/Sb2S3 interface, which can reduce the interfacial energy and increase the adhesion work between Sb2S3 and the substrate to encourage heterogeneous nucleation of Sb2S3, as well as promote lateral grain growth. Through reductions in nonradiative recombination at GBs and/or the CdS/Sb2S3 heterointerface, as well as improved charge&#8208;carrier transport properties at the heterojunction, this work achieves high performance Sb2S3 solar cells with a power conversion efficiency reaching 7.66%. An impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 796&#160;mV is achieved, which is the highest reported thus far for Sb2S3 solar cells. This work provides a strategy to simultaneously regulate the nucleation and growth of Sb2S3 absorber films for enhanced device performance.

         <title>Spontaneous Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pairs and Their Topological Transitions in a Chiral&#8208;Lattice Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging field of quantum computing, which relies on multiple electronic states, has recently garnered significant attention. Here, the on&#8208;demand creation of multiple states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including (anti)merons with N&#160;=&#160;&#177;1/2, bimerons, and skyrmions with N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 is presented. The transformations among these states through the application of magnetic fields and electric currents are demonstrated.








Abstract
The spontaneous formation and topological transitions of vortex&#8208;antivortex pairs have implications for a broad range of emergent phenomena, for example, from superconductivity to quantum computing. Unlike magnets exhibiting collinear spin textures, helimagnets with noncollinear spin textures provide unique opportunities to manipulate topological forms such as (anti)merons and (anti)skyrmions. However, it is challenging to achieve multiple topological states and their interconversion in a single helimagnet due to the topological protection for each state. Here, the on&#8208;demand creation of multiple topological states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including a spontaneous vortex pair of meron with topological charge N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1/2 and antimeron with N&#160;=&#160;1/2, and a vortex&#8208;antivortex bundle, that is, a bimeron (meron pair) with N&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 is reported. The mutual transformation between skyrmions and bimerons with respect to the competitive effects of magnetic field and magnetic shape anisotropy is demonstrated. It is shown that electric currents drive the individual bimerons to form their connecting assembly and then into a skyrmion lattice. These findings signify the feasibility of designing topological states and offer new insights into the manipulation of noncollinear spin textures for potential applications in various fields.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spontaneous formation and topological transitions of vortex-antivortex pairs have implications for a broad range of emergent phenomena, for example, from superconductivity to quantum computing. Unlike magnets exhibiting collinear spin textures, helimagnets with noncollinear spin textures provide unique opportunities to manipulate topological forms such as (anti)merons and (anti)skyrmions. However, it is challenging to achieve multiple topological states and their interconversion in a single helimagnet due to the topological protection for each state. Here, the on-demand creation of multiple topological states in a helimagnet Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Ge, including a spontaneous vortex pair of meron with topological charge &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1/2 and antimeron with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;1/2, and a vortex-antivortex bundle, that is, a bimeron (meron pair) with &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 is reported. The mutual transformation between skyrmions and bimerons with respect to the competitive effects of magnetic field and magnetic shape anisotropy is demonstrated. It is shown that electric currents drive the individual bimerons to form their connecting assembly and then into a skyrmion lattice. These findings signify the feasibility of designing topological states and offer new insights into the manipulation of noncollinear spin textures for potential applications in various fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printed Cellulose Nanofiber Aerogel Scaffold with Hierarchical Porous Structures for Fast Solar&#8208;Driven Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cellulose nanofiber&#8208;based bilayer scaffold for atmospheric water harvesting has been developed through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying, which introduces both a&#160;millimeter&#8208;sized grid structure for water sorption and evaporation enhancement, and a micrometer&#8208;sized pore structure for lithium chloride confinement. Benefiting from the milli/micrometer pore structures, the scaffold shows an excellent water sorption/release performance and good cyclic stability.








Abstract
Hygroscopic salt&#8208;based composite sorbents are considered ideal candidates for solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting. The primary challenge for the sorbents lies in exposing more hygroscopically active sites to the surrounding air while preventing salt leakage. Herein, a hierarchically structured scaffold is constructed by integrating cellulose nanofiber and lithium chloride (LiCl) as building blocks through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying. The milli/micrometer multiscale pores can effectively confine LiCl and simultaneously provide a more exposed active area for water sorption and release, accelerating both water sorption and evaporation kinetics of the 3D printed structure. Compared to a conventional freeze&#8208;dried aerogel, the 3D printed scaffold exhibits a water sorption rate that is increased 1.6&#8208;fold, along with a more than 2.4&#8208;fold greater water release rate. An array of bilayer scaffolds is demonstrated, which can produce 0.63&#160;g g&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 of water outdoors under natural sunlight. This article provides a sustainable strategy for collecting freshwater from the atmosphere.

         <title>Orderly Nanodendritic Nickel Substitute for Raney Nickel Catalyst Improving Alkali Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orderly dendritic nickel catalyst enables more effective charge/mass transport for high current density hydrogen evolution and promises an alternative to commercial Raney nickel in alkaline water electrolyzers.








Abstract
The development of nonprecious metal catalysts to meet the activity&#8208;stability balance at industrial&#8208;grade large current densities remains a challenge toward practical alkali&#8208;water electrolysis. Here, this work develops an orderly nanodendritic nickel (ND&#8208;Ni) catalyst that consists of ultrafine nanograins in chain&#8208;like&#160;conformation, which shows both excellent activity and robust stability for large current density hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, superior to currently applied Raney nickel (R&#8208;Ni) catalyst in commercial alkali&#8208;water electrolyzer (AWE). The ND&#8208;Ni catalyst featured by a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) interconnecting microporous structure endows with high specific surface area and excellent conductivity and hydrophilicity, which together afford superior charge/mass transport favorable to HER kinetics at high current densities. An actual AWE with ND&#8208;Ni catalyst demonstrates durable water splitting with 1.0&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 at 1.71&#160;V under industrial conditions and renders a record&#8208;low power consumption of 3.95&#160;kW h Nm&#8722;3 with an energy efficiency close to 90%. The hydrogen price per gallon of gasoline equivalent (GGE) is calculated to be &#8776;$0.95, which is less than the target of $2.0 per GGE by 2026 from the U.S. Department of Energy. The results suggest the feasibility of ND&#8208;Ni substitute for R&#8208;Ni catalyst in commercial AWE.

         <title>Electrochemically and Thermally Stable Inorganics&#8211;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphase for Robust Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase is constructed, which is electrochemically and thermally stable during the long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. More than 6 times longer cycles compared with routine cells are achieved in 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type cells. The onset and triggering temperatures during the thermal runaway are increased from 70.8 and 117.4 to 100.6 and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively.








Abstract
Severe dendrite growth and high&#8208;level activity of the lithium metal anode lead to a short life span and poor safety, seriously hindering the practical applications of lithium metal batteries. With a trisalt electrolyte design, an F&#8208;/N&#8208;containing inorganics&#8211;rich solid electrolyte interphase on a lithium anode is constructed, which is electrochemically and thermally stable over long&#8208;term cycles and safety abuse conditions. As a result, its Coulombic efficiency can be maintained over&#160;98.98% for 400 cycles. An 85.0% capacity can be retained for coin&#8208;type full cells with a 3.14 mAh cm&#8722;2 LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode after 200 cycles and 1.0 Ah pouch&#8208;type full cells with a 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode after 72 cycles. During the thermal runaway tests of a cycled 1.0 Ah pouch cell, the onset and triggering temperatures&#160;were increased from 70.8 &#176;C&#160;and 117.4 &#176;C&#160;to 100.6 &#176;C&#160;and 153.1&#160;&#176;C, respectively, indicating a greatly enhanced safety performance. This work gives&#160;novel insights into electrolyte and interface design, potentially paving the way for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, long&#8208;life&#8208;span, and thermally safe lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Manipulating Electron Redistribution in Ni2P for Enhanced Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv is successfully synthesized through manipulation of electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. Bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieves the industrially required high current densities at low voltages for overall seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;m KOH seawater. In Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv, P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity, and Ni sites are the dominant oxygen evolution reaction active centers; meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER, synergistically improve electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Developing bifunctional electrocatalyst for seawater splitting remains a persistent challenge. Herein, an approach is proposed through density functional theory (DFT) preanalysis to manipulate electron redistribution in Ni2P addressed by cation doping and vacancy engineering. The needle&#8208;like Fe&#8208;doped Ni2P with P vacancy (Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv) is successfully synthesized on nickel foam, exhibiting a superior bifunctional hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity for seawater electrolysis in alkaline condition. As a result, bifunctional Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv achieves the industrially required current densities of 1.0 and 3.0 A cm&#8722;2 at low voltages of 1.68 and 1.73&#160;V, respectively, for seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;m KOH circumstances. The theoretical calculation and the experimental results collectively reveal the reasons for the enhancement of catalyst activity. Specifically, Fe doping and P vacancies can accelerate the reconstruction of OER active species and optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;GH*) for HER. In addition, the active sites of Fe&#8208;Ni2Pv are identified, where P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity and Ni sites are the dominant OER active centers, meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER. The study provides a deep insight into the exploration for the enhancement of activity of nickel&#8208;based phosphide catalysts and the identification of their real active centers.

As a result, bifunctional Fe-Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pv achieves the industrially required current densities of 1.0 and 3.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at low voltages of 1.68 and 1.73&#160;V, respectively, for seawater splitting at 60 &#176;C in 6.0&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH circumstances. The theoretical calculation and the experimental results collectively reveal the reasons for the enhancement of catalyst activity. Specifically, Fe doping and P vacancies can accelerate the reconstruction of OER active species and optimize the hydrogen adsorption free energy (&#916;&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;H*&lt;/sub&gt;) for HER. In addition, the active sites of Fe-Ni&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pv are identified, where P vacancies greatly improve the electrical conductivity and Ni sites are the dominant OER active centers, meanwhile Fe atoms as active centers for the HER. The study provides a deep insight into the exploration for the enhancement of activity of nickel-based phosphide catalysts and the identification of their real active centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries
Chemically replaced interfacial layer design, via unveiling the influence of zinc (Zn) crystal facets for aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries, is introduced by Dong&#8208;Wan Kim and co&#8208;workers in article number 2308684. Owing to the unique crystallographic (high zincophilicity and surface energy), morphological (abundant active sites and uniform current/Zn2+ flux), and compositional (suppressed side&#8208;reactions of metallic Sn) merits of the chemically replaced layer, uniform dendrite&#8208;free Zn(002)&#8208;preferred Zn deposition is guided and unfavorable side&#8208;reactions are suppressed. A superior performance even under practical operating conditions is thereby achieved.

Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2305128, Qing Sun, Shang Wang, Yanhong Tian, Andreu Cabot, and co&#8208;workers report an investigation of the energy&#8208;storage mechanism of a layered Bi2Te3&#8208;based cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs). They demonstrate that the zinc ion is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed; in contrast, proton charge&#8208;storage dominates the process. They also demonstrate the great application prospects of aqueous ZIBs in flexible electronics via jet printing technology.

Zinc Anodes
In article number 2307219, Huanlei Wang, Jingyi Wu, Guihua Yu, and co&#8208;workers report Co single atoms as an electrolyte additive to facilitate dendrite&#8208;free zinc anodes. The additive can be preferentially adsorbed on the zinc surface in which the atomically dispersed zincophilic active site with strong charge polarization effect regulates the microspace electric field at the Zn&#8211;electrolyte interphase, thus promoting uniform zinc deposition.

These prominent performances not only strongly rely on the ultralow permeability resistance of atomically thin graphene, but they also are attributed to the synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions.

Atmospheric Water Harvesting
In article number 2306653, Wenshuai Chen, Gang Chen, Feng Jiang, and co&#8208;workers report a hierarchically structured cellulose nanofiber/lithium chloride scaffold through 3D printing combined with freeze&#8208;drying methods for solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting. The milli&#8208;/micrometer multiscale pores provide more exposed active area with the surrounding air, thus accelerating both water sorption and evaporation kinetics of the 3D&#8208;printed structure.

         <title>Liquid Metal Actuators: A Comparative Analysis of Surface Tension Controlled Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the operation and design principles of surface tension&#8208;controlled actuation by liquid metals and discusses their performance and functionalities. Theoretical pathways toward higher performances, thanks to the unique scaling law of surface tension, are analyzed and compared to other popular soft actuators. The review concludes by offering a roadmap for future research&#160;directions.








Abstract
Liquid metals, with their unique combination of electrical and mechanical properties, offer great opportunities for actuation based on surface tension modulation. Thanks to the scaling laws of surface tension, which can be electrochemically controlled at low voltages, liquid metal actuators stand out from other soft actuators for their remarkable characteristics such as high contractile strain rates and higher work densities at smaller length scales. This review summarizes the principles of liquid metal actuators and discusses their performance as well as theoretical pathways toward higher performances. The objective is to provide a comparative analysis of the ongoing development of liquid metal actuators. The design principles of the liquid metal actuators are analyzed, including low&#8208;level elemental principles (kinematics and electrochemistry), mid&#8208;level structural principles (reversibility, integrity, and scalability), and high&#8208;level functionalities. A wide range of practical use cases of liquid metal actuators from robotic locomotion and object manipulation to logic and computation is reviewed. From an energy perspective, strategies are compared for coupling the liquid metal actuators with an energy source toward fully untethered robots. The review concludes by offering a roadmap of future research directions of liquid metal actuators.

         <title>Coplanar Conformational Structure of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coplanar conformational segment of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer is a unique structure with a rigid backbone, long effective conjugated length, and narrow bandgap, which may enhance emission behavior, strengthen &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and improve charge transport. This overview mainly reports the recent development of coplanar conformational structure of &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers. The characteristics, analysis methods, preparation, and their optoelectronic application are introduced and summarized systematically.








Abstract
Hierarchical structure of conjugated polymers is critical to dominating their optoelectronic properties and applications. Compared to nonplanar conformational segments, coplanar conformational segments of conjugated polymers (CPs) demonstrate favorable properties for applications as a semiconductor. Herein, recent developments in the coplanar conformational structure of CPs for optoelectronic devices are summarized. First, this review comprehensively summarizes the unique properties of planar conformational structures. Second, the characteristics of the coplanar conformation in terms of optoelectrical properties and other polymer physics characteristics are emphasized. Five primary characterization methods for investigating the complanate backbone structures are illustrated, providing a systematical toolbox for studying this specific conformation. Third, internal and external conditions for inducing the coplanar conformational structure are presented, offering guidelines for designing this conformation. Fourth, the optoelectronic applications of this segment, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, solar cells, and field&#8208;effect transistors, are briefly summarized. Finally, a conclusion and outlook for the coplanar conformational segment regarding molecular design and applications are provided.

         <title>3D Motion Manipulation for Micro&#8208; and Nanomachines: Progress and Future Directions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the latest progress made in micro&#8208; and nanomachines (MNMs) with three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motion capabilities by different manipulation approaches, discusses the underlying motion mechanisms and their corresponding applications, explores potential design concepts inspired by nature for guiding the future design direction in controllable 3D motile MNMs, and presents the available 3D observation and tracking systems.








Abstract
In the past decade, micro&#8208; and nanomachines (MNMs) have made outstanding achievements in the fields of targeted drug delivery, tumor therapy, microsurgery, biological detection, and environmental monitoring and remediation. Researchers have made significant efforts to accelerate the rapid development of MNMs capable of moving through fluids by means of different energy sources (chemical reactions, ultrasound, light, electricity, magnetism, heat, or their combinations). However, the motion of MNMs is primarily investigated in confined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) horizontal setups. Furthermore, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) motion control remains challenging, especially for vertical movement and control, significantly limiting its potential applications in cargo transportation, environmental remediation, and biotherapy. Hence, an urgent need is to develop MNMs that can overcome self&#8208;gravity and controllably move in 3D spaces. This review delves into the latest progress made in MNMs with 3D motion capabilities under different manipulation approaches, discusses the underlying motion mechanisms, explores potential design concepts inspired by nature for controllable 3D motion in MNMs, and presents the available 3D observation and tracking systems.

         <title>Bistable Spin&#8208;Crossover Nanoparticles for Molecular Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;crossover materials showing bistability are very attractive for fabricating molecular electronic devices. Departing from chemical design, this paper reports on how the miniaturization as nanoparticles and their integration into various architectures, in particular combining them with two&#8208;dimensional materials,&#160;provides a suitable approach to prepare robust and resilient devices for electrically sensing spin transitions.








Abstract
The field of spin&#8208;crossover complexes is rapidly evolving from the study of the spin transition phenomenon to its exploitation in molecular electronics. Such spin transition is gradual in a single&#8208;molecule, while in bulk it can be abrupt, showing sometimes thermal hysteresis and thus a memory effect. A convenient way to keep this bistability while reducing the size of the spin&#8208;crossover material is to process it as nanoparticles (NPs). Here, the most recent advances in the chemical design of these NPs and their integration into electronic devices, paying particular attention to optimizing the switching ratio are reviewed. Then, integrating spin&#8208;crossover NPs over 2D materials is focused to improve the endurance, performance, and detection of the spin state in these hybrid devices.

         <title>Inorganic All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries: Electrolyte Designing and Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes various inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (such as oxide&#8208;based, NASICON&#8208;type, sulfide&#8208;based, etc.) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries. Their crystal structures, and modification strategies to enhance ionic conductivity are discussed. Additionally, methods for modifying the interfaces between solid electrolytes and cathodes/anodes, and optimizing full battery performance are explored. Lastly, the future development directions of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries are proposed.








Abstract
Inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (IASSSBs) are emerged as promising candidates to replace commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to their potential advantages, such as abundant raw materials, robust safety, low price, high&#8208;energy density, favorable reliability and stability. Inorganic sodium solid electrolytes (ISSEs) are an indispensable component of IASSSBs, gaining significant attention. Herein, this review begins by discussing the fundamentals of ISSEs, including their ionic conductivity, mechanical property, chemical and electrochemical stabilities. It then presents the crystal structures of advanced ISSEs (e.g., &#946;/&#946;''&#8208;alumina, NASICON, sulfides, complex hydride and halide electrolytes) and the related issues, along with corresponding modification strategies. The review also outlines effective approaches for forming intimate interfaces between ISSEs and working electrodes. Finally, current challenges and critical perspectives for the potential developments and possible directions to improve interfacial contacts for future practical applications of ISSEs are highlighted. This comprehensive review aims to advance the understanding and development of next&#8208;generation rechargeable IASSSBs.

         <title>Leveraging Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles for Combination Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have been widely used in tumor treatment. Through modification, SPNs can encapsulate or conjugate with various types of immune modulators. This review summarizes the recent progress of SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy and highlights the synergetic effect that amplifies the anti&#8208;tumor immune response.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has become a promising method for cancer treatment, bringing hope to advanced cancer patients. However, immune&#8208;related adverse events caused by immunotherapy also bring heavy burden to patients. Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as an emerging nanomaterial with high biocompatibility, can eliminate tumors and induce tumor immunogenic cell death through different therapeutic modalities, including photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and sonodynamic therapy. In addition, SPNs can work as a functional nanocarrier to synergize with a variety of immunomodulators to amplify anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. In this review, SPNs&#8208;based combination cancer immunotherapy is comprehensively summarized according to the SPNs&#8217; therapeutic modalities and the type of loaded immunomodulators. The in&#8208;depth understanding of existing SPNs&#8208;based therapeutic modalities will hopefully inspire the design of more novel nanomaterials with potent anti&#8208;tumor immune effects, and ultimately promote their clinical translation.

         <title>Wearable and Implantable Cortisol&#8208;Sensing Electronics for Stress Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable and implantable device can be placed on the body to continuously monitor the status of the subject. Cortisol, a hormone released in response to stress, varies in concentration among individuals and its fluctuations are not consistent. In this review, recent research that utilizes continuous measurements to analyze the dynamic stress response is examined.








Abstract
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that is released from the body in response to stress. Although a moderate level of cortisol secretion can help the body maintain homeostasis, excessive secretion can cause various diseases, such as depression and anxiety. Conventional methods for cortisol measurement undergo procedures that limit continuous monitoring, typically collecting samples of bodily fluids, followed by separate analysis in a laboratory setting that takes several hours. Thus, recent studies demonstrate wearable, miniaturized sensors integrated with electronic modules that enable wireless real&#8208;time analysis. Here, the primary focus is on wearable and implantable electronic devices that continuously measure cortisol concentration. Diverse types of cortisol&#8208;sensing techniques, such as antibody&#8208;, DNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;, and molecularly imprinted polymer&#8208;based sensors, as well as wearable and implantable devices that aim to continuously monitor cortisol in a minimally invasive fashion are discussed. In addition to the cortisol monitors that directly measure stress levels, other schemes that indirectly measure stress, such as electrophysiological signals and sweat are also summarized. Finally, the challenges and future directions in stress monitoring and management electronics are reviewed.

         <title>Material Breakthroughs in Smart Food Monitoring: Intelligent Packaging and On&#8208;Site Testing Technologies for Spoilage and Contamination Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper comprehensively reviews material breakthroughs in in situ and on&#8208;site food monitoring. Base material substrates are discussed, both with regards to their intrinsic material properties and their contributions within recently reported sensing platforms. Biogenic amine, pH, and pathogen monitoring are all examined. Finally, a situational assessment and anticipated future directions are outlined.








Abstract
Despite extensive commercial and regulatory interventions, food spoilage and contamination continue to impose massive ramifications on human health and the global economy. Recognizing that such issues will be significantly eliminated by the accurate and timely monitoring of food quality markers, smart food sensors have garnered significant interest as platforms for both real&#8208;time, in&#8208;package food monitoring and on&#8208;site commercial testing. In both cases, the sensitivity, stability, and efficiency of the developed sensors are largely informed by underlying material design, driving focus toward the creation of advanced materials optimized for such applications. Herein, a comprehensive review of emerging intelligent materials and sensors developed in this space is provided, through the lens of three key food quality markers &#8211; biogenic amines, pH, and pathogenic microbes. Each sensing platform is presented with targeted consideration toward the contributions of the underlying metallic or polymeric substrate to the sensing mechanism and detection performance. Further, the real&#8208;world applicability of presented works is considered with respect to their capabilities, regulatory adherence, and commercial potential. Finally, a situational assessment of the current state of intelligent food monitoring technologies is provided, discussing material&#8208;centric strategies to address their existing limitations, regulatory concerns, and commercial considerations.

         <title>Review of Carbon Support Coordination Environments for Single Metal Atom Electrocatalysts (SACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon support single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are widely investigated in numerous electrocatalytic systems due to their high selectivity and activity from size effects and unique metal&#8208;support interactions. This review summarizes the recent progress on carbon&#8208;supported SACs in key electrocatalytic systems from the perspective of their coordination environment regulations that greatly affect the electrocatalytic activity and electrocatalytic selectivity.








Abstract
This topical review focuses on the distinct role of carbon support coordination environment of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) for electrocatalysis. The article begins with an overview of atomic coordination configurations in SACs, including a discussion of the advanced characterization techniques and simulation used for understanding the active sites. A summary of key electrocatalysis applications is then provided. These processes are oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The review then shifts to modulation of the metal atom&#8208;carbon coordination environments, focusing on nitrogen and other non&#8208;metal coordination through modulation at the first coordination shell and modulation in the second and higher coordination shells. Representative case studies are provided, starting with the classic four&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (M&#63743;N4) based SACs. Bimetallic coordination models including homo&#8208;paired and hetero&#8208;paired active sites are also discussed, being categorized as emerging approaches. The theme of the discussions is the correlation between synthesis methods for selective doping, the carbon structure&#8211;electron configuration changes associated with the doping, the analytical techniques used to ascertain these changes, and the resultant electrocatalysis performance. Critical unanswered questions as well as promising underexplored research directions are identified.

         <title>J&#8208;Aggregation Strategy toward Potentiated NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Bioimaging of Molecular Fluorophores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review emphatically concentrates on the detailed summary of strategic design and comprehensive overview of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) J&#8208;aggregated scaffolds for perfecting and extending the NIR&#8208;II imaging window. By overviewing the nowadays research advances, this review paves the way for constructing bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregated emitters to promote bioimaging applications.








Abstract
Molecular fluorophores emitting in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) window with strong optical harvesting and high quantum yields hold great potential for in vivo deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging and high&#8208;resolution biosensing. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are harnessed to engineer long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters and show unique superiority in tumor detection, vessel mapping, surgical navigation, and phototheranostics due to their bathochromic&#8208;shifted optical bands in the required slip&#8208;stacked arrangement aggregation state. However, despite the preliminary progress of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates and theoretical study of structure&#8208;property relationships, further paradigms of NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates remain scarce due to the lack of study on aggregated fluorophores with slip&#8208;stacked fashion. In this effort, how to utilize the specific molecular structure to form slip&#8208;stacked packing motifs with J&#8208;type aggregated exciton coupling is emphatically elucidated. First, several molecular regulating strategies to achieve NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates containing intermolecular interactions and external conditions are positively summarized and deeply analyzed. Then, the recent reports on J&#8208;aggregates for NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and theranostics are systematically summarized to provide a clear reference and direction for promoting the development of NIR&#8208;II organic fluorophores. Eventually, the prospective efforts on ameliorating and promoting NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates to further clinical practices are outlined.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Framework Membranes for Liquid&#8208;Phase Molecular Separations: State of the Field, Common Pitfalls, and Future Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 1, January 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D covalent organic framework (COF) membranes are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation molecular sieves due to their uniform, tunable pores, but inconsistent characterization practices are currently leading this subfield astray. This review identifies common characterization pitfalls in existing 2D COF membrane literature and establishes rigorous protocols for assigning membrane structures and molecular transport mechanisms to direct the field toward achieving its long&#8208;term promise.








Abstract
2D covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) are attractive candidates for next&#8208;generation membranes due to their robust linkages and uniform, tunable pores. Many publications have claimed to achieve selective molecular transport through COF pores, but reported performance metrics for similar networks vary dramatically, and in several cases the reported experiments are inadequate to support such conclusions. These issues require a reevaluation of the literature. Published examples of 2D COF membranes for liquid&#8208;phase separations can be broadly divided into two categories, each with common performance characteristics: polycrystalline COF films (most &gt;1&#160;&#181;m thick) and weakly crystalline or amorphous films (most &lt;500&#160;nm thick). Neither category has demonstrated consistent relationships between the designed COF pore structure and separation performance, suggesting that these imperfect materials do not sieve molecules through uniform pores. In this perspective, rigorous practices for evaluating COF membrane structures and separation performance are described, which will facilitate their development toward molecularly precise membranes capable of performing previously unrealized chemical separations. In the absence of this more rigorous standard of proof, reports of COF&#8208;based membranes should be treated with skepticism. As methods to control 2D polymerization improve, precise 2D polymer membranes may exhibit exquisite and energy efficient performance relevant for contemporary separation challenges.
