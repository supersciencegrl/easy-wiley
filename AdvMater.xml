         <title>Alternate Storage of Opposite Charges in Multisite for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Al&#8210;MOF Battery</title>

Abstract
The limited active sites of cathode materials in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) restrict the storage of more large&#8208;sized Al&#8208;complex ions, leading to a low celling of theoretical capacity. To make the utmost of active sites, we herein propose an alternate storage mechanism of opposite charges (AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations) in multisites to achieve an ultrahigh capacity in Al&#8210;MOF battery. The bipolar ligands (oxidized from 18&#960; to 16&#960; electrons and reduced from 18&#960; to 20&#960; electrons in a planar cyclic conjugated system) can alternately uptake and release AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations in charge/discharge processes, which can double the capacity of unipolar ligands. Moreover, the high&#8208;density active Cu sites (Cu nodes) in 2D Cu&#8208;based MOF could also store AlCl2+ cations for a higher capacity. The rigid and extended MOF structure can address the problems of high solubility and poor stability of small organic molecules. As a result, three&#8208;step redox reactions with two&#8208;electron transfer in each step are demonstrated in charge/discharge processes, achieving high reversible capacity (184 mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (177&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) of the optimized cathode in Al&#8210;MOF battery. Our findings provide a new insight for rational design of stable high&#8208;energy Al&#8211;MOF batteries.

         <title>Plasmonic Active &#8220;Hot Spots&#8221;&#8208;Confined Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction with High Selectivity for CH4 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Plasmonic nanostructures have tremendous potential to be applied in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, since their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) can collect low&#8208;energy&#8208;photons to derive energetic &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; for reducing the CO2 activation&#8208;barrier. However, the hot electron&#8208;driven CO2 reduction is usually limited by poor efficiency and low selectivity for producing kinetically unfavourable hydrocarbons. Here, we propose a new idea of plasmonic active &#8220;hot spot&#8221;&#8208;confined photocatalysis to overcome this drawback. We assemble W18O49 nanowires on the outer surface of Au nanoparticles&#8208;embedded TiO2 electrospun nanofibers to obtain lots of Au/TiO2/W18O49 sandwich&#8208;like sub&#8208;structures in the formed plasmonic heterostructure. The short distance (&lt; 10&#160;nm) between Au and adjacent W18O49 can induce an intense plasmon&#8208;coupling to form the active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; in the sub&#8208;structures. These active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; are capable of not only gathering the incident light to enhance &#8220;hot electrons&#8221; generation and migration, but also capturing protons and CO through the dual&#8208;hetero&#8208;active&#8208;sites (Au&#8208;O&#8208;Ti and W&#8208;O&#8208;Ti) at the Au/TiO2/W18O49 interface, as evidenced by systematic experiments and simulation analyses. Thus, during photocatalytic CO2 reduction at 43&#177; 2&#8451;,&#160;these active &#8220;hot spots&#8221; enriched in the well&#8208;designed Au/TiO2/W18O49 plasmonic heterostructure could synergistically confine the hot&#8208;electron, proton, and CO intermediates for resulting in the CH4 and CO production&#8208;rates at &#8764;35.55 and &#8764;2.57&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, and the CH4&#8208;product selectivity at &#8764;93.3%.

         <title>Interpretation of Rubidium&#8208;based Perovskite Recipes towards Electronic Passivation and Ion Diffusion Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Rubidium cation (Rb+) addition has been witnessed to play a pivotal role in boosting the comprehensive performance of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. However, the origin of such success derived from irreplaceable superiorities brought by Rb+ remains ambiguous. Herein, grain boundary&#8208;included atomic models, for the first time, have been adopted for the accurate theoretical analysis of practical Rb+ distribution in perovskite structures. The spatial distribution covering both grain interiors and boundaries has been thoroughly identified by virtue of synchrotron&#8208;based grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction. On this basis, the prominent elevation of the halogen vacancy formation energy, improved charge carrier dynamics, and the electronic passivation mechanism in the grain interior have been expounded. As evidenced by the increased energy barrier and suppressed microcurrent, the critical role of Rb+ addition in blocking the diffusion pathway along grain boundaries, inhibiting halide phase segregation, and eventually enhancing intrinsic stability has been elucidated. Hence, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in Rb+ concentration on electronic defect, ion migration and phase stability are completely investigated in detail, shedding a new light on the advancement of high&#8208;efficiency cascade incorporating strategies and perovskite compositional engineering.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Artificial Hybrid Nanocells for Boosted Vascular Regeneration in Ischemic Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Restoration of sufficient blood supply for the treatment of ischemia remains a significant scientific and clinical challenge. Here, we introduce a cell&#8208;like nanoparticle delivery technology that is capable of recapitulating multiple cell functions for the spatiotemporal triggering of vascular regeneration. Specifically, a copper&#8208;containing protein was successfully prepared using a recombinant protein scaffold based on a de novo design strategy, which facilitated the timely release of nitric oxide (NO) and improved accumulation of particles within ischemic tissues. Through closely mimicking physiological cues, we demonstrated the benefits of bioactive factors secreted from hypoxic stem cells on promoting angiogenesis. Following this cell&#8208;mimicking manner, artificial hybrid nano&#8208;sized cells (Hynocell) were constructed by integrating the hypoxic stem cell secretome into nanoparticles with surface coatings of cell membranes fused with copper&#8208;containing protein. The Hynocell, hybridized with different cell&#8208;derived components, provided synergistic effects on targeting ischemic tissues and promoting vascular regeneration in acute hindlimb ischemia and acute myocardial infarction models. This study offers new insights into the utilization of nanotechnology to potentiate the development of cell&#8208;free therapeutics.

Design and construction of low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability is a challenging task in the field of catalysis. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) are promising candidates as precursor materials in the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications. This review starts with a summary of basic concepts and key evaluation parameters involved in the electrochemical water&#8208;splitting reaction. Then, different synthesis approaches reported for the cobalt&#8208;based Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;67) and its derivatives are critically reviewed. Additionally, several strategies employed to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability of ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail. The present review provides a succinct insight into the ZIF&#8208;67 and its derivatives (oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphide, nitrides, telluride, heteroatom/metal&#8208;doped carbon, noble metal&#8208;supported ZIF&#8208;67 derivatives) reported for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting applications. Finally, this review concludes with the associated challenges and the perspectives on developing the best economic, durable electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Artificial Heterogeneous Interphase Layer with Boosted Ion Affinity and Diffusion for Na/K Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic Na (K) is considered a promising anode material for Na (K) metal batteries because of its high theoretical capacity, low electrode potential, and abundant resources. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na (K) dendrites severely damages the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface, resulting in battery failure. Herein, we introduce a heterogeneous interface layer consisting of metal vanadium nanoparticles and sodium sulfide (potassium sulfide) on the surface of a Na (K) foil (i.e., Na2S/V/Na or K2S/V/K). Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that a heterogeneous Na2S/V (K2S/V) protective layer can effectively improve Na (K)&#8208;ion adsorption and diffusion kinetics, inhibiting the growth of Na (K) dendrites during Na (K) plating/stripping. Based on the novel design of the heterogeneous layer, the symmetric Na2S/V/Na cell displays a long lifespan of over 1000 h in a carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, and the K2S/V/K electrode can operate for over 1300 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm&#8211;2. Moreover, the Na full cell (Na3V2(PO4)3||Na2S/V/Na) exhibits a high energy density of 375&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 and a high power density of 23.5&#160;kW kg&#8211;1. Our achievements support the development of heterogeneous protective layers for other high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

         <title>Unconventional Doping Effect Leads to Ultrahigh Average Thermoelectric Power Factor in Cu3SbSe4&#8208;based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoelectric materials are typically highly degenerate semiconductors, which require high carrier concentration. However, the efficiency of conventional doping by replacing host atoms with alien ones is restricted by solubility limit, and more unfavorably, such doping method is likely to cause strong charge carrier scattering at ambient temperature, leading to deteriorated electrical performance. Here, we propose an unconventional doping strategy by using a small trace of alien atoms to stabilize cation vacancies in Cu3SbSe4 by compositing with CuAlSe2, in which cation vacancies rather than alien atoms provide high density of holes. Consequently, the hole concentration enlarges by 6 times but the carrier mobility is well maintained. As a result, a record&#8208;high average power factor of 19 &#956;W cm&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 in the temperature range of 300&#8764;723 K is attained. Finally, with further reduced lattice thermal conductivity, a peak zT value of 1.4 and a record&#8208;high average zT value of 0.72 are achieved within the diamond&#8208;like compounds. Our new doping strategy not only can be applied for boosting the average power factor for thermoelectrics, but more generally can be used to maintain carrier mobility for a variety of semiconductors that need high carrier concentration.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Dopant Selection for Metal Oxide&#8208;Based Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting: The Case Study of Fe2O3 and CuO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning is applied to guide rational dopant selection in metal oxide photoelectrodes with improved photoelectrochemical water splitting performance. The chemical state is found to be the most significant factor for dopant selection, while dopants with stronger metal&#8211;oxygen bond and larger ionic radius are preferred for charge separation and transfer.








Abstract
Doping is an effective strategy for tuning metal oxide&#8208;based semiconductors for solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Despite decades of extensive research effort, the dopant selection is still largely dependent on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Machine learning (ML) is promising in providing predictable insights on the dopant selection for high&#8208;performing PEC systems because it can uncover correlations from the seemingly ambiguous linkages between vast features of dopants and the PEC performance of doped photoelectrodes. Herein, the authors successfully build ML model to predict the doping effect of 17 metal dopants into hematite (Fe2O3), a prototype photoelectrode material. Their findings disclose the critical parameters from the 10 intrinsic features of each dopant. The model is further experimentally validated by the coherent prediction on Y and La dopants&#8217; behaviors. Further interpretation of the ML model suggests that the chemical state is the most significant selection criteria, meanwhile, dopants with higher metal&#8211;oxygen bond formation enthalpy and larger ionic radius are favored in improving the charge separation and transfer (CST) in the Fe2O3 photoanodes. The generic feature of this ML guided selection criteria has been further extended to CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes showing improved CST by alkaline metal ions doping.

         <title>Organic Single Crystal Actuators and Waveguides that Operate at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Applications in extreme conditions, such as those encountered in space exploration, require lightweight materials that can retain their elasticity in extremely cold environments. However, cryogenic treatment of most soft polymeric and elastomeric materials results in complete loss of their ability for elastic flow, whereby such materials that are normally ductile become stiff, brittle and prone to cracking. Here we report a facile method for preparation of hybrid organic crystalline materials that are not only cryogenically robust, but are also capable of large, recoverable and reversible deformation at low temperatures. To that end, flexible organic crystals were first mechanically reinforced by polymer coating and combined with a thermally responsive polymer. The resulting hybrid materials respond linearly and reversibly to temperatures from &#8722;15&#176;C to &#8722;120&#176;C without fatigue in air as well as in cold vacuum. The approach proposed here not only circumvents one of the main drawbacks that is inherent to the amorphous nature and has thus far limited the applications of polymeric materials at low temperatures, but it also provides a cost&#8208;effective access to a myriad of lightweight sensing, electronic, optical or actuating devices that can operate in low&#8208;temperature environmental settings.

The approach proposed here not only circumvents one of the main drawbacks that is inherent to the amorphous nature and has thus far limited the applications of polymeric materials at low temperatures, but it also provides a cost-effective access to a myriad of lightweight sensing, electronic, optical or actuating devices that can operate in low-temperature environmental settings.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Redox Couple Strategy Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes by Suppressing Oxygen Release</title>

Abstract
Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMROs) are considered the most promising cathode candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The poor cycling stability and fast voltage fading resulting from oxygen release during charging, however, severely hinder their practical application. Herein, a strategy of introducing an additional redox couple is first proposed to eliminate the persistent problem of oxygen release. As a proof of concept, the cycling stability of Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2, which is a typical LMRO cathode, is substantially enhanced with the help of the S2&#8722;/SO32&#8722; redox couple, and the capacity shows no decay with a retention of 100% after 700 cycles at 1C, far superior to the bare counterpart (61.7%). The surface peroxide ions (O22&#8722;) are readily chemically reduced back to immobile O2&#8722; by S2&#8722; during charging, accompanied by the formation of SO32&#8722;, which plays a critical role in stabilizing the oxygen lattice and eventually inhibiting the release of oxygen. More importantly, the S2&#8722; ions are regenerated during the following discharging process and participate in the chemical redox reaction again. Our findings shed light on a potential direction to tackle the poor cycling stability of high&#8208;energy anion&#8208;redox cathode materials for rechargeable metal&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Li- and Mn-rich layered oxides (LMROs) are considered the most promising cathode candidates for next-generation high-energy lithium-ion batteries.

         <title>Heterojunction Annealing Enabling Record Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage in Antimony Triselenide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the fact that antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) thin&#8208;film solar cell has undergone rapid development in recent years, the large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit still remains to be the biggest bottleneck as even the world record device suffers from a large VOC deficit of 0.59&#160;V. Here, an effective interface engineering approach is reported where the Sb2Se3/CdS heterojunction (HTJ) was subjected to a post&#8208;annealing treatment using rapid thermal process. It was found that non&#8208;radiative recombination near the Sb2Se3/CdS HTJ including interface recombination and space charge region recombination were greatly suppressed after the HTJ annealing treatment. Ultimately, a substrate Sb2Se3/CdS thin&#8208;film solar cell with a competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record VOC of 0.52&#160;V has been successfully fabricated. The device exhibits a much mitigated VOC deficit of 0.49&#160;V, which is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cell.

         <title>The Pivotal Role of s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;Block Metals in Water Electrolysis: Status Quo and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Transition metals, in particular noble metals, are the most common species in metal&#8208;mediated water electrolysis because they serve as highly active catalytic sites. In many cases, the presence of non&#8208;transition metals, that is, s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals with high natural abundance in the earth&#8208;crust in the catalytic material is indispensable to boost efficiency and durability in water electrolysis. This is why alkali metals, alkaline&#8208;earth metals, rare&#8208;earth metals, lean metals, and metalloids receive growing interest in this research area. In spite of the pivotal role of these non&#8208;transition metals in tuning efficiency of water electrolysis, there is far more room for developments towards a knowledge&#8208;based catalyst design. In this review, we discuss five classes of non&#8208;transition metals species which were successfully utilized in water electrolysis, with special emphasis on electronic structure&#8208;catalytic activity relationships and phase stability. Moreover, specific fundamental aspects on electrocatalysts for water electrolysis as well as a perspective on this research field have also been addressed in this account. We anticipate that this review can trigger a broader interest in using s&#8208;, p&#8208;, and f&#8208;block metals species towards the discovery of advanced polymetal&#8208;containing electrocatalysts for practical water splitting.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;stretchable and fast self&#8208;healing ionic hydrogel in cryogenic environments for artificial nerve fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;healing materials behave irreplaceable advantages in biomimetic intelligent robots (BIR) for avoiding or reducing safety hazards and economic losses from accidental damage during service. However, the self&#8208;healing ability is unreservedly lost and even becomes rigid, fragile in the cryogenic environment where BIR is precisely needed. Here, we report a versatile ionic hydrogel with fast self&#8208;healing ability, ultra&#8208;stretchability, and stable conductivity, even at &#8208;80&#8451;. The hydrogel is systematically optimized to improve hydrogen&#8208;bonded network nanostructure, coordinated achieving a quick self&#8208;healing ability within 10&#160;min, large deformation tolerance of over 7000%, superior conductivity of 11.76 S&#183;cm&#8211;1 and anti&#8208;freezing ability, which is difficult to obtain simultaneously. Such hydrogel provides new opportunities for artificial electronic devices in harsh environments. As a prospective application, we fabricate an artificial nerve fiber by mimicking the structure and functions of the myelinated axon, exhibiting the property of fast and potential&#8208;gated signal transmission. This artificial nerve fiber is integrated into a robot for demonstrating a real&#8208;time high fidelity and high throughput information interaction under big deformation and cryogenic temperature. The hydrogel and bionic device will bring pioneering functions for robots and open a broad application scenario in extreme conditions.

Abstract
Both tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and hypoxia condition severely restrict the antitumor potency during cancer immunotherapy. It is essential to overcome the two issues for improving therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we built hollow mesoporous Prussian blue (HMPB) nanosystem with mannose decoration and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) adsorption to form Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ. It could facilitate cellular internalization via mannose&#8208;receptor mediated endocytosis and induce TAM polarization via iron ion/HCQ release with HMPB degradation. The hybrid macrophage and thylakoid (TK) membrane was camouflaged on Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ surface, denoted as TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ, to reduce in vivo reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake, enhance tumor accumulation and mitigate hypoxia. The in vivo results indicated that TK&#8208;M@Man&#8208;HMPB/HCQ notably inhibited tumor growth, induced TAM polarization, facilitated cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltration and alleviated hypoxia microenvironment. The rational design may provide a new pathway to modulate TME for promoting cancer immunotherapy effects.

         <title>Electrically Programmable Interfacial Adhesion for Ultrastrong Hydrogel Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Adjustable interfacial adhesion is of great significance in smart hydrogel&#8208;related engineering fields. This study presents an electroadhesion strategy for universal and ultrastrong hydrogel bonding with electrically programmable strength. An ionic hydrogel containing lithium ions is designed to achieve hydrated ion diffusion&#8208;mediated interfacial adhesion, where external electric fields are employed to precisely control spatio&#8208;temporal dynamics of the ion diffusion across ionic adhesion region (IAR). The hydrogel can realize a universal, ultrastrong, efficient, tough, reversible and environmentally tolerant electroadhesion to diverse hydrogels, whose peak adhesion strength and interfacial adhesion toughness are as high as 1.2&#160;MPa and 3750 J m&#8211;2, respectively. With a mechanoelectric coupling model, the dominant role of the hydrated ions in IAR played in the interfacial electroadhesion is further quantitatively revealed. The proposed strategy opens a door for developing high&#8208;performance adhesion hydrogels with electrically programmable functions, which are indispensable for various emerging fields like flexible electronics and soft robotics.

         <title>A Minimalist Binary Vaccine Carrier for Personalized Postoperative Cancer Vaccine Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel class of minimalist vaccine carriers based on azole molecules&#8208;modified branched polyethylenimine is reported, which orchestrates the innate stimulating activity and antigen cross&#8208;presentation processes in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and achieves impressive personalized vaccine therapy results with the thus prepared binary vaccine.








Abstract
In recent years, significant evolutions have been made in applying nanotechnologies for prophylactic and therapeutic cancer vaccine design. However, the clinical translation of nanovaccines is still limited owing to their complicated compositions and difficulties in the spatiotemporal coordination of antigen&#8208;presenting cell activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, a minimalist binary nanovaccine (BiVax) is designed that integrates innate stimulating activity into the carrier to elicit robust antitumor immunity. The authors started by making a series of azole molecules end&#8208;capped polyethylenimine (PEI&#8208;M), and were&#160;surprised to find that over 60% of the PEI&#8208;M polymers have innate stimulating activity via activation of the stimulator of interferon genes pathway. PEI&#8208;4BImi, a PEI&#8208;M obtained from a series of polymers, elicits robust antitumor immune responses when used as a subcutaneously injected nanovaccine by simply mixing with ovalbumin antigens, and this BiVax system performs much better than the traditional ternary vaccine system, as well as, commercialized aluminum&#8208;containing adjuvants. This system also enables the fast preparation of personalized BiVax by compositing PEI&#8208;4BImi with autologous tumor cell membrane protein antigens, and a 60% postoperative cure rate is observed when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance In&#8208;Memory Photodetector Realized by Charge Storage in a van der Waals MISFET</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;memory photodetector is successfully designed based on a WSe2/h&#8208;BN/SiO2 van der Waals heterostructure, which demonstrates not only an ultrahigh photoresponsivity (337.8 A W&#8722;1) but also an extremely long&#8208;term retention (&gt;10 years). Moreover, the working mechanism with charge&#8208;storage effect of the h&#8208;BN/SiO2 structure is proved through a novel in situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy analysis.








Abstract
The emerging data&#8208;intensive applications in optoelectronics are driving innovation toward the fused integration of sensing, memory, and computing to break through the restrictions of the von Neumann architecture. However, the present photodetectors with only optoelectronic conversion functions cannot satisfy the growing demands of the multifunctions required in single devices. Here, a novel route for the integration of non&#8208;volatile memory into a photodetector is proposed, with a WSe2/h&#8208;BN van der Waals heterostructure on a Si/SiO2 substrate to realize in&#8208;memory photodetection. This photodetector exhibits an ultrahigh readout photocurrent of 3.4 &#181;A and photoresponsivity of 337.8 A W&#8722;1 in the solar&#8208;blind wavelength region, together with an extended retention time of more than 10 years. Furthermore, the charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based non&#8208;volatile mechanism of h&#8208;BN/SiO2 is successfully proven through a novel analysis of in situ optoelectronic electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy. These results represent a leap forward to future applications and insightful mechanisms of in&#8208;memory photodetection.

         <title>Synthetic Matrix Scaffolds Engineer the In Vivo Tumor Immune Microenvironment for Immunotherapy Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor growth dynamics and reproducibility of preclinical breast cancer models are improved utilizing a system leveraging synthetic material scaffolds. These scaffolds induce reliable tumor formation and programmable immune infiltration based on composition, enabling enhanced consistency and relevance to human disease. Various immunotherapeutic strategies are tested, revealing differential efficacy based on immune milieu, demonstrating the promise to improve clinical immunotherapy applications.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most powerful anti&#8208;cancer therapies but is stymied by the limits of existing preclinical models with respect to disease latency and reproducibility. Additionally, the influence of differing immune microenvironments within tumors observed clinically and associated with immunotherapeutic resistance cannot be tuned to facilitate drug testing workflows without changing model system or laborious genetic approaches. To address this testing platform gap in the immune oncology drug development pipeline, the authors deploy engineered biomaterials as scaffolds to increase tumor formation rate, decrease disease latency, and diminish variability of immune infiltrates into tumors formed from murine mammary carcinoma cell lines implanted into syngeneic mice. By altering synthetic gel formulations that reshape infiltrating immune cells within the tumor, responsiveness of the same tumor model to varying classes of cancer immunotherapies, including in situ vaccination with a molecular adjuvant and immune checkpoint blockade, diverge. These results demonstrate the significant role the local immune microenvironment plays in immunotherapeutic response. These engineered tumor immune microenvironments therefore improve upon the limitations of current breast tumor models used for immune oncology drug screening to enable immunotherapeutic testing relevant to the variability in tumor immune microenvironments underlying immunotherapeutic resistance seen in human patients.

         <title>A Universal Ternary&#8208;Solvent&#8208;Ink Strategy toward Efficient Inkjet&#8208;Printed Perovskite Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmentally&#8208;friendly ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink system with excellent printability and film&#8208;forming ability is tailor&#8208;made for efficient inkjet&#8208;printed perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). A record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% is achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs for the first time.








Abstract
Toward next&#8208;generation electroluminescent quantum dot (QD) displays, inkjet printing technique has been convinced as one of the most promising low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale manufacturing of patterned quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). The development of high&#8208;quality and stable QD inks is a key step to push this technology toward practical applications. Herein, a universal ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;ink strategy is proposed for the cesium lead halides (CsPbX3) perovskite QDs and their corresponding inkjet&#8208;printed QLEDs. With this tailor&#8208;made ternary halogen&#8208;free solvent (naphthene, n&#8208;tridecane, and n&#8208;nonane) recipe, a highly dispersive and stable CsPbX3 QD ink is obtained, which exhibits much better printability and film&#8208;forming ability than that of the binary solvent (naphthene and n&#8208;tridecane) system, leading to a much better qualitied perovskite QD thin film. Consequently, a record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% and maximum luminance of 43&#160;883.39&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 is achieved in inkjet&#8208;printed green perovskite QLEDs, which is much higher than that of the binary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system&#8208;based devices (EQE = 2.26%). Moreover, the ternary&#8208;solvent&#8208;system exhibits a universal applicability in the inkjet&#8208;printed red and blue perovskite QLEDs as well as cadmium (Cd)&#8208;based QLEDs.

&lt;p&gt;An environmentally-friendly ternary-solvent-ink system with excellent printability and film-forming ability is tailor-made for efficient inkjet-printed perovskite quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). A record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% is achieved in inkjet-printed green perovskite QLEDs for the first time.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toward next-generation electroluminescent quantum dot (QD) displays, inkjet printing technique has been convinced as one of the most promising low-cost and large-scale manufacturing of patterned quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). The development of high-quality and stable QD inks is a key step to push this technology toward practical applications. Herein, a universal ternary-solvent-ink strategy is proposed for the cesium lead halides (CsPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite QDs and their corresponding inkjet-printed QLEDs. With this tailor-made ternary halogen-free solvent (naphthene, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-tridecane, and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-nonane) recipe, a highly dispersive and stable CsPbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; QD ink is obtained, which exhibits much better printability and film-forming ability than that of the binary solvent (naphthene and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-tridecane) system, leading to a much better qualitied perovskite QD thin film. Consequently, a record peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.54% and maximum luminance of 43&#160;883.39&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in inkjet-printed green perovskite QLEDs, which is much higher than that of the binary-solvent-system-based devices (EQE = 2.26%). Moreover, the ternary-solvent-system exhibits a universal applicability in the inkjet-printed red and blue perovskite QLEDs as well as cadmium (Cd)-based QLEDs. This work demonstrates a new strategy for tailor-making a general ternary-solvent-QD-ink system for efficient inkjet-printed QLEDs as well as the other solution-processed electronic devices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Photocatalysis is a green technology to use ubiquitous and intermittent sunlight. The emerging S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has demonstrated its superiority in photocatalysis. This article covers the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress and provides new insights into its general designing criteria. It starts with the challenges confronted by single photocatalyst from the perspective of energy dissipation by borrowing the common behaviors in the dye molecule. Subsequently, other problems faced by single photocatalyst are summarized. Then a viable solution for these problems is the construction of heterojunctions. To overcome the problems and mistakes of type&#8208;II and Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions, S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is proposed and the underlying reaction mechanism is summarized. Afterward, the design principles for S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are proposed and four types of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are suggested. Following this, direct characterization techniques for testifying the charge transfer in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are presented. Finally, different photocatalytic applications of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are summarized. Specifically, this work endeavors to clarify the critical understanding on curved Fermi level in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction interface, which can help strengthen and advance the fundamental theories of photocatalysis. Moreover, the current challenges and prospects of the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst are critically discussed.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Efficient Sequential Drug Delivery of Biomimetic Nanosystem for Multimodal Chemo&#8208;, Antiangiogenic, and Anti&#8208;MDSC Therapy in Melanoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biomimetic DS@HLipo targets the tumor site, where near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeation triggers the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib for both antiangiogenic therapy and anti&#8208;MDSC immunotherapy. The liberated doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) from the liposomes can then be more easily ingested by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy.








Abstract
In view of the multiple pathological hallmarks of tumors, nanosystems for the sequential delivery of various drugs whose targets are separately located inside and outside tumor cells are desired for improved cancer therapy. However, current sequential delivery is mainly achieved through enzyme&#8208; or acid&#8208;dependent degradation of the nanocarrier, which would be influenced by the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, and unloading efficiency of the drug acting on the target outside tumor cells is usually unsatisfactory. Here, a light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy based on a liposomal formulation of doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded small&#8208;sized polymeric nanoparticles (DOX&#8208;NP) and free sunitinib in the aqueous cavity, is developed. The liposomal membrane is doped with photosensitizer porphyrin&#8211;phospholipid (PoP) and hybridized with red blood cell membrane to confer biomimetic features. Near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;induced membrane permeabilization triggers the &#8220;ultrafast&#8221; and &#8220;thorough&#8221; release of sunitinib (100% release in 5&#160;min) for antiangiogenic therapy and also myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cell (MDSC) inhibition to reverse the immunosuppressive tumor environment. Subsequently, the small&#8208;sized DOX&#8208;NP liberated from the liposomes is more easily uptaken by tumor cells for improved immunogenic chemotherapy. RNA sequencing and immune&#8208;related assay indicates therapeutic immune enhancement. This light&#8208;triggered sequential delivery strategy demonstrates the potency in cancer multimodal therapy against multiple targets in different spatial positions in tumor microenvironment.

         <title>2D FeP Nanoframe Superlattices via Space&#8208;Confined Topochemical Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D superlattices comprising monolayer FeP nanoframes are designed and synthesized through a space&#8208;confined topochemical transformation approach, using carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices as a precursor. The resulting 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices possess a number of unique features unavailable in conventional nanocrystal superlattices, which make them particularly promising as highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled nanocrystal superlattices represent an emergent class of designer materials with potentially programmable functionalities. The ability to construct hierarchically structured nanocrystal superlattices with tailored geometry and porosity is critical for extending their applications. Here, 2D superlattices comprising monolayer FeP nanoframes are synthesized through a space&#8208;confined topochemical transformation approach induced by the Kirkendall effect, using carbon&#8208;coated Fe3O4 nanocube superlattices as a precursor. The particle shape and the close&#8208;packed nature of Fe3O4 nanocubes as well as the interconnected carbon layer network contribute to the topochemical transformation process. The resulting 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices possess several unique and advantageous structural features that are unavailable in conventional 3D nanocrystal superlattices, which make them particularly attractive for catalytic applications. As a proof of concept, such 2D FeP nanoframe superlattices are harnessed as highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, the performance of which is superior to that of most FeP&#8208;based catalysts reported previously. This topochemical transformation approach is scalable and general, representing a new route of designing hierarchical superlattices with highly open features that cannot be accessible by traditional self&#8208;assembly methods.

         <title>High Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution via Strong Built&#8208;In Electric Field Induced by High Crystallinity of Perylene Imide Supramolecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline perylene imide supramolecular photocatalyst (PDI&#8208;NH) is successfully constructed via &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction and hydrogen bonding. The PDI&#8208;NH performs a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), exceeding most of photocatalysts. The high crystallinity of PDI&#8208;NH ensures the built&#8208;in electric field, acting as a kinetic force to promote the charge separation.








Abstract
A highly crystalline perylene imide supramolecular photocatalyst (PDI&#8208;NH) is synthesized via imidazole solvent method. The catalyst shows a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) with apparent quantum yield of 10.4% at 400&#160;nm, which is 1353 times higher than the low crystalline PDI&#8208;NH. The highly crystalline structure comes from the ordered self&#8208;assembly process in molten imidazole solvent via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding. Further, the excellent performance ascribes to the robust built&#8208;in electric field induced by its high crystallinity, which greatly accelerates the charge separation and transfer. What is more, the PDI&#8208;NH is quite stable and can be reused over 50 h without performance attenuation. Briefly, the crystalline PDI&#8208;NH with strong built&#8208;in electric field throws light on photocatalytic oxygen evolution, showing a new perspective for the design of organic photocatalysts.

The PDI-NH performs a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), exceeding most of photocatalysts. The high crystallinity of PDI-NH ensures the built-in electric field, acting as a kinetic force to promote the charge separation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly crystalline perylene imide supramolecular photocatalyst (PDI-NH) is synthesized via imidazole solvent method. The catalyst shows a breakthrough oxygen evolution rate (40.6 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) with apparent quantum yield of 10.4% at 400&#160;nm, which is 1353 times higher than the low crystalline PDI-NH. The highly crystalline structure comes from the ordered self-assembly process in molten imidazole solvent via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrogen bonding. Further, the excellent performance ascribes to the robust built-in electric field induced by its high crystallinity, which greatly accelerates the charge separation and transfer. What is more, the PDI-NH is quite stable and can be reused over 50 h without performance attenuation. Briefly, the crystalline PDI-NH with strong built-in electric field throws light on photocatalytic oxygen evolution, showing a new perspective for the design of organic photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fabrication of Stretchable Superamphiphobic Surfaces with Deformation&#8208;Induced Rearrangeable Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable and durable superamphiphobic surface is fabricated by a simple and low&#8208;cost spray&#8208;coating method. Low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids can easily slide off the surface, even when the tensile strain of the surface is &#8805;225%.








Abstract
Stretchable superamphiphobic surfaces with a high deformation resistance are in demand to achieve liquid&#8208;repellent performance in flexible electronics, artificial skin, and textile dressings. However, it is challenging to make mechanically robust superamphiphobic coatings, which maintain their superliquid repellency in a highly stretched state. Here, a stretchable superamphiphobic surface is reported, on which the microstructures can rearrange during stretching to maintain a stable superamphiphobicity even under a high tensile strain. The surface is prepared by spray&#8208;coating silicone nanofilaments onto a prestretched substrate (e.g., cis&#8208;1,4&#8208;polyisoprene) with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) layer as a binder. After subsequent fluorination, this surface keeps its superamphiphobicity to both water and n&#8208;hexadecane up to the tensile strain of at least 225%. The binding PDMS layer and rearrangeable structures maximize the deformation resistance of the surface during the stretching process. The superamphiphobicity and morphology of the surface are maintained even after 1000 stretch&#8211;release cycles. Taking advantage of the mentioned benefits, a liquid manipulation system is designed, which has the potential for fabricating reusable and low&#8208;cost platforms for biochemical detection and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.

         <title>Engineering Radiosensitizer&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Phenolic Networks Potentiate STING Pathway Activation for Advanced Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiotherapy suffers from high&#8208;dose radiation&#8208;induced systemic toxicity and radioresistance caused by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To overcome these limitations, a novel lanthanide&#8208;doped radiosensitizer&#8208;based metal&#8208;phenolic network is engineered to achieve a synergy of radiosensitization and stimulator of interferon genes pathway activation. This tactic promotes dendritic cell maturation and evokes potent systemic antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy, a mainstay of first&#8208;line cancer treatment, suffers from its high&#8208;dose radiation&#8208;induced systemic toxicity and radioresistance caused by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The synergy between radiosensitization and immunomodulation may overcome these obstacles for advanced radiotherapy. Here, the authors propose a radiosensitization cooperated with stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway activation strategy by fabricating a novel lanthanide&#8208;doped radiosensitizer&#8208;based metal&#8208;phenolic network, NaGdF4:Nd@NaLuF4@PEG&#8208;polyphenol/Mn (DSPM). The amphiphilic PEG&#8208;polyphenol successfully coordinates with NaGdF4:Nd@NaLuF4 (radiosensitizer) and Mn2+ via robust metal&#8208;phenolic coordination. After cell internalization, the pH&#8208;responsive disassembly of DSPM triggers the release of their payloads, wherein radiosensitizer sensitizes cancer cells to X&#8208;ray and Mn2+ promote STING pathway activation. This radiosensitizer&#8208;based DSPM remarkably benefits dendritic cell maturation, anticancer therapeutics in primary tumors, accompanied by robust systemic immune therapeutic performance against metastatic tumors. Therefore, a powerful radiosensitization with STING pathway activation mediated immunostimulation strategy is highlighted here to optimize cancer radiotherapy.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy&#8208;Mediated Growth of Amorphous Discharge Products toward an Ultrawide Band Light&#8208;Assisted Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated fast kinetics for an ultrawide band photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 system is developed. The bifunctional Ag/Bi2MoO6 cathode is favorable to promoting the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction kinetics due to the discharge products is amorphous Li2O2. The reaction mechanism is revealed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. 








Abstract
Photoassisted electrochemical reaction is regarded as an effective approach to reduce the overpotential of lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries. However, the achievement of both broadband absorption and long term battery cycling stability are still a formidable challenge. Herein, an oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated fast kinetics for a photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 system is developed with a silver/bismuth molybdate (Ag/Bi2MoO6) hybrid cathode. The cathode can offer both double advantages for light absorption covering UV to visible region and excellent electrochemical activity for O2. Upon discharging, the photoexcited electrons from Ag nanoplate based on the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are injected into the oxygen vacancy in Bi2MoO6. The fast oxygen reaction kinetics generate the amorphous Li2O2, and the discharge plateau is improved to 3.05&#160;V. Upon charging, the photoexcited holes are capable to decompose amorphous Li2O2 promptly, yielding a very low charge plateau of 3.25&#160;V. A first cycle round&#8208;trip efficiency is 93.8% and retention of 70% over 500 h, which is the longest cycle life ever reported in photoassisted Li&#8211;O2 batteries. This work offers a general and reliable strategy for boosting the electrochemical kinetics by tailoring the crystalline of Li2O2 with wide&#8208;band light.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Solar Cells for Building Integrated Photovoltaics: Transforming Building Fa&#231;ades into Power Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To increase solar production in city centers, one either needs to increase the power generation per unit area or increase the harvesting area by utilizing the building fa&#231;ade for solar electricity generation. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) appear to be an ideal solution for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which transforms windows or fa&#231;ades into electric power generators.








Abstract
The rapid emergence of organic&#8211;inorganic lead halide perovskites for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics promises to impact new photovoltaic concepts. Their high power conversion efficiencies, ability to coat perovskite layers on glass via various scalable deposition techniques, excellent optoelectronic properties, and synthetic versatility for modulating transparency and color allow perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to be an ideal solution for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which transforms windows or fa&#231;ades into electric power generators. In this review, the unique features and properties of PSCs for BIPV application are accessed. Device engineering and optical management strategies of active layers, interlayers, and electrodes for semitransparent, bifacial, and colorful PSCs are also discussed. The performance of PSCs under conditions that are relevant for BIPV such as different operational temperature, light intensity, and light incident angle are also reviewed. Recent outdoor stability testing of PSCs in different countries and other demonstration of scalability and deployment of PSCs are also spotlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future opportunities for realizing perovskite&#8208;based BIPV are discussed.

         <dc:description>
A nontoxic, visible&#8208;blind quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based downconverting thin&#8208;film technology that offers a ninefold enhancement in the UV sensitivity of a silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor sensor without deteriorating its performance in the visible and near&#8208;infrared is reported. Additionally, a tandem stack of such QDs is reported, which enables UV&#8208;band discrimination in a cost effective and facile manner.








Abstract
Selective spectral detection of ultraviolet (UV) radiation is highly important across numerous fields from health and safety to industrial and environmental monitoring applications. Herein, a nontoxic, visible&#8208;blind, quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based sensing scheme that expands the spectral coverage of silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) sensors into the UV, enabling efficient UV detection without affecting the sensor performance in the visible and UV&#8208;band discrimination, is reported. This scheme uses zinc magnesium oxide (ZnMgO) QDs with compositionally tunable absorption across UV and high photoluminescence quantum yield in the visible. The efficient luminescence and large Stokes shift of these QDs are exploited herein to act as an efficient downconverting material that enhances the UV sensitivity of Si&#8208;photodetectors (Si&#8208;PDs). A Si&#8208;PD integrated with the QDs results in a ninefold improvement in photoresponsivity from 0.83 to 7.5&#160;mA W&#8722;1 at 260&#160;nm. Leveraging the tunability of these QDs, a simple UV&#8208;band identification scheme is further reported, which uses two distinct&#8208;bandgap ZnMgO QDs stacked in a tandem architecture whose spectral emission color depends on the UV&#8208;band excitation light. The downconverting stack enables facile discrimination of UV light using a standard CMOS image sensor (camera) or by the naked eye and avoids the use of complex optics.

         <title>PEG&#8208;Like Brush Polymer Conjugate of RNA Aptamer That Shows Reversible Anticoagulant Activity and Minimal Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a path is offered to rescuing RNA therapeutics from the deleterious immune side effects of PEG that induces life&#8208;threatening hypersensitivity reactions upon reactivity toward PEG antibodies using a next&#8208;generation PEG&#8208;like stealth polymer conjugate technology. These results breathe new life into an established and valuable drug delivery technology facing an impasse.








Abstract
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) therapeutics are an emerging class of drugs. RNA aptamers are of significant therapeutic and clinical interest because their activity can be easily reversed in vivo&#8212;a useful feature that is difficult to achieve using other therapeutic modalities. Despite their therapeutic promise, RNA aptamers are limited by their poor blood circulation. The attachment of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to RNA aptamers addresses this limitation. However, an RNA aptamer&#8208;PEG conjugate that is a reversible anticoagulant fails in a clinical trial due to the reactivity of the conjugate with pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies and has cast a pall over PEGylation of aptamers and other biologics, despite its long history of utility in drug delivery. Here, PEG antibody&#8208;reactivity of this RNA aptamer is eliminated by conjugating it to a next&#8208;generation PEG&#8208;like brush polymer&#8212;poly[(oligoethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate)] (POEGMA). The conjugate retained the drug's therapeutic action and the ability to be easily reversed. Importantly, this conjugate does not bind pre&#8208;existing PEG antibodies that are prevalent in humans and does not induce a humoral immune response against the polymer itself in mice. These findings suggest a path to rescuing the PEGylation of RNA therapeutics and vaccines from the deleterious side&#8208;effects of PEG.

         <title>Design Rules of a Sulfur Redox Electrocatalyst for Lithium&#8208;sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Seeking an electrochemical catalyst to accelerate the liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides to insoluble products is crucial to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries and thus increase their practical energy density. We have used Mn&#8208;based mullite (SmMn2O5) as a model catalyst for the sulfur redox reaction to show how the design rules involving lattice matching and 3d&#8208;orbital selection improve catalyst performance. Theoretical simulation shows that the positions of Mn and O active sites on the (001) surface, are a good match with those of Li and S atoms in polysulfides, resulting in their tight anchoring to each other. Fundamentally, dz2 and dx2&#8208;y2 around the Fermi level are found to be crucial for strongly coupling with the p&#8208;orbitals of the polysulfides and thus decreasing the redox overpotential. Following the theoretical calculation, SmMn2O5 catalyst has been synthesized and used as an interlayer in a Li&#8208;S battery. The resulted battery has a high cycling stability over 1500 cycles at 0.5 C and more promisingly a high areal capacity of 7.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 is achieved with a sulfur loading of &#8764;5.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 under a low electrolyte/sulfur (E/S) value &#8764;4.6&#160;&#956;L mg&#8211;1 condition.

&lt;p&gt;Seeking an electrochemical catalyst to accelerate the liquid-to-solid conversion of soluble lithium polysulfides to insoluble products is crucial to inhibit the shuttle effect in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries and thus increase their practical energy density.

         <title>2D FeOCl: A Highly In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Antiferromagnetic Semiconductor Synthesized via Temperature&#8208;Oscillation Chemical Vapor Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) transition&#8208;metal oxyhalides with low symmetry, novel magnetism, and good stability provide a versatile platform for conducting fundamental research and developing spintronics. Antiferromagnetic FeOCl has attracted significant interest owing to its unique semiconductor properties and relatively high N&#233;el temperature. Herein, good&#8208;quality centimeter&#8208;scale FeOCl single crystals are controllably synthesized using the universal temperature&#8208;oscillation chemical vapor transport (TO&#8208;CVT) method. The crystal structure, bandgap, and anisotropic behavior of the 2D FeOCl are explored in detail. The absorption spectrum and electrical measurements reveal that 2D FeOCl is a semiconductor with an optical bandgap of &#8764;2.1&#160;eV and a resistivity of &#8764;10&#8211;1 &#937;&#183;m at 295 K, and the bandgap increases with decreasing thickness. Strong in&#8208;plane optical and electrical anisotropies are observed in 2D FeOCl flakes, and the maximum resistance anisotropic ratio reaches 2.66 at 295 K. Additionally, the lattice vibration modes are studied through temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectra and first&#8208;principles density functional calculations. A significant decrease in the Raman frequencies below the N&#233;el temperature is observed, which results from the strong spin&#8208;phonon coupling effect in 2D FeOCl. This study provides a high&#8208;quality low&#8208;symmetry vdW magnetic candidate for miniaturized spintronics.

         <title>Bioinspired Five&#8208;Coordinated Single&#8208;Atom Iron Nanozyme for Tumor Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) represent a new research frontier in the biomedical fields. The rational design and controllable synthesis of SAzymes with well&#8208;defined electronic and geometric structures are essential for maximizing their enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity and therapeutic efficacy but remain challenging. Here we first report a melamine&#8208;mediated pyrolysis activation strategy for the controllable fabrication of iron&#8208;based SAzyme containing five&#8208;coordinated structure (FeN5), identified by transmission electron microscopy imaging and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses. The FeN5 SAzyme exhibits superior peroxidase&#8208;like activity owing to the optimized coordination structure, and the corresponding catalytic efficiency of Fe&#8208;species in FeN5 SAzyme is 7.64 and 3.45 &#215; 105 times higher than those in traditional FeN4 SAzyme and Fe3O4 nanozyme, respectively, demonstrated by steady&#8208;state kinetic assay. In addition, the catalytic mechanism is jointly disclosed by experimental results and density functional theory studies. The as&#8208;synthesized FeN5 SAzyme demonstrates significantly enhanced antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo due to the excellent peroxidase&#8208;like activity under tumor microenvironment.

The as-synthesized FeN&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; SAzyme demonstrates significantly enhanced antitumor effect in vitro and in vivo due to the excellent peroxidase-like activity under tumor microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Z Sensitized Radiotherapy Synergizes with the Intervention of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway for In Situ Tumor Vaccination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In situ tumor vaccination has been preliminarily pursued to strengthen anti&#8208;tumor immune response. Immunogenic tumor cell death would spontaneously release abundant antigens and adjuvants for activation of dendritic cells (DCs), providing a paragon opportunity for establishing efficient in situ vaccination. Herein, we construct Phy@PLGdH nanosheets by integrating Physcion (Phy, an inhibitor of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)) with layered gadolinium hydroxide nanosheets (PLGdH nanosheets) to boost Radiation Therapy (RT)&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) for potent in situ tumor vaccination. We first observe that sheet&#8208;like PLGdH could present superior X&#8208;ray deposition and tumor penetrability, exhibiting improved Radio&#8208;sensitization in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the destruction of cellular NADPH and nucleotide homeostasis by Phy&#8208;mediated PPP intervention could further amplify PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT&#8208;mediated oxidative stress and DNA damage, which correspondingly result in effective ICD and enhance the immunogenicity of irradiated tumor cells. Consequently, Phy@PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT successfully primes robust CD8+ T cell dependent antitumor immunity to potentiate checkpoint blockade immunotherapies against primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>A MOF&#8208;Derivative Decorated Hierarchical Porous Host Enabling Ultrahigh Rates and Superior Long&#8208;Term Cycling of Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries have attracted much attention due to their high intrinsic capacity, high safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, uncontrollable dendrite growth and adverse side reactions of Zn anodes seriously hinder their further application. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous graphene&#8208;carbon nanotubes scaffold decorated with metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) derived ZnO/C nanoparticles (3D&#8208;ZGC) is fabricated as the host for dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal composite anodes. The zincophilic ZnO/C nanoparticles act as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to induce homogeneous Zn deposition. The mechanically robust 3D scaffold with high conductivity not only suppresses the formation of dendritic Zn by reducing the local current density and homogenizing Zn2+ ion flux, but also inhibits volume changes during the long&#8208;term plating/stripping process. As a result, the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anodes afford unprecedented Zn plating&#8208;stripping stability at an ultra&#8208;high current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 for 1500 cycles with low overpotential (&lt;65&#160;mV) when used in a symmetric cell. When coupled with MnO2 cathodes, the assembled Zn@3D&#8208;ZGC//MnO2 full batteries deliver an enhanced cycling stability for up to 6000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&#8211;1, demonstrating the potential of the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anode for advanced Zn metal batteries.

         <title>Synergistic Disruption of Metabolic Homeostasis through Hyperbranched Poly(ethylene glycol) Conjugates as Nanotherapeutics to Constrain Cancer Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanotherapeutic is presented for combination therapy through controllable co&#8208;delivery of doxorubicin and pyropheophorbide&#8208;a using nanoparticles (HP&#8208;PD NPs) co&#8208;assembled from two hyperbranched polymer&#8208;based conjugates (HP&#8208;P and HP&#8208;D). The demonstrated tumor suppression effect can result from the reduced protein translation due to disruption of metabolic homeostasis as evidenced by metabolic variations.








Abstract
Combination therapy is a promising approach for effective treatment of tumors through synergistically regulating pathways. However, the synergistic effect is limited, likely by uncontrolled co&#8208;delivery of different therapeutic payloads in a single nanoparticle. Herein, a combination nanotherapeutic is developed by using two amphiphilic conjugates, hyperbranched poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;pyropheophorbide&#8208;a (Ppa) (HP&#8208;P) and hyperbranched poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;doxorubicin (DOX) (HP&#8208;D) to construct co&#8208;assembly nanoparticles (HP&#8208;PD NPs) for controllably co&#8208;loading and co&#8208;delivering Ppa and DOX. In vitro and in vivo antitumor studies confirm the synergistic effect of photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy from HP&#8208;PD NPs. Metabolic variations reveal that tumor suppression is associated with disruption of metabolic homeostasis, leading to reduced protein translation. This study uncovers the manipulation of metabolic changes in tumor cells through disruption of cellular homeostasis using HP&#8208;PD NPs and provides a new insight into the rational design of synergistic nanotherapeutics for combination therapy.

         <title>Modulating Tumor Extracellular Matrix by Simultaneous Inhibition of Two Cancer Cell Receptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously blockade of epidermal growth factor receptor and integrin pathways with recombinant protein&#8208;drug conjugates treatment improves the tumor accumulation and cellular internalization of drug through regulating the F&#8208;actin content in cancer cells and extracellular matrix in the tumor environments as well as the physical environment of tumors, leading to an improved tumor therapy compared to free drug.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) is involved in fundamental cellular processes and pathological progression of many diseases. While most research and current knowledge focuses on the processes of biological and mechanical changes in ECM signaling residing cancer cells to respond, little is known of the converse&#8211;of how cancer cells initiate the changes of ECM properties. Here, it is reported that blocking the cancer cell signaling leads to disruption of tumor ECM. Using recombinant proteins (RPs) and recombinant protein&#8208;drug conjugates (RPDCs) that simultaneously target both epidermal growth factor receptor and integrin, it is demonstrated that multireceptor&#8208;mediated active modulation of tumor ECM can inhibit and even reverse tumor remodeling of the physiological and structural microenvironment. These results not only provide insights into the regulatory roles of cancer cells in developing a protumoral microenvironment, but also introduce a new therapeutic platform or strategy to treat cancers.

         <title>A Stiffness&#8208;Switchable, Biomimetic Smart Material Enabled by Supramolecular Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stiffness&#8208;changing biomimetic smart material is developed through a unique water&#8211;ethanol solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;induced supramolecular reconfiguration strategy. The dynamic switchable supramolecular network imparts the material with an interesting self&#8208;regulation behavior in mechanical properties between soft and hard states, self&#8208;healing capability, and excellent formability, which holds great application potential in smart buildings, personal protection devices, soft robots, intelligent devices, and beyond.








Abstract
In nature, stiffness&#8208;changing behavior is essential for living organisms, which, however, is challenging to achieve in synthetic materials. Here, a stiffness&#8208;changing smart material, through developing interchangeable supramolecular configurations inspired from the dermis of the sea cucumber, which shows extreme, switchable mechanical properties, is reported. In the hydrated state, the material, possessing a stretched, double&#8208;stranded supramolecular network, showcases a soft&#8208;gel behavior with a low stiffness and high pliability. Upon the stimulation of ethanol to transform into the coiled supramolecular configuration, it self&#8208;adjusts to a hard state with nearly 500&#8208;times enhanced stiffness from 0.51&#160;to 243.6&#160;MPa, outstanding load&#8208;bearing capability (over 35&#160;000&#160;times its own weight), and excellent puncture/impact resistance with a specific impact strength of &#8776;116&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2 (g&#160;cm&#8722;3)&#8722;1 (higher than some metals and alloys such as aluminum, and even comparable to the commercially available protective materials such as D3O and Kevlar). Moreover, this material demonstrates reconfiguration&#8208;dependent self&#8208;healing behavior and designable formability, holding great promise in advanced engineering fields that require both high&#8208;strength durability and good formability. This work may open up a new perspective for the development of self&#8208;regulating materials from supramolecular&#8208;scale configuration regulation.

In the hydrated state, the material, possessing a stretched, double-stranded supramolecular network, showcases a soft-gel behavior with a low stiffness and high pliability. Upon the stimulation of ethanol to transform into the coiled supramolecular configuration, it self-adjusts to a hard state with nearly 500-times enhanced stiffness from 0.51&#160;to 243.6&#160;MPa, outstanding load-bearing capability (over 35&#160;000&#160;times its own weight), and excellent puncture/impact resistance with a specific impact strength of &#8776;116&#160;kJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (g&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (higher than some metals and alloys such as aluminum, and even comparable to the commercially available protective materials such as D3O and Kevlar). Moreover, this material demonstrates reconfiguration-dependent self-healing behavior and designable formability, holding great promise in advanced engineering fields that require both high-strength durability and good formability. This work may open up a new perspective for the development of self-regulating materials from supramolecular-scale configuration regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nonvolatile Ferroelectric&#8208;Domain&#8208;Wall Memory Embedded in a Complex Topological Domain Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prototype memory based on conductive ferroelectric domain&#8208;walls confined in a topological quadrant domain is demonstrated, which exhibits a resistive&#8208;switching characteristic with a large on/off ratio &gt;104&#160;and high readout current, as well as an excellent endurance over 108&#160;cycles and a long retention over 12&#160;days.








Abstract
The discovery and precise manipulation of atomic&#8208;size conductive ferroelectric domain walls offers new opportunities for a wide range of prospective electronic devices, and the emerging field of walltronics. Herein, a highly stable and fatigue&#8208;resistant nonvolatile memory device is demonstrated, which is based on deterministic creation and erasure of conductive domain walls that are geometrically confined in a topological domain structure. By introducing a pair of delicately designed coaxial electrodes onto the epitaxial BiFeO3&#160;film, a center&#8208;type quadrant topological domain with conductive charged domain walls can be easily created. More importantly, reversible switching of the quadrant domain between the convergent state with highly conductive confined walls and the divergent state with insulating confined walls can be realized, resulting in an apparent resistance change with a large on/off ratio of &gt;104&#160;and a technically preferred readout current (up to 40&#160;nA). Owing to restrictions from the clamped quadrant ferroelastic domain, the device exhibits excellent restoration repeatability over 108&#160;cycles and a long retention of over 12&#160;days (&gt;106&#160;s). These results provide a new pathway toward high&#8208;performance ferroelectric&#8208;domain&#8208;wall memory, which may spur extensive interest in exploring the immense potential in the emerging field of walltronics.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Nanophotonic Structures for High&#8208;Performance SEIRA Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of high&#8208;performance nanophotonic surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) sensor employing liquid gallium as the ground plane of nanopatch antennas is demonstrated. Superior performance for sensing thin analyte films such as monolayer 1&#8208;octadecanethiol is achieved. The developed cost&#8208;effective procedure for realizing such liquid&#8208;gallium&#8208;based nanophotonic SEIRA sensors is suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy can provide label&#8208;free, nondestructive detection and identification of analytes with high sensitivity and specificity, and therefore has been widely used for various sensing applications. SEIRA sensors usually employ resonant nanophotonic structures, which can substantially enhance the electric field and hence light&#8211;matter interactions by orders of magnitude in certain nanoscale hot spots of the devices. However, as ever, smaller hot spots are employed to further enhance the field, the delivery of analytes into such hot spots becomes increasingly challenging. Here, high&#8208;performance nanophotonic SEIRA sensors based on nanopatch antennas with a liquid gallium ground plane are demonstrated, which not only lead to ultrahigh field confinement and enhancement, but also allow for convenient and efficient delivery of analytes into nanometric hot spots by employing a simple procedure suitable for point&#8208;of&#8208;care applications. The sensors exhibit superior sensitivity in the midinfrared spectral region. Around 10% molecular vibrational signals (i.e., the modulation of a sensor's reflection spectrum owing to the molecular vibrational modes of the analytes) near 2900&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;are achieved from sensing monolayer 1&#8208;octadecanethiol. This cost&#8208;effective and reliable method for realizing liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanophotonic structures provides a new strategy for developing high&#8208;performance sensors and other photonics applications in the infrared region.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass Anode with an Exceptional Cycling&#8208;Induced Capacity Enhancement for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ZIF glass (melt&#8208;quench Co ZIF&#8208;62 glass), for the first time, is evaluated as anode for high performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This ZIF glass anode exhibits an unusual capacity enhancement during charge&#8208;discharge cycling. This exceptional phenomenon is related to the unique structure of ZIF glass, e.g., short&#8208;range disorder.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) hold great promise as high&#8208;energy anode materials for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their tunable chemistry, pore structure and abundant reaction sites. However, the pore structure of crystalline MOFs tends to collapse during lithium&#8208;ion insertion and extraction, and hence, their electrochemical performances are rather limited. As a critical breakthrough, a MOF glass anode for LIBs has been developed in the present work. In detail, it is fabricated by melt&#8208;quenching Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 (Co(Im)1.75(bIm)0.25) to glass, and then by combining glass with carbon black and binder. The derived anode exhibits high lithium storage capacity (306 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at of 2 A g&#8722;1), outstanding cycling stability, and superior rate performance compared with the crystalline Cobalt&#8208;ZIF&#8208;62 and the amorphous one prepared by high&#8208;energy ball&#8208;milling. Importantly, it is found that the Li&#8208;ion storage capacity of the MOF glass anode continuously rises with charge&#8211;discharge cycling and even tripled after 1000 cycles. Combined spectroscopic and structural analyses, along with density functional theory calculations, reveal the origin of the cycling&#8208;induced enhancement of the performances of the MOF glass anode, that is, the increased distortion and local breakage of the Co&#63743;N coordination bonds making the Li&#8208;ion intercalation sites more accessible.

         <title>Oxide/ZIF&#8208;8 Hybrid Nanofiber Yarns: Heightened Surface Activity for Exceptional Chemiresistive Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional chemiresistive gas sensor composed of nanofiber yarn sputter&#8208;deposited with indium tin oxide (ITO) as a sensing layer is designed, and then coated with zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) for nanofiltration of gas analytes. Through comprehensive sensing experiments and molecular modeling, it is demonstrated that yarn@ITO@ZIF&#8208;8 exhibits highly sensitive and selective sensing properties toward NO at room temperature with accelerated responding speeds.








Abstract
Though highly promising as powerful gas sensors, oxide semiconductor chemiresistors have low surface reactivity, which limits their selectivity, sensitivity, and reaction kinetics, particularly at room temperature (RT) operation. It is proposed that a hybrid design involving the nanostructuring of oxides and passivation with selective gas filtration layers can potentially overcome the issues with surface activity. Herein, unique bi&#8208;stacked heterogeneous layers are introduced; that is, nanostructured oxides covered by conformal nanoporous gas filters, on ultrahigh&#8208;density nanofiber (NF) yarns via sputter deposition with indium tin oxide (ITO) and subsequent self&#8208;assembly of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8) nanocrystals. The NF yarn composed of ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;coated ITO films can offer heightened surface activity at RT because of high porosity, large surface area, and effective screening of interfering gases. As a case study, the hybrid sensor demonstrated remarkable sensing performances characterized by high NO selectivity, fast response/recovery kinetics (&gt;60&#8208;fold improvement), and large responses (12.8&#8208;fold improvement @ 1&#160;ppm) in comparison with pristine yarn@ITO, especially under highly humid conditions. Molecular modeling reveals an increased penetration ratio of NO over O2 to the ITO surface, indicating that NO oxidation is reliably prevented and that the secondary adsorption sites provided by the ZIF&#8208;8 facilitate the adsorption/desorption of NO, both to and from ITO.

         <title>Novel Oligomer Enables Green Solvent Processed 17.5% Ternary Organic Solar Cells: Synergistic Energy Loss Reduction and Morphology Fine&#8208;Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low energy loss ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PM6:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl achieve significantly improved power conversion efficiencies of 17.54% and 17.32% by introducing novel oligomers with higher HOMO level as third&#8208;components, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs by green solvent. The significance of high electroluminescence quantum efficiency is highlighted and new understanding of energy loss mechanisms is provided toward high&#8208;performance, ecofriendly OSCs.








Abstract
The large non&#8208;radiative recombination is the main factor that limits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two novel structurally similar oligomers (named 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT) with D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D and A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;D&#8208;A configuration are synthesized for high&#8208;performance ternary OSCs with low energy loss. As third components, these PM6 analogue oligomers effectively suppress the non&#8208;radiative recombination in OSCs. Although the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT are higher than that of PM6, the oligomers enabled ultra&#8208;high electroluminescence quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of 0.05% and improved VOC, indicating suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination overweighs the common belief of deeper HOMO requirement in third component selection. Moreover, the different compatibility of 5BDTBDD and 5BDDBDT with PM6 and BTP&#8208;BO4Cl fine&#8208;tunes the active layer morphology with synergistic effects. The ternary devices based on PM6:5BDTBDD:BTPBO4Cl and PM6:5BDDBDT:BTP&#8208;BO4Cl achieve a significantly improved PCEs of 17.54% and 17.32%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the art OSCs processed by green solvent of o&#8208;xylene. The strategy using novel oligomer as third component also has very wide composition tolerance in ternary OSCs. This is the first work that demonstrates novel structurally compatible D&#8208;A type oligomers are effective third components, and provides new understanding of synergetic energy loss mechanisms towards high performance OSCs.

         <title>Transforming the chemical structure and bio&#8208;nano activity of doxorubicin by ultrasound for selective killing of cancer cells</title>

Abstract
Reconfiguring the structure and selectivity of existing chemotherapeutics represents an opportunity for developing novel tumor&#8208;selective drugs. Here; we demonstrate; as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept; the use of high&#8208;frequency sound waves to transform the non&#8208;selective anthracycline doxorubicin into a tumor selective drug molecule. The transformed drug self&#8208;aggregates in water to form &#8764;200&#160;nm nanodrugs; without requiring organic solvents; chemical agents and surfactants. The nanodrugs preferentially interact with lipid rafts; abundant in the mitochondria of cancer cells. The mitochondrial localization of the nanodrugs plays a key role in inducing reactive oxygen species&#8208;mediated selective death of human breast cancer; colorectal carcinoma; ovarian carcinoma and drug&#8208;resistant cell lines. Only marginal cytotoxicity (80&#8208;100% cell viability) towards fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes is observed; even after administration of high doses of the nanodrug (25&#8208;40&#160;&#956;g/mL). Penetration; cytotoxicity and selectivity of the nanodrugs in tumor mimicking tissues are validated by using a 3D co&#8208;culture of cancer and healthy cells and 3D cell&#8208;collagen constructs in a perfusion bioreactor. The nanodrugs exhibit tropism for lung and limited accumulation in the liver and spleen; as suggested by in vivo biodistribution studies. Our results highlight the potential of this approach to transform the structure and bioactivity of commercial anticancer drugs and antibiotics bearing sono&#8208;active moieties.

         <title>Assembly of Bioactive Nanoparticles via Metal&#8211;Phenolic Complexation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and tunable strategy is developed to assemble a range of biomacromolecules into bioactive metal&#8211;phenolic nanoparticles (b&#8208;MPN NPs), while retaining the intrinsic activity of the biomacromolecules. The bioactivity of the b&#8208;MPN NPs enables their use in various applications, including cell apoptosis, RNA degradation, cascade reactions, and gene silencing.








Abstract
The integration of bioactive materials (e.g., proteins and genes) into nanoparticles holds promise in fields ranging from catalysis to biomedicine. However, it is challenging to develop a simple and broadly applicable nanoparticle platform that can readily incorporate distinct biomacromolecules without affecting their intrinsic activity. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic assembly approach is presented whereby diverse functional nanoparticles can be readily assembled in water by combining various synthetic and natural building blocks, including poly(ethylene glycol), phenolic ligands, metal ions, and bioactive macromolecules. The assembly process is primarily mediated by metal&#8211;phenolic complexes through coordination and hydrophobic interactions, which yields uniform and spherical nanoparticles (mostly &lt;200&#160;nm),&#160;while preserving the function of the incorporated biomacromolecules (siRNA and five different proteins used). The functionality of the assembled nanoparticles is demonstrated through cancer cell apoptosis, RNA degradation, catalysis, and gene downregulation studies. Furthermore, the resulting nanoparticles can be used as building blocks for the secondary engineering of superstructures via templating and cross&#8208;linking with metal ions. The bioactivity and versatility of the platform can potentially be used for the streamlined and rational design of future bioactive materials.

         <title>Active and Passive Tuning of Ultranarrow Resonances in Polaritonic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;field nanoscopy monitors active and passive tuning of ultranarrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas over a wide spectral range (&#8722;35 cm&#8722;1, being the resonance linewidth &#8776;9 cm&#8722;1). Passive tunability can be realized by tailoring the dielectric environment of nanoantennas made of boron nitride, while reversible in situ tuning of narrow resonances is realized by placing nanoantennas on top of a graphene layer.








Abstract
Optical nanoantennas are of great importance for photonic devices and spectroscopy due to their capability of squeezing light at the nanoscale and enhancing light&#8211;matter interactions. Among them, nanoantennas made of polar crystals supporting phonon polaritons (phononic nanoantennas) exhibit the highest quality factors. This is due to the low optical losses inherent in these materials, which, however, hinder the spectral tuning of the nanoantennas due to their dielectric nature. Here, active and passive tuning of ultranarrow resonances in phononic nanoantennas is realized over a wide spectral range (&#8776;35 cm&#8722;1, being the resonance linewidth &#8776;9 cm&#8722;1), monitored by near&#8208;field nanoscopy. To do that, the local environment of a single nanoantenna made of hexagonal boron nitride is modified by placing it on different polar substrates, such as quartz and 4H&#8208;silicon carbide, or covering it with layers of a high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index van der Waals crystal (WSe2). Importantly, active tuning of the nanoantenna polaritonic resonances is demonstrated by placing it on top of a gated graphene monolayer in which the Fermi energy is varied. This work presents the realization of tunable polaritonic nanoantennas with ultranarrow resonances, which can find applications in active nanooptics and (bio)sensing.

A novel ionic liquid, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate (EMIMHSO4), is employed for managing defects in printed cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) films. The EMIMHSO4 can succesfully regulate perovskite thin&#8208;film growth and strongly coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+, which enable the achievement of the highest&#8208;efficiencies ambient printed CsPbI3 solar cells, both under 1 sun illumination (20.01%, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and indoor light illumination (37.24%, 1000 lux, 365 &#181;W cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) perovskite is well known for its unparalleled stability at high temperatures up to 500 &#176;C and under oxidative chemical stresses. However, upscaling solar cells via ambient printing suffers from imperfect crystal quality and defects caused by uncontrollable crystallization. Here, the incorporation of a low concentration of novel ionic liquid is reported as being promising for managing defects in CsPbI3 films, interfacial energy alignment, and device stability of solar cells fabricated via ambient blade&#8208;coating. Both theoretical simulations and experimental measurements reveal that the ionic liquid successfully regulates the perovskite thin&#8208;film growth to decrease perovskite grain boundaries, strongly coordinates with the undercoordinated Pb2+ to passivate iodide vacancy defects, aligns the interface to decrease the energy barrier at the electron&#8208;transporting layer, and relaxes the lattice strain to promote phase stability. Consequently, ambient printed CsPbI3 solar cells with power conversion efficiency as high as 20.01% under 1 sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and 37.24% under indoor light illumination (1000 lux, 365 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) are achieved; both are the highest for printed all&#8208;inorganic cells for corresponding applications. Furthermore, the bare cells show an impressive long&#8208;term ambient stability with only &#8776;5% PCE degradation after 1000 h aging under ambient conditions.

         <dc:description>
Harnessing the coordination between the components and microstructures of low&#8208;dimensional core&#8211;shell structure materials represents a paradigm shift in the design of electromagnetic wave absorbents with radiation prevention and antiradar stealth functions.








Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption materials possess exceptionally high EM energy loss efficiency. With vigorous developments in nanotechnology, such materials have exhibited numerous advanced EM functions, including radiation prevention and antiradar stealth. To achieve improved EM performance and multifunctionality, the elaborate control of microstructures has become an attractive research direction. By designing them as core&#8211;shell structures with different dimensions, the combined effects, such as interfacial polarization, conduction networks, magnetic coupling, and magnetic&#8211;dielectric synergy, can significantly enhance the EM wave absorption performance. Herein, the advances in low&#8208;dimensional core&#8211;shell EM wave absorption materials are outlined and a selection of the most remarkable examples is discussed. The derived key information regarding dimensional design, structural engineering, performance, and structure&#8211;function relationship are comprehensively summarized. Moreover, the investigation of the cutting&#8208;edge mechanisms is given particular attention. Additional applications, such as oxidation resistance and self&#8208;cleaning functions, are also introduced. Finally, insight into what may be expected from this rapidly expanding field and future challenges are presented.

         <title>Sunlight&#8208;Coordinated High&#8208;Performance Moisture Power in Natural Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient sunlight&#8208;coordinated &#8220;moist&#8208;electric generator&#8221; offers a record&#8208;high short&#8208;circuit current density, harvesting multiple sources of moisture and light synchronously, which is available for scalable integration toward portable and wearable power&#8208;supply systems under different real natural conditions, working for lighting and electrically driven objects.








Abstract
It is a challenge to spontaneously harvest multiple clean sources from the environment for upgraded energy&#8208;converting systems. The ubiquitous moisture and sunlight in nature are attractive for sustainable power generation especially. A high&#8208;performance light&#8208;coordinated &#8220;moist&#8208;electric generator&#8221; (LMEG) based on the rational combination of a polyelectrolyte and a phytochrome is herein developed. By spontaneous adsorption of gaseous water molecules and simultaneous exposure to sunlight, a piece of 1 cm2 composite film offers an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.92&#160;V and a considerable short&#8208;circuit current density of up to 1.55&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This record&#8208;high current density is about two orders of magnitude improvement over that of most conventional moisture&#8208;enabled systems, which is caused by moisture&#8208;induced charge separation accompanied with photoexcited carrier migration, as confirmed by a dynamic Monte Carlo device simulation. Flexible devices with customizable size are available for large&#8208;scale integration to effectively work under a wide range of relative humidity (about 20&#8211;100%), temperature (10&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C), and light intensity (30&#8211;200&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). The wearable and portable LMEGs provide ample power supply in natural conditions for indoor and outdoor electricity&#8208;consuming systems. This work opens a novel avenue to develop sustainable power generation through collecting multiple types of natural energy by a single hybrid harvester.

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;Double&#8208;Layer Solid Electrolyte with Adjustable Interphases Enabling High&#8208;Voltage Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;double&#8208;layer solid electrolyte is designed by using different kinds of plasticizers coupled with a polymer. Through the in situ polymerization of propylene carbonate on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, to form a protective layer, the oxidation and cycling stability of the cathode are improved. The low&#8208;voltage stability and fast ion transmission is improved by the affinity of diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and poly(vinylidene fluoride).








Abstract
Increasing the energy density and long&#8208;term cycling stability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries necessitates the stability of electrolytes under high/low voltage application and stable electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact. However, neither a single polymer nor liquid electrolyte can realize this due to their limited internal energy gap, which cannot avoid lithium&#8208;metal deposition and electrolyte oxidation simultaneously. Herein, a novel type of quasi&#8208;double&#8208;layer composite polymer electrolytes (QDL&#8208;CPEs) is proposed by using plasticizers with high oxidation stability (propylene carbonate) and high reduction stability (diethylene glycol dimethyl ether) in a poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)&#8208;based electrolyte composites. In&#8208;situ&#8208;polymerized propylene carbonate can function as a cathode electrolyte interface (CEI) film, which can enhance the antioxidant ability. The nucleophilic substitution reaction between diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and PVDF increases the reduction stability of the electrolyte on the anodic side, without the formation of lithium dendrites. The QDL&#8208;CPEs has high ionic conductivity, an enhanced electrochemical reaction window, adjustable electrode/electrolyte interphases, and no additional electrolyte&#8211;electrolyte interfacial resistance. Thus, this ingenious design of the QDL&#8208;CPEs improves the cycling performance of a fabricated LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)//QDL&#8208;CPEs//hard carbon full cell at room temperature, paving a new way for designing solid&#8208;state battery systems accessible for practical applications.

         <title>Bioinspired lipoproteins of furoxans&#8208;oxaliplatin remodels physical barriers in tumor to potentiate T&#8208;cell infiltration</title>

Abstract
The infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors is critically challenged by the intricate intratumor physical barriers, which is emerging as an important issue of anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we synthesized a reduction&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8208;oxaliplatin (FO) and designed a stroma cell&#8208;accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system (S&#8208;LFO), aiming to facilitate CTLs infiltration in tumors for anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy. S&#8208;LFO treatment significantly promoted tumor vessel normalization and eliminated multiple components of tumor stroma, ultimately producing a 2.96&#8208;, 5.02&#8208; and 8.65&#8208;fold increase of CD3+CD8+ T cells, their interferon&#8208;&#947;&#8208; and granzyme B&#8208;expressing sub&#8208;types when comparing to the negative control, and considerably facilitating their trafficking to the cancer cell regions in tumors. Moreover, the combination of S&#8208;LFO with an anti&#8208;programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (aPD&#8208;L1) produced notable therapeutic benefits of retarded tumor growth and extended survivals in three murine tumor models. Therefore, this study provides an encouraging strategy of remodeling the intratumor physical barriers to potentiate CTLs infiltration for anti&#8208;cancer immunotherapy.

S-LFO treatment significantly promoted tumor vessel normalization and eliminated multiple components of tumor stroma, ultimately producing a 2.96-, 5.02- and 8.65-fold increase of CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, their interferon-&lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;- and granzyme B-expressing sub-types when comparing to the negative control, and considerably facilitating their trafficking to the cancer cell regions in tumors. Moreover, the combination of S-LFO with an anti-programmed death ligand-1 (aPD-L1) produced notable therapeutic benefits of retarded tumor growth and extended survivals in three murine tumor models. Therefore, this study provides an encouraging strategy of remodeling the intratumor physical barriers to potentiate CTLs infiltration for anti-cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A New Durable Surface Nanoparticles&#8208;Modified Perovskite Cathode for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells from Selective Cation Exsolution under Oxidizing Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The major perovskite phase, m&#8208;BCFZYN&#8208;095, in BCFZYN&#8208;095 has high proton conductivity, and NiO nanoparticles on the surface effectively improve the oxygen surface exchange rate, thereby simultaneously increasing proton and oxygen ion conductivities of the BCFZYN&#8208;095 composite. Consequently, favorable peak power densities of a protonic ceramic fuel cell with the BCFZYN&#8208;095 composite cathode in H2 are obtained.








Abstract
A high&#8208;performance cathode of a protonic ceramic fuel cell (PCFC) should possess excellent oxygen reduction reactivity, high proton/oxygen&#8208;ion/electron conductivity, and sufficient operational stability, thus requiring a delicate tuning of both the bulk and surface properties of the electrode material. Although surface modification of perovskites with nanoparticles from reducing&#8208;atmosphere exsolution has been demonstrated effective at improving the electrochemical anodic oxidation, such nanoparticles would easily re&#8208;incorporate into the perovskite lattice causing a big challenge for their application as a cathode. Here, a durable perovskite&#8208;based nanocomposite cathode for PCFCs is reported, which is facilely prepared via the exsolution of nanoparticles in an oxidizing atmosphere. Through composition and cation nonstoichiometry manipulation, a precursor with the nominal composition of Ba0.95(Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1)0.95Ni0.05O3&#8722;&#948; (BCFZYN&#8208;095) is designed, synthesized, and investigated, which, upon calcination, gives rise to the formation of a perovskite&#8208;based nanocomposite comprising a major perovskite phase and a minor NiO phase enriched on the perovskite surface. The major perovskite phase enabled by the proper cation nonstoichiometry manipulation promotes bulk proton conduction while the NiO nanoparticles facilitate the oxygen surface exchange process, leading to a superior cathodic performance with a maximum peak power density of 1040&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and excellent operational stability of 400 h at 550&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Escalating Ferromagnetic Order via Se&#8208;Vacancies Near Vanadium in WSe2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhancement of ferromagnetism is demonstrated via Se&#8208;vacancy engineering in V&#8208;doped WSe2 diluted magnetic semiconductors and the underlying mechanism is elucidated. After generation of abundant Se&#8208;vacancies via heat&#8208;treatment, butterfly&#8208;shaped hysteresis in the magnetoresistance curves and distinct magnetic domains are clearly observed. With state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art atomic elemental mapping and comprehensive theoretical explanation, the origin of the enhanced ferromagnetism is revealed.








Abstract
Magnetic order has been proposed to arise from a variety of defects, including vacancies, antisites, and grain boundaries, which are relevant in numerous electronics and spintronics applications. Nevertheless, its magnetism remains controversial due to the lack of structural analysis. The escalation of ferromagnetism in vanadium&#8208;doped WSe2 monolayer is herein demonstrated by tailoring complex configurations of Se vacancies (SeVac) via post heat&#8208;treatment. Structural analysis of atomic defects is systematically performed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), enabled by the monolayer nature. Temperature&#8208;dependent magnetoresistance hysteresis ensures enhanced magnetic order after high&#8208;temperature heat&#8208;treatment, consistent with magnetic domain analysis from magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The vanadium&#8211;Se vacancy pairing is a key to promoting ferromagnetism via spin&#8208;flip by electron transfer, predicted from density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations. The approach toward nanodefect engineering paves a way to overcome weak magnetic order in diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMSs) for renovating semiconductor spintronics.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembled Epitaxial Ferroelectric Oxide Nano&#8208;spring with Super&#8208;scalability</title>

Abstract
Oxide nano&#8208;springs have attracted many research interests because of their anti&#8208;corrosion, high&#8208;temperature tolerance, oxidation resistance, and enhanced&#8208;mechanic&#8208;response from unique helix structures, enabling various nano&#8208;manipulators, nano&#8208;motors, nano&#8208;switches, sensors, and energy harvesters. However, preparing oxide nano&#8208;springs is a challenge for their intrinsic lack of elasticity. Here, we developed an approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled, epitaxial, ferroelectric nano&#8208;springs with built&#8208;in strain due to the lattice mismatch in freestanding La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3 (LSMO/BTO) bilayer heterostructures. We find that these LSMO/BTO nano&#8208;springs can be extensively pulled or pushed up to their geometry limits back and forth without breaking, exhibiting super&#8208;scalability with full recovery capability. The phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that the excellent scalability originates from the continuous ferroelastic domain structures, resulting from twisting under co&#8208;existing axial and shear strains. In addition, the oxide hetero&#8208;structural springs exhibit strong resilience due to the limited plastic deformation nature and the built&#8208;in strain between the bilayers. This discovery provides an alternative way for preparing and operating functional oxide nano&#8208;springs that can be applied to various technologies.

         <title>Polymerized Small Molecular Acceptor with Branched Side Chains for All Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency over 16.7%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of small molecule acceptor (SMA)&#8208;based organic solar cells have already exceeded 18%. However, the development of polymer acceptors still lags far behind their SMA counterparts mainly due to the lack of efficient polymer acceptors. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of polymer acceptors named PY&#8208;X (with X being the branched alkyl chain) by employing the same central core with the SMA L8&#8208;BO but with different branched alkyl chains on the pyrrole motif. L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains on the beta position of the thiophene unit has previously shown improved structural order and charge transport compared to those of Y6. It was found that the molecular packing of SMA&#8208;HD featuring 2&#8208;hexyldecyl side chain used in the synthesis of PY&#8208;HD is similar to L8&#8208;BO, in which the branched alkyl chains lead to condensed and high&#8208;order molecular assembly in SMA&#8208;HD molecules. When combined with PM6, PY&#8208;HD&#8208;based all polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) exhibits a high PCE of 16.41%, representing the highest PCE value for the binary all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, the side&#8208;chain modification on the pyrrole site position further improves the performance of the all&#8208;PSCs, and the PY&#8208;DT&#8208;based device delivers a new record high efficiency of 16.76% (certified as 16.3%), with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.949&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current of 23.73&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and a decent fill factor of 74.4%. Our work provides new insights for understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship of polymer acceptors and paves a feasible avenue to develop efficient conjugated polymer acceptors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of small molecule acceptor (SMA)-based organic solar cells have already exceeded 18%. However, the development of polymer acceptors still lags far behind their SMA counterparts mainly due to the lack of efficient polymer acceptors. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of polymer acceptors named PY-X (with X being the branched alkyl chain) by employing the same central core with the SMA L8-BO but with different branched alkyl chains on the pyrrole motif. L8-BO with the branched alkyl chains on the beta position of the thiophene unit has previously shown improved structural order and charge transport compared to those of Y6. It was found that the molecular packing of SMA-HD featuring 2-hexyldecyl side chain used in the synthesis of PY-HD is similar to L8-BO, in which the branched alkyl chains lead to condensed and high-order molecular assembly in SMA-HD molecules. When combined with PM6, PY-HD-based all polymer solar cell (all-PSC) exhibits a high PCE of 16.41%, representing the highest PCE value for the binary all-PSCs.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystal&#8208;Infused Porous Surfaces for Manipulation of Underwater Gas Bubble Transport and Adhesion</title>

Abstract
Biomimetic artificial surfaces that enable the manipulation of gas bubble mobility have been explored in a wide range of applications in nanomaterial synthesis, surface defouling, biomedical diagnostics, and therapeutics. Although many superhydrophobic surfaces and isotropic lubricant&#8208;infused porous surfaces have been developed to manipulate gas bubbles, the simultaneous control over the adhesion and transport of gas bubbles underwater remains a challenge. Thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs), a class of structured fluids, provide an opportunity to tune the behavior of gas bubbles through LC mesophase transitions using a variety of external stimuli. Using this central idea, we report the design and synthesis of liquid crystal&#8208;infused porous surfaces (LCIPS) and elucidate the effects of the LC mesophase on the transport and adhesion of gas bubbles on LCIPS immersed in water. We demonstrate that LCIPS are a promising class of surfaces with an unprecedented level of responsiveness and functionality, which enable the design of cyanobacteria&#8208;inspired object movement, smart catalysts, and bubble gating devices to sense and sort volatile organic compounds and control oxygen levels in biomimetic cell cultures.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Deposited and Patternable Conductive Polymer Thin Film Electrodes for Microbial Bioelectronics</title>

Abstract
Microbial bioelectronic devices integrate naturally occurring or synthetically engineered electroactive microbes with microelectronics. These devices have a broad range of potential applications, but engineering the biotic&#8208;abiotic interface for biocompatibility, adhesion, electron transfer, and maximum surface area remains a challenge. Prior approaches to interface modification lack simple processability, the ability to pattern the materials, and/or a significant enhancement in currents. Here, we report a novel conductive polymer coating that significantly enhances current densities relative to unmodified electrodes in microbial bioelectronics. Our coating is based on a blend of PEDOT:PSS crosslinked with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethylacrylate) (PHEA) along with a thin polydopamine (PDA) layer for adhesion to an underlying ITO electrode. When used as an interface layer with the current&#8208;producing bacterium&#160;Shewanella oneidensis&#160;MR&#8208;1, this material produces&#160;a 178&#8208;fold increase in the current density compared to unmodified electrodes, a current gain that is higher than previously reported thin&#8208;film 2D coatings and 3D conductive polymer coatings. We characterize the chemistry, morphology, and electronic properties of the coatings and demonstrate the implementation of these coated electrodes for use in microbial fuel cells, multiplexed bioelectronic devices, and organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)&#8208;based microbial sensors. We envision that this simple coating will advance the development of microbial bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Ternary Blend Organic Solar Cells: Understanding the Morphology from Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review briefly introduces the solubility and miscibility parameters that affect the morphology of ternary blends and then summarizes the recent processes of morphology study on ternary blends from the aspects of molecular crystallinity, molecular packing orientation, domain size and purity, vertical phase separation, direct observation of the morphology as well as morphological stability.








Abstract
Ternary blend organic solar cells (TB&#8208;OSCs) incorporating multiple donor and/or acceptor materials into the active layer have emerged as a promising strategy to simultaneously improve the overall device parameters for realizing higher performances than binary devices. Whereas introducing multiple materials also results in a more complicated morphology than their binary blend counterparts. Understanding the morphology is crucially important for further improving the device performance of TB&#8208;OSC. This review introduces the solubility and miscibility parameters that affect the morphology of ternary blends. Then, this review summarizes the recent processes of morphology study on ternary blends from the aspects of molecular crystallinity, molecular packing orientation, domain size and purity, directly observation of morphology, vertical phase separation as well as morphological stability. Finally, summary and prospects of TB&#8208;OSCs are concluded.

A self&#8208;assembled CdSe/CdS@Cd1&#8722;xZnxS core/shell nanoplatelets&#8208;whispering gallery mode (WGM) microlaser with ultralow&#8208;threshold, tunable&#8208;wavelength, and excellent photostability is proposed. Both multi&#8208; and single&#8208;mode high quality factor WGM lasing are achieved with ultralow thresholds. The results highlight the significance of interface engineering on the optimization of gain properties of heterostructured nanomaterials and shed light on developing future miniaturized tunable coherent light sources.








Abstract
The realization of efficient on&#8208;chip microlasers with scalable fabrication, ultralow threshold, and stable single&#8208;frequency operation is always desired for a wide range of miniaturized photonic systems. Herein, an effective way to fabricate nanostructures&#8208; whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) lasers by drop&#8208;casting CdSe/CdS@Cd1&#8722;xZnxS core/buffer&#8208;shell@graded&#8208;shell nanoplatelets (NPLs) dispersion onto silica microspheres is presented. Benefiting from the excellent gain properties from the interface engineered core/hybrid shell NPLs and high&#8208;quality factor WGM resonator from excellent optical field confinement, the proposed room&#8208;temperature NPLs&#8208;WGM microlasers show a record&#8208;low lasing threshold of 3.26 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 under nanosecond laser pumping among all colloidal NPLs&#8208;based lasing demonstrations. The presence of sharp discrete transverse electric&#8208; and magnetic&#8208;mode spikes, the inversely proportional dependence of the free spectra range on microsphere sizes and the polarization anisotropy of laser output represent the first direct experimental evidence for NPLs&#8208;WGM lasing nature, which is verified theoretically by the computed electric&#8208;field distribution inside the microcavity. Remarkably, a stable single&#8208;mode lasing output with an ultralow lasing threshold of 3.84 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 is achieved by the Vernier effect through evanescent field coupling. The results highlight the significance of interface engineering on the optimization of gain properties of heterostructured nanomaterials and shed light on developing future miniaturized tunable coherent light sources.

         <title>Colloidal Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Nanoplatelets: Thickness&#8208;Controlled Synthesis, Properties, and Application in Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the research progress and challenges associated with thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis, stability, surface passivation, doping, optical (linear and nonlinear) properties of both organic and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid lead and lead&#8208;free halide perovskite nanoplatelets along with recent progress on their application to light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
Colloidal metal&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals (MHP NCs) are gaining significant attention for a wide range of optoelectronics applications owing to their exciting properties, such as defect tolerance, near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and tunable emission across the entire visible wavelength range. Although the optical properties of MHP NCs are easily tunable through their halide composition, they suffer from light&#8208;induced halide phase segregation that limits their use in devices. However, MHPs can be synthesized in the form of colloidal nanoplatelets (NPls) with monolayer (ML)&#8208;level thickness control, exhibiting strong quantum confinement effects, and thus enabling tunable emission across the entire visible wavelength range by controlling the thickness of bromide or iodide&#8208;based lead&#8208;halide perovskite NPls. In addition, the NPls exhibit narrow emission peaks, have high exciton binding energies, and a higher fraction of radiative recombination compared to their bulk counterparts, making them ideal candidates for applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in colloidal MHP NPls: synthetic routes, thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis of both organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid and all&#8208;inorganic MHP NPls, their linear and nonlinear optical properties (including charge&#8208;carrier dynamics), and their performance in LEDs. Furthermore, the challenges associated with their thickness&#8208;controlled synthesis, environmental and thermal stability, and their application in making efficient LEDs are discussed.

         <title>Highly Transparent and Self&#8208;Healable Solar Thermal Anti&#8208;/Deicing Surfaces: When Ultrathin MXene Multilayers Marry a Solid Slippery Self&#8208;Cleaning Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar anti&#8208;/deicing surfaces, exhibiting high transparency (coated glass, transmittance &gt;77%&#160;at 550&#160;nm) and photothermal healability, are fabricated on various substrates, by applying a solid omniphobic slippery coating onto layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer&#8208;assembled MXene multilayers. The surface temperature rises by 31 &#176;C under 1.0 sun illumination for anti&#8208;/deicing applications, and the surface possesses self&#8208;cleaning capability to spontaneously shed waterborne and organic liquids.








Abstract
Solar anti&#8208;/deicing can solve icing problems by converting sunlight into heat. One of the biggest problems, which has long been plaguing the design of solar anti&#8208;/deicing surfaces, is that photothermal materials are always lightproof and appear black, because of the mutual exclusiveness between generating heat and retaining transparency. Herein, a highly transparent and scalable solar anti&#8208;/deicing surface is reported, which enables the coated glass to exhibit high transparency (&gt;77% transmittance at 550&#160;nm) and meanwhile causes a &gt;30 &#176;C&#160;surface temperature increase relative to the ambient environment under 1.0 sun illumination. Such a transparent anti&#8208;/deicing surface can be fabricated onto a large class of substrates (e.g., glass, ceramics, metals, plastics), by applying a solid omniphobic slippery coating onto layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer&#8208;assembled ultrathin MXene multilayers. Hence, the surface possesses a self&#8208;cleaning ability to shed waterborne and oil&#8208;based liquids thanks to residue&#8208;free slipping motion. Passive anti&#8208;icing and active deicing capabilities are, respectively, obtained on the solar thermal surface, which effectively prevents water from freezing and simultaneously melts pre&#8208;formed ice and thick frost. The self&#8208;cleaning effect enables residue&#8208;free removal of unfrozen water and interfacially melted ice/frost to boost the anti&#8208;/deicing efficiency. Importantly, the surface is capable of self&#8208;healing under illumination to repair physical damage and chemical degradation.

         <title>Copper&#8208;Free Click Chemistry: Applications in Drug Delivery, Cell Tracking, and Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Copper&#8208;free click chemistry is applicable outside of the laboratory, as it can be used controllably on cell surfaces, in the cytosol, and in living bodies. It is consequently of interest to biomedical researchers, and various new materials have been proposed. They can be categorized as nanoparticles for drug delivery, imaging agents for cell tracking, and hydrogels for tissue engineering.








Abstract
Traditionally, organic chemical reactions require organic solvents, toxic catalysts, heat, or high pressure. However, copper&#8208;free click chemistry has been shown to have favorable reaction rates and orthogonality in water, buffer solutions, and physiological conditions without toxic catalysts. Strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition and inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reactions are representative of copper&#8208;free click chemistry. Artificial chemical reactions via click chemistry can also be used outside of the laboratory in a controllable manner on live cell surfaces, in the cytosol, and in living bodies. Consequently, copper&#8208;free click chemistry has many features that are of interest in biomedical research, and various new materials and strategies for its use have been proposed. Herein, recent remarkable trials that have used copper&#8208;free click chemistry are described, focusing on their applications in molecular imaging and therapy. The research is categorized as nanoparticles for drug delivery, imaging agents for cell tracking, and hydrogels for tissue engineering, which are rapidly advancing fields based on click chemistry. The content is based primarily on the experience with click chemistry&#8208;based biomaterials over the last 10 years.

         <title>A High Conductivity 1D &#960;&#8211;d Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with Efficient Polysulfide Trapping&#8208;Diffusion&#8208;Catalysis in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rationally designed multifunctional polysulfide mediators based on a novel 1D &#960;&#8211;d conjugated Ni&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D) are demonstrated as excellent cathode materials in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, realizing the adsorption&#8208;catalysis&#8208;conversion of polysulfides, and thus batteries with exceptional lifespan are delivered.








Abstract
The shuttling behavior and sluggish conversion kinetics of the intermediate lithium polysulfides (LiPS) represent the main obstructions to the practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Herein, a 1D &#960;&#8211;d conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D, is presented as an efficient sulfur host to overcome these limitations. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D is characterized by a remarkable binding strength for trapping soluble LiPS species. Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D also acts as an effective catalyst for S reduction during the discharge process and Li2S oxidation during the charging process. In addition, the delocalization of electrons in the &#960;&#8211;d system of Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D provides a superior electrical conductivity to improve electron transfer. Thus, cathodes based on Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;1D enable LSBs with excellent performance, for example, impressive cycling stability with over 82% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 3 C, superior rate performance of 575 mAh g&#8722;1 at 8 C, and a high areal capacity of 6.63 mAh cm&#8722;2 under raised sulfur loading of 6.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. The strategies and advantages here demonstrated can be extended to a broader range of &#960;&#8211;d conjugated MOFs materials, which the authors believe have a high potential as sulfur hosts in LSBs.

         <title>Fabrication of Efficient Single&#8208;Emitter Plasmonic Patch Antennas by Deterministic In Situ Optical Lithography using Spatially Modulated Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new technique of direct laser etching using spatially modulated light permits deterministic and controlled positioning of single&#8208;emitters inside photonic structures, such as patch nanoantennas, while preventing any emitter photodegradation. The optical properties of the fabricated antennas are investigated; high brightness and very large increase of absorption cross&#8208;section are demonstrated.








Abstract
Single&#8208;emitter plasmonic patch antennas are room&#8208;temperature deterministic single&#8208;photon sources, which exhibit highly accelerated and directed single&#8208;photon emission. However, for efficient operation these structures require 3D nanoscale deterministic control of emitter positioning within the device, which is a demanding task, especially when emitter damage during fabrication is a major concern. To overcome this limitation, the deterministic room&#8208;temperature in situ optical lithography protocol uses spatially modulated light to position a plasmonic structure nondestructively on any selected single&#8208;emitter with 3D nanoscale control. Herein, the emission statistics of such plasmonic antennas that embed a deterministically positioned single colloidal CdSe/CdS quantum dot, which highlight acceleration and brightness of emission, are analyzed. It is demonstrated that the presented antenna induces a 1000&#8208;fold effective increase in the absorption cross&#8208;section, and, under high pumping, these antennas show nonlinearly enhanced emission.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Insensitive Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaics by Bulk Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bulk&#8208;heterojunction strategy is developed to reduce the temperature sensitivity of inorganic perovskite solar cells to operation temperature, which may shed light on extending the application of perovskite solar cells for specific scenarios such as polar regions, near space, and exoplanet exploration.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) emerge as an ideal candidate for applications beyond terrestrial implementation due to their robustness. However, underlying mechanisms regarding their photovoltaic process at different temperatures remain unclear. Based on a stable absorber of CsPbI2.85(BrCl)0.15, considerable variation of corresponding device performance is revealed over temperature and further demonstrates a simple approach to an effective reduction of such variation.

&lt;p&gt;A bulk-heterojunction strategy is developed to reduce the temperature sensitivity of inorganic perovskite solar cells to operation temperature, which may shed light on extending the application of perovskite solar cells for specific scenarios such as polar regions, near space, and exoplanet exploration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) emerge as an ideal candidate for applications beyond terrestrial implementation due to their robustness. However, underlying mechanisms regarding their photovoltaic process at different temperatures remain unclear. Based on a stable absorber of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2.85&lt;/sub&gt;(BrCl)&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;, considerable variation of corresponding device performance is revealed over temperature and further demonstrates a simple approach to an effective reduction of such variation. Interestingly, this absorber is found to be excitonic with poor carrier transport even at an ambient temperature of 285 K and below. With a novel device configuration of a PTB7-th/perovskite bulk heterojunction, exciton dissociation and carrier extraction is facilitated. The resultant solar cell attains a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.2% with the fill factor of &#8776;84%, which represents the highest-efficiency &#947;-phase IPSCs reported to date. Importantly, this device is less sensitive to operation temperature, wherein the PCE variation over the temperature range from 210 to 360 K is 60% suppressed compared with the reference. The approach is effectively extended to other IPSCs with different photoactive phases, which may shed light on realizing highly efficient IPSCs for specific scenarios such as polar regions, near-space, and exoplanet exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible, stretchable, and soft electronics interfaced with the human body hold immense potential to unlock a variety of diagnostic, therapeutic, and health monitoring applications. Materials chemistry plays a crucial role in determining the interaction and integration of these devices with biological systems. Recent progress in materials chemistry&#8208;enabled bioelectronics is presented and challenges, opportunities, and future research directions are highlighted.








Abstract
Designing bioelectronic devices that seamlessly integrate with the human body is a technological pursuit of great importance. Bioelectronic medical devices that reliably and chronically interface with the body can advance neuroscience, health monitoring, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Recent major efforts focus on investigating strategies to fabricate flexible, stretchable, and soft electronic devices, and advances in materials chemistry have emerged as fundamental to the creation of the next generation of bioelectronics. This review summarizes contemporary advances and forthcoming technical challenges related to three principal components of bioelectronic devices: i) substrates and structural materials, ii) barrier and encapsulation materials, and iii) conductive materials. Through notable illustrations from the literature, integration and device fabrication strategies and associated challenges for each material class are highlighted.

         <title>Record&#8208;High Superconductivity in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Emerged in Compressed 2H&#8208;TaS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;Tc superconducting state emerges in 2H&#8208;TaS2 under high pressure. The Tc enhances rapidly and reaches a maximum of &#8776;16.4 K at &#8776;157.4&#160;GPa, which sets a new record for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). It is the first time this remarkable superconducting state has been found in TMDs. The result brings a new broad perspective on layered materials.








Abstract
Pressure has always been an effective method for uncovering novel phenomena and properties in condensed matter physics. Here, an electrical transport study is carried on 2H&#8208;TaS2 up to &#8776;208&#160;GPa, and an unexpected superconducting state (SC&#8208;II) emerging around 86.1&#160;GPa with an initial critical temperature (Tc) of 9.6 K is found. As pressure increases, the Tc enhances rapidly and reaches a maximum of 16.4 K at 157.4&#160;GPa, which sets a new record for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The original superconducting state (SC&#8208;I) is found to be re&#8208;enhanced above 100&#160;GPa after the recession around 10&#160;GPa, and coexists with SC&#8208;II to the highest pressure applied in this work. In situ high&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hall effect measurements reveal that the occurrence of SC&#8208;II is accompanied by a structural modification and a concurrent enhancement of hole carrier density. The new high&#8208;Tc superconducting state in 2H&#8208;TaS2 can be attributed to the change of the electronic states near the Fermi surface, owing to pressure&#8208;induced interlayer modulation. It is the first time finding this remarkable superconducting state in TMDs, which not only brings a new broad of perspective on layered materials but also expands the field of pressure&#8208;modified superconductivity.

         <title>Synergetic Anion Vacancies and Dense Heterointerfaces into Bimetal Chalcogenide Nanosheet Arrays for Boosting Electrocatalysis Sulfur Conversion</title>

Abstract
Vacancy and interface engineering are regarded as effective strategies to modulate the electronic structure and enhance the activity of metal chalcogenide. However, the practical application of metal chalcogenide in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries is limited by their low conductivity, rapid decline in catalytic activity, and large volume variation during discharging/charging process. Herein, bimetal sulfide (CoZn&#8208;S) nanosheet arrays with sulfur vacancies and dense heterointerfaces are proposed to accelerate sulfur conversion and improve the performance of Li&#8208;S batteries. Systematic investigations reveal that sulfur&#8208;vacancy and build&#8208;in interfacial field in CoZn&#8208;S facilitate the electron transfer and regulate the electronic structure. The well&#8208;designed 3D nanosheet array structures short ion&#8208;transport pathway and inhibit the volume fluctuation of CoZn&#8208;S during the electrocatalysis process. Density functional theory studies confirm that the build&#8208;in interfacial field and sulfur vacancy can promote the thermodynamic formation and decomposition of Li2S, thus improve their intrinsic activity.

Abstract
A reliable method for preparing a conformal amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) layer with a thickness of 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level, was tested as a possible Cu diffusion barrier layer for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh density semiconductor device miniaturization. A polystyrene brush of uniform thickness was grafted onto 4&#8208;inch SiO2/Si wafer substrates with &#8220;self&#8208;limiting&#8221; chemistry favoring such a uniform layer. UV crosslinking and subsequent carbonization transformed this polymer film into an ultrathin a&#8208;C layer without pinholes or hillocks. The uniform coating of nonplanar regions or surfaces is also possible. The Cu diffusion &#8220;blocking ability&#8221; was evaluated by time&#8208;dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) tests using a metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (MOS) capacitor structure. A 0.82&#160;nm&#8208;thick a&#8208;C barrier gave TDDB lifetimes 3.3&#215; longer than that obtained using the conventional 1.0&#160;nm&#8208;thick TaNx diffusion barrier. In addition, this exceptionally uniform ultrathin polymer and a&#8208;C film layers hold promise for selective ion permeable membranes, electrically and thermally insulating films in electronics, slits of angstrom&#8208;scale thickness, and when appropriately functionalized, as a robust ultrathin coating with many other potential applications.

         <title>Perovskite Solar Cells Go Bifacial&#8212;Mutual Benefits for Efficiency and Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites are an ideal candidate for fabricating bifacial thin&#8208;film solar cells because of their outstanding optoelectronic properties and unique features of device physics. Bifacial perovskite solar cells hold the potential to simultaneously achieve higher energy yield and longer device stability than their monofacial equivalent, which provides a commercialization path for perovskite photovoltaics in the future.








Abstract
Bifacial solar cells hold the potential to achieve a higher power output per unit area than conventional monofacial devices without significantly increasing manufacturing costs. However, efficient bifacial designs are challenging to implement in inorganic thin&#8208;film solar cells because of their short carrier lifetimes and high rear surface recombination. The emergence of perovskite photovoltaic (PV) technology creates a golden opportunity to realize efficient bifacial thin&#8208;film solar cells, owing to their outstanding optoelectronic properties and unique features of device physics. More importantly, transparent conducting oxide electrodes can prevent electrode corrosion by halide ions, mitigating one major instability issue of the perovskite devices. Here, the theory of bifacial PV devices is summarized and the advantages of bifacial perovskite solar cells, such as high power output, enhanced device durability, and low economic and environmental costs, are reviewed. The limitations and challenges for bifacial perovskite solar cells are also discussed. Finally, the awareness of bifacial solar cells as a feasible commercialization pathway of perovskite PV for mainstream solar power generation and building&#8208;integrated PV is advocated and future research directions are suggested.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Wicking, Breathable, and Intrinsically Antibacterial Electronic Skin Based on Dual&#8208;Gradient Poly(ionic liquid) Nanofiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;gradient poly(ionic liquid) electronic skin with moisture&#8208;wicking, breathable, and antibacterial properties is prepared. Sweat can be delivered to the outside, away from the skin, keeping the electrode&#8208;skin interface dry, ensuring stable and safe collection of bioelectric signals, further enabling real&#8208;time control of a robotic hand. This work provides an unprecedented practical strategy for monitoring and utilization of bioelectrical signals under real conditions.








Abstract
Electronic skin can detect minute electrical potential changes in the human skin and represent the body's state, which is critical for medical diagnostics and human&#8211;computer interface development. On the other hand, sweat has a significant effect on the signal stability, comfort, and safety of electronic skin in a real&#8208;world application. In this study, by modifying the cation and anion of a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) and employing a spinning process, a PIL&#8208;based multilayer nanofiber membrane (PIL membrane) electronic skin with a dual gradient is created. The PIL electronic skin is moisture&#8208;wicking and breathable due to the hydrophilicity and pore size&#8208;gradients. The intrinsically antimicrobial activities of PILs allow the safe collection of bioelectrical signals from the human body, such as electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG). In addition, a robotic hand may be operated in real&#8208;time, and a preliminary human&#8211;computer interface can be accomplished by simple processing of the collected EMG signal. This study establishes a novel practical approach for monitoring and using bioelectrical signals in real&#8208;world circumstances via the multifunctional electronic skin.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Reactive Oxygen Species Amplifier for Enzymatic Cascade Cancer Starvation/Chemodynamic /Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP)&#8208;based smart UCNPs@Cu&#8211;Cys&#8211;GOx (UCCG) nanosystem is designed, which combines natural enzymes and nanozymes so as to in situ amplify reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via an open source and reduce expenditure strategy. Furthermore, the chemodynamic therapy (CDT) process can be monitored in real time by the luminescence intensity of the UCNPs core.








Abstract
At present, some progress has been made in the field of cancer theranostics based on nanocatalysts (NCs), but achieving precise theranostics in response to the specific tumor microenvironment (TME) remains a major challenge. Herein, a TME&#8208;responsive upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;based smart UCNPs@Cu&#8211;Cys&#8211;GOx (UCCG) nanosystem is engineered, which combines natural enzymes and nanozymes so as to amplify reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in situ for cancer starvation/chemodynamic/immunotherapy. One of the biggest merits of this material is that it can be preserved inert (off) in normal tissues, and only in the TME can it be specifically activated (on) through a series of enzymatic cascades to boost ROS production via a strategy of open source (H2O2 self&#8208;supplying ability) and reduce expenditure (glutathione (GSH) consuming ability). More importantly, the enhanced oxidative stress by UCCG NCs reverses the immunosuppressive TME, and facilitates antitumor immune responses. Meanwhile, the starvation/chemodynamic synergistic therapy triggered by UCCG combined with PD&#8208;L1 antibody effectively inhibits the growth of primary tumors and cancer metastasis. In addition, the UCNPs in UCCG present upconversion luminescence enhancement, which can be exploited to visualize the reinforced ROS generation in real time. Collectively, this work provides an original method for the devising and exploitation of UCNPs&#8208;based catalytic immunotherapy.

         <title>Engineering Electronic Band Structure of Binary Thermoelectric Nanocatalysts for Augmented Pyrocatalytic Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance nanosized pyroelectric nanosystems, Bi13S18I2 nanorods, with excellent photothermal conversion and pyroelectric conversion capabilities are rationally engineered for pyroelectric&#8208;dynamic&#8208;therapy&#8208;augmented photonic tumor hyperthermia. The high&#8208;performance pyroelectric nanocatalysts are designed via reconstructing the band structures of canonical binary compounds.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has emerged as a distinct therapeutic modality owing to its noninvasiveness and spatiotemporal selectivity. However, heat&#8208;shock proteins (HSPs) endow tumor cells with resistance to heat&#8208;induced apoptosis, severely lowering the therapeutic efficacy of PTT. Here, a high&#8208;performance pyroelectric nanocatalyst, Bi13S18I2 nanorods (NRs), with prominent pyroelectric conversion and photothermal conversion performance for augmented pyrocatalytic tumor nanotherapy, is developed. Canonical binary compounds are reconstructed by inserting a third biocompatible agent, thus facilitating the formation of Bi13S18I2 NRs with enhanced pyrocatalytic conversion efficiency. Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, Bi13S18I2 NRs induce a conspicuous temperature elevation for photonic hyperthermia. In particular, Bi13S18I2 NRs harvest pyrocatalytic energy from the heating and cooling alterations to produce abundant reactive oxygen species, which results in the depletion of HSPs and hence the reduction of thermoresistance of tumor cells, thereby significantly augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of photothermal tumor hyperthermia. By synergizing the pyroelectric dynamic therapy with PTT, tumor suppression with a significant tumor inhibition rate of 97.2% is achieved after intravenous administration of Bi13S18I2 NRs and subsequent exposure to an 808&#160;nm laser. This work opens an avenue for the design of high&#8208;performance pyroelectric nanocatalysts by reconstructing canonical binary compounds for therapeutic applications in biocatalytic nanomedicine.

Humidity gradients surrounding sweating surfaces can continuously output electric energy when integrated with ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;infused nanofluidics, which is attributed to the nanoconfined IL that integrates van der Waals and electrostatic interactions to block movement of Omim+ clusters while allowing for directional transmembrane diffusion of moisture&#8208;liberated Cl&#8722;.








Abstract
Humidity&#8208;based power generation that converts internal energy of water molecules into electricity is an emerging approach for harvesting clean energy from nature. Here it is proposed that intrinsic gradient within a humidity field near sweating surfaces, such as rivers, soil, or animal skin, is a promising power resource when integrated with liquid&#8208;infused nanofluidics. Specifically, capillary&#8208;stabilized ionic liquid (IL, Omim+Cl&#8208;) film is exposed to the above humidity field to create a sustained transmembrane water&#8208;content difference, which enables asymmetric ion&#8208;diffusion across the nanoconfined fluidics, facilitating long&#8208;term electricity generation with the power density of &#8776;12.11 &#181;W cm&#8208;2. This high record is attributed to the nanoconfined IL that integrates van der Waals and electrostatic interactions to block movement of Omim+ clusters while allowing for directional diffusion of moisture&#8208;liberated Cl+. This humidity gradient triggers large ion&#8208;diffusion flux for power generation indicates great potential of sweating surfaces considering that most of the earth is covered by water or soil.

         <title>Mechanically Durable Memristor Arrays Based on a Discrete Structure Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable memristor with mechanical damage endurance is developed based on a discrete structure design. The discrete&#8208;structure&#8208;based memristor exhibits large stretchability (&#8776;40%) and stable performance under various mechanical deformations. Moreover, the device possesses excellent tolerance against adverse mechanical damage, including puncture and tearing, while retaining reliable functions.








Abstract
Memristors constitute a promising functional component for information storage and in&#8208;memory computing in flexible and stretchable electronics including wearable devices, prosthetics, and soft robotics. Despite tremendous efforts made to adapt conventional rigid memristors to flexible and stretchable scenarios, stretchable and mechanical&#8208;damage&#8208;endurable memristors, which are critical for maintaining reliable functions under unexpected mechanical attack, have never been achieved. Here, the development of stretchable memristors with mechanical damage endurance based on a discrete structure design is reported. The memristors possess large stretchability (40%) and excellent deformability (half&#8208;fold), and retain stable performances under dynamic stretching and releasing. It is shown that the memristors maintain reliable functions and preserve information after extreme mechanical damage, including puncture (up to 100 times) and serious tearing situations (fully diagonally cut). The structural strategy offers new opportunities for next&#8208;generation stretchable memristors with mechanical damage endurance, which is vital to achieve reliable functions for flexible and stretchable electronics even in extreme and highly dynamic environments.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Performance Optoelectronic Skin Based on Intrinsically Stretchable Perovskite&#8208;Polymer Heterojunction Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a surface energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly methodology is developed to form easily transferrable and flexible perovskite quantum dot (PQD) films with a worm&#8208;like morphology. Furthermore, intrinsically stretchable phototransistors (ISTPTs) are fabricated based on an ultra&#8208;flexible photosensitive heterojunction consisting of worm&#8208;like PQD films and polymer semiconductor. The resulting ISTPTs demonstrate highly sensitive respond to high&#8208;energy photons of X&#8208;ray and UV even under 100% tensile strain.








Abstract
The optoelectronic skin is acknowledged as the world's current cutting&#8208;edge technology in the fields of wearable healthcare monitoring, soft robotics, artificial retinas, and so on. However, the difficulty in preparing stretchable photosensitive polymers and the high&#8208;crystallization nature of most reported photosensitive materials (such as perovskites) severely restrict the development of skin&#8208;like optoelectronic devices. Herein, a surface energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly methodology is proposed to form easily transferrable and flexible perovskite quantum dot (PQD) films with a worm&#8208;like morphology. Furthermore, intrinsically stretchable phototransistors (ISTPTs) are fabricated based on a stretchable photosensitive layer heterojunction consisting of worm&#8208;like PQD films and hybrid polymer semiconductors. The obtained ISTPTs display highly sensitive response to high&#8208;energy photons of X&#8208;ray (with a detection limit of 79 nGy s&#8722;1, that is 560 times lower than commercial medical chest X&#8208;ray diagnosis) and ultraviolet (with photosensitivity of 5 &#215; 106 and detectable light intensity of 50 nW cm&#8722;2 among the highest performance of reported photodetectors). In addition, these ISTPTs demonstrate desirable e&#8208;skin characteristics with high strain tolerance, high sensing specificity, high optical transparency, and good skin conformability. The surface energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly methodology for the preparation of ISTPTs is a critical demonstration to enable low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance optoelectronic skins.

         <title>A Universal Approach for Room&#8208;Temperature Printing and Coating of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregated suspensions of 2D materials with high&#8208;enough concentrations can be processed into homogenous gel inks for various printing and coating methods. The stability of the inks, their rheological properties, and film formation behavior mainly depend on their interflake van der Waals interactions, eliminating the need for addition of the conventional additives and enabling their room&#8208;temperature processing.








Abstract
Processing 2D materials into printable or coatable inks for the fabrication of functional devices has proven to be quite difficult. Additives are often used in large concentrations to address the processing challenges, but they drastically degrade the electronic properties of the materials. To remove the additives a high&#8208;temperature post&#8208;deposition treatment can be used, but this complicates the fabrication process and limits the choice of materials (i.e., no heat&#8208;sensitive materials). In this work, by exploiting the unique properties of 2D materials, a universal strategy for the formulation of additive&#8208;free inks is developed, in which the roles of the additives are taken over by van der Waals (vdW) interactions. In this new class of inks, which is termed &#8220;vdW inks&#8221;, solvents are dispersed within the interconnected network of 2D materials, minimizing the dispersibility&#8208;related limitations on solvent selection. Furthermore, flow behavior of the inks and mechanical properties of the resultant films are mainly controlled by the interflake vdW attractions. The structure of the vdW inks, their rheological properties, and film&#8208;formation behavior are discussed in detail. Large&#8208;scale production and formulation of the vdW inks for major high&#8208;throughput printing and coating methods, as well as their application for room&#8208;temperature fabrication of functional films/devices are demonstrated.

         <title>A Tissue&#8208;Like Soft All&#8208;Hydrogel Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;hydrogel batteries with Young's moduli of 80&#160;kPa are designed to match the mechanical properties of the skin and the heart. They exhibit a high specific capacity of 370 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintains stability during dynamic deformation. High stability and biocompatibility are realized on the skin and in vivo, so these all&#8208;hydrogel batteries are an ideal power supply for wearable and implantable bioelectronics.








Abstract
To develop wearable and implantable bioelectronics accommodating the dynamic and uneven biological tissues and reducing undesired immune responses, it is critical to adopt batteries with matched mechanical properties with tissues as power sources. However, the batteries available cannot reach the softness of tissues due to the high Young's moduli of components (e.g., metals, carbon materials, conductive polymers, or composite materials). The fabrication of tissue&#8208;like soft batteries thus remains a challenge. Here, the first ultrasoft batteries totally based on hydrogels are reported. The ultrasoft batteries exhibit Young's moduli of 80&#160;kPa, perfectly matching skin and organs (e.g., heart). The high specific capacities of 82 mAh g&#8722;1 in all&#8208;hydrogel lithium&#8208;ion batteries and 370 mAh g&#8722;1 in all&#8208;hydrogel zinc&#8208;ion batteries at a current density of 0.5 A g&#8722;1 are achieved. Both high stability and biocompatibility of the all&#8208;hydrogel batteries have been demonstrated upon the applications of wearable and implantable. This work illuminates a pathway for designing power sources for wearable and implantable electronics with matched mechanical properties.

The high specific capacities of 82 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in all-hydrogel lithium-ion batteries and 370 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in all-hydrogel zinc-ion batteries at a current density of 0.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved. Both high stability and biocompatibility of the all-hydrogel batteries have been demonstrated upon the applications of wearable and implantable. This work illuminates a pathway for designing power sources for wearable and implantable electronics with matched mechanical properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chlorination Enabling a Low&#8208;Cost Benzodithiophene&#8208;Based Wide&#8208;Bandgap Donor Polymer with an Efficiency of over 17%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three D&#8211;D type wide&#8208;bandgap donor polymers (PBDTT, PBDTT1Cl, and PBDTT2Cl) are designed and facilely synthesized. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PBDTT1Cl exhibit a high power conversion efficiency of 17% and a low nonradiative energy loss of 0.19&#160;eV. In addition, PBDTT1Cl has a very low figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit and good universality, indicating its potential as a low&#8208;cost polymer donor for high&#8208;performance OSCs.








Abstract
Three regioregular benzodithiophene&#8208;based donor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;D)&#8208;type polymers (PBDTT, PBDTT1Cl, and PBDTT2Cl) are designed, synthesized, and used as donor materials in organic solar cells (OSCs). Because of the weak intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer effect, these polymers exhibit large optical bandgaps (&gt;2.0&#160;eV). Among these three polymers, PBDTT1Cl exhibits more ordered and closer molecular stacking, and its devices demonstrate higher and more balanced charge mobilities and a longer charge&#8208;separated state lifetime. As a result of these comprehensive benefits, PBDTT1Cl&#8208;based OSCs give a very impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.10% with a low nonradiative energy loss (0.19&#160;eV). Moreover, PBDTT1Cl also possesses a low figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value and good universality to match with different acceptors. This work provides a simply and efficient strategy to design low&#8208;cost high&#8208;performance polymer donor materials.

         <title>Efficient Tandem Quantum&#8208;Dot LEDs Enabled by An Inorganic Semiconductor&#8208;Metal&#8208;Dielectric Interconnecting Layer Stack</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient interconnecting layers (ICLs) are reported consisting of multifunctional inorganic semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric stack, which enables the resultant tandem quantum dot light emitting diodes (QLEDs) with double junction to achieve a record efficiency, with the EQEs of 40% for red, 49% for yellow, 50% for green, and 24% for blue.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) in a tandem configuration offer a strategy to realize high&#8208;performance, multicolor devices. Until now, though, the efficiency of tandem colloidal quantum dot LEDs (QLEDs) has been limited due to unpassivated interfaces and solvent damage originating from the materials processing requirements of interconnecting layers (ICLs). Here an ICL is reported consisting of a semiconductor&#8208;metal&#8208;dielectric stack that provides facile fabrication, materials stability, and good optoelectronic coupling. It is investigated experimentally how the ICL enables charge balance, suppresses current leakage, and prevents solvent damage to the underlying layers. As a result record efficiencies are reported for double&#8208;junction tandem QLEDs, whose emission wavelengths cover from blue to red light; i.e., external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 40% (average 37+/&#8722;2%) for red, 49% (average 45+/&#8722;2%) for yellow, 50% (average 46+/&#8722;2%) for green, and 24% (average 21+/&#8722;2%) for blue are achieved.

         <title>Tailoring Interlayer Spacers for Efficient and Stable Formamidinium&#8208;Based Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the flexible monovalent spacer cations are introduced into the formamidinium&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional perovskite, which effectively alleviates lattice distortion and reduce crystal defects. The resultant perovskite films possess desirable microscopic morphology, preferable crystal orientation, reduced defect states, and improved charge transport capability, which delivers highly efficient and thermostable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskite solar cells generally show mediocre device performances as they are restrained by their defective film quality. The rigid diammonium organic interlayer spacers are intolerant to lattice mismatches, which induces defects and distortions and ultimately deteriorates the optoelectronic properties. Herein, a secondary interlayer spacer is introduced into formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional perovskite, which substantially improves the film quality. The flexible monovalent spacer cations effectively alleviate lattice distortions and reduce crystal defects, providing perovskite films with desirable microscopic morphology, preferable crystal orientation, reduced defect states, and improved charge transport capability. As a result, the optimized perovskite solar cell based on the (PDA0.9PA0.2)(FA)3Pb4I13 (PDA = propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium, PA = propylammonium) film exhibits the exceptional power conversion efficiency of 16.0%, the highest reported value in its class. In addition, the device demonstrates the enhanced thermal stability, retaining 90% of its initial efficiency after aging at 85&#160;&#176;C for 800 h.

         <title>An Annealing Accelerator for Ising Spin Systems Based on In&#8208;Memory Complementary 2D FETs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy&#8208; and area&#8208;efficient hardware acceleration of simulated annealing for the Ising spin system is achieved by exploiting subthreshold conduction and programmability of 2D field&#8208;effect transistors based on p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2. Search acceleration of &gt;800&#215; for 4 &#215; 4 ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and spin glass systems is demonstrated with a miniscule energy dissipation of &#8776;120 nJ.








Abstract
Metaheuristic algorithms such as simulated annealing (SA) are often implemented for optimization in combinatorial problems, especially for discreet problems. SA employs a stochastic search, where high&#8208;energy transitions (&#8220;hill&#8208;climbing&#8221;) are allowed with a temperature&#8208;dependent probability to escape local optima. Ising spin glass systems have properties such as spin disorder and &#8220;frustration&#8221; and provide a discreet combinatorial problem with a high number of metastable states and ground&#8208;state degeneracy. In this work, subthreshold Boltzmann transport is exploited in complementary 2D field&#8208;effect transistors (p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2) integrated with an analog, nonvolatile, and programmable floating&#8208;gate memory stack to develop in&#8208;memory computing primitives necessary for energy&#8208; and area&#8208;efficient hardware acceleration of SA for Ising spin systems. Search acceleration of &gt;800&#215; is demonstrated for 4 &#215; 4 ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and spin glass systems using SA compared to an exhaustive search using a brute force trial at miniscule total energy expenditure of &#8776;120 nJ. The hardware&#8208;realistic numerical simulations further highlight the astounding benefits of SA in accelerating the search for larger spin lattices.

         <title>Anionic Redox Regulated via Metal&#8211;Ligand Combinations in Layered Sulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodes utilizing anionic redox chemistry have higher energy density, but are still accompanied by reversibility problems. In this work, by regulating metal&#8211;ligand combinations, it is found that strong covalency between cations and anions can stabilize holes, and grants the cathode with better electron conductivity, prevents irreversible anion dimerization and cation migration, and thus restrains voltage hysteresis and voltage decay issues.








Abstract
The increasing demand for energy storage is calling for improvements in cathode performance. In traditional layered cathodes, the higher energy of the metal 3d over the O 2p orbital results in one&#8208;band cationic redox; capacity solely from cations cannot meet the needs for higher energy density. Emerging anionic redox chemistry is promising to access higher capacity. In recent studies, the low&#8208;lying O nonbonding 2p orbital was&#160;designed to activate one&#8208;band oxygen redox, but they are still accompanied by reversibility problems like oxygen loss, irreversible cation migration, and voltage decay. Herein, by regulating the metal&#8211;ligand energy level, both extra capacities provided by anionic redox and highly reversible anionic redox process are realized in NaCr1&#8722;yVyS2 system. The simultaneous cationic and anionic redox of Cr/V and S is observed by in situ X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Under high d&#8211;p hybridization, the strong covalent interaction stabilizes the holes on the anions, prevents irreversible dimerization and cation migration, and restrains voltage hysteresis and voltage decay. The work provides a fundamental understanding of highly reversible anionic redox in layered compounds, and demonstrates the feasibility of anionic redox chemistry based on hybridized bands with d&#8211;p covalence.

         <title>Multicolor Photonic Pigments for Rotation&#8208;Asymmetric Mechanochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multicolor photonic pigment is developed by magnetically assembling Fe3O4 nanorods and fixing the resulting tetragonal photonic crystals. Its dynamic color tuning and precise orientational control enable the convenient printing of structural&#8208;colored patterns and the design of rotation&#8208;asymmetric photonic devices.








Abstract
Photonic crystals are extensively explored to replace inorganic pigments and organic dyes as coloring elements in printing, painting, sensing, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting due to their brilliant structural colors, chemical stability, and environmental friendliness. However, most existing photonic&#8208;crystal&#8208;based pigments can only display monochromatic colors once made, and generating multicolors has to start with designing different building blocks. Here, a novel photonic pigment featuring highly tunable structural colors in the entire visible spectrum, made by the magnetic assembly of monodisperse nanorods into body&#8208;centered&#8208;tetragonal photonic crystals, is reported. Their prominent magnetic and crystal anisotropy makes it efficient to generate multicolors using one photonic pigment by magnetically controlling the crystal orientation. Further, the combination of angle&#8208;dependent diffraction and magnetic orientation control enables the design of rotation&#8208;asymmetric photonic films that display distinct patterns and encrypted information in response to rotation. The efficient multicolor generation through precise orientational control makes this novel photonic pigment promising in developing high&#8208;performance structural&#8208;colored materials and optical devices.

         <title>Preparation of fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Heterophase Pd@Ir Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd@Ir core&#8211;shell nanostructures with fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc heterophase and different Pd/Ir atomic ratios are prepared via seeded phase&#8208;selective epitaxial growth. The fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc&#8208;heterophase Pd45@Ir55 nanodendrites exhibit superior catalytic performance toward electrochemical hydrogen evolution. This work offers new opportunities toward the rational synthesis of novel heterophase nanostructures and paves a way to the phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) for various promising applications.








Abstract
With the development of phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN), construction of noble&#8208;metal heterostructures with unconventional crystal phases, including heterophases, has been proposed as an attractive approach toward the rational design of highly efficient catalysts. However, it still remains challenging to realize the controlled preparation of such unconventional&#8208;phase noble&#8208;metal heterostructures and explore their crystal&#8208;phase&#8208;dependent applications. Here, various Pd@Ir core&#8211;shell nanostructures are synthesized with unconventional fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc heterophase (2H: hexagonal close&#8208;packed; fcc: face&#8208;centered cubic) through a wet&#8208;chemical seeded method. As a result, heterophase Pd66@Ir34 nanoparticles, Pd45@Ir55 multibranched nanodendrites, and Pd68@Ir22Co10 trimetallic nanoparticles are obtained via the phase&#8208;selective epitaxial growth of fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc&#8208;heterophase Ir&#8208;based nanostructures on 2H&#8208;Pd seeds. Importantly, the heterophase Pd45@Ir55 nanodendrites exhibit excellent catalytic performance toward electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions. An overpotential of only 11.0&#160;mV is required to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 on Pd45@Ir55 nanodendrites, which is lower than those of the conventional fcc&#8208;Pd47@Ir53 counterparts, commercial Ir/C and Pt/C. This work not only demonstrates an appealing route to synthesize novel heterophase nanomaterials for promising applications in the emerging field of PEN, but also highlights the significant role of the crystal phase in determining their catalytic properties.

         <title>Programmable Zwitterionic Droplets as Biomolecular Sorters and Model of Membraneless Organelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to produce programmable liquid droplets via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of associative synthetic polymers is presented. Starting from zwitterionic polymers as reference, different functional groups able to encode multiple intermolecular interactions are introduced in the polymer. In this way, it is possible to simultaneously control multiple mesoscopic properties of the droplets, opening attractive applications in bioseparation and diagnostics.








Abstract
Increasing evidence indicates that cells can regulate biochemical functions in time and space by generating membraneless compartments with well&#8208;defined mesoscopic properties. One important mechanism underlying this control is simple coacervation driven by associative disordered proteins that encode multivalent interactions. Inspired by these observations, programmable droplets based on simple coacervation of responsive synthetic polymers that mimic the &#8220;stickers&#8208;and&#8208;spacers&#8221; architecture of biological disordered proteins are developed. Zwitterionic polymers that undergo an enthalpy&#8208;driven liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation process and form liquid droplets that remarkably exclude most molecules are developed. Starting from this reference material, different functional groups in the zwitterionic polymer are progressively added to encode an increasing number of different intermolecular interactions. This strategy allowed the multiple emerging properties of the droplets to be controlled independently, such as stimulus&#8208;responsiveness, polarity, selective uptake of client molecules, fusion times, and miscibility. By exploiting this high programmability, a model of cellular compartmentalization is reproduced and droplets capable of confining different molecules in space without physical barriers are generated. Moreover, these biomolecular sorters are demonstrated to be able to localize, separate, and enable the detection of target molecules even within complex mixtures, opening attractive applications in bioseparation, and diagnostics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomerization of transition metal aqua ions inside electrified carbon micropores is observed using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The cations associate together via hydroxo bridging under the synergy of confinement and negative charging. The resulting ionic oligomers have sluggish dissociation kinetics and accumulate upon cycling, leading to capacitance fading of supercapacitors. Positive charging destructs them and revivifies the capaictance.








Abstract
Ion adsorption inside electrified carbon micropores is pivotal for the operation of supercapacitors. Depending on the electrolyte, two main mechanisms have been identified so far, the desolvation of ions in solvents and the formation of superionic states in ionic liquids. Here, it is shown that upon confinement inside negatively charged micropores, transition&#8208;metal cations dissolved in water associate to form oligomer species. They are identified using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The cations associate one with each other via hydroxo bridging, forming ionic oligomers under the synergic effect of spatial confinement and Coulombic screening. The oligomers display sluggish dissociation kinetics and accumulate upon cycling, which leads to supercapacitor capacitance fading. They may be dissolved by applying a positive potential, so an intermittent reverse cycling strategy is proposed to periodically evacuate micropores and revivify the capacitance. These results reveal new insights into ion adsorption and structural evolution with their effects on the electrochemical performance, providing guidelines for designing advanced supercapacitors.

         <title>MIL&#8208;96&#8208;Al for Li&#8211;S Batteries: Shape or Size?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MIL&#8208;96&#8208;Al crystals with hexagonal platelet crystal (HPC), hexagonal bipyramidal crystal (HBC), and hexagonal prismatic bipyramidal crystal (HPBC) shapes are successfully prepared by co&#8208;solvent methods. Moreover, by changing the ratio of the cosolvent, different sizes of the HBC shape are prepared. These MIL&#8208;96 crystals are used as sulfur hosts to investigate their ability to suppress the shuttle effect in Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with controllable shapes and sizes show a great potential in Li&#8211;S batteries. However, neither the relationship between shape and specific capacity nor the influence of MOF particle size on cyclic stability have been fully established yet. Herein, MIL&#8208;96&#8208;Al with various shapes, forming hexagonal platelet crystals (HPC), hexagonal bipyramidal crystals (HBC), and hexagonal prismatic bipyramidal crystals (HPBC) are successfully prepared via cosolvent methods. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the HBC shape with highly exposed (101) planes can effectively adsorb lithium polysulfides (LPS) during the charge/discharge process. By changing the relative proportion of the cosolvents, HBC samples with different particle sizes are prepared. When these MIL&#8208;96&#8208;Al crystals are used as sulfur host materials, it is found that those with a smaller size of the HBC shape deliver higher initial capacity. These investigations establish that different crystal planes have different adsorption abilities for LPS, and that the MOF particle size should be considered for a suitable sulfur host. More broadly, this work provides a strategy for designing sulfur hosts in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Biodegradable Polymer with Effective Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Absorption as a Photothermal Agent for Deep Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable photothermal agent is developed by inserting cleavable disulfide moieties into a conjugative polymer, which affords biodegradability and excellent adsorption in both the near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II windows, effectively inhibits tumor progression, and extends survival spans in a deep&#8208;seated ovarian cancer mouse model.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy holds great promise for cancer treatment due to its effective tumor ablation and minimal invasiveness. Herein a new class of biodegradable photothermal agents with effective adsorption in both near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) and NIR&#8208;II windows is reported for deep tumor therapy. As demonstrated in a deep&#8208;seated ovarian cancer model, photothermal therapy using 1064&#160;nm irradiation effectively inhibits tumor progression and prolongs survival spans. This work provides a new design of photothermal agents toward a more effective therapy of tumors.

         <title>Controlled Deposition of Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes via Selectively Polarized Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin ferroelectric polymer (poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE))) film is constructed on a zinc&#8208;metal anode as a surface protective layer. After selective polarization, such a protective layer could enable a locally concentrated zinc&#8208;ion distribution along the coated surface, and thus induce zinc to grow into horizontally aligned plates. Highly stable zinc batteries are achieved via such modified zinc anodes.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as ideal candidates for stationary energy&#8208;storage systems due to their low cost and high safety. However, zinc can readily grow into dendrites, leading to limited cycling performance and quick failure of the batteries. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to mitigate this dendrite problem, in which a selectively polarized ferroelectric polymer material (poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE))) is employed as a surface protective layer on zinc anodes. Such a polarized ferroelectric polymer layer can enable a locally concentrated zinc&#8208;ion distribution along the coated surface and thus enable the horizontal growth of zinc plates. As a result, symmetrical zinc batteries using such anodes exhibit long cycling lifespan at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 0.2 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 2000 h, and a high rate performance up to 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Also, the full cell (including a Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery and a zinc&#8208;ion capacitor) based on this anode is demonstrated. This work provides a novel strategy to protect the zinc anode and even other metal anodes exploiting polymer ferroelectricity.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Switchable Laser via Optical Pumping of Rubrene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and operation of a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind magnetically switchable laser is reported. The dependence of singlet&#8208;exciton fission on magnetic field is exploited to drive the gain medium below and above the lasing threshold using an external magnetic field. Magnetic switching results in a +360% modulation in output intensity, the largest magnetically induced change in brightness from a singlet&#8208;fission system to date.








Abstract
Volumetric optical imaging of magnetic fields is challenging with existing magneto&#8208;optical materials, motivating the search for dyes with strong magnetic field interactions, distinct emission spectra, and an ability to withstand high photon flux and incorporation within samples. Here, the magnetic field effect on singlet&#8208;exciton fission is exploited to demonstrate spatial imaging of magnetic fields in a thin film of rubrene. Doping rubrene with the high&#8208;quantum yield dye dibenzotetraphenylperiflanthene (DBP) is shown to enable optically pumped, slab waveguide lasing. This laser is magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;switchable: when operated just below the lasing threshold, application of a 0.4 T magnetic field switches the device between nonlasing and lasing modes, accompanied by an intensity modulation of +360%. This is thought to be the first demonstration of a magnetically switchable laser, as well as the largest magnetically induced change in emission brightness in a singlet&#8208;fission material to date. These results demonstrate that singlet&#8208;fission materials are promising materials for magnetic sensing applications and could inspire a new class of magneto&#8208;optical modulators.

         <title>Small&#8208;Dipole&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Containing Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three kinds of small&#8208;dipole&#8208;molecule&#8208;containing electrolytes are developed for aqueous batteries. The developed electrolytes deliver an expanded electrochemical stability window (over 2.5&#160;V), and their solvation&#8208;sheath structure and ion conductivity mechanism are explored. A constructed Li4Ti5O12//LiMn2O4 battery in a glycerol&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibits high output voltage (2.45&#160;V) and a specific capacity of 119.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage aqueous rechargeable batteries are promising competitors for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems with safety and high specific energy, but they are limited by the absence of low&#8208;cost aqueous electrolytes with a wide electrochemical stability window (ESW). The decomposition of aqueous electrolytes is mainly facilitated by the hydrogen bond network between water molecules and the water molecules in the solvation sheath. Here, three types of small dipole molecules (small molecules containing a dipole; glycerol (Gly), erythritol (Et), and acrylamide (AM)) are reported to develop aqueous electrolytes with high safety and wide ESW (over 2.5&#160;V) for aqueous lithium&#8208;, sodium&#8208;, and zinc&#8208;ion batteries, respectively. The solvation&#8208;sheath structures are explored by ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, demonstrating that three types of dipole molecules deplete the water molecules in the solvation sheath of the charge carrier and break the hydrogen bond network between the water molecules, thus effectively expanding the ESW. A battery constructed from lithium titanate and lithium manganate in Gly&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibits an output voltage of 2.45&#160;V and retains a specific capacity of 119.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles. This work provides another strategy for exploiting low&#8208;cost high&#8208;voltage electrolytes for aqueous energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Bright and Stable Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedently bright, efficient, and stable quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are presented by multilateral approaches, including appropriate modification of the QD structure and optimization of the device architecture, via resolving heat&#8208;related degradation, enhancing light&#8208;outcoupling, and controlling the excitonic states precisely, which expands the applications of QLEDs as a light source.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation displays and lighting sources, but they are barely used because vulnerability to electrical and thermal stresses precludes high brightness, efficiency, and stability at high current density (J) regimes. Here, bright and stable QLEDs on a Si substrate are demonstrated, expanding their potential application boundary over the present art. First, a tailored interface is granted to the quantum dots, maximizing the quantum yield and mitigating nonradiative Auger decay of the multiexcitons generated at high&#8208;J regimes. Second, a heat&#8208;endurable, top&#8208;emission device architecture is employed and optimized based on optical simulation to enhance the light outcoupling efficiency. The multilateral approaches realize that the red top&#8208;emitting QLEDs exhibit a maximum luminance of 3&#160;300&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, a current efficiency of 75.6&#160;cd A&#8722;1, and an operational lifetime of 125&#160;000&#160;000 h at an initial brightness of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which are the highest of the values reported so far.

         <title>Influence of Molecular Weight on the Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance of Ladder&#8208;Type Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
n&#8208;Type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) underperform compared to p&#8208;type OECTs. By tuning the molecular weight of the rigid ladder&#8208;type poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline), n&#8208;type OECTs with record&#8208;high figures of merit are reported. OECT&#8208;based complementary inverters are also demonstrated with high voltage gains of up to 100&#160;V V&#8722;1 and ultralow power consumption down to 0.32 nW, depending on the supply voltage.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) hold promise for developing a variety of high&#8208;performance (bio&#8208;)electronic devices/circuits. While OECTs based on p&#8208;type semiconductors have achieved tremendous progress in recent years, n&#8208;type OECTs still suffer from low performance, hampering the development of power&#8208;efficient electronics. Here, it is demonstrated that fine&#8208;tuning the molecular weight of the rigid, ladder&#8208;type n&#8208;type polymer poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) by only one order of magnitude (from 4.9 to 51&#160;kDa) enables the development of n&#8208;type OECTs with record&#8208;high geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm&#160;&#8776; 11 S cm&#8722;1) and electron mobility &#215; volumetric capacitance (&#181;C* &#8776; 26 F cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), fast temporal response (0.38&#160;ms), and low threshold voltage (0.15&#160;V). This enhancement in OECT performance is ascribed to a more efficient intermolecular charge transport in high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight BBL than in the low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight counterpart. OECT&#8208;based complementary inverters are also demonstrated with record&#8208;high voltage gains of up to 100&#160;V V&#8722;1 and ultralow power consumption down to 0.32 nW, depending on the supply voltage. These devices are among the best sub&#8208;1 V&#160;complementary inverters reported to date. These findings demonstrate the importance of molecular weight in optimizing the OECT performance of rigid organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors and open for a new generation of power&#8208;efficient organic (bio&#8208;)electronic devices.

         <title>Nanostructure Control in 3D Printed Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation is applied to 3D printing using a robust and rapid photoinitiated RAFT polymerization process. The resulting materials display sub&#8208;10&#160;nm features that are controllable through the choice of resin components and provide enhanced mechanical properties. This process is a new highly accessible route to nanoscale structured materials.








Abstract
Currently, there are no straightforward methods to 3D print materials with nanoscale control over morphological and functional properties. Here, a novel approach for the fabrication of materials with controlled nanoscale morphologies using a rapid and commercially available Digital Light Processing 3D printing technique is demonstrated. This process exploits reversible deactivation radical polymerization to control the in&#8208;situ&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation of 3D printing resins, which provides materials with complex architectures controllable from the macro&#8208; to nanoscale, resulting in the preparation of materials with enhanced mechanical properties. This method does not require specialized equipment or process conditions and thus represents an important development in the production of advanced materials via additive manufacturing.

The use of 18O2 verifies the proposed theoretical reaction path: conversion of NO3&#8722; to NO2+ followed by adsorption on MgO, causing significant weakening of CO2 adsorption strength and formation of [Mg2+&#8230; O2&#8722;] ion pairs. This prevents the presence of impermeable MgCO3 shell which increases the rate of MgO carbonation to a significantly greater extent compared to the unpromoted MgO.








Abstract
The optimization of MgO&#8208;based adsorbents as advanced CO2&#8208;capture materials is predominantly focused on their molten&#8208;salt modification, for which theoretical and experimental contributions provide great insights for their high CO2&#8208;capture performance. The underlying mechanism of the promotion effect of the molten salt on CO2 capture, however, is a topic of controversy. Herein, advanced experimental characterization techniques, including in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (eTEM) and CO2 chemisorption by diffuse&#8208;reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), transient 18O&#8208;isotopic exchange, and density functional theory (DFT), are employed to elucidate the mechanism of the CO2 interaction with molten&#8208;salt&#8208;modified MgO in the 250&#8211;400&#160;&#176;C range. Herein, eTEM studies using low (2&#8211;3 mbar) and high (700 mbar) CO2 pressures illustrate the dynamic evolution of the molten NaNO3 salt promoted and unpromoted MgO carbonation with high magnification (&lt;50&#160;nm). The formation of 18O&#8208;NaNO3 (use of 18O2) and C16O18O following CO2 interaction, verifies the proposed reaction path: conversion of NO3&#8722; (NO3&#8722;&#160;&#8594; NO2+&#160;+ O2&#8211;), adsorption of NO2+ on MgO with significant weakening of CO2 adsorption strength, and formation of [Mg2+&#8230; O2&#8722;] ion pairs preventing the development of an impermeable MgCO3 shell, which largely increases the rate of bulk MgO carbonation.

         <title>Suppressing the Step Effect of 3D Printing for Constructing Contact Lenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous liquid film confined 3D printing strategy is exploited to eliminate the step effect. Reutilization and good control of the liquid residual can improve the printing fidelity and avoid a post&#8208;washing process. Based on this strategy, a centimeter&#8208;scale contact lens structure with nanoscale roughness and high&#8208;definition imaging can be 3D printed, indicating its great potential in scalable 3D printing optical structures.








Abstract
3D printing has been considered as a sustainable method to construct complicated 3D structures. However, the step effect induced by the traditional point&#8208;by&#8208;point or layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer additive manufacturing mode inevitably occurs and remains an obstacle to realizing the smoothness and uniformity of 3D samples. Here, a continuous liquid film confined 3D printing strategy is proposed to fabricate high&#8208;precision 3D structures based on the Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology. With the control of the confinement of the liquid&#8211;solid interface and the continuous printing mode, liquid film adhering to the cured structure is sucked into the cured layer structures with excess resin adhering to the cured structure scraping off, where the step effect is eliminated and post&#8208;washing is avoided. The morphology and dimension of the confined liquid film can be well regulated by ink properties and printing parameters to optimize the surface smoothness and printing fidelity. In addition, heat accumulation and thermal diffusion are also suppressed, ensuring the long&#8208;term printing stability. A centimeter&#8208;scale contact lens structure with central thickness of &#8776;135&#160;&#181;m comparable to commercial ones can be printed, which possesses extreme smoothness (sub 1.3&#160;nm), homogeneous mechanical characteristic, biocompatibility, and high optical properties with imaging resolution of up to 228.1 lp mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Multiscale Understanding of Surface Structural Effects on High&#8208;Temperature Operational Resiliency of Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature calendar aging and thermal runaway have led to severe performance decay and safety concerns regarding battery cathodes. By using a combination of various in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray and electron microscopy techniques, a multiscale understanding of surface structure effects in regulating the high&#8208;temperature operational resilience of polycrystalline Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes is reported.








Abstract
The worldwide energy demand in electric vehicles and the increasing global temperature have called for development of high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with improved high&#8208;temperature operational resiliency. However, current attention has been mostly focused on cycling aging at elevated temperature, leaving considerable gaps of knowledge in the failure mechanism, and practical control of abusive calendar aging and thermal runaway that are highly related to the eventual operational lifetime and safety performance of LIBs. Herein, using a combination of various in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray and electron microscopy techniques, a multiscale understanding of surface structure effects involved in regulating the high&#8208;temperature operational tolerance of polycrystalline Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes is reported. The results collectively show that an ultraconformal poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) coating can effectively prevent a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode from undergoing undesired phase transformation and transition metal dissolution on the surface, atomic displacement, and dislocations within primary particles, intergranular cracking along the grain boundaries within secondary particles, and intensive bulk oxygen release during high state&#8208;of&#8208;charge and high&#8208;temperature aging. The present work highlights the essential role of surface structure controls in overcoming the multiscale degradation pathways of high&#8208;energy battery materials at extreme temperature.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Imaging of Highly Curved Membrane Structures in Giant Vesicles Encapsulating Molecular Condensates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular crowding is inherent to cell interiors. Giant vesicles encapsulating aqueous polymer solutions mimic macromolecular condensation in cells. Upon liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation, membrane nanotubes and apparent kinks at the two&#8208;phase interface form. Resolving these highly curved structures with super&#8208;resolution microscopy reveals the membrane spontaneous curvature and the intrinsic contact angle describing the wettability contrast of different phases to the membrane.








Abstract
Molecular crowding is an inherent feature of cell interiors. Synthetic cells as provided by giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) encapsulating macromolecules (poly(ethylene glycol) and dextran) represent an excellent mimetic system to study membrane transformations associated with molecular crowding and protein condensation. Similarly to cells, such GUVs exhibit highly curved structures like nanotubes. Upon liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation their membrane deforms into apparent kinks at the contact line of the interface between the two aqueous phases. These structures, nanotubes, and kinks, have dimensions below optical resolution. Here, these are studied with super&#8208;resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy facilitated by immobilization in a microfluidic device. The cylindrical nature of the nanotubes based on the superior resolution of STED and automated data analysis is demonstrated. The deduced membrane spontaneous curvature is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Furthermore, the membrane kink&#8208;like structure is resolved as a smoothly curved membrane demonstrating the existence of the intrinsic contact angle, which describes the wettability contrast of the encapsulated phases to the membrane. Resolving these highly curved membrane structures with STED imaging provides important insights in the membrane properties and interactions underlying cellular activities.

The emerging Ni&#8208;based infinite&#8208;layer superconducting oxide thin films mark the birth of the Ni age of superconductivity, which may differ from well&#8208;known high&#8208;temperature superconducting cuprates and Fe&#8208;based superconductors because no magnetic order is known in their bulk parent compounds. However, it has now been surprisingly discovered that long&#8208;range antiferromagnetism coexists with superconductivity in infinite&#8208;layer nickelate thin films.








Abstract
Due to the lack of any magnetic order down to 1.7 K in the parent bulk compound NdNiO2, the recently discovered 9&#8211;15 K superconductivity in the infinite&#8208;layer Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 thin films has provided an exciting playground for unearthing new superconductivity mechanisms. Herein, the successful synthesis of a series of superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 thin films ranging from 8 to 40&#160;nm is reported. The large exchange bias effect is observed between the superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 films and a thin ferromagnetic layer, which suggests the existence of the antiferromagnetic order. Furthermore, the existence of the antiferromagnetic order is evidenced by X&#8208;ray magnetic linear dichroism measurements. These experimental results are fundamentally critical for the current field.

         <title>Construction of Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 Heterostructures by Stepwise Topochemical Pathways for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 heterostructures are constructed by a stepwise topochemical method from a Hofmann&#8208;type coordination polymer precursor. The heterostructure is formed by growing NiSe2 nanocrystals preferentially on the edges of each Ni(CN)2 nanoplate. Benefitting from the synergy of two components, the formed Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 heterostructure catalyst manifests improves electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Exploiting effective electrocatalysts based on elaborate heterostructures for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has been considered as a promising strategy for boosting water splitting efficiency to produce the clean&#160;energy&#8212;hydrogen. However, constructing catalytically active heterostructures with novel composition and architecture remains poorly developed due to the synthetic challenge. In this work, it is demonstrated that unique Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 heterostructures, composed of single&#8208;crystalline Ni(CN)2 nanoplates surrounded by crystallographically aligned NiSe2 nanosatellites, can be created from nickel&#8208;based Hofmann&#8208;type coordination polymers through stepwise topochemical pathways. When employed as the OER electrocatalyst, the Ni(CN)2/NiSe2 heterostructures show enhanced performance, which could be attributed to optimized geometric and electronic structures of the catalytic sites endowed by the synergy between the two components. This work demonstrates a rational synthetic route for creating a novel Ni&#8208;based OER electrocatalyst that possesses nanoscale heterostructure, whose composition, spatial organization, and interface configuration can be finely manipulated.

         <title>Ultrahigh Sensitive Au&#8208;Doped Silicon Nanomembrane Based Wearable Sensor Arrays for Continuous Skin Temperature Monitoring with High Precision</title>

         <dc:description>
Thermal monitoring of the human body with high accuracy provides a fast, facile, but powerful route in a wide range of health information standards. Ultrasensitive, and stretchable Au&#8208;doped silicon nanomembrane (SiNM) epidermal temperature sensor array achieved by property modulations of SiNM with the development of a novel gold&#8208;doping strategy offers a general foundation for continuous monitoring of human body temperature.








Abstract
Monitoring the body temperature with high accuracy provides a fast, facile, yet powerful route about the human body in a wide range of health information standards. Here, the first ever ultrasensitive and stretchable gold&#8208;doped silicon nanomembrane (Au&#8208;doped SiNM) epidermal temperature sensor array is introduced. The ultrasensitivity is achieved by shifting freeze&#8208;out region to intrinsic region in carrier density and modulation of fermi energy level of p&#8208;type SiNM through the development of a novel gold&#8208;doping strategy. The Au&#8208;doped SiNM is readily transferred onto an ultrathin polymer layer with a well&#8208;designed serpentine mesh structure, capable of being utilized as an epidermal temperature sensor array. Measurements in vivo and in vitro show temperature coefficient of resistance as high as &#8722;37270.72 ppm &#176;C&#8722;1,&#160;22&#160;times higher than existing metal&#8208;based temperature sensors with similar structures, and one of the highest thermal sensitivity among the inorganic material based temperature sensors. Applications in the continuous monitoring of body temperature and respiration rate during exercising are demonstrated with a successful capture of information. This work lays a foundation for monitoring body temperature, potentially useful for precision diagnosis (e.g., continuous monitoring body temperature in coronavirus disease 2019 cases) and management of disease relevance to body temperature in healthcare.

         <title>Lattice Orientation Heredity in the Transformation of 2D Epitaxial Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice orientation heredity is shown to be a universal strategy in the transformation of highly oriented 2D van der Waals layered and nonlayered thin films. Different from the classical and direct epitaxial deposition, this process is developed based on the heredity phenomena in material science. It opens a new window for growing textured films on disordered substrates (e.g., GaN&#8208;related technology), and provides an effective route for large&#8208;area growth of epitaxial 2D MoS2 thin films.








Abstract
The ability to control lattice orientation is often an essential requirement in the growth of both 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered and nonlayered thin films. Here, a unique and universal phenomenon termed &#8220;lattice orientation heredity&#8221; (LOH) is reported. LOH enables product films (including 2D&#8208;layered materials) to inherit the lattice orientation from reactant films in a chemical conversion process, excluding the requirement on the substrate lattice order. The process universality is demonstrated by investigating the lattice transformations in the carbonization, nitridation, and sulfurization of epitaxial MoO2, ZnO, and In2O3 thin films. Their resultant compounds all inherit the mono&#8208;oriented crystal feature from their precursor oxides, including 2D vdW&#8208;layered semiconductors (e.g., MoS2), metallic films (e.g., MXene&#8208;like Mo2C and MoN), wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors (e.g., hexagonal ZnS), and ferroelectric semiconductors (e.g., In2S3). Using LOH&#8208;grown MoN as a seeding layer, mono&#8208;oriented GaN is achieved on an amorphous quartz substrate. The LOH process presents a universal strategy capable of growing epitaxial thin films (including 2D vdW&#8208;layered materials) not only on single&#8208;crystalline but also on noncrystalline substrates.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired Design of Photomechanically Modulated Display Systems for On&#8208;Demand Fluorescent Patterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the bioelectromechanical display mechanism of cephalopods, a conceptually new photomechanically modulated fluorescent system is developed. Its key component is an NIR&#8208;light&#8208;responsive fluorescent actuator with desirable time&#8208; and NIR light power dependent actuating behaviors. When paired with customizable display panels, on&#8208;demand display of diverse fluorescent patterns/information can be realized by facilely controlling the single remote NIR signal.








Abstract
Cephalopods can display variable body color/patterns upon environmental stimulation via bioelectricity&#8208;controlled muscle contraction/expansion of skin chromatophores. However, it remains challenging to produce artificial display analogs that exhibit reversible and rapid switching between multiple expected luminescent patterns, although such systems are very appealing for many practical uses (e.g., data encryption). Inspired by the bioelectromechanical display tactic of cephalopods, in this work, a conceptually new photomechanically modulated fluorescent system that enables on&#8208;demand display of fluorescent patterns via a cascading stimulation&#8722;mechanical movement&#8722;optical output conduction mechanism is presented. Specifically, this biomimetic system comprises a customizable hollow display panel and a bottom&#8208;tethered photothermally responsive fluorescent actuator. Under NIR light, the photomechanically bending movements of the fluorescent actuator will immediately cover the hollow window of the display panel and synchronously manifest as the display of fluorescent patterns. Owing to its desirable time&#8208; and light&#8208;power&#8208;dependent actuating behaviors, diverse fluorescent patterns/information can be dynamically and reversibly displayed by facilely controlling this single remote NIR signal. This bioinspired strategy is universal and promising for fabricating on&#8208;demand fluorescent display platforms that combine a wide choice of fluorophores, remote control with high spatial/temporal precision, and especially single&#8208;input multiple&#8208;output features.

Its key component is an NIR-light-responsive fluorescent actuator with desirable time- and NIR light power dependent actuating behaviors. When paired with customizable display panels, on-demand display of diverse fluorescent patterns/information can be realized by facilely controlling the single remote NIR signal.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalopods can display variable body color/patterns upon environmental stimulation via bioelectricity-controlled muscle contraction/expansion of skin chromatophores. However, it remains challenging to produce artificial display analogs that exhibit reversible and rapid switching between multiple expected luminescent patterns, although such systems are very appealing for many practical uses (e.g., data encryption). Inspired by the bioelectromechanical display tactic of cephalopods, in this work, a conceptually new photomechanically modulated fluorescent system that enables on-demand display of fluorescent patterns via a cascading stimulation&#8722;mechanical movement&#8722;optical output conduction mechanism is presented. Specifically, this biomimetic system comprises a customizable hollow display panel and a bottom-tethered photothermally responsive fluorescent actuator. Under NIR light, the photomechanically bending movements of the fluorescent actuator will immediately cover the hollow window of the display panel and synchronously manifest as the display of fluorescent patterns. Owing to its desirable time- and light-power-dependent actuating behaviors, diverse fluorescent patterns/information can be dynamically and reversibly displayed by facilely controlling this single remote NIR signal. This bioinspired strategy is universal and promising for fabricating on-demand fluorescent display platforms that combine a wide choice of fluorophores, remote control with high spatial/temporal precision, and especially single-input multiple-output features.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Programmable Liquid Droplets
In article number 2104837, Umberto Capasso Palmiero, Paolo Arosio, and co&#8208;workers propose a strategy to produce programmable liquid droplets via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of associative zwitterionic polymers. With this approach, multiple properties of the droplets, such as composition and stimulus responsiveness, can be finely tuned, opening attractive applications in bioseparation and diagnostics.

Stretchable Phototransistors
In article number 2107304, Yunlong Guo and co&#8208;workers achieve intrinsically stretchable phototransistors based on a designed polymer/perovskite heterojunction. The obtained stretchable phototransistors show a high&#8208;sensitivity response to high&#8208;energy photons (e.g. X&#8208;rays or UV light) even under 100% tensile strain. Some other optoelectronic skin characteristics, high sensing specificity, high transmittance, high tolerance to harsh mechanical deformations, and superior skin conformability, are also demonstrated.

3D Printing
In article number 2107249, Lei Wu, Yanlin Song, and co&#8208;workers propose a continuous liquid film confined 3D printing strategy to fabricate high&#8208;precision 3D structures. Reutilization and good control of the liquid residual can improve the printing fidelity and avoid a post&#8208;washing process. A centimeter&#8208;scale contact&#8208;lens structure with nanoscale roughness, high&#8208;definition imaging and homogeneous mechanical characteristic is printed, indicating its great potential in scalable 3D printing of optical structures.

Photonic Pigments
In article number 2107398, Yadong Yin and co&#8208;workers highlight the integration of magnetically responsive photonic pigments with orientation&#8208;dependent structural colors into optoelectronic devices that can exhibit dynamic color&#8208;switching or display predesigned patterns upon simple rotation. Such photonic pigments are promising materials in the development of high&#8208;performance sensors, color displays, rewritable papers, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices.

This strategy is promising for fabricating on&#8208;demand fluorescent display platforms that combine a wide choice of fluorophores, remote control with high spatial/temporal precision, and single&#8208;input multiple&#8208;output features.

Additive&#8208;Free Inks
Additive&#8208;free dry&#8208;only inks can enable functional printing and high&#8208;throughput fabrication of elec&#8208;tronics at room temperature, but their design proves challenging. In article number 2103660, Jakob Heier and co&#8208;workers show how interflake van der Waals interactions in 2D materials can be used to replace the roles of conventional additives for the formulation of additive&#8208;free inks.

Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) in a tandem configuration offer a strategy to realize high&#8208;performance, multi&#8208;color devices, but the efficiency of tandem quantum&#8208;dot based LEDs (QLEDs) has been limited due to unpassivated interfaces and solvent damage originating from the materials processing requirements of the interconnecting layers (ICLs). In article number 2108150, Edward H. Sargent, Xuyong Yang, and co&#8208;workers report an ICL consisting of a semiconductor&#8211;metal&#8211;dielectric stack that provides facile fabrication, materials stability, and good optoelectronic coupling, making the tandem QLED based on the ICL achieve recording efficiency.

         <title>Exciton&#8208;Polaritons and Their Bose&#8211;Einstein Condensates in Organic Semiconductor Microcavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of organic exciton&#8208;polaritonics is given. First, the principle of polariton formation and polariton condensation is introduced. Then, recent experimental advances and emerging applications in organic semiconductor microcavities are reviewed. To conclude, some remaining questions are considered and a personal viewpoint about future directions in this field is provided.








Abstract
Exciton&#8208;polaritons are half&#8208;light, half&#8208;matter bosonic quasiparticles formed by strong exciton&#8211;photon coupling in semiconductor microcavities. These hybrid particles possess the strong nonlinear interactions of excitons and keep most of the characteristics of the underlying photons. As bosons, above a threshold density they can undergo Bose&#8211;Einstein condensation to a polariton condensate phase and exhibit a rich variety of exotic macroscopic quantum phenomena in solids. Recently, organic semiconductors have been considered as a promising material platform for these studies due to their room&#8208;temperature stability, good processability, and abundant photophysics and photochemistry. Herein, recent advances of exciton&#8208;polaritons and their Bose&#8211;Einstein condensates in organic semiconductor microcavities are summarized. First, the basic physics is introduced, and then their emerging applications are highlighted. The remaining questions are also discussed and a personal viewpoint about the potential directions for future research is given.

         <title>Surface Chemistry Engineering of Perovskite Quantum Dots: Strategies, Applications, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface chemistry of metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) plays a key role in determining their structural stability and electronic properties. A critical overview focusing on the surface ligand engineering of PQDs, including advanced synthesis, in situ passivation, and ligand exchange, toward efficient and stable optoelectronic applications is presented.








Abstract
The presence of surface ligands not only plays a key role in keeping the colloidal integrity and non&#8208;defective surface of metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), but also serves as a knob to tune their optoelectronic properties for a variety of exciting applications including solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, these indispensable surface ligands may also deteriorate the stability and key properties of PQDs due to their highly dynamic binding and insulating nature. To address these issues, a number of innovative surface chemistry engineering approaches have been developed in the past few years. Based on an in&#8208;depth fundamental understanding of the surface atomistic structure and surface defect formation mechanism in the tiny nanoparticles, a critical overview focusing on the surface chemistry engineering of PQDs including advanced colloidal synthesis, in&#8208;situ surface passivation, and solution&#8208;phase/solid&#8208;state ligand exchange is presented, after which their unprecedented achievements in photovoltaics and other optoelectronics are presented. The practical hurdles and future directions are critically discussed to inspire more rational design of PQD surface chemistry toward practical applications.

         <title>Recent Advances in Electrolytes for &#8220;Beyond Aqueous&#8221; Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the fundamental understanding of the characteristics and challenges of the &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes of zinc&#8208;ion batteries, including conventional organic electrolytes, ionic liquid, all/quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and goes deep into the discussion on the pros and cons of each electrolyte. Lastly, this review presents a perspective on the challenges and future opportunities for the &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes.








Abstract
With the growing demands for large&#8208;scale energy storage, Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with distinct advantages, including resource abundance, low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, and acceptable energy density, are considered&#160;as potential substitutes for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Although numerous efforts are devoted to design and develop high performance cathodes and aqueous electrolytes for ZIBs, many challenges, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, water evaporation, and liquid leakage, have greatly hindered the development of aqueous ZIBs. Developing &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes can be able to avoid these issues due to the absence of water, which are beneficial for the achieving of highly efficient ZIBs. In this review, the recent development of the &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes, including conventional organic electrolytes, ionic liquid, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and deep eutectic electrolytes are presented. The critical issues and the corresponding strategies of the designing of &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes for ZIBs are also summarized.

         <title>Challenges and Strategies towards Practically Feasible Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remarkable improvement of inorganic solid electrolytes has opened up the opportunities to realize commercialization of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). However, practical operation of SSLMBs faces challenges of poor stability and low energy efficiency. This review introduces current understandings regarding the underlying origins of the issues in SSLMBs and discussions on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies to overcome these challenges.








Abstract
Remarkable improvement of the ionic conductivity of inorganic solid electrolytes (SEs) exceeding 10 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature has opened up the opportunities to realize the commercialization of solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). The transition to the intrinsically inflammable SEs also promises that SSBs would successfully utilize lithium metal anode thus achieving the high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries without the risk of a safety hazard. However, the practical operation of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) still faces the challenges of the poor cycle stability and the low energy efficiency, which are coupled with the interface stability and even with the dendrite growth of lithium metal. This article overviews current understandings regarding the underlying origins of the issues in employing the lithium metal anode in SSLMBs from the five main standpoints: i) the chemical/electrochemical interfacial stability, ii) the microscopic evolution of interfacial morphology, iii) the intrinsic diffusivity of lithium atom/vacancy at the interface, iv) imperfections (defect/pores), and v) non&#8208;negligible electronic conductivity of SEs. The discussions are followed on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efforts and strategies to overcome these respective challenges. Finally, the authors provide their perspectives for the future research directions toward achieving the commercial level of high&#8208;energy SSLMBs.

         <title>Heterointerface Engineering in Electromagnetic Absorbers: New Insights and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 4, January 27, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New and in&#8208;depth insights into the electromagnetic response mechanism of heterointerface engineering are provided, including band alignment, spatial charge, electron transport, lattice defects, lattice strain, and pinning effects. The relevant characterization techniques and reinforcement strategies are systematically demonstrated. Smart electromagnetic absorbers based on interfacial effects are highlighted.








Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) absorbers play an increasingly essential role in the electronic information age, even toward the coming &#8220;intelligent era&#8221;. The remarkable merits of heterointerface engineering and its peculiar EM characteristics inject a fresh and infinite vitality for designing high&#8208;efficiency and stimuli&#8208;responsive EM absorbers. However, there still exist huge challenges in understanding and reinforcing these interface effects from the micro and macro perspectives. Herein, EM response mechanisms of interfacial effects are dissected in depth, and with a focus on advanced characterization as well as theoretical techniques. Then, the representative optimization strategies are systematically discussed with emphasis on component selection and structural design. More importantly, the most cutting&#8208;edge smart EM functional devices based on heterointerface engineering are reported. Finally, current challenges and concrete suggestions are proposed, and future perspectives on this promising field are also predicted.

         <title>Biomineralized Materials as Model Systems for Structural Composites: 3D Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biomineralized materials are sophisticated material systems with hierarchical 3D organizations of minerals and organics, which have been broadly used as model systems for fundamental mechanical, materials science, and biomimetic studies. Our current knowledge of the structure of biological materials is mainly based on 2D imaging techniques, which often impedes comprehensive and accurate understanding of the materials&#8217; intricate 3D architecture and consequently their mechanics, functions, and bioinspired designs. The development of 3D techniques like tomography, additive manufacturing, and 4D testing has opened pathways to study biological materials fully in 3D. In this review, we discuss how applying 3D techniques can provide new insights into biomineralized materials that are either well&#8208;known or possess complex microstructures that are extremely challenging to understand in the 2D framework. Specifically, the diverse structures of biomineralized materials are understood based on four universal structural motifs. Nacre is selected as an example to demonstrate how the progression of knowledge from 2D to 3D can bring substantial improvements to the growth mechanism, biomechanics theories, and bioinspired designs. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multiscale 3D tomographic techniques are discussed with a focus on their integration with 3D geometric quantification, 4D in&#8208;situ experiments, and multiscale modeling. Outlook is given on the emerging approaches to investigate the synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;function&#8208;biomimetics relationship.

         <title>Advances in High&#8208;Performance Autonomous Energy and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing Textiles with Novel 3D Fabric Structures</title>

Abstract
The seamless integration of emerging triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology with traditional wearable textile materials has given the birth to the next&#8208;generation smart textiles, i.e., textile TENGs, which will play a vital role in the era of Internet of Things and artificial intelligences. However, low output power and inferior sensing ability have largely limited the development of textile TENGs. Among various approaches to improve the output and sensing performance, such as material modification, structural design, and environmental management, 3D fabric structural scheme is a facile, efficient, controllable and scalable strategy to increase the effective contact area for contact electrification of textile TENGs without cumbersome material processing and service area restrictions. In this review, the recent advances of the current reported textile TENGs with 3D fabric structures are comprehensively summarized and systematically analyzed in order to clarify their superiorities over 1D fiber and 2D fabric structures in terms of power output and pressure sensing. The forward&#8208;looking integration abilities of the 3D fabrics are also discussed at the end. We hope that the overview and analysis of textile TENGs with distinctive 3D fabric structures will contribute to the development and realization of high&#8208;power output micro/nano wearable power sources and high&#8208;quality self&#8208;powered wearable sensors.

         <title>Achieving Remarkable Charge Density Via Self&#8208;polarization of Polar High&#8208;k Material in Charge&#8208;excitation Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Boosting output charge density is top priority for achieving high performance triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). The charge excitation strategy has been demonstrated to be a superior approach to acquire high output charge density. Meanwhile, the molecular charge behaviors in dielectric under strong electric field from high charge density brings new physics that is worth exploring. Here, we report a rapid self&#8208;polarization effect of polar dielectric material by the super&#8208;high electric field in charge excitation TENG, by which the permittivity of polar dielectric material realizes self&#8208;increase to a saturation, and thus enhances the output charge density. Consequently, an ultra&#8208;high charge density of 3.53 mC m&#8722;2 is obtained with 7&#160;&#956;m homemade Lead Zirconate Titanate&#8208;Polyvinylidene fluoride composite film in the atmosphere with 5% relative humidity, which is the highest charge density for TENG with high durability currently. This work provides new guidance for dielectric material optimization under charge excitation to boost the output performance of TENG toward practical applications.

Abstract
Developing robust and high active non&#8208;precious electrocatalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) is crucial for the industrialization of hydrogen energy. In this study, we prepared a highly active and durable single&#8208;atom W doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheet@NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorod heterostructure (W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5) electrocatalyst. W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the HER and OER with ultralow overpotentials (39 and 106&#160;mV for the HER and 171 and 239&#160;mV for the OER at 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively) and excellent long&#8208;term durability (500 h), outperforming commercial precious&#8208;metal catalysts and many other previously reported transition metal&#8208;based compounds. The introduction of single&#8208;atom W delocalized the spin state of Ni, which resulted in an increase in the Ni d&#8208;electron density. This caused the optimization of the adsorption/desorption process of H and a significant reduction in the adsorption free energy of the rate&#8208;determining step (O* &#8594; OOH*), thus accelerating the thermodynamics and kinetics of the HER and OER. This work provides a rational feasible strategy to design single&#8208;atom catalysts for water splitting and to develop advanced transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts by regulating delocalized spin states.

         <title>Realizing 19.05% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells by Progressively Improving Charge Extraction and Suppressing Charge Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Improving the charge extraction and suppressing the charge recombination are critical important to minimize the loss of absorbed photons and improve the device performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this work, highly efficient PSCs are demonstrated by progressively improving the charge extraction and suppressing the charge recombination through the combination of side chain engineering of new nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), adopting ternary blend and introducing volatilizable solid additive. The two&#8208;dimensional (2D) side chains on BTP&#8208;Th induce certain steric hindrance for molecular packing and phase separation, which is mitigated by fluorination of side chains on BTP&#8208;FTh. Moreover, by introducing two highly crystalline molecules, IDIC and DTT, as the second acceptor and volatilizable solid additive, respectively, into the PTQ10:BTP&#8208;FTh host blend, the molecular crystallinity is significantly improved and the blend morphology is finely optimized. As expected, the enhanced charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination are progressively realized, contributing to the largely improved fill factor (FF) of the resultant devices. Accompanied by the enhanced open circuit voltage (Voc) and short current density (Jsc), a record high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05% is realized by adding IDIC acceptor and DTT additive to the PTQ10:BTP&#8208;FTh host blend.

         <title>Direct Observation of Strong Anomalous Hall Effect and Proximity&#8208;induced Ferromagnetic State in SrIrO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The 5d iridium&#8208;based transition metal oxides have gained broad interest because of their strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling which favors new or exotic quantum electronic states. On the other hand, they rarely exhibit more mainstream orders like ferromagnetism due to generally weak electron&#8208;electron correlation strength. Here, we show a proximity&#8208;induced ferromagnetic (FM) state with TC &#8776; 100 K and strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy in a SrIrO3 (SIO) heterostructure via interfacial charge transfer by using a ferromagnetic insulator in contact with SIO. Electrical transport allows to selectively probe the FM state of the SIO layer and the direct observation of a strong, intrinsic and positive anomalous Hall effect (AHE). For T &#8804; 20 K, the AHE displays unusually large coercive and saturation field, a fingerprint of a strong pseudospin&#8208;lattice coupling. A Hall angle, &#963;xyAHE/&#963;xx, larger by an order of magnitude than in typical 3d metals and a FM net moment of about 0.1 &#956;B/Ir, is reported. This emphasizes how efficiently the nontrivial topological band properties of SIO can be manipulated by structural modifications and the exchange interaction with 3d TMOs.

Abstract
The looming impact of climate change and the diminishing supply of fossil fuels both highlight the need for a transition to more sustainable energy sources. Whilst solar and wind can produce much of the energy needed, to meet all our energy demands there is a need for a diverse sustainable energy generation mix. Thermoelectrics can play a vital role in this, by harvesting otherwise wasted heat energy and converting it into useful electrical energy. Whilst efficient thermoelectric materials have been known since the 1950's, thermoelectrics has not been utilised beyond a few niche applications. This can in part be attributed to the high cost of manufacturing and the geometrical restraints of current commercial manufacturing techniques. Printing offers a potential route to manufacture thermoelectric materials at a lower price point and allow for the fabrication of generators that are custom build to meet the waste heat source requirements. This review details the significant progress that has been made in recent years in printing of thermoelectric materials in all thermoelectric material groups and printing methods, and highlights very recent publications that show printing can now offer comparable performance to commercially manufactured thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Highly Anisotropic Organometal Halide Perovskite Nanowalls Grown By Glancing Angle Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Polarizers are ubiquitous components in current optoelectronic devices as displays or photographic cameras. Yet the control over light polarization is an unsolved challenge as the main drawback of the existing display technologies relays in significant optical losses. In such a context, organometal halide perovskites (OMHP) can play a decisive role given their flexible synthesis with under design optical properties such as tunable bandgap and photoluminescence, and excellent light emission with a low non&#8208;radiative recombination rate. Therefore, along with their outstanding electrical properties have elevated hybrid perovskites as the material of choice in photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Among the different OMHP nanostructures, nanowires and nanorods have lately arisen as key players in the control of light polarization for lighting or detector applications. Herein, we present the fabrication of highly aligned and anisotropic methylammonium lead iodide perovskite nanowalls by Glancing Angle Deposition, compatible with most substrates. Their high alignment degree provides the samples with anisotropic optical properties such as light absorption and photoluminescence. Furthermore, their implementation in photovoltaic devices provides them with a polarization&#8208;sensitive response. Our facile vacuum&#8208;based approach embodies a milestone in the development of last&#8208;generation polarization&#8208;sensitive perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices such as lighting appliances or self&#8208;powered photodetectors.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Ultrathin Highly&#8208;Crystalline Pt&#8208;Ni Nanostructure on Metal Carbide Template for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

Abstract
Structure engineering strategies such as core&#8208;shell and hollow nanostructures are effective pathways to improve the utilization of noble metals for catalysis. However, nowadays materials design based on these strategies are still largely rely on precious metals templates. Herein, we report the epitaxial growth of highly&#8208;crystalline Pt3Ni overlayer on earth abundant nickel carbide, forming Ni3C@Pt3Ni core&#8208;shell nanoparticles with well&#8208;define interface through a new lattice&#8208;match&#8208;directed synthetic strategy. Derived from such core&#8208;shell nanostructure, ultrathin highly&#8208;crystalline Pt3Ni nanocage has an advantageous configuration of ORR favored facets and inherent high active surface area for ORR, bringing high mass activity and specific activity as much as 4.71 A/mgPt and 5.14&#160;mA/cm2, which are 26 and 20 times to that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. This novel epitaxial growth of platinum opens up new avenues to rationally design highly active and economical electrocatalysts.

         <title>Diverging Expressions of Anharmonicity in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lead&#8208;based halide perovskite (PbHaP) crystals were&#160;shown to have strongly anharmonic structural dynamics. This behavior is important because it may be the origin of their exceptional photo&#8208;voltaic properties. The double perovskite, Cs2AgBiBr6, has been recently studied as a lead&#8208;free alternative for optoelectronics applications. However, it does not exhibit the excellent photo&#8208;voltaic activity of the PbHaPs. Therefore, to explore the correlation between the anharmonic structural dynamics and optoelectronic properties in PbHaPs, we&#160;investigate the structural dynamics of Cs2AgBiBr6 and compare it to its lead&#8208;based analog CsPbBr3. Using temperature&#8208;dependent Raman measurements, we&#160;find that both materials are indeed strongly anharmonic. Nonetheless, the expression of their anharmonic behavior is markedly different. Cs2AgBiBr6 has well&#8208;defined normal modes throughout the measured temperature range, while CsPbBr3 exhibits a complete breakdown of the normal mode picture above 200&#160;K. We&#160;suggest that the breakdown of the normal mode picture implies that the average crystal structure may not be a proper starting point to understand the electronic properties of the crystal. In addition to our main findings, we&#160;also discovered an unreported phase of Cs2AgBiBr6 below&#160;&#8764;37&#160;K.

         <title>Supramolecular Reinforcement of Polymer&#8211;Nanoparticle Hydrogels for Modular Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin&#8208;based supramolecular binding enhances the viscoelastic properties of polymer&#8211;nanoparticle hydrogels and provides modular exchange of building blocks. This paradigm expands the interactions available for the formation of this class of injectable nanocomposite hydrogels, enabling unique applications in 3D printing, magnetic materials, and conductive hydrogels.








Abstract
Moldable hydrogels are increasingly used as injectable or extrudable materials in biomedical and industrial applications owing to their ability to flow under applied stress (shear&#8208;thin) and reform a stable network (self&#8208;heal). Nanoscale components can be added to dynamic polymer networks to modify their mechanical properties and broaden the scope of applications. Viscoelastic polymer&#8211;nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels comprise a versatile and tunable class of dynamic nanocomposite materials that form via reversible interactions between polymer chains and nanoparticles. However, PNP hydrogel formation is restricted to specific interactions between select polymers and nanoparticles, resulting in a limited range of mechanical properties and constraining their utility. Here, a facile strategy to reinforce PNP hydrogels through the simple addition of &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) to the formulation is introduced. The formation of polypseudorotoxanes between &#945;CD and the hydrogel components resulted in a drastic enhancement of the mechanical properties. Furthermore, supramolecular reinforcement of CD&#8211;PNP hydrogels enabled decoupling of the mechanical properties and material functionality. This allows for modular exchange of structural components from a library of functional polymers and nanoparticles. &#945;CD supramolecular binding motifs are leveraged to form CD&#8211;PNP hydrogels with biopolymers for high&#8208;fidelity 3D (bio)printing and drug delivery as well as with inorganic NPs to engineer magnetic or conductive&#160;materials.

         <title>Nanovesicle&#8208;Mediated Targeted Delivery of Immune Checkpoint Blockades to Potentiate Therapeutic Efficacy and Prevent Side Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 antibody (&#945;CTLA&#8208;4)&#8208;conjugated and tumor antigen (TA)&#8208;loaded nanovesicles derived from dendritic cells can facilitate spatiotemporal delivery of TA and &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 to tumor&#8208;specific T cells. This leads to selective activation of tumor&#8208;reactive T cells, effective inhibition of tumor growth and prevention of immune&#8208;related adverse events, improving the current immune checkpoint blockade therapies.








Abstract
Despite the clinically proven efficacies of immune checkpoint blockades, including anti&#8208;cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4&#160;antibody (&#945;CTLA&#8208;4), the low response rate and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) in cancer patients represent major drawbacks of the therapy. These drawbacks of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;therapy are mainly due to the suboptimal activation of tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and the systemic nonspecific activation of T cells. To overcome such drawbacks, &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;is delivered by dendritic cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles presenting tumor antigens (DCNV&#8208;TAs) that exclusively interact with tumor&#8208;specific T cells, leading to selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific CTLs. Compared to conventional &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;therapy, treatment with &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#8208;conjugated DCNV&#8208;TAs significantly inhibits tumor growth and reduces irAEs in syngeneic tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study demonstrates that the spatiotemporal presentation of both &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;and tumor antigens enables selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific T cells and potentiates the antitumor efficacy of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;without inducing systemic irAEs.

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Photosensitizable Bacterial Cellulose as Engineered Living Material for Skin Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Living materials based on bacterial cellulose (BC) represent a natural and promising candidate for wound dressing. Both physical adsorption and chemical methods have been applied to BC for realizing antibacterial function. However, effective and long&#8208;lasting incorporation of bactericidal moieties to BC remains challenging. We herein explore a Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans&#8208;based direct synthetic method to fabricate photosensitizer&#8208;grafted BC through&#160;in situ&#160;bacterial metabolism in the presence of TPEPy&#8208;modified glucose (TPEPy&#8208;Glc). Our results verify that the direct biosynthesis method is efficient and convenient to endow BC with outstanding fluorescence and light&#8208;triggered photodynamic bactericidal activity for skin wound repair. This work presents a new approach to fabricate eco&#8208;friendly and active wound dressing with light&#8208;controlled bactericidal activity by microbial metabolism. The successful modification of the glucose carbon source of microorganisms also offers insights for biosyntheses of other living materials through microbial metabolism.

         <title>Enabling Fast Na+ Transfer Kinetics in the Whole&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Region of Hard Carbon Anodes for Ultrahigh Rate Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Efficient electrode materials, that combine high power and high energy, are the crucial requisites of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) which have unwrapped new possibilities in the areas of grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Hard carbons (HCs) are considered as the leading candidate anode materials for SIBs, however, the primary challenge of slow charge transfer kinetics at the low potential region (&lt; 0.1&#160;V) remains unresolved till date, and the underlying structure&#8208;performance correlation is under debate. Herein, we report ultrafast sodium storage in the whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;region (0.01&#8208;2&#160;V) with the Na+ diffusion coefficient enhanced by 2 orders of magnitude (&#8764;10&#8211;7 cm2 s&#8211;1) through rational deploying the physical parameters of HC using a ZnO assisted bulk etching strategy. We unveil that the Na+ adsorption energy (Ea) and diffusion barrier (Eb) are in a positive and negative linear relationship with the carbon p&#8208;band center, respectively, and balanced of Ea and Eb is critical in enhancing the charge storage kinetics. The charge storage mechanism in HCs is evidenced through comprehensive in(ex)&#8208;situ techniques. The as prepared HC microspheres deliver a record high rate performance of 107 mAh g&#8211;1 @ 50 A g&#8211;1 and unprecedented electrochemical performance at extremely low temperature (426 mAh g&#8211;1 @ &#8208;40&#176;C).

         <title>Enabling Anionic Redox Stability of P2&#8208;Na5/6Li1/4Mn3/4O2 by Mg Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substitution strategy of partial occupation of the Na&#8208;site by Mg ions in Na0.773Li0.25Mn0.75O2 not only reduces the chemical potential energy of oxygen but also reduces the undercoordinated oxygen, the nonbonded, and electron&#8208;deficient O2p states, thus enhancing the stability of oxygen anodic redox upon long&#8208;term cycling.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;based anionic redox reactions have recently emerged as a lever to increase the capacity of Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes in addition to the charge compensation based on cationic redox reactions for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the irreversibility of anionic redox often aggravates irreversible structure change and poor cycling performance. Here, a stable anionic redox is achieved through substituting Na ions by Mg ions in P2&#8208;type Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mg substitution effectively decreases the oxygen chemical potential, causing an improvement in lattice oxygen stability. Moreover, at a highly desodiated state, Mg ions that remain in the lattice and interact with O 2p orbitals can decrease the undercoordinated oxygen and the nonbonded, electron&#8208;deficient O 2p states, facilitating the reversibility of oxygen redox. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.6&#8211;4.5&#160;V where only anionic redox occurs for charge compensation, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 presents a much better reversibility, giving a 4 times better cycle stability than that of Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Experimentally, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 exhibits a &#8776;1.1% volume expansion during sodium insertion/extraction, suggestive of a &#8220;zero&#8208;strain&#8221; cathode. Overall, the work opens a new avenue for enhancing anionic reversibility of oxygen&#8208;related Mn&#8208;rich cathodes.

         <title>Mucosa&#8208;Like Conformal Hydrogel Coating for Aqueous Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mucosa is a protective and lubricating barrier in biological tissue, which has a great clinical inspiration because of its slippery, soft, and hydrophilic surface. However, mimicking mucosal traits on complex surface remains an enormous challenge. Herein, a novel approach to create mucosa&#8208;like conformal hydrogel coating is developed. A thin conformal hydrogel layer mimicking the epithelial layer is obtained by first absorbing micelles, followed by forming covalent interlinks with the polymer substrate via interface&#8208;initiated hydrogel polymerization. The resulting coating exhibits uniform thickness (&#8764; 15&#160;&#956;m), mucosa&#8208;matched compliance (Young's modulus = 1.1&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;kPa) and lubrication (coefficients of friction = 0.018&#160;&#177; 0.003), robust interfacial bonding against peeling (peeling strength = 1218.0&#160;&#177; 187.9 J m&#8211;2), as well as high water absorption capacity. It effectively resists adhesion of proteins and bacteria without compromising biocompatibility. As demonstrated by a in vivo cynomolgus monkey model and clinical trial, applications of the mucosa&#8208;like conformal hydrogel coating on the endotracheal tube significantly reduces intubation&#8208;related complications, such as invasive stimuli, mucosal lesions, laryngeal oedema, inflammation, and postoperative pain. This work offers a promising prototype for surface decoration of biomedical devices and holds great prospects for clinical translation to enable interventional operations with minimally invasive impacts

         <title>A Programmable Dual&#8208;Regime Spray for Large&#8208;Scale and Custom&#8208;Designed Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable dual&#8208;regime spray that enables direct writing of custom electronic textiles (e&#8208;textiles) into stretch fabrics or garments over meter scale is introduced. The e&#8208;textiles tightly fit various body sizes and shapes of large animals to support reliable monitoring of health data under ambulatory conditions in a wirelessly controlled fashion.








Abstract
Increasing demand for wearable healthcare synergistically advances the field of electronic textiles, or e&#8208;textiles, allowing for ambulatory monitoring of vital health signals. Despite great promise, the pragmatic deployment of e&#8208;textiles in clinical practice remains challenged due to the lack of a method in producing custom&#8208;designed e&#8208;textiles at high spatial resolution across a large area. To this end, a programmable dual&#8208;regime spray that enables the direct custom writing of functional nanoparticles into arbitrary fabrics at sub&#8208;millimeter resolution over meter scale is employed. The resulting e&#8208;textiles retain the intrinsic fabric properties in terms of mechanical flexibility, water&#8208;vapor permeability, and comfort against multiple uses and laundry cycles. The e&#8208;textiles tightly fit various body sizes and shapes to support the high&#8208;fidelity recording of physiological and electrophysiological signals on the skin under ambulatory conditions. Pilot field tests in a remote health&#8208;monitoring setting with a large animal, such as a horse, demonstrate the scalability and utility of the e&#8208;textiles beyond conventional devices. This approach will be suitable for the rapid prototyping of custom e&#8208;textiles tailored to meet various clinical needs.

         <title>Scalable Growth of Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Films via Orientation Filter Funnel for High&#8208;Performance Transistors with Excellent Uniformity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) provide an unprecedented opportunity for the development of new&#8208;generation organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. However, crystallization of organic films is normally governed by stochastic nucleation and incoherent growth, posing a formidable challenge to grow large&#8208;sized OSCFs. Here, we present an &#8220;orientation filter funnel&#8221; concept for the scalable growth of OSCFs with well&#8208;aligned, single&#8208;orientated crystals. By rationally designing solvent wetting/dewetting patterns on the substrate, this approach can produce seed crystals with the same crystallographic orientation and then maintain epitaxial growth of these crystals, enabling the formation of large&#8208;area OSCFs. As a result, this unique concept for crystal growth not only enhances average mobility of organic film by 4.5&#8208;fold, but also improves its uniformity of electrical properties with a low mobility variable coefficient of 9.8%, the new lowest record among the organic devices. Our method offers a general and scalable route to produce OSCFs towards real&#8208;word electronic applications.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Integration of Silicon Nanomembranes with 2D Materials for Bioresorbable, Wireless Neurochemical System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although neurotransmitters are key substances closely related to evaluate degenerative brain diseases as well as regulate essential functions in the body, many research efforts have been focused on monitoring relatively associated physical, mechanical and electrophysiological parameters, rather than direct observation of such biochemical messengers. Here, we introduce a bioresorbable silicon&#8208;based neurochemical analyzer incorporated with two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides as a completely implantable brain&#8208;integrated system that can wirelessly monitor time&#8208;dynamic behaviors of dopamine and relevant parameters in a simultaneous mode. Extensive range of examinations of molybdenum/tungsten disulfide (MoS2/WS2) nanosheets and catalytic iron nanoparticles (Fe NPs) highlights underlying mechanisms of strong chemical and target&#8208;specific responses to the neurotransmitters along with theoretical modeling tools. Systematic characterizations demonstrate reversible, stable and long&#8208;term operational performances of the degradable bioelectronics with excellent sensitivity and selectivity over those of non&#8208;dissolvable counterparts. A complete set of in vivo experiments with comparative analysis using carbon fiber electrodes illustrates capabilities for a potential use as a clinically accessible tool to associated neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>A Universal Cosolvent Evaporation Strategy Enables Direct Printing of Perovskite Single Crystals for Optoelectronic Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite single crystals (SCs) are grown on&#8208;demand at room temperature and integrated directly onto optoelectronic devices via printing and coating using a scalable cosolvent evaporation (CSE) strategy. The CSE strategy controls supersaturation and suppresses competing nucleation during drying to yield high&#8208;quality SCs of 2D, 3D, lead&#8208;free, and mixed&#8208;ion perovskites with minimal residue.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskite (MHP) single crystals (SCs) are in high demand for a growing number of printed electronic applications due to their superior optoelectronic properties compared to polycrystalline thin films. There is an urgent need to make SC fabrication facile, scalable, and compatible with the printed electronic manufacturing infrastructure. Here, a universal cosolvent evaporation (CSE) strategy is presented by which perovskite SCs and arrays are produced directly on substrates via printing and coating methods within minutes at room temperature from drying droplets. The CSE strategy successfully guides the supersaturation via controlled drying of droplets to suppress all crystallization pathways but one, and is shown to produce SCs of a wide variety of 3D, 2D, and mixed&#8208;cation/halide perovskites with consistency. This approach works with commonly used precursors and solvents, making it universal. Importantly, the SC consumes the precursor in the droplet, which enables the large&#8208;scale fabrication of SC arrays with minimal residue. Direct on&#8208;chip fabrication of 3D and 2D perovskite photodetector devices with outstanding performance is demonstrated. The approach shows that any MHP SC can now be manufactured on substrates using precision printing and scalable, high&#8208;throughput coating methods.

         <title>A Flexible and Degradable Hybrid Mineral as a Plastic Substitute</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biomineralization, a flexible and degradable hybrid mineral (HM), which is dominated by minerals, is constructed by the inorganic ionic polymerization of calcium phosphate ionic oligomers under biomimetic control from organic templates (polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate). The HM shows potential to serve as a plastic substitute owing to its superior mechanical properties and environmental friendliness.








Abstract
The development of environmentally friendly plastics is critical to ensure sustainable development. In contrast to polymer plastics derived from petrochemicals, inorganic minerals, which are the most abundant matter in Earth's crust, are environmentally friendly. However, the brittleness of these minerals limits their applications as plastics. Here, because of the advantages of both biomineralization and inorganic ionic polymerization, the calcium phosphate (CaP, a typical geological and biological mineral) oligomers are used for biomimetic mineralization under the regulation of polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate, resulting in flexible CaP nanofibers with periodic structural defects. The assembly of CaP nanofibers produces a hierarchically structured bulk hybrid mineral (HM), which overcomes the intrinsic brittleness of minerals and exhibits plasticity characteristics. HM exhibits better hardness and thermostability than classical polymer plastics due to its dominant mineral composition. Notably, HM is environmentally friendly and degradable in nature, as it can potentially participate in geological cycles, indicating that this material is an optimal plastic substitute. The construction of periodic structural defects within flexible minerals expands the current understanding of materials science.

         <title>Unraveling Heat Transport and Dissipation in Suspended MoSe2 from Bulk to Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study using Raman thermometry and ab initio simulations to unravel the heat transport properties of suspended MoSe2 crystals with systematic thickness variation down to the monolayer. Monolayer films have almost the same in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity as bulk material thanks to an additional heat&#8208;carrying low&#8208;frequency mode. Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane heat dissipation to air is extremely efficient for the thinnest flakes.








Abstract
Understanding heat flow in layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals is crucial for applications exploiting these materials. Despite significant efforts, several basic thermal transport properties of TMDs are currently not well understood, in particular how transport is affected by material thickness and the material's environment. This combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study establishes a unifying physical picture of the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of the representative TMD MoSe2. Thermal conductivity measurements using Raman thermometry on a large set of clean, crystalline, suspended crystals with systematically varied thickness are combined with ab initio simulations with phonons at finite temperature. The results show that phonon dispersions and lifetimes change strongly with thickness, yet the thinnest TMD films exhibit an in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity that is only marginally smaller than that of bulk crystals. This is the result of compensating phonon contributions, in particular heat&#8208;carrying modes around &#8776;0.1&#160;THz in (sub)nanometer thin films, with a surprisingly long mean free path of several micrometers. This behavior arises directly from the layered nature of the material. Furthermore, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane heat dissipation to air molecules is remarkably efficient, in particular for the thinnest crystals, increasing the apparent thermal conductivity of monolayer MoSe2 by an order of magnitude. These results are crucial for the design of (flexible) TMD&#8208;based (opto&#8208;)electronic&#160;applications.

     alt="Unraveling Heat Transport and Dissipation in Suspended MoSe2 from Bulk to Monolayer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study using Raman thermometry and ab initio simulations to unravel the heat transport properties of suspended MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystals with systematic thickness variation down to the monolayer. Monolayer films have almost the same in-plane thermal conductivity as bulk material thanks to an additional heat-carrying low-frequency mode. Out-of-plane heat dissipation to air is extremely efficient for the thinnest flakes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding heat flow in layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) crystals is crucial for applications exploiting these materials. Despite significant efforts, several basic thermal transport properties of TMDs are currently not well understood, in particular how transport is affected by material thickness and the material's environment. This combined experimental&#8211;theoretical study establishes a unifying physical picture of the intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity of the representative TMD MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Thermal conductivity measurements using Raman thermometry on a large set of clean, crystalline, suspended crystals with systematically varied thickness are combined with ab initio simulations with phonons at finite temperature. The results show that phonon dispersions and lifetimes change strongly with thickness, yet the thinnest TMD films exhibit an in-plane thermal conductivity that is only marginally smaller than that of bulk crystals. This is the result of compensating phonon contributions, in particular heat-carrying modes around &#8776;0.1&#160;THz in (sub)nanometer thin films, with a surprisingly long mean free path of several micrometers. This behavior arises directly from the layered nature of the material. Furthermore, out-of-plane heat dissipation to air molecules is remarkably efficient, in particular for the thinnest crystals, increasing the apparent thermal conductivity of monolayer MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by an order of magnitude. These results are crucial for the design of (flexible) TMD-based (opto-)electronic&#160;applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Twist Fibers toward Rotating Microengines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Untethered twist fibers with reversible responsiveness have shown great potential as rotating microengine, of which high torque and high rotational deformation are desirable. Herein, liquid crystal elastomer twist fiber (LCETF) with fixed twisting orientation is developed, demonstrating outstanding rotational performance due to its significant intrinsic deformation. The obtained LCETF can function as a rotating microengine in an electricity generator.








Abstract
Untethered twist fibers do not require end&#8208;anchoring structures to hold their twist orientation and offer simple designs and convenient operation. The reversible responsiveness of these fibers allows them to generate torque and rotational deformation continuously upon the application of external stimuli. The fibers therefore have potential in rotating microengines. In practical applications, high torque and rotational deformation are desirable to meet work capacity requirements. However, the simultaneous endowment of reversible responsiveness and high rotational performance to untethered twist fibers remains a challenge. In this study, a liquid crystal elastomer twist fiber (LCETF) is designed and developed with a fixed twisting alignment of mesogens to provide untethered and reversible responsiveness. Outstanding rotational performance can be achieved when the mesogenic orientation is disrupted through heat triggering. Owing to the significant intrinsic contractile ratio of the LCE material, the rotational deformation of the LCETF can reach 243.6&#176; mm&#8722;1. More importantly, the specific torque can reach 10.1 N m kg&#8722;1, which exceeds previously reported values. In addition, the LCETF can be exploited in a rotating microengine to convert heat into electricity with an induction voltage as high as 9.4&#160;V. This work broadens the applications of LCEs for energy harvesters, micromachines, and soft robots.

         <title>Differential Polymer Chain Scission Enables Free&#8208;Standing Microcavity Laser Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of differential polymer chain scission is developed to fabricate free&#8208;standing optical microcavities with high&#8208;quality factors by one&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam direct writing on polymer bilayers. This strategy features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the free&#8208;standing optical microstructures, which significantly expands the application scope for versatile photonic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Control over material architectures is essential to the performance of photonic devices and systems. Optical isolation of the photonic materials from substrates can significantly enhance their performance but suffers from complicated fabrication processes and limited applications. Here a differential polymer chain scission strategy is proposed to fabricate free&#8208;standing photonic structures based on one&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam direct writing on polymer bilayers (EOB). The polymer molecular mass&#8208;dependent sensitivity to electron beam enables differential patterning of the two layers of polymers, leading to the direct formation of suspended optical microcavities. The EOB technique features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the optical microcavities, which significantly expands the application scope of the suspended optical microcavities. As well as providing a versatile strategy for building high&#8208;performance photonic materials, the results provide a promising platform for innovative applications of optical microstructures.

         <title>Inverse Design of Ferroelectric&#8208;Order in Perovskite Crystal for Self&#8208;Powered Ultraviolet Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered KTa1&#8722;xNbxO3&#160;photodetector is fabricated based on &#8220;inverse&#8208;design&#8221; of the ferroelectric order.








Abstract
It has always been a hot topic to design an orderly mesoscopic structure in functional materials to tailor the macroscopic properties or realize new functions. The existence of domains in ferroelectric materials has been proven to affect the macroscopic properties, being actively studied in nonlinear optical conversion and piezoelectric effects. However, the high&#8208;efficiency photoelectric conversion capability of ferroelectric crystals has not yet been explored. Here, the authors study the orderly arrangement of ferroelectric order in KTa1&#8722;xNbxO3 (KTN) perovskite crystals, and design the &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; domains by tuning the Curie temperature Tc, thereby generating abundant charged domain walls and robust conductive channels for electrons and holes. An ultrahigh ultraviolet photoresponsivity is achieved in the KTN crystal under zero bias voltage, being about four orders magnitude higher than that of the well&#8208;known ferroelectric materials. The substantial improvement can be attributed to the judiciously designed ferroelectric order, as demonstrated by the conductive atomic force microscopy. In addition, KTN detector exhibits high stability and reliability after high&#8208;temperature and fatigue treatment. KTN crystal features giant photoresponsivity, high electric&#8211;optical coefficient, and large &#967;(2) nonlinearity concurrently, indicating its great potential for application of all&#8208;optical devices on photonic chips.

         <title>Anisotropic Rod&#8208;Shaped Particles Influence Injectable Granular Hydrogel Properties and Cell Invasion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spherical and rod&#8208;shaped microparticles are fabricated using droplet microfluidics and assembled into injectable and porous granular hydrogels for tissue repair. Changing particle shape improves structural features such as pore anisotropy and increases bulk mechanics such as storage moduli. Hydrogels containing rod&#8208;shaped particles support robust endothelial cell sprouting in&#160;vitro and uninhibited cell invasion in vivo.








Abstract
Granular hydrogels have emerged as a new class of injectable and porous biomaterials that improve integration with host tissue when compared to solid hydrogels. Granular hydrogels are typically prepared using spherical particles and this study considers whether particle shape (i.e., isotropic spheres vs anisotropic rods) influences granular hydrogel properties and cellular invasion. Simulations predict that anisotropic rods influence pore shape and interconnectivity, as well as bead transport through granular assemblies. Photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable norbornene&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid is used to produce spherical and rod&#8208;shaped particles using microfluidic droplet generators and formed into shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing granular hydrogels, with particle shape influencing mechanics and injectability. Rod&#8208;shaped particles form granular hydrogels that have anisotropic and interconnected pores, with pore size and number influenced by particle shape and degree of packing. Robust in&#160;vitro sprouting of endothelial cells from embedded cellular spheroids is observed with rod&#8208;shaped particles, including higher sprouting densities and sprout lengths when compared to hydrogels with spherical particles. Cell and vessel invasion into granular hydrogels when injected subcutaneously in vivo are significantly greater with rod&#8208;shaped particles, whereas a gradient of cellularity is observed with spherical particles. Overall, this work demonstrates potentially superior functional properties of granular hydrogels with rod&#8208;shaped particles for tissue repair.

         <title>Surfaces Decorated with Enantiomorphically Pure Polymer Nanohelices via Hierarchical Chirality Transfer across Multiple Length Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;templated approach to prepare nanohelices of chiral parylene polymers on surfaces with tunable length, pitch, and higher&#8208;order mesoscale morphologies by altering the chirality of the template and/or the precursor is described. A phenomenon of chirality transfer from molecular to mesoscale level takes places during chemical vapor deposition, allowing for detection of weak chiral signals on such surfaces.








Abstract
Mesoscale chiral materials are prepared by lithographic methods, assembly of chiral building blocks, and through syntheses in the presence of polarized light. Typically, these processes result in micrometer&#8208;sized structures, require complex top&#8211;down manipulation, or rely on tedious asymmetric separation. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization of chiral precursors into supported films of liquid crystals (LCs) are discovered to result in superhierarchical arrangements of enantiomorphically pure nanofibers. Depending on the molecular chirality of the 1&#8208;hydroxyethyl [2.2]paracyclophane precursor, extended arrays of enantiomorphic nanohelices are formed from achiral nematic templates. Arrays of chiral nanohelices extend over hundreds of micrometers and consistently display enantiomorphic micropatterns. The pitch of individual nanohelices depends on the enantiomeric excess and the purity of the chiral precursor, consistent with the theoretical model of a doubly twisted LC director configuration. During CVD of chiral precursors into cholesteric LC films, aspects of molecular and mesoscale asymmetry combine constructively to form regularly twisted nanohelices. Enantiomorphic surfaces permit the tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, such as the asymmetric induction of weak chiral systems.

         <title>Single&#8208;, Dual&#8208;, Triple, and Quadruple&#8208;Wavelength Surface&#8208;Emitting Lasing in Blue&#8208;Phase Liquid Crystal</title>

A strategy of how to controllably construct a multiwavelength laser, from single&#8208;, dual&#8208;, triple&#8208; to quadruple&#8208;wavelength, in a simple configuration, i.e., a free&#8208;standing blue&#8208;phase liquid crystals film, is presented. The corresponding principle is also investigated.








Abstract
Soft organic lasers with multiwavelength output and high spectral purity are of crucial importance for versatile photonic devices, owing to their monochromaticity, coherence, and high intensity.&#160;However, there remain challenges for the achievement of&#160;surface&#8208;emitting multiwavelength lasing in soft photonic crystals, and the relative mechanisms need to be investigated. Herein, single&#8208;, dual&#8208;, triple&#8208;, and quadruple&#8208;wavelength lasers are successfully achieved in dye&#8208;doped blue&#8208;phase liquid crystal (BPLC) film. The number and wavelength of the lasing peaks can be manipulated by tuning the center of the bandgap, the order parameter of the laser dye, the quality of the resonance cavity, and even the pump energy. For single&#8208;wavelength lasing, &#160;a lasing peak with&#160;an ultranarrow linewidth of 0.04&#160;nm (Q&#8208;factor of 13&#160;454) is achieved. Multiwavelength lasing is attained based on the following aspects: i) the narrow bandgaps of the BPLCs with&#160;full width at half maximum of 14&#8211;20&#160;nm; ii) a laser dye with high gain over a wide wavelength band, having a low&#8208;order parameter in the liquid crystal matrix; iii) appropriate relative positions between the reflection and fluorescence peaks; and iv) the highly ordered crystal lattice of BPLC film. The proposed single&#8208;to&#8208;quadruple&#8208;wavelength surface&#8208;emitting lasers can be employed as coherent light sources for next&#8208;generation optical devices.

         <title>A Novel Technique for Controlling Anisotropic Ion Diffusion: Bulk Single&#8208;Crystalline Metallic Silicon Clathrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic ion&#8208;diffusion process is developed. This technique can homogeneously extract Na+ from a type&#8208;II Si clathrate regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity by skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force. The synthesis concept behind the technique is expected to expose new exploration areas for thermodynamically metastable materials.








Abstract
Na&#8208;free Si clathrates consisting only of Si cages are an allotrope of diamond&#8208;structured Si. This material is promising for various device applications, such as next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. The probable technique for synthesizing Na&#8208;free Si clathrates is to extract Na+ from the Si cages of Na24Si136. Vacuum annealing is presently a well&#8208;known conventional and effective approach for extracting Na. However, this study demonstrates that Na+ cannot be extracted from the surface of a single&#8208;crystalline type&#8208;II metallic Si clathrate (Na24Si136) in areas deeper than 150&#160;&#181;m. Therefore, a novel method is developed to control anisotropic ion diffusion: this is effective for various compounds with a large difference in the bonding strength between their constituent elements, such as Na24Si136 composed of covalent Si cages and weakly trapped Na+. By skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force, Na+ is homogeneously extracted regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity. Additionally, the proposed point defect model is evaluated via density functional theory, and the migration of Na+ between the Si cages is explained. It is expected that the developed experimental and computational techniques would significantly advance material design for synthesizing thermodynamically metastable materials.

         <title>Rapid Identification of DNA Fragments through Direct Sequencing with Electro&#8208;Optical Zero&#8208;Mode Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for flash sequencing of DNA molecules using single&#8208;molecule real&#8208;time sequencing is proposed. Electro&#8208;optical zero&#8208;mode waveguides are presented, which use voltage to efficiently load ultralow inputs (picogram&#8208;to&#8208;nanogram levels) of various&#8208;sized DNA fragments, followed by their optically guided sequencing in just a few minutes.








Abstract
In contrast to sequence&#8208;specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing does not require prior knowledge of the sample for surveying DNA. However, current sequencing technologies demand high inputs for a suitable library preparation, which typically necessitates DNA amplification, even for single&#8208;molecule sequencing methods. Here, electro&#8208;optical zero&#8208;mode waveguides (eZMWs) are presented, which can load DNA into the confinement of zero&#8208;mode waveguides with high efficiency and negligible DNA fragment length bias. Using eZMWs, highly efficient voltage&#8208;induced loading of DNA fragments of various sizes from ultralow inputs (nanogram&#8208;to&#8208;picogram levels) is observed. Rapid DNA fragment identification is demonstrated by burst sequencing of short and long DNA molecules (260 and 20&#160;000&#160;bp) loaded from an equimolar picomolar&#8208;level concentration mixture in just a few minutes. The device allows further studies in which low&#8208;input DNA capture is essential, for example, in epigenetics, where native DNA is required for obtaining modified base information.

         <title>Photopatternable Porous Separators for Micro&#8208;Electrochemical Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photopatterning of a unique porous separator is demonstrated by modifying the chemistry of SU&#8208;8, an epoxy&#8208;derived photoresist, through the addition of an imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid, which serves as a templating agent. The photopatternable SU&#8208;8&#160;separator exhibits good electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical properties, and is integrated and electrochemically validated with nonplanar high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio 3D Li&#8208;ion microbatteries.








Abstract
The miniaturization of electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems, one of the key challenges facing the rapid expansion of the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, has been limited by poor performance of the various energy&#8208;storage components at the micrometer scale. Here, the development of a unique photopatternable porous separator that overcomes the electrolyte difficulties involving resistive losses at small dimensions is reported. The separator is based on modifying the chemistry of SU&#8208;8, an epoxy&#8208;derived photoresist, through the addition of a miscible ionic liquid. The ionic liquid serves as a templating agent, which is selectively removed by solution methods, leaving the SU&#8208;8&#160;scaffold whose interconnected porosity provides ion transport from the confined liquid electrolyte. The photopatternable separator exhibits good electrochemical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability during the operation of electrochemical devices in both 2D and 3D formats. For the latter, the separator demonstrates the ability to form conformal coatings over 3D structures. The development of the photopatternable separator overcomes the electrolyte issues, which have limited progress in the field of micro&#8208;EES.

For the latter, the separator demonstrates the ability to form conformal coatings over 3D structures. The development of the photopatternable separator overcomes the electrolyte issues, which have limited progress in the field of micro-EES.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monolithic All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells with Minimized Optical and Energetic Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic metal&#8208;halide perovskite tandem solar cells reach a power conversion efficiency of 23% after passivating the interfaces of the wide&#8208; and narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites with the C60 electron transport layer and minimizing the optical losses in the cell by using a hydrogenated indium oxide front contact and a thin hole transporting layers.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;based multijunction solar cells are a potentially cost&#8208;effective technology that can help surpass the efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction devices. However, both mixed&#8208;halide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites and lead&#8208;tin narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites suffer from non&#8208;radiative recombination due to the formation of bulk traps and interfacial recombination centers which limit the open&#8208;circuit voltage of sub&#8208;cells and consequently of the integrated tandem. Additionally, the complex optical stack in a multijunction solar cell can lead to losses stemming from parasitic absorption and reflection of incident light which aggravates the current mismatch between sub&#8208;cells, thereby limiting the short&#8208;circuit current density of the tandem. Here, an integrated all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell is presented that uses surface passivation strategies to reduce non&#8208;radiative recombination at the perovskite&#8208;fullerene interfaces, yielding a high open&#8208;circuit voltage. By using optically benign transparent electrode and charge&#8208;transport layers, absorption in the narrow&#8208;bandgap sub&#8208;cell is improved, leading to an improvement in current&#8208;matching between sub&#8208;cells. Collectively, these strategies allow the development of a monolithic tandem solar cell exhibiting a power&#8208;conversion efficiency of over 23%.

         <title>Multifunctional Biomedical Materials Derived from Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;function relationship of some important biological membranes, such as various cell membranes, extracellular vesicles, and membranes from bacteria and organelles are reviewed, and selected literature examples of multifunctional biomaterials derived from biological membranes for biomedical applications are also highlighted. Finally, perspectives and challenges associated with the clinical applications of biological&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived materials are discussed.








Abstract
The delicate structure and fantastic functions of biological membranes are the successful evolutionary results of a long&#8208;term natural selection process. Their excellent biocompatibility and biofunctionality are widely utilized to construct multifunctional biomedical materials mainly by directly camouflaging materials with single or mixed biological membranes, decorating or incorporating materials with membrane&#8208;derived vesicles&#160;(e.g., exosomes), and designing multifunctional materials with the structure/functions of biological membranes. Here, the structure&#8211;function relationship of some important biological membranes and biomimetic membranes are discussed, such as various cell membranes, extracellular vesicles, and membranes from bacteria and organelles. Selected literature examples of multifunctional biomaterials derived from biological membranes for biomedical applications, such as drug&#8208; and gene&#8208;delivery systems, tissue&#8208;repair scaffolds, bioimaging, biosensors, and biological detection, are also highlighted. These designed materials show excellent properties, such as long circulation time, disease&#8208;targeted therapy, excellent biocompatibility, and selective recognition. Finally, perspectives and challenges associated with the clinical applications of biological&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived materials are discussed.

         <title>Mechanically Guided Hierarchical Assembly of 3D Mesostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D), hierarchical micro/nanostructures formed with advanced functional materials are of growing interest due to their broad potential utilities in electronics, robotics, battery technology, and biomedical engineering. Among various strategies in 3D micro/nanofabrication, a set of methods based on compressive buckling offers wide&#8208;ranging material compatibility, fabrication scalability, and precise process control. Previously reported works of this type rely on a single, planar prestretched elastomeric platform to transform thin&#8208;film precursors with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layouts into 3D architectures. The simple planar configuration of bonding sites between these precursors and their assembly substrates prevents realization of certain types of complex 3D geometries. In this paper we report a set of hierarchical assembly concepts that leverage multiple layers of prestretched elastomeric substrates to induce not only compressive buckling of 2D precursors bonded to them but also of themselves, thereby creating 3D mesostructures mounted at multiple levels of 3D frameworks with complex, elaborate configurations. Control over strains used in these processes provides reversible access to multiple different 3D layouts in a given structure. Examples to demonstrate these ideas through both experimental and computational results span vertically aligned helices to closed 3D cages, selected for their relevance to 3D conformal bio&#8208;interfaces and multifunctional microsystems.

         <title>Zero Bias Power Detector Circuits based on MoS2 Field Effect Transistors on Wafer&#8208;Scale Flexible Substrates</title>

Abstract
We demonstrate the design, fabrication, and characterization of wafer&#8208;scale, zero&#8208;bias power detectors based on two&#8208;dimensional MoS2 field effect transistors (FETs). The MoS2 FETs are fabricated using a wafer&#8208;scale process on 8&#160;&#956;m thick Polyimide film, which in principle serves as flexible substrate. The performances of two CVD&#8208;MoS2 sheets, grown with different processes and showing different thicknesses, are analyzed and compared from the single device fabrication and characterization steps to the circuit level. The power detector prototypes exploit the nonlinearity of the transistors above the cut&#8208;off frequency of the devices. The proposed detectors are designed employing a transistor model based on measurement results. The fabricated circuits operate in Ku&#8208;band between 12 and 18&#160;GHz, with a demonstrated voltage responsivity of 45&#160;V/W at 18&#160;GHz in the case of monolayer MoS2 and 104&#160;V/W at 16&#160;GHz in the case of multilayer MoS2, both achieved without applied DC bias. They are the best performing power detectors fabricated on flexible substrate reported to date. The measured dynamic range exceeds 30&#160;dB outperforming other semiconductor technologies like silicon complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits and GaAs Schottky diodes.

         <title>From p&#8208; to n&#8208;Type Mixed Conduction in Isoindigo&#8208;Based Polymers through Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic mixed ionic and electronic conductors are of significant interest for bioelectronic applications. Here, we use three different isoindigoid building blocks to obtain polymeric mixed conductors with vastly different structural and electronic properties which can be further fine&#8208;tuned through the choice of comonomer unit. We show how careful design of the isoindigoid scaffold can afford highly planar polymer structures with high degrees of electronic delocalization, while subtle structural modifications can control the dominant charge carrier (hole or electron) when probed in organic electrochemical transistors. We employ a combination of experimental and computational techniques to probe electrochemical, structural and mixed ionic and electronic properties of the polymer series which in turn allows us to derive important structure&#8208;property relations for this promising class of materials in the context of organic bioelectronics. Ultimately, we use these findings to outline robust molecular design strategies for isoindigo&#8208;based mixed conductors that can support efficient p&#8208;type, n&#8208;type and ambipolar transistor operation in an aqueous environment.

Abstract
Mechanically flexible and conformable materials and integrated devices have found diverse applications in personalized healthcare as diagnostics and therapeutics, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine constructs, surgical tools, secure systems, and assistive technologies. In order to impart optimal mechanical properties to the (bio)materials used in these applications, various strategies have been explored &#8211; from composites to structural engineering. In recent years, geometric cuts inspired by the art of paper&#8208;cutting, referred to as kirigami, have provided innovative opportunities for conferring precise mechanical properties via material removal. Kirigami&#8208;based approaches have been used for device design in areas ranging from soft bioelectronics to energy storage. In this review, we discuss the principles of kirigami&#8208;inspired engineering specifically for biomedical applications. We cover factors pertinent to their design, including cut geometry, materials, and fabrication, and the effect these parameters have on their properties and configurations. Examples of kirigami designs in healthcare are presented, such as various form factors of sensors (on skin, wearable), implantable devices, therapeutics, surgical procedures, and cellular scaffolds for regenerative medicine. Finally, the challenges and future scope for the successful translation of these biodesign concepts to broader deployment are discussed.

         <title>High&#8208;strength and Injectable Supramolecular Hydrogel Self&#8208;Assembled by Monomeric Nucleoside for Tooth Extraction Wound Healing</title>

Abstract
Hydrogels with high mechanical strength and injectability have attracted extensive attention in the field of biomedical tissue engineering. However, endowing a hydrogel with both properties is challenging because they are generally inversely related. In this work, by constructing a multi&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonding system, a high&#8208;strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel was successfully fabricated, which was self&#8208;assembled in a single step using a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;deoxyadenosine, 2&#8208;FA) and distilled water (dH2O)/phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as the solvent. Its storage modulus reached 1&#160;MPa at a concentration of 5.0 wt%, which is the largest reported for a supramolecular hydrogel including an ultra&#8208;low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (MW&lt;300) gelator. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent shear&#8208;thinning injectability, converting from a liquid to a gel state in seconds after injection at 37&#176;C. Crystal structural analogy analysis and molecular dynamics simulation revealed that the multi&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonding system was essentially based on the synergistic interactions between the double NH2 groups, water molecules, and 2&#8217;&#8208;F atoms. Furthermore, the 2&#8208;FA hydrogel also exhibited excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial activity, indicating its suitability for application in tooth&#8208;extraction wounds. The in vivo animal experiments showed that the 2&#8208;FA hydrogel showed better socket healing performance after molar extraction in rats, compared to natural healing and the commercial hemorrhage agent gelatin sponge. Furthermore, it exhibited faster degradation and induced less osteoclastic activity and inflammatory infiltration, resulting in more complete bone healing. In summary, this study proposed a comprehensive strategy for developing a multifunctional, high&#8208;strength, and injectable supramolecular hydrogel for various biomedical engineering applications.

         <title>Cascade&#8208;targeting Poly(amino acid) Nanoparticles Eliminate Intracellular Bacteria via on&#8208;site Antibiotic Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intracellular bacteria in latent or dormant states tolerate high&#8208;dose antibiotics. Fighting against these opportunistic bacteria has been a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, we design a cascade&#8208;targeting drug delivery system (DDS) that can sequentially target macrophages and intracellular bacteria, exhibiting on&#8208;site drug delivery. The DDS is fabricated by encapsulating rifampicin (Rif) into mannose&#8208;decorated poly(&#945;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;phenylalanine)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acryloyl&#8208;D&#8208;aminoalanine) nanoparticles, denoted as Rif@FAM NPs. The mannose units on Rif@FAM NPs guide the initial macrophage&#8208;specific uptake and intracellular accumulation. After the uptake, the detachment of mannose in acidic phagolysosome via Schiff base cleavage exposes the D&#8208;aminoalanine moieties, which subsequently steer the NPs to escape from lysosomes and target intracellular bacteria through peptidoglycan&#8208;specific binding, as evidenced by the in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ co&#8208;localization using confocal, flow cytometry, and TEM. Through the on&#8208;site Rif delivery, Rif@FAM NPs show superior in vitro and in vivo elimination efficiency than the control groups of free Rif or the DDSs lacking the macrophages&#8208; or bacteria&#8208;targeting moieties. Furthermore, Rif@FAM NPs remodel the innate immune response of the infected macrophages by up&#8208;regulating the M1/M2 polarization, resulting in a reinforced antibacterial capacity. Therefore, this biocompatible DDS enabling macrophages and bacteria targeting in a cascade manner provides a new outlook for the therapy of intracellular pathogen infection.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Liquid Crystal Printheads for Spatial and Temporal Control of Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymerization reactions triggered by stimuli play a pivotal role in material science, with applications ranging from lithography to biomedicine to adaptive materials. However, the development of chemically&#8208;triggered, stimuli&#8208;responsive systems that can confer spatial and temporal control on polymerization remains a challenge. Herein, chemical stimuli&#8208;induced polymerization based on a liquid crystal (LC) printhead is presented. The LC responds to a local chemical stimulus at its aqueous interface, resulting in the ejection of initiator into solution to trigger polymerization. Various LC printhead geometries are designed, allowing programming of (i) bulk solution polymerization, (ii) synthesis of a thin surface&#8208;confined polymeric coating, (iii) polymerization&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers to form various nanostructures (sphere, worm&#8208;like and vesicles), and (iv) three&#8208;dimensional (3D) polymeric structures printed according to local solution conditions. The approach is demonstrated using amphiphiles, multivalent ions and biomolecules as stimuli.

         <title>Multilayer Reservoir Computing Based on Ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 for Hierarchical Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Dynamic physical systems such as reservoir computing (RC) architectures have shown great prospect in temporal information processing, whereas hierarchical information processing capability is still lacking due to the absence of advanced multilayer reservoir elements. Here, a stackable reservoir system is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 devices with voltage input and output, which is realized by dynamic voltage division between a ferroelectric field effect transistor and a planar device and therefore allows the reservoirs to cascade, enabling multilayer reservoir computing. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high harmonic generation in the first layer as a result of inherent nonlinearity of the reservoir, and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect was realized where higher&#8208;frequency components are progressively filtered in deeper&#8208;layer RCs. Time series prediction and waveform classification tasks have also been demonstrated, serving as evidence for the memory capacity and computing capability of the deep reservoir architecture. This work could provide a promising pathway in exploiting emerging 2D materials and dynamics for advanced neuromorphic computing architectures.

         <title>Biomimetic Human lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip with Colorful Displaying Microphysiological Breath</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models hold great promise for disease modeling and drug screening in the past decade. Herein, inspired by the iridescence phenomenon of soap bubbles, we present a novel biomimetic 3D microphysiological lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip system with breathing visuality. The system with an array of pulmonary alveoli at the physiological scale was constructed and coated with structural color materials. Cyclic deformation was induced by regular airflow, resembling the expansion and contraction of the alveoli during the rhythmic breathing. As the deformation were accompanied with corresponding synchronous shifts in the structural colors, the constructed system offered the self&#8208;reporting of cell mechanics and enabled real&#8208;time monitoring of the cultivation process. Using this system, we have investigated the dynamic relationships between color atlas and disease symptoms, showing the essential role of mechanical stretch in the phenotypes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. These features make this human lung system ideal in biological study, disease monitoring and drug discovery.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung-on-a-chip models hold great promise for disease modeling and drug screening in the past decade. Herein, inspired by the iridescence phenomenon of soap bubbles, we present a novel biomimetic 3D microphysiological lung-on-a-chip system with breathing visuality. The system with an array of pulmonary alveoli at the physiological scale was constructed and coated with structural color materials. Cyclic deformation was induced by regular airflow, resembling the expansion and contraction of the alveoli during the rhythmic breathing. As the deformation were accompanied with corresponding synchronous shifts in the structural colors, the constructed system offered the self-reporting of cell mechanics and enabled real-time monitoring of the cultivation process. Using this system, we have investigated the dynamic relationships between color atlas and disease symptoms, showing the essential role of mechanical stretch in the phenotypes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. These features make this human lung system ideal in biological study, disease monitoring and drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Jammed Micro&#8208;Flake Hydrogel for 4D Living Cell Bioprinting</title>

Abstract
Four&#8208;dimensional (4D) bioprinting is promising to build cell&#8208;laden constructs (bioconstructs) with complex geometries and functions for tissue/organ regeneration applications. The development of hydrogel&#8208;based 4D bioinks, especially those allowing living cell printing, with easy preparation, defined composition, and controlled physical properties is critically important for 4D bioprinting. Here, a single&#8208;component jammed micro&#8208;flake hydrogel (MFH) system with heterogeneous size distribution, which differs from the conventional granular microgel, has been developed as a new cell&#8208;laden bioink for 4D bioprinting. This jammed cytocompatible MFH features scalable production and straightforward composition with shear&#8208;thinning, shear&#8208;yielding, and rapid self&#8208;healing properties. As such, it can be smoothly printed into stable 3D bioconstructs, which can be further crosslinked to form a gradient in crosslinking density when a photoinitiator and a UV absorber are incorporated. After being subject to shape morphing, a variety of complex bioconstructs with well&#8208;defined configurations and high cell viability were obtained. Based on this system, 4D cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation was demonstrated as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept. The establishment of this versatile new 4D bioink system may open up a number of applications in tissue engineering.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanoerythrosome&#8208;Coated Aptamer&#8208;DNA Tetrahedron/Maytansine Conjugates: pH&#8208;Responsive and Targeted Cytotoxicity for HER2&#8208;positive Breast Cancer</title>

Abstract
DNA materials have emerged as potential nanocarriers for targeted cancer therapy with superior biological applications to precisely deliver cargo with specific purpose. However, many DNA carriers have constrained ability to carry sufficient dose of drugs, and their short half&#8208;life and low bioavailability due to the interception by the reticuloendothelial system and blood clearance further limit their clinical translations. To address these issues, our study employed a HER2&#8208;targeted DNA aptamer modified tetrahedral framework nucleic acid (HApt&#8208;tFNA) as a drug delivery system, and combined maytansine (DM1) and HApt&#8208;tFNA to develop the HApt&#8208;DNA tetrahedron/DM1 conjugate (HApt&#8208;tFNA@DM1, HTD, HApDC) nanomedicine for targeted therapy of HER2&#8208;positive cancer. To optimize the pharmacokinetics and tumor&#8208;aggregation of HTD, a biomimetic camouflage was applied to embed HTD. The biomimetic camouflage was constructed by merging the red blood cell (RBC) membrane with pH&#8208;responsive functionalized synthetic liposomes thus with excellent performance of chemotherapeutic drug delivery and tumor&#8208;stimulated drug release. In xenograft mice models, the hybrid erythrosome&#8208;based nanoparticles showed better inhibition of HER2&#8208;positive cancer than other drug formulations. More importantly, not like other therapeutics, this novel nanomedicine exhibited superior biosafety and did not induce any overt side effects. With the strengths of precise delivery, increased drug loading, more sensitive tumor probing and prolonged circulation time to exert long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;tumor effects, the HApDC represents a promising nanomedicine to treat HER2&#8208;positive tumors. Notably, this study is the first to develop a dual&#8208;targeting nanoparticle by combining pH&#8208;sensitive biomimetic camouflage and HApDC, initiating an important step towards the developments and applications of DNA&#8208;based medicine and biomimetic cell membrane materials in cancer treatment and other potential biological applications in the future.

         <title>Machine Learning Guided Synthesis of Flash Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Advances in nanoscience have enabled the synthesis of nanomaterials, such as graphene, from low&#8208;value or waste materials through flash Joule heating. Though this capability is promising, the complex and entangled variables that govern nanocrystal formation in the Joule heating process remain poorly understood. In this work, we construct machine learning (ML) models to explore the factors that drive the transformation of amorphous carbon into graphene nanocrystals during flash Joule heating. An XGBoost regression model of crystallinity achieves an r2 score of 0.8051 &#177; 0.054. Feature importance assays and decision trees extracted from these models reveal key considerations in the selection of starting materials and the role of stochastic current fluctuations in flash Joule heating synthesis. Furthermore, partial dependence analyses demonstrate the importance of charge and current density as predictors of crystallinity, implying a progression from reaction&#8208;limited to diffusion&#8208;limited kinetics as flash Joule heating parameters change. Finally, we show a practical application of the ML models by using Bayesian meta&#8208;learning algorithms to automatically improve bulk crystallinity over many Joule heating reactions. These results illustrate the power of ML as a tool to analyze complex nanomanufacturing processes and enable the synthesis of 2D crystals with desirable properties by flash Joule heating.

         <title>Theory of Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We&#160;provide a critical overview of the theory of the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, i.e., phenomena in which the chirality of molecular species imparts significant spin selectivity to various electron processes. Based on discussions in a recently held workshop, and further work published since, we&#160;review the status of CISS effects &#8208; in electron transmission, electron transport, and chemical reactions. For each, we&#160;provide a detailed discussion of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in theoretical understanding and identify remaining challenges and research opportunities.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of 2D Nanomaterial Field&#8208;Effect Transistor Sensors: Fundamentals and Translation across the Innovation Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D nanomaterials are analyzed fundamentally for their field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) and tunneling FET (TFET) sensor applications. With molecular engineering of specific probes, they hold great potential for intelligent management of water by detecting water contaminants with both high sensitivity and high selectivity. Major challenges and opportunities for designing and fabricating 2D nanomaterial FET/TFET sensors with superior performance are also outlined.








Abstract
Over the last decade, 2D layered nanomaterials have attracted significant attention across the scientific community due to their rich and exotic properties. Various nanoelectronic devices based on these 2D nanomaterials have been explored and demonstrated, including those for environmental applications. Here, the fundamental attributes of 2D layered nanomaterials for field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) sensors and tunneling FET (TFET) sensors, which provide versatile detection of water contaminants such as heavy&#8208;metal ions, bacteria, nutrients, and organic pollutants, are discussed. The major challenges and opportunities are also outlined for designing and fabricating 2D nanomaterial FET/TFET sensors with superior performance. Translation of these FET/TFET sensors from fundamental research to applied technology is illustrated through a case study on graphene&#8208;based real&#8208;time FET water sensors. A second case study centers on large&#8208;scale sensor networks for water&#8208;quality monitoring to enable intelligent drinking water and river&#8208;water systems. Overall, 2D nanomaterial FET sensors have significant potential for enabling a human&#8208;centered intelligent water system that can likely be applied to other precarious water supplies around the globe.

         <title>Deterministic Shallow Dopant Implantation in Silicon with Detection Confidence Upper&#8208;Bound to 99.85% by Ion&#8211;Solid Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;chip electrodes are employed to signal near&#8208;surface single&#8208;ion implantation in silicon. A physical model of the signals provides insights into the ion stopping trajectories within the silicon chip and reveals greater than 99.8% single&#8208;ion&#8208;detection confidence. The study demonstrates the feasibility of controlled scalable dopant architecture engineering for classical and quantum silicon devices.








Abstract
Silicon chips containing arrays of single dopant atoms can be the material of choice for classical and quantum devices that exploit single donor spins. For example, group&#8208;V donors implanted in isotopically purified 28Si crystals are attractive for large&#8208;scale quantum computers. Useful attributes include long nuclear and electron spin lifetimes of 31P, hyperfine clock transitions in 209Bi or electrically controllable 123Sb nuclear spins. Promising architectures require the ability to fabricate arrays of individual near&#8208;surface dopant atoms with high yield. Here, an on&#8208;chip detector electrode system with 70&#160;eV root&#8208;mean&#8208;square noise (&#8776;20 electrons) is employed to demonstrate near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature implantation of single 14&#160;keV 31P+ ions. The physics model for the ion&#8211;solid interaction shows an unprecedented upper&#8208;bound single&#8208;ion&#8208;detection confidence of 99.85 &#177; 0.02% for near&#8208;surface implants. As a result, the practical controlled silicon doping yield is limited by materials engineering factors including surface gate oxides in which detected ions may stop. For a device with 6&#160;nm gate oxide and 14&#160;keV 31P+ implants, a yield limit of 98.1% is demonstrated. Thinner gate oxides allow this limit to converge to the upper&#8208;bound. Deterministic single&#8208;ion implantation can therefore be a viable materials engineering strategy for scalable dopant architectures in silicon devices.

         <title>Stapled Liposomes Enhance Cross&#8208;Priming of Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antigen&#8208;capturing stapled liposome (ACSL) with robust structure and bioactive surface that can capture and transport tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) from lysosomes to cytoplasm in dendritic cells, thereby enhancing the TAA cross&#8208;presentation for effective radio&#8208;immunotherapy is demonstrated.








Abstract
The release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) and their cross&#8208;presentation in dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for radio&#8208;immunotherapy. However, the irradiation resistance of tumor cells usually results in limited TAA generation and release. Importantly, TAAs internalized by DCs are easily degraded in lysosomes, resulting in unsatisfactory extent of TAA cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, an antigen&#8208;capturing stapled liposome (ACSL) with a robust structure and bioactive surface is developed. The ACSLs capture and transport TAAs from lysosomes to the cytoplasm in DCs, thereby enhancing TAA cross&#8208;presentation. l&#8208;arginine encapsulated in ACSLs induces robust T cell&#8208;dependent antitumor response and immune memory in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice after local irradiation, resulting in significant tumor suppression and an abscopal effect. Replacing l&#8208;arginine with radiosensitizers, photosensitizers, and photothermal agents may make ACSL a universal platform for the rapid development of various combinations of anticancer therapies.

         <title>Deciphering Nanoparticle Trafficking into Glioblastomas Uncovers an Augmented Antitumor Effect of Metronomic Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The underlying fate of surface&#8208;modified lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles is directly observed in an intracranial glioblastoma xenograft model. An augmented antitumor effect is further validated directly on glioma cells from the metronomic chemotherapy administration using nanoparticles.








Abstract
Nanoparticles have been explored in glioblastomas as they can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier and target glioblastoma selectively. However, direct observation of nanoparticle trafficking into glioblastoma cells and their underlying intracellular fate after systemic administration remains uncharacterized. Here, based on high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy experiments of an intracranial glioblastoma model, it is shown that ligand&#8208;modified nanoparticles can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier, endocytose into the lysosomes of glioblastoma cells, and undergo endolysosomal escape upon photochemical ionization. Moreover, an optimal dose of metronomic chemotherapy using dual&#8208;drug&#8208;loaded nanocarriers can induce an augmented antitumor effect directly on tumors, which has not been recognized in previous studies. Metronomic chemotherapy enhances antitumor effects 3.5&#8208;fold compared with the standard chemotherapy regimen using the same accumulative dose in vivo. This study provides a conceptual framework that can be used to develop metronomic nanoparticle regimens as a safe and viable therapeutic strategy for treating glioblastomas and other advanced&#8208;stage solid tumors.

         <title>Bioinspired Quasi&#8208;3D Multiplexed Anti&#8208;Counterfeit Imaging via Self&#8208;Assembled and Nanoimprinted Photonic Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite lattice photonic crystal architecture can realize polarization&#8208;sensitive multichannel image encodings designed by self&#8208;assembling and nanoimprinting technique. This strategy is low cost, high yield, and scalable, leading to innovative anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology with efficient and handy fabrication.








Abstract
Innovative multiplexing technologies based on nano&#8208;optics for anti&#8208;counterfeiting have been proposed as overt and covert technologies to secure products and make them difficult to counterfeit. However, most of these nano&#8208;optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are metasurfaces and metamaterials with complex and expensive fabrication process, often resulting in materials that are not damage tolerant. Highly efficient anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies with easy fabrication process are targeted for intuitive and effective authentication of banknotes, secure documents, and goods packing. Here, a simple strategy exploiting self&#8208;assembling and nanoimprinting technique to fabricate a composite lattice photonic crystal architecture featuring full spatial control of light, multiplexed full&#8208;pixel imaging, and multichannel cryptography combined with customized algorithms is reported. In particular, the real&#8208;time encryption/recognition of mobile quick response codes and anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels on a postage stamp, encoded by the proposed photonic architecture, are both demonstrated. The wave optics of scattering, diffraction, and polarization process involved are also described, validated with numerical simulations and experiments. By introducing a new degree of freedom in the 3D space, the multichannel image switching exhibits unprecedented variability of encryption, providing a promising roadmap to achieve larger information capacity, better security, and higher definition for the benefit of modern anti&#8208;counterfeiting security.

         <title>Fluidic Manipulating of Printable Zinc Oxide for Flexible Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using the optimized n&#8208;propylamine&#8211;zinc oxide electron transporting layer, an organic solar cell with high power conversion efficiency and outstanding stability is achieved.








Abstract
As a representative electron transporting layer in organic solar cells, zinc oxide (ZnO) can be fabricated by the meniscus&#8208;guided coating with the promotion of sol&#8211;gel technology. In order to fabricate stable and flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the printable ZnO layers, here, a new method for simultaneously manipulating fluidics of the sol&#8211;gel ZnO precursor and optimizing processability of the ZnO layer for flexible OSCs is developed. It is found that the Marangoni recirculation in meniscus and the annealing temperature of the sol&#8211;gel ZnO precursor can be effectively modulated by changing the Lewis base. With the use of propylamine, the high&#8208;quality ZnO layer that is suitable for flexible OSCs can be fabricated through blade coating. Under such a condition, the formation of polar facet in ZnO layer is well restrained, which favors the photostability of the cells. As a result, the best 1.00 cm2 flexible cell outputs a power conversion efficiency of 16.71%, which is the best value till now.

&lt;p&gt;By using the optimized &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-propylamine&#8211;zinc oxide electron transporting layer, an organic solar cell with high power conversion efficiency and outstanding stability is achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a representative electron transporting layer in organic solar cells, zinc oxide (ZnO) can be fabricated by the meniscus-guided coating with the promotion of sol&#8211;gel technology. In order to fabricate stable and flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the printable ZnO layers, here, a new method for simultaneously manipulating fluidics of the sol&#8211;gel ZnO precursor and optimizing processability of the ZnO layer for flexible OSCs is developed. It is found that the Marangoni recirculation in meniscus and the annealing temperature of the sol&#8211;gel ZnO precursor can be effectively modulated by changing the Lewis base. With the use of propylamine, the high-quality ZnO layer that is suitable for flexible OSCs can be fabricated through blade coating. Under such a condition, the formation of polar facet in ZnO layer is well restrained, which favors the photostability of the cells. As a result, the best 1.00 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; flexible cell outputs a power conversion efficiency of 16.71%, which is the best value till now.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Defective Bimetallic Selenides for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic CuInSe2 with Se vacanies (V&#8208;CuInSe2) significantly optimizes the adsorption of CO2 electroreduction intermediates owing to its moderate band center relative to the Fermi level. Meanwhile, hydrogen evolution is suppressed on V&#8208;CuInSe2 due to an energetically unfavorable surface reconstruction after hydrogen adsorption. Consequently, the V&#8208;CuInSe2 achieves a highly active and selective CO generation ability.








Abstract
CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to CO is promising for the carbon cycle but still remains challenging. Au is regarded as the most selective catalyst for CO2RR, but its high cost significantly hinders its industrial application. Herein, the bimetallic CuInSe2 is found to exhibit an Au&#8208;like catalytic feature: i) the interaction of Cu and In orbitals induces a moderate adsorption strength of CO2RR intermediates and favors the reaction pathway; and ii) the hydrogen evolution is energetically unfavorable on CuInSe2, as a surface reconstruction along with high energy change will occur after hydrogen adsorption. Furthermore, the Se vacancy is found to induce an electron redistribution, slightly tune the band structure, and optimize the CO2RR route of bimetallic selenide. Consequently, the Se&#8208;defective CuInSe2 (V&#8208;CuInSe2) achieves a highly selective CO production ability that is comparable to noble metals in aqueous electrolyte, and the V&#8208;CuInSe2 cathode shows a satisfactory performance in an aqueous Zn&#8211;CO2 cell. This work demonstrates that designing cost&#8208;effective catalysts with noble&#8208;metal&#8208;like properties is an ideal strategy for developing efficient electrocatalysts. Moreover, the class of transition bimetallic selenides has shown promising prospects as active and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts owing to their unique structural, electronic, and catalytic properties.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane is fabricated by ionic crosslinking sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) and imidazolium&#8208;functionalized poly(arylene ether sulfone) to aggregate the ion pathways in the membrane through nanophase separation, which results in excellent ion selectivity and high ion conductivity. This membrane shows great potential in osmotic energy conversion, which maximum power density can be up to 16.72 W m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;governed ion transport is crucial to numerous industries, and the advanced membrane is the essential component. In nature, the efficient and selective ion transport is mainly governed by the charged ion channels located in cell membrane, indicating the architecture with functional differentiation. Inspired by this architecture, a membrane by ionic crosslinking sulfonated poly(arylene ether ketone) and imidazolium&#8208;functionalized poly(arylene ether sulfone) is designed and fabricated to make full use of the charges. This ionic crosslinking is designed to realize nanophase separation to aggregate the ion pathways in the membrane, which results in excellent ion selectivity and high ion conductivity. With the excellent ion transport behavior, ionic crosslinking membrane shows great potential in osmotic energy conversion, which maximum power density can be up to 16.72 W m&#8722;2. This design of ionic crosslinking&#8208;induced nanophase separation offers a roadmap for ion transport promotion.

         <title>Selective Antisite Defect Formation in WS2 Monolayers via Reactive Growth on Dilute W&#8208;Au Alloy Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisite defects in monolayer WS2 are selectively formed with a nonequilibrium synthesis strategy that can reduce their formation energy via W&#8208;poor growth conditions achieved by limiting the available surface W concentration on a W/Au alloy. A high density of SW and S2W antisite defects can be obtained and identified in monolayer WS2 that are sufficient to induce localized defect states in the bandgap.








Abstract
Defects are ubiquitous in 2D materials and can affect the structure and properties of the materials and also introduce new functionalities. Methods to adjust the structure and density of defects during bottom&#8208;up synthesis are required to control the growth of 2D materials with tailored optical and electronic properties. Here, the authors present an Au&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition approach to selectively form SW and S2W antisite defects, whereby one or two sulfur atoms substitute for a tungsten atom in WS2 monolayers. Guided by first&#8208;principles calculations, they describe a new method that can maintain tungsten&#8208;poor growth conditions relative to sulfur via the low solubility of W atoms in a gold/W alloy, thereby significantly reducing the formation energy of the antisite defects during the growth of WS2. The atomic structure and composition of the antisite defects are unambiguously identified by Z&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy, and their total concentration is statistically determined, with levels up to &#8776;5.0%. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations further verified these antisite defects and revealed the localized defect states in the bandgap of WS2 monolayers. This bottom&#8208;up synthesis method to form antisite defects should apply in the synthesis of other 2D materials.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Probe: Intraoperative Pathological Fluorescent Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer via Specific Cathepsin E</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic AIE&#8208;active probe is developed by integrating a biological penetration unit, a cell penetrating peptide, which realizes efficient cell&#8208;penetration ability, with in situ generation of high&#8208;fidelity AIE signals for long&#8208;term tracking of the endogenous overexpressed Cathepsin E enzyme in human PC cells, achieving the intraoperative pathological diagnosis of pancreatic cancer section, and succeeding in tracking xenograft&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing nude BALB/C mice.








Abstract
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most devastating malignant tumors. However, fluorescence probes for early clinical diagnosis of PC often encounter difficulties in accuracy and penetrability. In this work, an enzyme&#8208;activated aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) probe, QM&#8211;HSP&#8211;CPP, for high&#8208;contrast fluorescence diagnosis of PC is developed by monitoring specific overexpressed enzyme Cathepsin E (CTSE). The probe is composed of an AIE fluorophore QM&#8211;COOH (QM = quinoline&#8211;malononitrile), CTSE&#8208;triggered hydrophobic peptide (HSP), and hydrophilic biocompatible cell penetrating peptide (CPP). The CPP unit can well&#8208;modulate the molecular dispersion properties, giving initial fluorescence&#8208;off state in the aqueous biosystem, thus endowing high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and finally overcoming the poor targeting selectivity of traditional AIE probes. CPP can ensure cell/tissue penetrating ability, thus allowing on&#8208;site monitoring of endogenous CTSE in PC cells, tissues, and living animal models. When the QM&#8211;HSP&#8211;CPP probe is specifically cleaved by CTSE, it can generate AIE signals in situ with high&#8208;specificity and long&#8208;term tracking ability, and successfully achieve intraoperative diagnosis of human PC sections, tracking PC in heterotopic nude mice models. The CTSE&#8208;enzyme&#8208;triggered AIEgens&#8217; liberation strategy improves accuracy and addresses the penetration problem simultaneously, which can expand the database of multitudinous biocompatible AIE&#8208;active probes, especially for establishing intraoperative pathological fluorescent diagnosis.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of I&#8208;Rich Lithium Argyrodite Glass&#8211;Ceramic Electrolyte with High Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast synthesis of lithium argyrodite Li6&#8211;xPS5&#8211;xI1+x glass&#8211;ceramic electrolytes is accomplished via ultimate&#8208;energy mechanical alloying method within 1 h. A 45% S2&#8211;/I&#8211; disorder at 4d sites together with an ionic conductivity over 2 mS cm&#8211;1 is achieved for the optimal Li5.6PS4.6I1.4. The LiI&#8208;containing anodic interface helps solid&#8208;state batteries demonstrate prominent cycling stability and rate performance.








Abstract
Lithium argyrodites are one of the most promising sulfide electrolytes due to their high ionic conductivity and ductile feature. Among them, Li6PS5I (LPSI) exhibits better stability against Li metal but a rather low ionic conductivity (only &#8776;10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1) because of the absence of S2&#8722;/I&#8722; disorder. Herein, argyrodite Li6&#8722;xPS5&#8722;xI1+x glass&#8211;ceramic electrolytes with high iodine content are synthesized using ultimate&#8208;energy mechanical alloying method. S2&#8722;/I&#8722; disorder is successfully introduced into the system by doping LiI during this one&#8208;pot process. Determined by 6Li magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the introduction of iodine promotes Li+ inter&#8208;cage jumps, leading to an enhanced long&#8208;range Li+ conducting. The Li5.6PS4.6I1.4 glass&#8211;ceramic electrolyte (LPSI1.4&#8208;gc) possesses high ionic conductivity (2.04 mS cm&#8722;1) and excellent stability against Li metal. The Li symmetric cell with the LPSI1.4&#8208;gc electrolyte demonstrates ultralong cycling stability over 3200 h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. LiCoO2/Li6PS5Cl/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery applying LPSI1.4&#8208;gc as the anode interlayer also presents prominent cycling and rate performance. This work provides a novel type of electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and stability against Li metal.

         <title>Probing Electronic States in Monolayer Semiconductors through Static and Transient Third&#8208;Harmonic Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced optical technique is introduced: broadband static and transient third&#8208;harmonic spectroscopies capture clear fingerprints of relevant electronic states in monolayer semiconductors with an unprecedentedly high contrast ratio up to 200 and further offer a dramatic advance in understanding of exciton dynamics with an ultrafast speed of &#8776;1 ps and high modulation depth up to 94%.








Abstract
Electronic states and their dynamics are of critical importance for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Here, various relevant electronic states in monolayer MoS2, such as multiple excitonic Rydberg states and free&#8208;particle energy bands are probed with a high relative contrast of up to &#8805;200 via broadband (from &#8776;1.79 to 3.10 eV) static third&#8208;harmonic spectroscopy (THS), which is further supported by theoretical calculations. Moreover, transient THS is introduced to demonstrate that third&#8208;harmonic generation can be all&#8208;optically modulated with a modulation depth exceeding &#8776;94% at &#8776;2.18&#160;eV, providing direct evidence of dominant carrier relaxation processes associated with carrier&#8211;exciton and carrier&#8211;phonon interactions. The results indicate that static and transient THS are not only promising techniques for the characterization of monolayer semiconductors and their heterostructures, but also a potential platform for disruptive photonic and optoelectronic applications, including all&#8208;optical modulation and imaging.

         <title>A Tri&#8208;Channel Oxide Transistor Concept for the Rapid Detection of Biomolecules Including the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike Protein</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed metal oxide heterojunction channel with a geometrically engineered tri&#8208;channel architecture several millimeters in size, is developed and used as a generic platform for robust, selective, and ultrasensitive detection of various biomolecules. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, selective sensing of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein down to attomolar concentrations in under 2 min is demonstrated.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state transistor sensors that can detect biomolecules in real time are highly attractive for emerging bioanalytical applications. However, combining upscalable manufacturing with the required performance remains challenging. Here, an alternative biosensor transistor concept is developed, which relies on a solution&#8208;processed In2O3/ZnO semiconducting heterojunction featuring a geometrically engineered tri&#8208;channel architecture for the rapid, real&#8208;time detection of important biomolecules. The sensor combines a high electron mobility channel, attributed to the electronic properties of the In2O3/ZnO heterointerface, in close proximity to a sensing surface featuring tethered analyte receptors. The unusual tri&#8208;channel design enables strong coupling between the buried electron channel and electrostatic perturbations occurring during receptor&#8211;analyte interactions allowing for robust, real&#8208;time detection of biomolecules down to attomolar (am) concentrations. The experimental findings are corroborated by extensive device simulations, highlighting the unique advantages of the heterojunction tri&#8208;channel design. By functionalizing the surface of the geometrically engineered channel with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) antibody receptors, real&#8208;time detection of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike S1 protein down to am concentrations is demonstrated in under 2 min in physiological relevant conditions.

         <title>Atomic Visualization and Switching of Ferroelectric Order in &#946;&#8208;In2Se3 Films at the Single Layer Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single layer &#946;&#8242;&#8208; and &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3 films are experimentally validated to host 2D in&#8208;plane anti&#8208;ferroelectric and ferroelectric order, respectively, with structural and spectroscopic evidences characterized by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)/spectroscopy. An electric field&#8208;induced phase transition is also realized via applying an STM tip pulse, demonstrating the manipulation of the ferroelectric polarization with reversible switching.








Abstract
2D ferroelectrics have received wide interest due to the remarkable quantum states of emerging physics at reduced dimensionality, associated with their exotic properties in high&#8208;performance and nonvolatile functional devices. Here, by combing molecular beam epitaxy synthesis and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization, two metastable phases of layered In2Se3 films: &#946;&#8242;&#8208; and &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3 are reported, which develop different types of in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarizations, thus resulting in different striped morphologies. The anti&#8208;ferroelectric order in &#946;&#8242;&#8208;In2Se3 and ferroelectric order of &#946;*&#8208;In2Se3 are identified, respectively, down to the 2D limit by comprehensive investigations of structural and spectroscopic signatures, including the lattice distortion, the spatial profile of images, the formation of domain structure, and the electronic band&#8208;bending by polarization charges at edges. The ferroelectric switching between those two phases are further controlled via applying an electric field generated from the scanning tunneling microscopy tip in a reversible manner. The intriguing tunability between the (anti&#8208;)ferroelectric orders in the 2D limit provides a promising platform for studying the interplay between electronic structure and ferroelectricity in van der Waals materials, and promotes potential development of miniaturized transistors and memory devices based on electric polarizations.

Here, by combing molecular beam epitaxy synthesis and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization, two metastable phases of layered In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films: &#946;&#8242;- and &#946;*-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are reported, which develop different types of in-plane spontaneous polarizations, thus resulting in different striped morphologies. The anti-ferroelectric order in &#946;&#8242;-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ferroelectric order of &#946;*-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are identified, respectively, down to the 2D limit by comprehensive investigations of structural and spectroscopic signatures, including the lattice distortion, the spatial profile of images, the formation of domain structure, and the electronic band-bending by polarization charges at edges. The ferroelectric switching between those two phases are further controlled via applying an electric field generated from the scanning tunneling microscopy tip in a reversible manner. The intriguing tunability between the (anti-)ferroelectric orders in the 2D limit provides a promising platform for studying the interplay between electronic structure and ferroelectricity in van der Waals materials, and promotes potential development of miniaturized transistors and memory devices based on electric polarizations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquid Gating Meniscus&#8208;Shaped Deformable Magnetoelastic Membranes with Self&#8208;Driven Regulation of Gas/Liquid Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid gating magnetoelastic membrane with meniscus&#8208;shaped deformations actuated by magnetic stimuli is reported to actively regulate gas/liquid release. It introduces a universal and new self&#8208;driven strategy for smart liquid gating membranes, combining fast and contactless operation and nonfouling behavior for energy&#8208;saving multiphase fluid transport and separation, and visible gas/liquid mixture content monitoring.








Abstract
Liquid gating membranes have been demonstrated to show unprecedented properties of dynamicity, stability, adaptivity, and stimulus&#8208;responsiveness. Most recently, smart liquid gating membranes have attracted increasing attention to bring some brand&#8208;new properties for real&#8208;world applications, and various environment&#8208;driven systems have been created. Here, a self&#8208;driven system of a smart liquid gating membrane is further developed by designing a new sytem based on a liquid gating magnetoelastic porous membrane with reversible meniscus&#8208;shaped deformations, and it is not subject to the complex gating liquid restriction of magnetorheological fluids. Compared with other systems, this magnetic&#8208;responsive self&#8208;driven system has the advantage that it provides a universal and convenient way to realize active regulation of gas/liquid release. Experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate the stability, the nonfouling behavior, and the tunability of the system. In addition, this system can be used to perfectly open and close gas transport, and the gating pressure threshold for the liquid release can be reduced under the same conditions. Based on the above capabilities, combined with the fast and 3D contactless operation, it will be of benefit in fields ranging from visible gas/liquid mixture content monitoring and energy&#8208;saving multiphase separation, remote fluid release, and beyond.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Resistant Multiresonance TADF Emitter Realizes 40% External Quantum Efficiency in Narrowband Electroluminescence at High Doping Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design tactic to achieve quenching&#8208;resistant multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is proposed by fencing the MR&#8208;skeleton with steric units. Excellent electroluminescence performances are recorded in corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, with record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiencies up to 40.0% and full width at half maximum values of only 25&#160;nm.








Abstract
Multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters manifest great potential for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high exciton&#8208;utilization efficiency and narrowband emission. Nonetheless, their tendency toward self&#8208;quenching caused by strong interchromophore interactions would induce doping sensitivity and deteriorate the device performances, and effective strategy to construct quenching&#8208;resistant emitters without sacrifycing color purity is still to be developed. By segregating the planar MR&#8208;TADF skeleton using two bulky carbazolyl units, herein a highly emissive molecule with enhanced quenching resistance is reported. The steric effect largely removes the formation of detrimental excimers/aggregates, and boosts the performance of the corresponding devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) up to 40.0% and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm, representative of the only example of single OLED that can concurrently achieve narrow bandwidth and high EL efficiency surpassing 40% to date. Even at doping ratio of 30 wt%, the EQEmax is retained to be 33.3% with nearly unchanged emission spectrum. This work provides a viable approach to realize doping&#8208;insensitive MR&#8208;TADF devices with extreme EL efficiency and color purity for high&#8208;end OLED displays.

         <title>Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Dry Transfer of Large&#8208;Scale Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process is developed for dry transfer of large&#8208;scale graphene. With peeling speed and tension control, surface resistance of 9.5 k&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1 is achieved on polyethylene terephthalate/ethylene vinyl acetate, allowing the fabrication of flexible graphene&#8208;based field effect transistors with 100 times lower gate leakage current and near&#8208;zero doping level compared with those fabricated using wet etched graphene samples.








Abstract
A major challenge for graphene applications is the lack of mass production technology for large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;quality graphene growth and transfer. Here, a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) dry transfer process for large&#8208;scale graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition is reported. The process is fast, controllable, and environmentally benign. It avoids chemical contamination and allows the reuse of graphene growth substrates. By controlling tension and speed of the R2R dry transfer process, the electrical sheet resistance is achieved as 9.5 k&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1, the lowest ever reported among R2R dry transferred graphene samples. The R2R dry transferred samples are used to fabricate graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) on polymer. It is demonstrated that these flexible GFETs feature a near&#8208;zero doping level and a gate leakage current one to two orders of magnitude lower than those fabricated using wet&#8208;chemical etched graphene samples. The scalability and uniformity of the R2R dry transferred graphene is further demonstrated by successfully transferring a 3 &#215; 3&#160;in2 sample and measuring its field&#8208;effect mobility with 36 millimeter&#8208;scaled GFETs evenly spaced on the sample. The field&#8208;effect mobility of the R2R dry transferred graphene is determined to be 205 &#177; 36&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1.

         <title>Construction of Interfacial Electric Field via Dual&#8208;Porphyrin Heterostructure Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong interfacial electric field is constructed through the dual&#8208;porphyrin heterostructure of tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) zinc porphyrin (ZnTCPP)/tetrakis (4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin (THPP), which greatly promotes charge separation and transfer. Meanwhile, dual porphyrins possess proper interface match to reduce recombination sites of interface charge carriers. Consequently, ZnTCPP/THPP exhibits an excellent photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 41.4&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, exceeding most of the reported photocatalysts.








Abstract
A dual&#8208;porphyrin heterostructure is successfully constructed by coupling tetrakis (4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) zinc porphyrin (ZnTCPP) with tetrakis (4&#8208;hydroxyphenyl) porphyrin (THPP). The high photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 41.4&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 is obtained for ZnTCPP/THPP under full spectrum, which is &#8776;5.1 and &#8776;17.0 times higher than that of pure ZnTCPP and THPP, respectively. The significantly enhanced activity is mainly attributed to the giant interfacial electric field formed between dual porphyrins, which greatly facilitates efficient charge separation and transfer. Meanwhile, similar conjugated structures of dual porphyrins also provide proper interface match and decrease interface defects, thus inhibiting the recombination of photoproduced carriers. By rationally combining the appropriate band structures and high&#8208;quality interfacial contact of dual porphyrins, this work provides a fresh insight into the interfacial electric field construction to improve the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Single Crystals Heterogeneity Impacts the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Properties of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of heterogeneities in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be enormous at the single&#8208;particle level but is often neglected in characterization due to the lack of microscopes capable of correlated studies on the same crystals. The authors present an analysis platform for correlated, in situ spectroscopy and imaging named MOSAIC, and unveil new heterogeneity&#8211;property relations for two important MOF systems.








Abstract
At present, an enormous characterization gap exists between the study of the crystal structure of a material and its bulk properties. Individual particles falling within this gap cannot be fully characterized in a correlative manner by current methods. The authors address this problem by exploiting the noninvasive nature of optical microscopy and spectroscopy for the correlative analysis of metal&#8208;organic framework particles in situ. They probe the intrinsic as well as extrinsic properties in a correlated manner. The authors show that the crystal shape of MIL&#8208;88A strongly impacts its optical absorption. Furthermore, the question of how homogeneously water is distributed and adsorbed within one of the most promising materials for harvesting water from humid air, MOF&#8208;801, is addressed. The results demonstrate the considerable importance of the particle level and how it can affect the property of the material.

         <title>Design of Materials Configuration for Optimizing Redox&#8208;Based Resistive Switching Memories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Influence of electrode and capping layer materials configuration in HfO2&#8208;based electrochemical metallization memory (ECM) and valence&#8208;change memory (VCM) types of redox&#8208;based resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells is presented. Cyclic voltammetry reveals different interfacial electrochemical redox processes. The modulation of the resistive switching characteristics by varying the capping layer material in a combination with counter(bottom) electrode configurations are demonstrated and highlighted.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;based resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) are based on electrochemical processes of oxidation and reduction within the devices. The selection of materials and material combinations strongly influence the related nanoscale processes, playing a crucial role in resistive switching properties and functionalities. To date, however, comprehensive studies on device design accounting for a combination of factors such as electrodes, electrolytes, and capping layer materials related to their thicknesses and interactions are scarce. In this work, the impact of materials&#8217; configuration on interfacial redox reactions in HfO2&#8208;based electrochemical metallization memory (ECM) and valence&#8208;change memory (VCM) systems is reported. The redox processes are studied by cyclic voltammetry, and the corresponding resistive switching characteristics are investigated. In ECM cells, the overall cell resistance depends on the electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrode. Nonetheless, the capping layer material further influences the cell resistance and the SET and RESET voltages. In VCM systems, the influence of the electrode material configuration is also pronounced, and is capable of modulating the active resistive switching interface. For both types of memory cells, the switching behavior changes significantly with variation of the oxide thickness. The results present important materials selection criteria for rationale design of ReRAM cells for various memristive applications.

         <title>Rational Design of Dot&#8208;on&#8208;Rod Nano&#8208;Heterostructure for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Pivotal Role of Hole Transfer and Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dot&#8208;on&#8208;rod (DOR) nano&#8208;heterostructure is rationally constructed by anchoring multiple ZnSe QDs on a single CdS nanorod. Due to the favored energy level alignment and the good exposure of ZnSe to the surrounding medium, ultrafast (&#8776;2&#160;ps) charge separation and facile hole utilization are realized, which enable effective and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction taking H2O as an electron donor.








Abstract
Inspired by green plants, artificial photosynthesis has become one of the most attractive approaches toward carbon dioxide (CO2) valorization. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) or dot&#8208;in&#8208;rod (DIR) nano&#8208;heterostructures have gained substantial research interest in multielectron photoredox reactions. However, fast electron&#8211;hole recombination or sluggish hole transfer and utilization remains unsatisfactory for their potential applications. Here, the first application of a well&#8208;designed ZnSe/CdS dot&#8208;on&#8208;rods (DORs) nano&#8208;heterostructure for efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction with H2O as an electron donor is presented. In&#8208;depth spectroscopic studies reveal that surface&#8208;anchored ZnSe QDs not only assist ultrafast (&#8776;2&#160;ps) electron and hole separation, but also promote interfacial hole transfer participating in oxidative half&#8208;reactions. Surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy provides a direct image of spatially separated electrons in CdS and holes in ZnSe. Therefore, ZnSe/CdS DORs photocatalyze CO2 to CO with a rate of &#8776;11.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and &#8805;85% selectivity, much higher than that of ZnSe/CdS DIRs or pristine CdS nanorods under identical conditions. Obviously, favored energy&#8208;level alignment and unique morphology balance the utilization of electrons and holes in this nano&#8208;heterostructure, thus enhancing the performance of artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.

         <title>Low&#8208;Threshold, Highly Stable Colloidal Quantum Dot Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Laser enabled by Suppression of Trap&#8208;Assisted Auger Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A short&#8208;wave infrared single&#8208;mode laser is demonstrated based on PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), which exhibit low threshold and highly&#8208;stable performance owing to suppression of trap&#8208;assisted Auger recombination at supra&#8208;nanocrystalline level. PbS CQDs act as a gain medium where their trap states are electronically passivated by the donated electrons from ZnO nanocrystals.








Abstract
Pb&#8208;chalcogenide colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are attractive materials to be used as tuneable laser media across the infrared spectrum. However, excessive nonradiative Auger recombination due to the presence of trap states outcompetes light amplification by rapidly annihilating the exciton population, leading to high gain thresholds. Here, a binary blend is employed of CQDs and ZnO nanocrystals in order to passivate the in&#8208;gap trap states of PbS&#8208;CQD gain medium. Using transient absorption, a fivefold increase is measured in Auger lifetime demonstrating the suppression of trap&#8208;assisted Auger recombination. By doing so, a twofold reduction is achieved in amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold. Finally, by integrating the proposed binary blend to a distributed feedback (DFB) resonator, single&#8208;mode lasing emission is demonstrated at 1650&#160;nm with a linewidth of 1.23&#160;nm (0.62 meV), operating at a low lasing threshold of &#8776;385 &#956;J cm&#8211;2. The Auger suppression in this system has allowed to achieve unprecedented lasing emission stability for a CQD laser with recorded continuous operation of 5 h at room temperature and ambient conditions.

         <title>Coordination Polymer&#8208;Coated CaCO3 Reinforces Radiotherapy by Reprogramming the Immunosuppressive Metabolic Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acidity&#8208;IDO1 modulation nanoparticles (AIM NPs) can effectively promote the transition of immunosuppressive (cold) tumor microenvironment to immune&#8208;activated (hot) one via simultaneous tumor acidity neutralization and Kyn depletion. In synergizing with AIM NPs injection, treatment with external X&#8208;ray irradiation can effectively suppress the growth of irradiated primary tumors, distant unirradiated (metastatic) tumors, and rechallenged (relapsed) tumors by eliciting potent antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy is widely exploited for the treatment of a large range of cancers in clinic, but its therapeutic effectiveness is seriously crippled by the tumor immunosuppression, mainly driven by the altered metabolism of cancer cells. Here, a pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicine is prepared by coating calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles with 4&#8208;phenylimidazole (4PI), an inhibitor against indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO&#8208;1), together with zinc ions via the coordination reaction, aiming at reinforcing the treatment outcome of radiotherapy. The obtained pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicine, coined as acidity&#8208;IDO1&#8208;modulation nanoparticles (AIM NPs), is able to instantly neutralize protons, and release 4PI to suppress the IDO1&#8208;mediated production of kynurenine (Kyn) upon tumor accumulation. As a result, treatment with AIM NPs can remarkably enhance the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy against both murine CT26 and 4T1 tumors by eliciting potent antitumor immunity. Furthermore, it is shown that such combination treatment can effectively suppress the growth of untreated distant tumors via the abscopal effect, and result in immune memory responses to reject rechallenged tumors. This work highlights a novel strategy of simultaneous tumor acidity neutralization and IDO1 inhibition to potentiate radiotherapy, with great promises to suppress tumor metastasis and recurrence by eliciting robust antitumor immunity.

&lt;p&gt;Acidity-IDO1 modulation nanoparticles (AIM NPs) can effectively promote the transition of immunosuppressive (cold) tumor microenvironment to immune-activated (hot) one via simultaneous tumor acidity neutralization and Kyn depletion. In synergizing with AIM NPs injection, treatment with external X-ray irradiation can effectively suppress the growth of irradiated primary tumors, distant unirradiated (metastatic) tumors, and rechallenged (relapsed) tumors by eliciting potent antitumor immunity.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Healing Multifunctional Dressing with Antibacterial Activity for Sutureless Wound Closure and Infected Wound Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;healing elastomer&#8208;based multifunctional wound dressing (MFWD) with desirable mechanical robustness, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity is developed for effective wound management. MFWD assists in contracting wound edges, based on the excellent self&#8208;healing ability of the elastomer. The wound status can also be comprehensively monitored and reported with this MFWD.








Abstract
Wound healing represents a major clinical and public healthcare problem that is frequently challenged by infection risks, detrimental consequences on the surrounding tissues, and difficulties to monitor the healing process. Here we&#160;report on a novel self&#8208;healing, antibacterial, and multifunctional wound dressing for sutureless wound closure and real&#8208;time monitoring of the healing parameters. The self&#8208;healing elastomer contains cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and has high mechanical toughness (35&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), biocompatibility, and outstanding antibacterial activity (bactericidal rate is &#8776;90% in 12 h), enabling the wound dressing to effectively inhibit bacterial growth and accelerate infected wound healing. In vivo tests based on full&#8208;thickness skin incision model shows that the multifunctional wound dressing can help in contracting wound edges and facilitate wound closure and healing, as could be evidenced by notably dense and well&#8208;organized collagen deposition. The test provides an evidence that the integrated sensor array within the multifunctional wound dressing can monitor temperature, pH, and glucose level of the wound area in real&#8208;time, providing reliable and timely information of the condition of the wound. Ultimately, the reported multifunctional dressing would be of high value in managing the burden associated with wound healing via personalised monitoring and treatment approaches, digital and other people&#8208;centred solutions for health care.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cu2O Mesh Pattern on High&#8208;Facet Cu Surface for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined structure with Cu+ and high&#8208;facets is developed via insufficient graphene growth and a postoxidation process. The synthesized catalysts show high ethanol selectivity from the electrochemical CO2 reduction. The enhanced CO binding strength due to the introduction of Cu+ induces stable CO adsorption while maintaining high&#8208;facet properties, resulting in a favorable CO&#8211;CO coupling reaction for C2 formation.








Abstract
Although the electroconversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into ethanol is considered to be one of the most promising ways of using CO2, the ethanol selectivity is less than 50% because of difficulties in designing an optimal catalyst that arise from the complicated pathways for the electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol. Several approaches including the fabrication of oxide&#8208;derived structures, atomic surface control, and the Cu+/Cu interfaces have been primarily used to produce ethanol from CO2. Here, a combined structure with Cu+ and high&#8208;facets as electrocatalysts is constructed by creating high&#8208;facets of wrinkled Cu surrounded by Cu2O mesh patterns. Using chemical vapor deposition graphene growth procedures, the insufficiently grown graphene is used as an oxidation&#8208;masking material, and the high&#8208;facet wrinkled Cu is simultaneously generated during the graphene growth synthesis. The resulting electrocatalyst shows an ethanol selectivity of 43% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is one of the highest ethanol selectivity values reported thus far. This is attributed to the role of Cu+ in enhancing CO binding strength, and the high&#8208;facets, which favor C&#8211;C coupling and the ethanol pathway. This method for generating the combined structure can be widely applicable not only for electrochemical catalysts but also in various fields.

         <title>Spiderweb Nanomechanical Resonators via Bayesian Optimization: Inspired by Nature and Guided by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human creativity, analytical models, and trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimentation have led to groundbreaking achievements in nanotechnology. In this work, machine learning is shown to offer a new path to discovery, complementing the traditional process. A spiderweb&#8208;inspired sensor is designed and fabricated by this strategy achieving world&#8208;class performance. The algorithm finds a novel vibration mechanism, enabling devices isolated from room&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
From ultrasensitive detectors of fundamental forces to quantum networks and sensors, mechanical resonators are enabling next&#8208;generation technologies to operate in room&#8208;temperature environments. Currently, silicon nitride nanoresonators stand as a leading microchip platform in these advances by allowing for mechanical resonators whose motion is remarkably isolated from ambient thermal noise. However, to date, human intuition has remained the driving force behind design processes. Here, inspired by nature and guided by machine learning, a spiderweb nanomechanical resonator is developed that exhibits vibration modes, which are isolated from ambient thermal environments via a novel &#8220;torsional soft&#8208;clamping&#8221; mechanism discovered by the data&#8208;driven optimization algorithm. This bioinspired resonator is then fabricated, experimentally confirming a new paradigm in mechanics with quality factors above 1 billion in room&#8208;temperature environments. In contrast to other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art resonators, this milestone is achieved with a compact design that does not require sub&#8208;micrometer lithographic features or complex phononic bandgaps, making it significantly easier and cheaper to manufacture at large scales. These results demonstrate the ability of machine learning to work in tandem with human intuition to augment creative possibilities and uncover new strategies in computing and nanotechnology.

         <title>Elucidating and Mitigating High&#8208;Voltage Degradation Cascades in Cobalt&#8208;Free LiNiO2 Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2 lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes, which subsequently induces Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults, microscale creep, cracking, and even bending of layers after high&#8208;voltage cycling. By suppressing oxygen evolution, hermetic graphene coatings arrest this degradation cascade, resulting in substantially improved high&#8208;voltage capacity retention.








Abstract
LiNiO2 (LNO) is a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to its exceptionally high capacity and cobalt&#8208;free composition that enables more sustainable and ethical large&#8208;scale manufacturing. However, its poor cycle life at high operating voltages over 4.1&#160;V impedes its practical use, thus motivating efforts to elucidate and mitigate LiNiO2 degradation mechanisms at high states of charge. Here, a multiscale exploration of high&#8208;voltage degradation cascades associated with oxygen stacking chemistry in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2, is presented. Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the local O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition at high states of charge, which subsequently leads to Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults during cycling. This undesirable atomic&#8208;scale structural evolution accelerates microscale electrochemical creep, cracking, and even bending of layers, ultimately resulting in macroscopic mechanical degradation of LNO particles. By employing a graphene&#8208;based hermetic surface coating, oxygen loss is attenuated in LNO at high states of charge, which suppresses the initiation of the degradation cascade and thus substantially improves the high&#8208;voltage capacity retention of LNO. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insight into the high&#8208;voltage degradation of LNO, which will inform ongoing efforts to employ cobalt&#8208;free cathodes in Li&#8208;ion battery technology.

However, its poor cycle life at high operating voltages over 4.1&#160;V impedes its practical use, thus motivating efforts to elucidate and mitigate LiNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; degradation mechanisms at high states of charge. Here, a multiscale exploration of high-voltage degradation cascades associated with oxygen stacking chemistry in cobalt-free LiNiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is presented. Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the local O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition at high states of charge, which subsequently leads to Ni-ion migration and irreversible stacking faults during cycling. This undesirable atomic-scale structural evolution accelerates microscale electrochemical creep, cracking, and even bending of layers, ultimately resulting in macroscopic mechanical degradation of LNO particles. By employing a graphene-based hermetic surface coating, oxygen loss is attenuated in LNO at high states of charge, which suppresses the initiation of the degradation cascade and thus substantially improves the high-voltage capacity retention of LNO. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insight into the high-voltage degradation of LNO, which will inform ongoing efforts to employ cobalt-free cathodes in Li-ion battery technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct&#8208;Bandgap Bilayer WSe2/Microsphere Monolithic Cavity for Low&#8208;Threshold Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)/cavity monolithic cavity is achieved by directly growing single&#8208;domain tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers on single silica microsphere (MS) surfaces. The thermal strain induces bilayer bandgap from indirect to direct, and the cavity confinement factor is also improved, which directly realizes room&#8208;temperature whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode lasing, with a threshold nearly an order of magnitude lower than the existing records.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as widely accepted 2D gain materials in the field of light sources owing to their direct bandgap and high photoluminescence quantum yield. However, the monolayer medium suffers from weak emission because only a single layer of molecules can absorb the pump energy. Moreover, the material degradation when transferring these fragile materials hinders their cooperation with the optical cavity further. In this study, for the first time, a high&#8208;quality monolithic structure is developed by directly growing single&#8208;domain tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers on single silica microsphere (MS) cavities. Such a completely wrapped structure guides the indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bandgap transition of WSe2 bilayers, leading to a significantly improved photoluminescence intensity by about 60&#8208;fold. Moreover, the high&#8208;quality monolithic structure enhances the confinement factor of the cavity by more than 20&#8208;fold. Based on the above advantages, a bilayer WSe2/MS microlaser is realized with an ultralow threshold of 0.72 W&#160;cm&#8722;2, nearly an order of magnitude lower than the existing records. The results demonstrate the possibility of using multilayer TMD materials as 2D gain media and provide insights into a new ultracompact monolithic platform of TMD material/cavity for lasing devices.

         <title>Thermally Controlled Charge&#8208;Carrier Transitions in Disordered PbSbTe Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown experimentally that the carrier type and mobility in Pb&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te thin films can be controlled by annealing the disordered crystal. First&#8208;principles simulations indicate that the unexpected transition from n&#8208; to p&#8208;conduction is caused by a crossover of the predominant point&#8208;defect type with increasing order. Tuning self&#8208;doping properties this way could prove useful for thermoelectric devices and other applications.








Abstract
Binary and ternary chalcogenides have recently attracted much attention due to their wide range of applications including phase&#8208;change memory materials, topological insulators, photonic switches, and thermoelectrics. These applications require a precise control of the number and mobility of charge carriers. Here, an unexpected charge&#8208;carrier transition in ternary compounds from the PbTe&#8211;Sb2Te3 pseudo&#8208;binary line is reported. Upon thermal annealing, sputtered thin films of PbSb2Te4 and Pb2Sb2Te5 undergo a transition in the temperature coefficient of resistance and in the type of the majority charge carriers from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type. These transitions are observed upon increasing structural order within one crystallographic phase. To account for this striking observation, it is proposed that the Fermi energy shifts from the tail of the conduction band to the valence band because different levels of overall structural disorder lead to different predominant types of native point defects. This view is confirmed by an extensive computational study, revealing a transition from excess cations and SbPb for high levels of disorder to PbSb prevailing for low disorder. The findings will help fine&#8208;tune transport properties in certain chalcogenides via proper thermal treatment, with potential benefits for memories, thermoelectric material optimization, and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Silica Membrane as Separator for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled arrays of closely&#8208;packed hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) particles on the cathode surface can serve as ultralight, mechanically robust, and thermally stable separators for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Thanks to their inorganic nature and hierarchically porous structure, the HMS separators display higher electrolyte affinity and ionic conductivity compared to commercial polypropylene separators, endowing LIBs with exceptional rate capability and cycling stability.








Abstract
Commercial polymeric separators in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) typically suffer from limited porosity, low electrolyte wettability, and poor thermal and mechanical stability, which can degrade the battery performance especially at high current densities. Here, the design of hierarchically porous, ultralight silica membranes as separator for high&#8208;performance LIBs is reported through the assembly of hollow mesoporous silica (HMS) particles on the cathode surface. The rich mesopores and large cavity of individual HMS particles provide low&#8208;tortuosity pathways for ionic transport, while simultaneously serving as electrolyte reservoir to further boost the electrochemical kinetics. Moreover, benefiting from their inorganic and hierarchically porous nature, such HMS separators display better electrolyte affinity, thermal stability, and mechanical strength than commercial polypropylene (PP) separators. As a demonstration, LIBs with a LiFePO4 cathode coated with HMS separators exhibit exceptional rate capability and cycling stability, outperforming LIBs with PP and Al2O3&#8208;modified PP separators as well as separators made of solid silica particles.

         <title>Highly Stiff and Stretchable DNA Liquid Crystalline Organogels with Super Plasticity, Ultrafast Self&#8208;Healing, and Magnetic Response Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of DNA soft material driven by supramolecular interactions has been developed. Exceptional stretchability, deformability, plasticity, and ultrafast self&#8208;healing property have been observed due to the formed internal mesophase ordering. Moreover, the DNA&#8208;based liquid crystalline organogels exhibit impressive ultimate tensile strengths and stiffness, rendering the materials the strongest among reported DNA networks.








Abstract
DNA&#8208;based gels are attractive materials as they allow intuitive rational design, respond to external physicochemical stimuli, and show great potential for biomedical applications. However, their relatively poor mechanical properties currently limit their technological application considerably as the latter requires mechanical integrity and tunability. With this work, a DNA organogel is reported that gels through supramolecular interactions, which induce mesophase ordering, and that exhibits exceptional stretchability, deformability, plasticity, and biocompatibility. Moreover, the nature of the supramolecular bond enables complete self&#8208;healing within 3 s. Most importantly, the DNA&#8208;based liquid crystalline organogels exhibit impressive ultimate tensile strengths above 1&#160;MPa, stiffness higher than 20&#160;MPa, and toughness up to 18&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, rendering these materials the strongest among reported DNA networks. In addition, the facile access is demonstrated to composite DNA materials by blending magnetic nanoparticles with the organogel matrix giving access to magnetic field induced actuation. It is believed that these findings contribute significantly to the advancement of DNA gels for their use in smart materials and biomedical applications.

         <title>Giant Thermal Transport Tuning at a Metal/Ferroelectric Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant thermal transport tuning is observed at a metal/ferroelectric interface by switching the ferroelectric polarization orientations. This work shows that surface bound charges at a metal/insulator interface can substantially enhance the interfacial electron&#8211;phonon&#8208;mediated thermal coupling, providing a new route to optimize the thermal transport performance in the next&#8208;generation nanodevices, power electronics, and thermal logic devices.








Abstract
Interfacial thermal transport plays a prominent role in the thermal management of nanoscale objects and is of fundamental importance for basic research and nanodevices. At metal/insulator interfaces, a configuration commonly found in electronic devices, heat transport strongly depends upon the effective energy transfer from thermalized electrons in the metal to the phonons in the insulator. However, the mechanism of interfacial electron&#8211;phonon coupling and thermal transport at metal/insulator interfaces is not well understood. Here, the observation of a substantial enhancement of the interfacial thermal resistance and the important role of surface charges at the metal/ferroelectric interface in an Al/BiFeO3 membrane are reported. By applying uniaxial strain, the interfacial thermal resistance can be varied substantially (up to an order of magnitude), which is attributed to the renormalized interfacial electron&#8211;phonon coupling caused by the charge redistribution at the interface due to the polarization rotation. These results imply that surface charges at a metal/insulator interface can substantially enhance the interfacial electron&#8211;phonon&#8208;mediated thermal coupling, providing a new route to optimize the thermal transport performance in next&#8208;generation nanodevices, power electronics, and thermal logic devices.

         <title>Electrically Tunable and Dramatically Enhanced Valley&#8208;Polarized Emission of Monolayer WS2 at Room Temperature with Plasmonic Archimedes Spiral Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient tailoring of valley&#8208;polarized photoluminescence from monolayer WS2 at room temperature (RT) through surface plasmon&#8211;exciton interactions with plasmonic Archimedes spiral (PAS) nanostructures is achieved in this manuscript. The degree of valley polarization of WS2&#8211;PAS heterostructures at RT can be further enhanced from 40% to 70% by modulating the carrier doping via a backgate field effect transistor (FET) device.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have intrinsic valley degrees of freedom, making them appealing for exploiting valleytronic applications in information storage and processing. WS2 monolayer possesses two inequivalent valleys in the Brillouin zone, each valley coupling selectively with a circular polarization of light. The degree of valley polarization (DVP) under the excitation of circularly polarized light (CPL) is a parameter that determines the purity of valley polarized photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer WS2. Here efficient tailoring of valley&#8208;polarized PL from monolayer WS2 at room temperature (RT) through surface plasmon&#8211;exciton interactions with plasmonic Archimedes spiral (PAS) nanostructures is reported. The DVP of WS2 at RT can be enhanced from &lt;5% to 40% and 50% by using 2 turns (2T) and 4 turns (4T) of PAS, respectively. Further enhancement and control of excitonic valley polarization is demonstrated by electrostatically doping monolayer WS2. For CPL on WS2&#8211;2TPAS heterostructures, the 40% valley polarization is enhanced to 70% by modulating the carrier doping via a backgate, which may be attributed to the screening of momentum&#8208;dependent long&#8208;range electron&#8211;hole exchange interactions. The manifestation of electrically tunable valley&#8208;polarized emission from WS2&#8211;PAS heterostructures presents a new strategy toward harnessing valley excitons for application in ultrathin valleytronic devices.

         <title>Tunable Supramolecular Cavities Molecularly Homogenized in Polymer Membranes for Ultraefficient Precombustion CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with interactive affinity for polymers can be utilized to design novel nanocomposite membranes with true molecular homogeneity, unlike conventional nanoarchitectures that form heterogeneous nanofiller phases within membranes that cause performance and processability issues. By adjusting the OMC cavity size within the membranes, tunable gas transport properties can be obtained for highly molecular&#8208;sieving H2/CO2 separation.








Abstract
Processable molecular&#8208;sieving membranes are important materials for realizing energy&#8208;efficient precombustion CO2 capture during industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production. However, the promising design of mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) that aims to integrate the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of nanoporous architectures with industrial processable polymers still faces performance and fabrication issues due to the formation of segregated nanofiller domains in their polymer matrices. Here, an unconventional nanocomposite membrane design is proposed using soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with tunable open cavity sizes that not only mitigate the formation the discrete nanofiller phases but also deliver distinct molecular&#8208;sieving separations. The versatile organic&#8208;solvent solubility coupled with highly interactive functionalities of OMCs allows them to obtain molecularly homogeneous mixing with matrix polymers and form only one integral continuous phase crucial to the robust processability of polymers. A series of polybenzimidazole&#8208;based molecularly mixed composite membranes (MMCMs) are fabricated via the incorporation of a soluble and thermally stable OMC choice, sulfocalixarenes, with various cavity sizes. These membranes achieve outstanding high&#8208;temperature mixed&#8208;gas H2/CO2 separation performances comparable with several state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art molecular&#8208;sieving membranes owing to effective size&#8208;sieving gas passages through the open or partially&#8208;intruded supramolecular cavities. The broadly tunable structures and functionalities of OMCs would make their MMCMs attractive for other energy&#8208;intensive molecular separations.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Holographic Display and Encryption with Full&#8208;Polarization Degree of Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimalist metasurface assembling geometric phase meta&#8208;atoms in a tetratomic macro pixel is proposed, which enables the full degree of freedom tuning in polarization (orientation, ellipticity, and chirality) and color (real hue, saturation, and brightness) spaces simultaneously. The proposed strategy has great potential in multiplex&#8208;oriented applications, such as holographic data storage and information transfer.








Abstract
Metasurfaces provide a compact and powerful platform for manipulating the fundamental properties of light, and have shown unprecedented capabilities in both optical holographic display and information encryption. For increasing information display/storage capacity, metasurfaces with more polarization manipulation channel and full&#8208;color holographic functionality are now an urgent requirement. Here, a minimalist dielectric metasurface with the capability of full&#8208;color holography encoded with arbitrary polarization is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Without the daunting exploratory and computational problem in nanostructure searching, full&#8208;color holographic images can be multiplexed into arbitrary polarization channels through vectorial ptychography and k&#8208;space ptychography based on tetratomic macropixel geometric phase metasurfaces. Thanks to the full degree of freedom tuning in polarization and color spaces, the application scenarios such as holographic 3D imaging and information encryption are realized. The strategy exhibits promising potential in applications of 3Dl display, augmented/virtual reality, high&#8208;density data storage, and encryption.

Wound Healing
In article number 2106842, Miaomiao Yuan, Daxiang Cui, Hossam Haick, and co&#8208;workers report a novel self&#8208;healing elastomer&#8208;based multifunctional wound dressing (MFWD) with desirable mechanical robustness, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity for effective wound management. MFWD assists in contracting wound edges, based on the excellent self&#8208;healing ability of the elastomer, and enables tracking of the wound health status in real&#8208;time via a set of (bio)chemical and physical sensors integrated therein.

Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2106402, Mark C. Hersam and co&#8208;workers show that lattice oxygen loss plays a critical role in the O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2 lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes, which subsequently induces Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults, microscale electrochemical creep, cracking, and even bending of layers after high&#8208;voltage cycling. By suppressing oxygen evolution, hermetic graphene coatings arrest this degradation cascade, resulting in substantially improved high&#8208;voltage capacity retention.

Near&#8208;Surface Doping
In article number 2103235, David N. Jamieson and co&#8208;workers report that single&#8208;crystal silicon can be configured with arrays of single, near&#8208;surface, dopant atoms using on&#8208;chip electrodes and low&#8208;noise charge&#8208;sensitive electronics to register single&#8208;ion implants. Suitable for integration with a nanostencil scanner to localize the implants, the system makes use of the signal of electron&#8211;hole pairs generated as the ions dissipate their kinetic energy in the crystal. The system can be part of an engineering strategy for high&#8208;confidence fabrication of large&#8208;scale donor arrays to exploit donor spin ensembles in silicon devices.

Molecular Sieves
In article number 2105156, Tai&#8208;Shung Chung and co&#8208;workers show how soluble organic macrocyclic cavitands (OMCs) with interactive affinity for polymers can be utilized to design novel nanocomposite membranes with true molecular homogeneity, unlike conventional nanoarchitectures that form heterogeneous nanofiller phases within membranes that cause performance and processability issues. By adjusting the OMC cavity size within the membranes, tunable gas&#8208;transport properties can be obtained for molecular&#8208;sieving H2/CO2 separation.

2D Materials
In article number 2106674, Kai Xiao and co&#8208;workers develop a nonequilibrium chemical vapor deposition approach for selective formation of antisite defects in atomically thin 2D tungsten sulfide monolayer crystals by regulating the diffusion of tungsten into gold substrates. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for the selective formation of defects in 2D materials by tuning their formation energy during synthesis via choice of substrate and alloy design.

Liquid Gating
Liquid&#8208;gating technology is attracting increasing attention for the delivery of some brand&#8208;new properties for real&#8208;world applications. In article number 2107327, Xu Hou and co&#8208;workers report a self&#8208;driven smart liquid&#8208;gating system, developed by designing a liquid&#8208;gating magnetoelastic porous membrane with reversible meniscus&#8208;shaped deformations. This system provides a universal and convenient way to realize active regulation of gas/liquid release. The illustrated visible gas/liquid&#8208;mixture content monitoring showcases one example of the application of the reported material.

         <title>New Dimension in Magnetism and Superconductivity: 3D and Curvilinear Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapidly developing field of curvilinear magnetism and superconductivity is reviewed. The covered topics range from novel physical concepts for material science through first proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device demonstrations to established technologies of flexible magnetoelectronics. The review is relevant for a broad community of physicists, material scientists, and engineers, targeting fundamental research and technology transfer activities.








Abstract
Traditionally, the primary field, where curvature has been at the heart of research, is the theory of general relativity. In recent studies, however, the impact of curvilinear geometry enters various disciplines, ranging from solid&#8208;state physics over soft&#8208;matter physics, chemistry, and biology to mathematics, giving rise to a plethora of emerging domains such as curvilinear nematics, curvilinear studies of cell biology, curvilinear semiconductors, superfluidity, optics, 2D van der Waals materials, plasmonics, magnetism, and superconductivity. Here, the state of the art is summarized and prospects for future research in curvilinear solid&#8208;state systems exhibiting such fundamental cooperative phenomena as ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and superconductivity are outlined. Highlighting the recent developments and current challenges in theory, fabrication, and characterization of curvilinear micro&#8208; and nanostructures, special attention is paid to perspective research directions entailing new physics and to their strong application potential. Overall, the perspective is aimed at crossing the boundaries between the magnetism and superconductivity communities and drawing attention to the conceptual aspects of how extension of structures into the third dimension and curvilinear geometry can modify existing and aid launching novel functionalities. In addition, the perspective should stimulate the development and dissemination of research and development oriented techniques to facilitate rapid transitions from laboratory demonstrations to industry&#8208;ready prototypes and eventual products.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Changing Particles: From Materials Design and Mechanisms to Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extension of shape&#8208;morphing capabilities to the micro&#8208; and nanoscale has recently enabled novel applications in photonics, microrobotics, biomedicine, and microfluidics. The materials, mechanisms, and fabrication technologies used to create shape&#8208;changing micro&#8208; and nanoparticles are discussed, and key demonstrations in various application areas are summarized comprehensive review.








Abstract
Demands for next&#8208;generation soft and responsive materials have sparked recent interest in the development of shape&#8208;changing particles and particle assemblies. Over the last two decades, a variety of mechanisms that drive shape change have been explored and integrated into particulate systems. Through a combination of top&#8208;down fabrication and bottom&#8208;up synthesis techniques, shape&#8208;morphing capabilities extend from the microscale to the nanoscale. Consequently, shape&#8208;morphing particles are rapidly emerging in a variety of contexts, including photonics, microfluidics, microrobotics, and biomedicine. Herein, the key mechanisms and materials that facilitate shape changes of microscale and nanoscale particles are discussed. Recent progress in the applications made possible by these particles is summarized, and perspectives on their promise and key open challenges in the field are discussed.

         <title>Bioprinting of Complex Multicellular Organs with Advanced Functionality&#8212;Recent Progress and Challenges Ahead</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioprinting has emerged as a promising strategy for fabrication of functional organs in the lab. Until recently, however, this has mostly been restricted to a few miniaturized tissues with rudimentary biological activity. This review discusses a series of milestones that have paved the way for bioprinting of 3D multicellular tissues and organ with advanced levels of biological and architectural mimicry.








Abstract
Bioprinting has emerged as one of the most promising strategies for fabrication of functional organs in the lab as an alternative to transplant organs. While progress in the field has mostly been restricted to a few miniaturized tissues with minimal biological functionality until a few years ago, recent progress has advanced the concept of building three&#8208;dimensional multicellular organ complexity remarkably. This review discusses a series of milestones that have paved the way for bioprinting of tissue constructs that have advanced levels of biological and architectural functionality. Critical materials, engineering and biological challenges that are key to addressing the desirable function of engineered organs are presented. These are discussed in light of the many difficulties to replicate the heterotypic organization of multicellular solid organs, the nanoscale precision of the extracellular microenvironment in hierarchical tissues, as well as the advantages and limitations of existing bioprinting methods to adequately overcome these barriers. In summary, the advances of the field toward realistic manufacturing of functional organs have never been so extensive, and this manuscript serves as a road map for some of the recent progress and the challenges ahead.

         <title>Advancing 2D Perovskites for Efficient and Stable Solar Cells: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar cells incorporating 2D perovskites show tradeoffs between efficiency and stability. The challenges these solar cells face are identified and select works the community has undertaken to overcome them are highlighted in this review. Several recommendations are proposed on how to further improve perovskite solar cells so their performance and stability can be commensurate with application requirements.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly emerged as one of the hottest topics in the photovoltaics community owing to their high power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCE), and the promise to be produced at low cost. Among various PSCs, typical 3D perovskite&#8208;based solar cells deliver high PCE but they suffer from severe instability, which restricts their practical applications. In contrast to 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites that incorporate larger, less volatile, and generally more hydrophobic organic cations exhibit much improved thermal, chemical, and environmental stability. 2D perovskites can have different roles within a solar cell, either as the primary light absorber (2D PSCs), or as a capping layer atop a 3D perovskite absorbing layer (2D/3D PSCs). Tradeoffs between PCE and stability exist in both types of PSCs&#8212;2D PSCs are more stable but exhibit lower efficiency while 2D/3D PSCs deliver exciting efficiency but show relatively poor stability. To address this PCE/stability tradeoff, the challenges both the 2D and 2D/3D PSCs face are identified and select works the community has undertaken to overcome them are highlighted in this review. It is ended with several recommendations on how to further improve PSCs so their performance and stability can be commensurate with application requirements.

         <title>4D Printing of Liquid Crystals: What's Right for Me?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 3, January 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystals are the basis for many &#8220;smart&#8221; materials used in, for instance, soft robotics and polymer optics. Recently, their potential and appeal for different additive manufacturing techniques has been demonstrated. Insight into the usage of liquid crystals in 3D printing for fabrication at both micro&#8208; and centimeterscale is provided for those wanting to join this exciting, developing field.








Abstract
Recent years have seen major advances in the developments of both additive manufacturing concepts and responsive materials. When combined as 4D printing, the process can lead to functional materials and devices for use in health, energy generation, sensing, and soft robots. Among responsive materials, liquid crystals, which can deliver programmed, reversible, rapid responses in both air and underwater, are a prime contender for additive manufacturing, given their ease of use and adaptability to many different applications. In this paper, selected works are compared and analyzed to come to a didactical overview of the liquid crystal&#8208;additive manufacturing junction. Reading from front to back gives the reader a comprehensive understanding of the options and challenges in the field, while researchers already experienced in either liquid crystals or additive manufacturing are encouraged to scan through the text to see how they can incorporate additive manufacturing or liquid crystals into their own work. The educational text is closed with proposals for future research in this crossover field.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The similarities and differences in the charge carrier dynamics in organic solar cells and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells, two leading technologies in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics, are discussed, linking these back to the intrinsic material properties of organic and perovskite semiconductors, and how these factors impact on photovoltaic device performance is elucidated.








Abstract
The charge carrier dynamics in organic solar cells and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells, two leading technologies in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics, are compared. The similarities and differences in charge generation, charge separation, charge transport, charge collection, and charge recombination in these two technologies are discussed, linking these back to the intrinsic material properties of organic and perovskite semiconductors, and how these factors impact on photovoltaic device performance is elucidated. In particular, the impact of exciton binding energy, charge transfer states, bimolecular recombination, charge carrier transport, sub&#8208;bandgap tail states, and surface recombination is evaluated, and the lessons learned from transient optical and optoelectronic measurements are discussed. This perspective thus highlights the key factors limiting device performance and rationalizes similarities and differences in design requirements between organic and perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Tailoring Competitive Adsorption Sites by Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy on Cobalt Oxides to Enhance the Electrooxidation of Biomass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) process is complicated, including the HMF and OH&#8722; jointly adsorbed and coupled with each other. In this work, the role of oxygen vacancies is investigated during HMFOR. It is found that the OH&#8722; tends to fill into Vo and participate in the dehydrogenation of HMF molecules, which can improve the catalytic activity of HMFOR.








Abstract
The electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) offers a promising green route to attain high&#8208;value chemicals from biomass. The HMF electrooxidation reaction (HMFOR) is a complicated process involving the combined adsorption and coupling of organic molecules and OH&#8722; on the electrode surface. An in&#8208;depth understanding of these adsorption sites and reaction processes on electrocatalysts is fundamentally important. Herein, the adsorption behavior of HMF and OH&#8722;, and the role of oxygen vacancy on Co3O4 are initially unraveled. Correspondingly, instead of the competitive adsorption of OH&#8722; and HMF on the metal sites, it is observed that the OH&#8722; can fill into oxygen vacancy (Vo) prior to couple with organic molecules through lattice oxygen oxidation reaction process, which could accelerate the rate&#8208;determining step of the dehydrogenation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid (HMFCA) intermediates. With the modulated adsorption sites, the as&#8208;designed Vo&#8208;Co3O4 shows excellent activity for HMFOR with the earlier potential of 90 and 120&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 m KOH and 1 m PBS solution. This work sheds insight on the catalytic mechanism of oxygen vacancy, which benefits designing a novel electrocatalysts to modulate the multi&#8208;molecules combined adsorption behaviors.

         <title>Simultaneously Blocking Chemical Crosstalk and Internal Short Circuit via Gel&#8208;Stretching Derived Nanoporous Non&#8208;Shrinkage Separator for Safe Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;shrinkage nanoporous separator is designed for enhancing the safety of lithium&#8208;ion battery through a novel gel&#8208;stretching strategy. Both internal short circuit and chemical crossover within the battery are simultaneously prevented when the separator is employed. The results elucidate the underlying mechanism to ensure battery safety and highlight the design principles for advanced separators.








Abstract
The separator, an ionic permeable and electronic insulating membrane between cathode and anode, plays a crucial role in the electrochemical and safety performance of batteries. However, commercial polyolefin separators not only suffer from inevitable thermal shrinkage at elevated temperature, but also fail to inhibit the hidden chemical crosstalk of reactive gases such as O2, leading to often reported thermal runaway (TR) and hence preventing large&#8208;scale implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a nanoporous non&#8208;shrinkage separator (GS&#8208;PI) is fabricated via a novel gel&#8208;stretching orientation approach to eliminate TR. In situ synchrotron small angle X&#8208;ray scattering during heating clearly shows that the as&#8208;prepared thin GS&#8208;PI separator exhibits superior mechanical tolerance at high temperature, thus effectively preventing internal short circuit. Meanwhile, the unique nanoporous structure design further blocks chemical crosstalk and the associated exothermic reactions. Accelerating rate calorimetry tests reveal that the practical 1 Ah LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622)/graphite pouch cell using GS&#8208;PI nanoporous separator show a maximum temperature rise (dT/dtmax) of only 3.7&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 compared to 131.6&#160;&#176;C s&#8722;1 in the case of Al2O3@PE macroporous separator. Moreover, despite the reduced pore size, the GS&#8208;PI separator demonstrates better cycling stability than conventional Al2O3@PE separator at high temperature without sacrificing specific capacity and rate capability.

         <title>Extreme Environmental Thermal Shock Induced Dislocation&#8208;Rich Pt Nanoparticles Boosting Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An environmental high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method is proposed to generate dislocation&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticles in a liquid&#8208;nitrogen cooling medium. Structural stress and thermal stress trigger the formation of dislocations. The fast&#8208;cooling rate makes dislocations kinetically frozen in nanoparticles. The strain induced by dislocations downshifts the d&#8208;band center of the Pt, leading to weakened adsorption energy between the metal and reaction intermediates.








Abstract
Crystal structure engineering of nanomaterials is crucial for the design of electrocatalysts. Inducing dislocations is an efficient approach to generate strain effects in nanomaterials to optimize the crystal and electronic structures and improve the catalytic properties. However, it is almost impossible to produce and retain dislocations in commercial mainstream catalysts, such as single metal platinum (Pt) catalysts. In this work, a non&#8208;equilibrium high&#8208;temperature (&gt;1400 K) thermal&#8208;shock method is reported to induce rich dislocations in Pt nanocrystals (Dr&#8208;Pt). The method is performed in an extreme environment (&#8776;77 K) created by liquid nitrogen. The dislocations induced within milliseconds by thermal and structural stress during the crystallization process are kinetically frozen at an ultrafast cooling rate. The high&#8208;energy surface structures with dislocation&#8208;induced strain effects can prevent surface restructuring during catalysis. The findings indicate that a novel extreme environmental high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method can successfully introduce rich dislocations in Pt nanoparticles and significantly boost its hydrogen evolution reaction performance.

Structural stress and thermal stress trigger the formation of dislocations. The fast-cooling rate makes dislocations kinetically frozen in nanoparticles. The strain induced by dislocations downshifts the d-band center of the Pt, leading to weakened adsorption energy between the metal and reaction intermediates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crystal structure engineering of nanomaterials is crucial for the design of electrocatalysts. Inducing dislocations is an efficient approach to generate strain effects in nanomaterials to optimize the crystal and electronic structures and improve the catalytic properties. However, it is almost impossible to produce and retain dislocations in commercial mainstream catalysts, such as single metal platinum (Pt) catalysts. In this work, a non-equilibrium high-temperature (&amp;gt;1400 K) thermal-shock method is reported to induce rich dislocations in Pt nanocrystals (Dr-Pt). The method is performed in an extreme environment (&#8776;77 K) created by liquid nitrogen. The dislocations induced within milliseconds by thermal and structural stress during the crystallization process are kinetically frozen at an ultrafast cooling rate. The high-energy surface structures with dislocation-induced strain effects can prevent surface restructuring during catalysis. The findings indicate that a novel extreme environmental high-temperature thermal-shock method can successfully introduce rich dislocations in Pt nanoparticles and significantly boost its hydrogen evolution reaction performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Vertically Stacked Full Color Quantum Dots Phototransistor Arrays for High&#8208;Resolution and Enhanced Color&#8208;Selective Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolithic integration of vertically stacked red (R), green (G), and blue (B) quantum dots (QDs), from chalcometallate RGB QD precursor films, with amorphous oxide semiconductor indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide phototransistor arrays for high&#8208;resolution active&#8208;matrix driving of color&#8208;selective multispectral photodetection is demonstrated. Efficient QD connectivity for reduced trap density and photopatternability essential for pixelation are achieved, which result in ultrahigh photosensitive optoelectronic properties.








Abstract
Color&#8208;selective multifunctional and multiplexed photodetectors have attracted considerable interest with the increasing demand for color filter&#8208;free optoelectronics which can simultaneously process multispectral signal via minimized system complexity. The low efficiency of color&#8208;filter technology and conventional laterally pixelated photodetector array structures often limit opportunities for widespread realization of high&#8208;density photodetectors. Here, low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processed vertically stacked full color quantum dot (QD) phototransistor arrays are developed on plastic substrates for high&#8208;resolution color&#8208;selective photosensor applications. Particularly, the three different&#8208;sized/color (RGB) QDs are vertically stacked and pixelated via direct photopatterning using a unique chelating chalcometallate ligand functioning both as solubilizing component and, after photoexposure, a semiconducting cement creating robust, insoluble, and charge&#8208;efficient QD layers localized in the a&#8208;IGZO transistor region, resulting in efficient wavelength&#8208;dependent photo&#8208;induced charge transfer. Thus, high&#8208;resolution vertically stacked full color QD photodetector arrays are successfully implemented with the density of 5500 devices cm&#8211;2 on ultrathin flexible polymeric substrates with highly photosensitive characteristics such as photoresponsivity (1.1 &#215; 104 AW&#8211;1) and photodetectivity (1.1 &#215; 1018 Jones) as well as wide dynamic ranges (&gt;150&#160;dB).

         <title>Versatile Preparation of Mesoporous Single&#8208;Layered Transition&#8208;Metal Sulfide/Carbon Composites for Enhanced Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoporous single&#8208;layered MoS2/carbon composite is successfully synthesized, which displays remarkable electrochemical performance for both sodium&#8208;ion batteries and sodium&#8208;ion full cells. The reaction mechanism is systematically investigated by in situ and ex situ characterizations. This work may be expected to guide the future design protocol for various mesoporous single&#8208;layered transition&#8208;metal sulfide/carbon composite materials.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal sulfides are promising electrochemical energy storage materials due to their abundant active sites, large interlayer space, and high theoretical capacities, especially for sodium storage. However, the low conductivity and poor cycling stability at high current densities hamper their applications. Herein, a versatile dual&#8208;template method is reported to elaborate ordered mesoporous single&#8208;layered MoS2/carbon composite with high specific area, uniform pore size, and large pore volume. The single&#8208;layered MoS2 is confined in the carbon matrix. The mesopores between the composite nanorods provide fast electrolyte diffusion. The obtained nanocomposite shows a high sodium&#8208;storage capability, excellent rate capacity, and very good cycling performance. A capacity of 310 mAh g&#8722;1 can remain at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 after 2500 cycles. Furthermore, a sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) full cell composed of the MoS2/carbon composite anode and a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode maintains a specific capacity of 330&#160;mAh g&#8722;1 at 1.0 A g&#8722;1 during 100 cycles. The mechanism is investigated by in situ and ex situ characterizations as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Light Intensity Analysis of Photovoltaic Parameters for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light intensity analysis of photovoltaic parameters is introduced as a simple method, allowing understanding of the dominating mechanisms limiting the device performance in perovskite solar cells. The method is based on the drift&#8208;diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from the trap&#8208;assisted recombination or ohmic losses in devices.








Abstract
The number of publications on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) continues to grow exponentially. Although the efficiency of PSCs has exceeded 25.5%, not every research laboratory can reproduce this result or even pass the border of 20%. Unfortunately, it is not always clear which dominating mechanism is responsible for the performance drop. Here, a simple method of light intensity analysis of the JV parameters is developed, allowing an understanding of what the mechanisms are that appear in the solar cell and limit device performance. The developed method is supported by the drift&#8208;diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from the interface or bulk recombination, series resistance, or shunt resistance in the perovskite solar cell. This method can help not only point toward the dominating of bulk or interface recombination in the devices but also determine which interface is more defective. A detailed and stepwise guidance for such a type of light intensity analysis of JV parameters is provided. The proposed method and the conclusions of this study are supported by a series of case studies, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method on real examples.

         <title>Biosensor&#8208;Enabled Multiplexed On&#8208;Site Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Antibiotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first electrochemical biosensor, with a synthetic&#8208;biology&#8208;enabled antibody&#8208;free assay, for temporal monitoring of piperacillin/tazobactam in exhaled breath condensate, along with a correlation study exploring the link between monitored drug levels, is presented. The validation of the findings with gold&#8208;standard measurements demonstrates the suitability of the system as a low&#8208;cost, rapid, and sample&#8208;independent tool for multiplexed on&#8208;site therapeutic drug monitoring.








Abstract
Personalized antibiotherapy ensures that the antibiotic concentration remains in the optimal therapeutic window to maximize efficacy, minimize side effects, and avoid the emergence of drug resistance due to insufficient dosing. However, such individualized schemes need frequent sampling to tailor the blood antibiotic concentrations. To optimally integrate therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) into the clinical workflow, antibiotic levels can either be measured in blood using point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing (POCT), or can rely on noninvasive sampling. Here, a versatile biosensor with an antibody&#8208;free assay for on&#8208;site TDM is presented. The platform is evaluated with an animal study, where antibiotic concentrations are quantified in different matrices including whole blood, plasma, urine, saliva, and exhaled breath condensate (EBC). The clearance and the temporal evaluation of antibiotic levels in EBC and plasma are demonstrated. Influence of matrix effects on measured drug concentrations is determined by comparing the plasma levels with those in noninvasive samples. The system's potential for blood&#8208;based POCT is further illustrated by tracking &#223;&#8209;lactam concentrations in untreated blood samples. Finally, multiplexing capabilities are explored successfully for multianalyte/sample analysis. By enabling a rapid, low&#8208;cost, sample&#8208;independent, and multiplexed on&#8208;site TDM, this system can shift the paradigm of &#8220;one&#8209;size&#8208;fits&#8208;all&#8221; strategy.

         <title>Ultrafast&#8208;Response/Recovery Flexible Piezoresistive Sensors with DNA&#8208;Like Double Helix Yarns for Epidermal Pulse Monitoring</title>

         <dc:description>
Hysteresis is a critical issue existing in textiles sensors. Distinct from the conventional methods, in this work, a biomimetic DNA&#8208;like double&#8208;helix structure is introduced into a textile&#8208;based pressure sensor, providing a twisting force to allow quick and sufficient recovery from the deformation. Ultimately, the hysteresis is largely inhibited together with an improved response/relaxation time.








Abstract
A key challenge in textile sensors is to adequately solve the hysteresis for more broad and exacting applications. Unlike the conventional strategy in integrating elastic polymers into the textile, the hysteretic issue is critically addressed here through the structural design of yarns to provide a twisting force. The underlying mechanism is fully discussed based on theory and modeling, which are in good agreement with experimental data. Impressively, the pressure sensor outperforms almost all reported textile&#8208;based sensors in terms of recovery index, which refers to the ability to overcome the lagged deformation reflected by the hysteresis (5.3%) and relaxation time (2&#160;ms). Besides, the sensor superiority is also demonstrated by way of its ultrafast response time (2&#160;ms). Thanks to these merits, this pressure sensor is demonstrated to be capable of monitoring epidermal pulses and meanwhile shows great potential to advance the standardization and modernization of pulse palpation in traditional Chinese medicine.

         <title>An Ultrarobust and High&#8208;Performance Rotational Hydrodynamic Triboelectric Nanogenerator Enabled by Automatic Mode Switching and Charge Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge excitation and automatic mode switching triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is proposed, which displays outstanding durability and electrical output at the same time. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability and broadening the range of working frequency as well as improving the electrical output performance of TENGs.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology for ambient mechanical energy harvesting, which provides a possibility to realize wild environment monitoring by self&#8208;powered sensing systems. However, TENGs are limited in some practical applications as a result of their low output performance (low charge density) and mechanical durability (material abrasion). Herein, an ultrarobust and high&#8208;performance rotational TENG enabled by automatic mode switching (contact mode at low speed and noncontact at high speed) and charge excitation is proposed. It displays excellent stability, maintaining 94% electrical output after 72&#160;000 cycles, much higher than that of the normal contact&#8208;mode TENG (30%). Due to its high electrical stability and large electrical output, this TENG powers 944 green light&#8208;emitting diodes to brightness in series. Furthermore, by harvesting water&#8208;flow energy, various commercial capacitors can be charged quickly, and a self&#8208;powered fire alarm and self&#8208;powered temperature and humidity detection are realized. This work provides an ideal scheme for enhancing the mechanical durability, broadening the range of working frequency, and improving the electrical output of TENGs. In addition, the high&#8208;performance hydrodynamic TENG demonstrated in this work will have great applications for Internet of Things in remote areas.

         <title>Magnetic and Optical Field Multi&#8208;Assisted Li&#8211;O2 Batteries with Ultrahigh Energy Efficiency and Cycle Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A renewable magnetic and optical field multi&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery is developed with porous NiO on the Ni foam as a photoelectrode. The battery achieves an ultralow charge potential of 2.73&#160;V, a high energy efficiency of 96.7%, and good cycling stability. The effect mechanism of the improved battery performance with magnetic field and optical field is revealed.








Abstract
The photoassisted lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) system has emerged as an important direction for future development by effectively reducing the large overpotential in Li&#8211;O2 batteries. However, the advancement is greatly hindered by the rapidly recombined photoexcited electrons and holes upon the discharging and charging processes. Herein, a breakthrough is made in overcoming these challenges by developing a new magnetic and optical field multi&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery with 3D porous NiO nanosheets on the Ni foam (NiO/FNi) as a photoelectrode. Under illumination, the photogenerated electrons and holes of the NiO/FNi photoelectrode play a key role in reducing the overpotential during discharging and charging, respectively. By introducing the external magnetic field, the Lorentz force acts oppositely on the photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby suppressing the recombination of charge carriers. The magnetic and optical field multi&#8208;assisted Li&#8211;O2 battery achieves an ultralow charge potential of 2.73 V, a high energy efficiency of 96.7%, and good cycling stability. This external magnetic and optical field multi&#8208;assisted technology paves a new way of developing high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;O2 batteries and other energy storage systems.

         <title>Designing Artificial Vibration Modes of Piezoelectric Devices Using Programmable, 3D Ordered Structure with Piezoceramic Strain Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable, 3D ordered structure with piezoceramic strain units (3D OSPSU) is proposed to artificially generate basic modes, such as flexural, extension, shear, torsion, and even coupled modes in a broad frequency band other than only at eigenfrequency. A five&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom micro&#8211;nano actuating platform based on only one 3D OSPSU is constructed, indicating the potential for nano&#8208;operation in microelectronic manufacturing.








Abstract
Piezoelectric ceramic devices, which utilize multifarious vibration modes to realize electromechanical coupling and energy conversions, are extensively used in high&#8208;technological fields. However, the excitation of basic modes is mainly subjected to natural eigenfrequency of ceramic devices, which is related to the structure and material parameters. Herein, inspired by metamaterial theory, a programmable, 3D ordered structure with piezoceramic strain units (3D OSPSU) is developed to artificially generate basic modes in a broad frequency band other than only in narrow eigenfrequency. A (2 &#215; 2 &#215; 2) arrayed, co&#8208;fired, multilayer 3D OSPSU is painstakingly designed and fabricated for generating basic modes, such as flexural, extension, shear, torsion, and even coupled modes at nonresonance. To validate the 3D OSPSU method, a five&#8208;degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom micro&#8211;nano actuating platform based on only one co&#8208;fired multilayer ceramic is constructed. The proposed methodology provides a new paradigm for creating extraordinary material properties of piezoelectric ceramics and will inspire brand&#8208;new piezoelectric device designs.

         <title>Air&#8208;Stable 2D Cr5Te8 Nanosheets with Thickness&#8208;Tunable Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D ferromagnetism Cr5Te8 single crystals with high crystallinity are successfully synthesized via a tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube chemical vapor deposition growth. The as&#8208;grown Cr5Te8 nanosheet shows air&#8208;stable and thickness&#8208;tunable ferromagnetic properties with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization, which open up new prospects for exploring 2D magnetism and spintronic device applications.








Abstract
2D magnetic materials have aroused widespread research interest owing to their promising application in spintronic devices. However, exploring new kinds of 2D magnetic materials with better stability and realizing their batch synthesis remain challenging. Herein, the synthesis of air&#8208;stable 2D Cr5Te8 ultrathin crystals with tunable thickness via tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth technology is reported. The importance of tube&#8208;in&#8208;tube CVD growth, which can significantly suppress the equilibrium shift to the decomposition direction and facilitate that to the synthesis reaction direction, for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality Cr5Te8 with accurate composition, is highlighted. By precisely adjusting the growth temperature, the thickness of Cr5Te8 nanosheets is tuned from &#8776;1.2&#160;nm to tens of nanometers, with the morphology changing from triangles to hexagons. Furthermore, magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect measurements reveal that the Cr5Te8 nanosheet is ferromagnetic with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization. The Curie temperature exhibits a monotonic increase from 100 to 160 K as the Cr5Te8 thickness increases from 10 to 30&#160;nm and no apparent variation in surface roughness or magnetic properties after months of exposure to air.

&lt;p&gt;2D ferromagnetism Cr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals with high crystallinity are successfully synthesized via a tube-in-tube chemical vapor deposition growth. The as-grown Cr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet shows air-stable and thickness-tunable ferromagnetic properties with strong out-of-plane spin polarization, which open up new prospects for exploring 2D magnetism and spintronic device applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D magnetic materials have aroused widespread research interest owing to their promising application in spintronic devices. However, exploring new kinds of 2D magnetic materials with better stability and realizing their batch synthesis remain challenging. Herein, the synthesis of air-stable 2D Cr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; ultrathin crystals with tunable thickness via tube-in-tube chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth technology is reported. The importance of tube-in-tube CVD growth, which can significantly suppress the equilibrium shift to the decomposition direction and facilitate that to the synthesis reaction direction, for the synthesis of high-quality Cr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; with accurate composition, is highlighted. By precisely adjusting the growth temperature, the thickness of Cr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets is tuned from &#8776;1.2&#160;nm to tens of nanometers, with the morphology changing from triangles to hexagons. Furthermore, magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements reveal that the Cr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet is ferromagnetic with strong out-of-plane spin polarization. The Curie temperature exhibits a monotonic increase from 100 to 160 K as the Cr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; thickness increases from 10 to 30&#160;nm and no apparent variation in surface roughness or magnetic properties after months of exposure to air. This study provides a robust method for the controllable synthesis of high-quality 2D ferromagnetic materials, which will facilitate research progress in spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tissue Engineering with Mechanically Induced Solid&#8208;Fluid Transitions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissues composed of a collagenous core surrounded by an epithelial sheet serve as shape&#8208;programmable living matter. The shaping process involves solid to fluid transitions in the epithelium induced by mechanical perturbations, and the generation of spatially distributed surface stresses at the interfaces. Optochemical and microsurgical operations generate a new shape that is autonomously stabilized by the re&#8208;epithelization process.








Abstract
Epithelia are contiguous sheets of cells that stabilize the shape of internal organs and support their structure by covering their surfaces. They acquire diverse morphological forms appropriate for their specific functions during embryonic development, such as the kidney tubules and the complex branching structures found in the lung. The maintenance of epithelial morphogenesis and homeostasis is controlled by their remarkable mechanics&#8212;epithelia can become elastic, plastic, and viscous by actively remodeling cell&#8211;cell junctions and modulating the distribution of local stresses. Microfabrication, finite element modelling, light&#8208;sheet microscopy, and robotic micromanipulation are used to show that collagen gels covered with an epithelial skin serve as shape&#8208;programmable soft matter. The process involves solid to fluid transitions induced by mechanical perturbations, generates spatially distributed surface stresses at tissue interfaces, and is amenable to both additive and subtractive manufacturing techniques. The robustness and versatility of this strategy for engineering designer tissues is demonstrated by directing the morphogenesis of a variety of molded, carved, and assembled forms from the base material. The results provide insight into the active mechanical properties of the epithelia and establish methods for engineering tissues with sustainable architectures.

         <title>Silk Embolic Material for Catheter&#8208;Directed Endovascular Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embolic materials today are clinically approved for achieving vascular occlusion. In this work, a biomaterial comprising silk fibroin and nanoclay is developed and optimized as a multifunctional embolic agent that offers both embolization and drug&#8208;delivery capabilities. The silk embolic material exhibits excellent transcatheter injectability, mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and hemocompatibility to serve as a catheter&#8208;directed embolic drug carrier for the treatment of vascular diseases.








Abstract
Embolization is a catheter&#8208;based minimally invasive procedure that deliberately occludes diseased blood vessels for treatment purposes. A novel silk&#8208;based embolic material (SEM) that is developed and optimized to provide tandem integration of both embolization and the delivery of therapeutics is reported. Natural silk is processed into fibroin proteins of varying lengths and is combined with charged nanoclay particles to allow visibility and injectability using clinical catheters as small as 600 &#956;m in diameter at lengths &gt;100&#160;cm.&#160;SEMs loaded with fluorochrome labeled bovine albumin and Nivolumab, which is among the most used immunotherapy drugs worldwide, demonstrate a sustained release profile in vitro over 28 days. In a porcine renal survival model, SEMs with labeled albumin and Nivolumab successfully embolize porcine arteries without recanalization and lead to the delivery of both albumin and Nivolumab into the interstitial space of the renal cortex. Mechanistically, it is shown that tissue delivery is most optimal when the internal elastic membrane of the embolized artery is disrupted. SEM is a potential next&#8208;generation multifunctional embolic agent that can achieve embolization and deliver a wide range of therapeutics to treat vascular diseases including tumors.

         <title>Ultrathin 2D NbWO6 Perovskite Semiconductor Based Gas Sensors with Ultrahigh Selectivity under Low Working Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D all&#8208;inorganic NbWO6 perovskite nanosheets with thicknesses down to 1.5 nm are synthesized for the fabrication of gas sensors, and the fabricated few&#8208;layer NbWO6&#8208;based semiconducting sensor exhibits fast H2S sensing speed with high selectivity and sensitivity at low temperature.








Abstract
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) detection with high selectivity and low working temperature is of great significance due to its strong toxicity both to the environment and to humans and also as an endogenous signaling molecule existing in various physiological processes. 2D perovskites with high carrier mobility are promising candidates for gas sensing; however, the development of stable and nontoxic 2D perovskites nanosheets still remains a challenge. Herein, 2D all&#8208;inorganic NbWO6 perovskite nanosheets with thicknesses down to 1.5&#160;nm are synthesized by liquid exfoliation, and the gas&#8208;sensing performance based on these ultrathin nanosheets is investigated. A few&#8208;layer NbWO6&#8208;based sensor exhibits fast H2S sensing speed (&lt;6 s) with high selectivity and sensitivity (S&#160;= 12.5 vs 50&#160;ppm) at low temperature (150&#160;&#176;C). A small variation of H2S concentration (&lt;0.5&#160;ppm) can be detected with a fully reversible resistance signal. This work sheds light on the development of high&#8208;performance gas sensors working in ambient conditions based on low&#8208;dimensional, nontoxic, and wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite semiconductors. The high carrier mobility, ultrathin structure, and soft nature make this type of 2D perovskite semiconductor an ideal material candidate for the fabrication of flexible, transparent, and wearable sensing devices in the future.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancy Injection as a Pathway to Enhancing Electromechanical Response in Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films driven via local oxygen vacancy migration is observed via temperature dependent band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy. Observations are supported by finite element modeling, reactive force field, and density functional theory calculations pointing toward the discovery of a new method of enhancing functional responses in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Since their discovery in late 1940s, perovskite ferroelectric materials have become one of the central objects of condensed matter physics and materials science due to the broad spectrum of functional behaviors they exhibit, including electro&#8208;optical phenomena and strong electromechanical coupling. In such disordered materials, the static properties of defects such as oxygen vacancies are well explored but the dynamic effects are less understood. In this work, the first observation of enhanced electromechanical response in BaTiO3 thin films is reported driven via dynamic local oxygen vacancy control in piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM). A persistence in peizoelectricity past the bulk Curie temperature and an enhanced electromechanical response due to a created internal electric field that further enhances the intrinsic electrostriction are explicitly demonstrated. The findings are supported by a series of temperature dependent band excitation PFM in ultrahigh vacuum and a combination of modeling techniques including finite element modeling, reactive force field, and density functional theory. This study shows the pivotal role that dynamics of vacancies in complex oxides can play in determining functional properties and thus provides a new route toward&#8211; achieving enhanced ferroic response with higher functional temperature windows in ferroelectrics and other ferroic materials.

         <title>A Universal Nonhalogenated Polymer Donor for High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, with different side&#8208;chain orientations and deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels are reported. In organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells, PB1 only produces a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.3%, while PB2 gives an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. More importantly, PB2 has good compatibility with various electron acceptors. PB2 achieves excellent PCEs of 18.4% and 27.1% for ternary OPV cells and indoor light photovoltaic devices, respectively.








Abstract
Nonhalogenated polymers have great potential in the commercialization of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells due to their advantage in low&#8208;cost preparation. However, non&#8208;halogenated polymers usually have high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and inferior self&#8208;aggregation properties in solution, thus resulting in low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, two nonhalogenated polymers, PB1 and PB2, are prepared. When the polymers are used to fabricate OPV cells with BTP&#8208;eC9, the PB1&#8208;based device only gives a PCE of 5.3%, while the PB2&#8208;based device shows an outstanding PCE of 17.7%. After the introduction of PBDB&#8208;TF as the third component, the PB2:PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based device with an optimal weight ratio of 0.5:0.5:1 achieves a PCE up to 18.4%. More importantly, PB2 exhibits good compatibility with various nonfullerene acceptors to achieve better PCEs than those of classical polymer (PBDB&#8208;T and PBDB&#8208;TF)&#8208;based devices. When PB2 is combined with a wide&#8208;bandgap electron acceptor (F&#8208;BTA3), this device shows excellent PCE of 27.1% and 24.6% for 1 and 10 cm2 devices, respectively, under light intensity of 1000 lux light&#8208;emitting diode illumination. These results provide new insight in the rational design of novel nonhalogenated polymer donors for further development of low&#8208;cost materials and broadening the application of OPV cells.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zinc(I) Active Sites to Accelerate Nitrogen Reduction Kinetics for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon electrocatalyst with single Zn(I) sites is discovered to accelerate kinetics of hydrogenation process for efficient N2 reduction.








Abstract
Developing highly active and stable nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts for NH3 electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, an unusual NRR electrocatalyst is reported with a single Zn(I) site supported on hollow porous N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Zn1N&#8211;C). The Zn1N&#8211;C nanofibers exhibit an outstanding NRR activity with a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;16.1&#160;&#181;g NH3 h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.3&#160;V and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 11.8% in alkaline media, surpassing other previously reported carbon&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts with transition metals atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated (TM&#8208;Nx) sites. 15N2 isotope labeling experiments confirm that the feeding nitrogen gas is the only nitrogen source in the production of NH3. Structural characterization reveals that atomically dispersed Zn(I) sites with Zn&#8211;N4 moieties are likely the active sites, and the nearby graphitic N site synergistically facilitates the NRR process. In situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared measurement and theoretical calculation elucidate that the formation of initial *NNH intermediate is the rate&#8208;limiting step during the NH3 production. The graphitic N atoms adjacent to the tetracoordinate Zn&#8211;N4 moieties could significantly lower the energy barrier for this step to accelerate hydrogenation kinetics duing the NRR.

         <title>Homojunction Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells with over 1&#160;&#181;m&#8208;Thick Photoactive Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a charge&#8208;transfer doping strategy to tune the carrier&#8208;type, P/N homojunction CsPbI3 perovskite QD solar cells are demonstrated; the P/N homojunction significantly improves the carrier dynamic process and outputs record high efficiency in a QD active layer with thickness over 1&#160;&#181;m, demonstrating great potential for the future printing manufacturing of QD PVs.








Abstract
The solution&#8208;processed solar cells based on colloidal quantum dots (QDs) reported so far generally suffer from poor thickness tolerance and it is difficult for them to be compatible with large&#8208;scale solution printing technology. However, the recently emerged perovskite QDs, with unique high defect tolerance, are particularly well&#8208;suited for efficient photovoltaics. Herein, efficient CsPbI3 perovskite QD solar cells are demonstrated first with over 1&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick active layer by developing an internal P/N homojunction. Specifically, an organic dopant 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(perfluoronaphthalene&#8208;2,6&#8208;diylidene) dimalononitrile (F6TCNNQ) is introduced into CsPbI3 QD arrays to prepare different carrier&#8208;type QD arrays. The detailed characterizations reveal successful charge&#8208;transfer doping of QDs and carrier&#8208;type transformation from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type. Subsequently, the P/N homojunction perovskite QD solar cell is assembled using different carrier&#8208;type QDs, delivering an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 15.29%. Most importantly, this P/N homojunction strategy realizes remarkable thickness tolerance of QD solar cells, showing a record high efficiency of 12.28% for a 1.2&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick QD active&#8208;layer and demonstrating great potential for the future printing manufacturing of QDs solar cells.

         <title>Chirality Bias Tissue Homeostasis by Manipulating Immunological Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that upregulates M2 macrophage polarization and activates downstream immune signaling to restore tissue homeostasis. These findings provide a more practical, simple, and efficient material strategy for regulating macrophages to treat disease.








Abstract
The physiological chirality of extracellular environments is substantially affected by pathological diseases. However, how this stereochemical variation drives host immunity remains poorly understood. Here, it is reported that pathology&#8208;mimetic M&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;but not physiology&#8208;mimetic P&#8208;nanofibrils&#8212;act as a defense mechanism that helps to restore tissue homeostasis by manipulating immunological response. Quantitative multi&#8208;omics in vivo and in vitro shows that M&#8208;nanofibrils significantly inhibit inflammation and promote tissue regeneration by upregulating M2 macrophage polarization and downstream immune signaling compared with P&#8208;nanofibrils. Molecular analysis and theoretical simulation demonstrate that M&#8208;chirality displays higher stereo&#8208;affinity to cellular binding, which induces higher cellular contractile stress and activates mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZOl to conduct Ca2+ influx. In turn, the nuclear transfer of STAT is biased by Ca2+ influx to promote M2 polarization. These findings underscore the structural mechanisms of disease, providing design basis for immunotherapy with bionic functional materials.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layer Nacre&#8208;Inspired Polyimide&#8208;Mica Nanocomposite Films with Excellent Mechanical Stability for LEO Environmental Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyimide&#8208;mica (PI&#8208;Mica) nanocomposite film with outstanding mechanical properties and atomic oxygen resistance is produced by integrating mica nanosheets with polyimide into a double&#8208;layer nacre&#8208;inspired structure with a much higher density of mica in the top layer. This unique microstructure and advantages of mica also impart the film with favorable resistance to ultraviolet, space debris, and high temperatures.








Abstract
Owing to their outstanding comprehensive performance, polyimide (PI) composite films are widely used on the external surfaces of spacecraft to protect them from the adverse conditions of low Earth orbit (LEO). However, current PI composite films have inadequate mechanical properties and atomic oxygen (AO) resistance. Herein, this work fabricates a new PI&#8208;based nanocomposite film with greatly enhanced mechanical properties and AO resistance by integrating mica nanosheets with PI into a unique double&#8208;layer nacre&#8208;inspired structure with a much higher density of mica nanosheets in the top layer. In addition, the unique microstructure and the intrinsic properties of mica also impart the nanocomposite film with favorable ultraviolet and high&#8208;temperature resistance. The comprehensive performance of this material is superior to those of pure PI, single&#8208;layer PI&#8208;mica, and previously reported PI&#8208;based composite films. Thus, the double&#8208;layer nanocomposite film displays great potential as an aerospace material for use in LEO.

         <title>Doping&#8208;Induced Dielectric Catastrophe Prompts Free&#8208;Carrier Release in Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general mechanism for the doping&#8208;induced insulator&#8211;conductor transition in organic semiconductors is proposed. Multiscale simulations unveil the high polarizability of dopant&#8211;semiconductor complexes and predict large nonlinear enhancements of the dielectric constant as the system approaches a dielectric instability (catastrophe) upon increasing doping. Such an enhanced screening frees charges from Coulomb barriers at concentrations of 5&#8211;10%, in accordance with experiments.








Abstract
The control over material properties attainable through molecular doping is essential to many technological applications of organic semiconductors, such as organic light&#8208;emitting diodes or thermoelectrics. These excitonic semiconductors typically reach the degenerate limit only at impurity concentrations of 5&#8211;10%, a phenomenon that has been put in relation with the strong Coulomb binding between charge carriers and ionized dopants, and whose comprehension remained elusive so far. This study proposes a general mechanism for the release of carriers at finite doping in terms of collective screening phenomena. A multiscale model for the dielectric properties of doped organic semiconductor is set up by combining first principles and microelectrostatic calculations. The results predict a large nonlinear enhancement of the dielectric constant (tenfold at 8% load) as the system approaches a dielectric instability (catastrophe) upon increasing doping. This can be attributed to the presence of highly polarizable host&#8211;dopant complexes, plus a nontrivial leading contribution from dipolar interactions in the disordered and heterogeneous system. The enhanced screening in the material drastically reduces the (free) energy barriers for electron&#8211;hole separation, rationalizing the possibility for thermal charge release. The proposed mechanism is consistent with conductivity data and sets the basis for achieving higher conductivities at lower doping loads.

         <title>A Dynamic and Self&#8208;Adapting Interface Coating for Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is proposed for constructing a dynamic and adaptive volume change interface coating to stabilize zinc anodes and prepare poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/TiO2&#8722;x as a reasonable artificial interface coating, which can provide continuous dynamic protection and induce rapid and uniform transfer of Zn2+. This provides an effective and feasible approach for the protection and practical application of zinc&#8208;metal anodes.








Abstract
The zinc (Zn)&#8208;ion battery has attracted much attention due to its high safety and environmental protection. At present, the critical issues of the generation of dendrites and the accumulation of dead Zn on the surface will lead to a sharp decline of the battery life. Zn dendrites can be inhibited to some extent by constructing an interface protective coating. However, the existing rigid coating method cannot maintain conformal contact with Zn due to the volume change of Zn deposition and will cause fracture irreversibly during the cycle. Here, a highly self&#8208;adaptable poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/TiO2&#8722;x coating is developed that can dynamically adapt to volume changes and inhibit dendrites growth. PDMS has high dynamic and self&#8208;adaptability due to the crosslinking of the B&#8211;O bond. In addition, the rapid and uniform transfer of Zn2+ is induced by the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich TiO2&#8722;x. The assembled cells still achieve 99.6% coulombic efficiency after 700 cycles at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The adaptive interface coating constructed provides a sufficient guarantee for the stable operation of the Zn anode.

         <title>Asymmetric Elimination Reaction on Chiral Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral intermetallic compounds are promising candidates to promote heterogeneous asymmetric catalysis. Combining experimental and theoretical surface science methods, enantiospecific control is demonstrated for a halogen elimination reaction with a difference in the debromination temperatures of the two surface enantiomers of up to an unprecedented 46 K on the prototypical chiral intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces.








Abstract
The production of enantiopure materials and molecules is of uttermost relevance in research and industry in numerous contexts, ranging from nonlinear optics to asymmetric synthesis. In the context of the latter, dehalogenation, which is an essential reaction step for a broad class of chemical reactions, is investigated; specifically, dehalogenation of prochiral 5&#8208;bromo&#8208;7&#8208;methylbenz(a)anthracene (BMA) on prototypical, chiral, intermetallic PdGa{111} surfaces under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Asymmetric halogen elimination is demonstrated by combining temperature&#8208;programmed X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning probe microscopy, and density functional theory. On the PdGa{111} surfaces, the difference in debromination temperatures for the two BMA surface enantiomers amounts up to an unprecedented 46 K. The significant dependence of the dehalogenation temperature of the BMA surface enantiomers on the atomic termination of the PdGa{111} surfaces implies that the ensemble effect is pronounced in this reaction step. These findings evidence enantiospecific control and hence promote intrinsically chiral crystals for asymmetric on&#8208;surface synthesis.

         <title>Amine&#8208;Functionalized Carbon Nanodot Electrocatalysts Converting Carbon Dioxide to Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ amine functionalization is a general strategy that can be applied to nanoscale carbon catalysts, i.e., in the form of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) regardless of their crystal structure, to promote the selectivity and production rate of CH4 in CO2 electroreduction. Specifically, amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve CH4 Faradaic efficiency and partial current density of industrial relevance.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4), which can be used not only as fuel but also as a hydrogen carrier, has drawn great attention for use in supporting carbon capture and utilization. The design of active and selective electrocatalysts with exceptional CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency is highly desirable; however, it remains a challenge. Here a molecular tuning strategy&#8722;in situ amine functionalization of nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) for highly efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion is presented. Amine functionalized nitrogen&#8208;doped GQDs achieve a CH4 Faradic efficiency (FE) of 63% and 46%, respectively, at CH4 partial current densities of 170 and 258&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, approximating to or even outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts. These GQDs also convert CO2 to C2 products mainly including C2H4 and C2H5OH with a maximum FE of &#8776;10%. A systematic analysis reveals that the CH4 yield varies linearly with amine group content, whereas the C2 production rate is positively dependent on pyridinic N dopant content. This work provides insight into the rational design of carbon catalysts with CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion efficiency at the industrially relevant level.

The design of active and selective electrocatalysts with exceptional CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion efficiency is highly desirable; however, it remains a challenge. Here a molecular tuning strategy&#8722;in situ amine functionalization of nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) for highly efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion is presented. Amine functionalized nitrogen-doped GQDs achieve a CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Faradic efficiency (FE) of 63% and 46%, respectively, at CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; partial current densities of 170 and 258&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, approximating to or even outperforming state-of-the-art Cu-based electrocatalysts. These GQDs also convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; products mainly including C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH with a maximum FE of &#8776;10%. A systematic analysis reveals that the CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; yield varies linearly with amine group content, whereas the C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate is positively dependent on pyridinic N dopant content. This work provides insight into the rational design of carbon catalysts with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion efficiency at the industrially relevant level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarimetric Image Sensor and Fermi Level Shifting Induced Multichannel Transition Based on 2D PdPS</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide spectral response photodetector and polarimetric image sensor based on 2D palladium phosphide sulfide (PdPS) are designed. The photoresponse range of PdPS is from solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet to the near&#8208;infrared. The PdPS&#8208;based polarimetric imaging sensor achieves object imaging and hidden&#8208;target detection in complex environments.








Abstract
2D materials have been attracting high interest in recent years due to their low structural symmetry, excellent photoresponse, and high air stability. However, most 2D materials can only respond to specific light, which limits the development of wide&#8208;spectrum photodetectors. Proper bandgap and the regulation of Fermi level are the foundations for realizing electronic multichannel transition, which is an effective method to achieve a wide spectral response. Herein, a noble 2D material, palladium phosphide sulfide (PdPS), is designed and synthesized. The bandgap of PdPS is around 2.1&#160;eV and the formation of S vacancies, interstitial Pd and P atoms promote the Fermi level very close to the conduction band. Therefore, the PdPS&#8208;based photodetector shows impressive wide spectral response from solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared based on the multichannel transition. It also exhibits superior optoelectrical properties with photoresponsivity (R) of 1 &#215; 103 A W&#8722;1 and detectivity (D*) of 4 &#215; 1011 Jones at 532&#160;nm. Moreover, PdPS exhibits good performance of polarization detection with dichroic ratio of &#8776;3.7 at 808&#160;nm. Significantly, it achieves polarimetric imaging and hidden&#8208;target detection in complex environments through active detection.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Hydrogen&#8208;Release Platform for Multieffective Helicobacter Pylori Targeting Therapy and Intestinal Flora Protective Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based hydrogen&#8208;generation platform for the treatment of H. pylori is reported. This platform integrates inflammatory targeted adhesion, multieffectively antibacterial capability, inflammatory regulation, and gastric mucosa repair, and also avoids simultaneously the imbalance of gastrointestinal flora homeostasis.








Abstract
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. Antibiotics, as traditional method for eliminating H. pylori, have no targeting effect, which causes serious bacterial resistance and gut dysbacteriosis. Moreover, antibiotics can hardly address hyperactive inflammatory response or damaged gastric mucosal barrier caused by H. pylori infection. Here, a pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework hydrogen&#8208;generation nanoparticle (Pd(H)&#8202;@&#8202;ZIF&#8208;8) is reported, which is encapsulated with ascorbate palmitate (AP) hydrogel. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that the outer AP hydrogel can target and adhere to the inflammatory site through electrostatic interactions, and is then hydrolyzed by matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enriching in inflammatory sites. The released Pd(H)&#8202;@&#8202;ZIF&#8208;8 nanoparticles are further decomposed by gastric acid to generate zinc ions (Zn2+) and hydrogen, thus effectively killing H. pylori, alleviating inflammation and restoring impaired gastric mucosa simultaneously. Unexpectedly, this metal&#8211;organic framework hydrogen&#8208;generation platform (Pd(H)&#8202;@&#8202;ZIF&#8208;8&#8202;@&#8202;AP) also has an effect toward avoiding the imbalance of intestinal flora, which thus provides a more precise, effective, and healthy strategy for the treatment of H. pylori infection.

         <title>Modeling the Triboelectric Behaviors of Elastomeric Nonwoven Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An analytical model is developed for nonwoven&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) working at conductor&#8208;to&#8208;dielectric contact mode. The model fits well with different sets of experimental data at reasonable mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and suggests that nonwoven triboelectric output reaches a maximum at a specific thickness, solidity, or average fiber diameter when other structural parameters are fixed.








Abstract
Theoretical modeling of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) is fundamental to their performance optimization, since it can provide useful guidance on the material selection, structure design, and parameter control of relevant systems. Built on the theoretical model of film&#8208;based TENGs, here, an analytical model is introduced for conductor&#8208;to&#8208;dielectric contact&#8208;mode nonwoven&#8208;based TENGs, which copes with the unique hierarchical structure of nonwovens and details the correlation between the triboelectric output (maximum transferred charge density) and nonwoven structural parameters (thickness, solidity, and average fiber diameter). A series of styrene&#8211;ethylene&#8211;butylene&#8211;styrene nonwoven samples are fabricated through a melt&#8208;blowing process to map nonwoven structural features within certain ranges, while an ion&#8208;injection protocol is adopted to quantify the triboelectric output with superior consistency and reproducibility. With a database containing structural features and triboelectric output of 43 nonwoven samples, a good model fitting is achieved via nonlinear regression analysis in Python, which also shows good predictive power and suggests the existing of tribo&#8208;output maxima at a specific thickness, solidity, or average fiber diameter when other structural parameters are fixed. The model is also successfully applied to a group of polypropylene meltblown nonwovens, which verifies its universality on meltblown&#8208;nonwoven&#8208;based TENGs.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix in Synthetic Hydrogel&#8208;Based Prostate Cancer Organoids Regulate Therapeutic Response to EZH2 and DRD2 Inhibitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuroendocrine prostate cancer is epigenetically transformed tumors for which no targeted therapies exist. Using a combination of transcriptomics, proteomics, spatial omics, and microscopy on patient biopsies, the extracellular matrix tumor microenvironment is defined. Informed by findings, synthetic hydrogel&#8208;based prostate cancer organoids are developed to grow patient tumor cells under the defined microenvironment conditions, leading to the discovery of novel therapeutics.








Abstract
Following treatment with androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors, &#8776;20% of prostate cancer patients progress by shedding their AR&#8208;dependence. These tumors undergo epigenetic reprogramming turning castration&#8208;resistant prostate cancer adenocarcinoma (CRPC&#8208;Adeno) into neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC&#8208;NEPC). No targeted therapies are available for CRPC&#8208;NEPCs, and there are minimal organoid models to discover new therapeutic targets against these aggressive tumors. Here, using a combination of patient tumor proteomics, RNA sequencing, spatial&#8208;omics, and a synthetic hydrogel&#8208;based organoid, putative extracellular matrix (ECM) cues that regulate the phenotypic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic underpinnings of CRPC&#8208;NEPCs are defined. Short&#8208;term culture in tumor&#8208;expressed ECM differentially regulated DNA methylation and mobilized genes in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs. The ECM type distinctly regulates the response to small&#8208;molecule inhibitors of epigenetic targets and Dopamine Receptor D2 (DRD2), the latter being an understudied target in neuroendocrine tumors. In vivo patient&#8208;derived xenograft in immunocompromised mice showed strong anti&#8208;tumor response when treated with a DRD2 inhibitor. Finally, we&#160;demonstrate that therapeutic response in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs under drug&#8208;resistant ECM conditions can be overcome by first cellular reprogramming with epigenetic inhibitors, followed by DRD2 treatment. The synthetic organoids suggest the regulatory role of ECM in therapeutic response to targeted therapies in CRPC&#8208;NEPCs and enable the discovery of therapies to overcome resistance.

Finally, we&#160;demonstrate that therapeutic response in CRPC-NEPCs under drug-resistant ECM conditions can be overcome by first cellular reprogramming with epigenetic inhibitors, followed by DRD2 treatment. The synthetic organoids suggest the regulatory role of ECM in therapeutic response to targeted therapies in CRPC-NEPCs and enable the discovery of therapies to overcome resistance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simultaneous Realization of Superoleophobicity and Strong Substrate Adhesion in Water via a Unique Segment Orientation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and versatile noncovalent coating strategy is provided to simultaneously realize underwater superoleophobicity and strong substrate adhesion based on a mixture of amphiphilic polyurethane and a water&#8208;miscible solvent. By immersing the coating in water, hydrophobic segments will orientate and pile along the substrate surface via a segment orientation mechanism. Hydrophilic segments will physically crosslink to a hydrogel surface.








Abstract
The underwater superoleophobicity of a coating is often caused by its preferential water affinity, which, however, normally weakens the substrate adhesion property. In this work, a new strategy is reported for achieving strong underwater adhesion between a well&#8208;designed amphiphilic polyurethane coating and a diverse range of substrates while also rendering the coating surface's superoleophobicity. When the coating, which is a mixture of an amphiphilic polyurethane and a water miscible solvent, is immersed in water, the hydrophobic segments aggregate to orientate and pile along the surface of substrates via a segment orientation mechanism triggered by solvent exchange with water penetration to exert strong adhesion. At the same time, the hydrophilic segments will physically crosslink to form a hydrogel coating, endowing the substrate with underwater superoleophobicity. This work provides a facile, versatile, and scalable approach for the future design of superoleophobic coatings in a water environment.

         <title>Design of Quasi&#8208;MOF Nanospheres as a Dynamic Electrocatalyst toward Accelerated Sulfur Reduction Reaction for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework (quasi&#8208;MOF) nanospheres are developed as a sulfur electrocatalyst, wherein abundant metal nodes that act as active sites are exposed, rendering strong lithium polysulfides absorbability. The dynamic structure evolution over the sulfur reduction reaction can effectively promote catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides, leading to accelerated reaction kinetics. This quasi&#8208;MOF sulfur composite demonstrates a decent electrochemical performance with prolonged cycle lifespan.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries owing to their high energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the sluggish kinetics of the sulfur reduction reaction process, which is so far insufficiently explored, still impedes its practical application.&#160;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are widely investigated as&#160;a sulfur immobilizer, but the interactions and catalytic activity of lithium polysulfides (LiPs) on metal nodes are weak due to the presence of organic ligands. Herein, a strategy to design quasi&#8208;MOF nanospheres, which contain a transition&#8208;state structure between the MOF and the metal oxide via controlled ligand exchange strategy, to serve as sulfur electrocatalyst, is presented. The quasi&#8208;MOF not only inherits the porous structure of the MOF, but also exposes abundant metal nodes to act as active sites, rendering strong LiPs absorbability. The reversible deligandation/ligandation of the quasi&#8208;MOF and its impact on the durability of the catalyst over the course of the electrochemical process is acknowledged, which confers a remarkable catalytic activity. Attributed to these structural advantages, the quasi&#8208;MOF delivers a decent discharge capacity and low capacity&#8208;fading rate over long&#8208;term cycling. This work not only offers insight into the rational design of quasi&#8208;MOF&#8208;based composites but also provides guidance for application in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting White Light Printed Image Multiplexing by Fast Nanosecond Laser Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Up to four images are encoded in a single random plasmonic metasurface created by fast nanosecond laser processing. Each laser&#8208;induced pixel exhibits various colors in different observation modes, which can be controlled independently to enable multiplexing. The approach, different from holography, makes possible the observation of various images on the same support by the naked eye under different observation angles.








Abstract
Passive plasmonic metasurfaces enable image multiplexing by displaying different images when altering the conditions of observation. Under white light, three&#8208;image multiplexing with polarization&#8208;selective switching has been recently demonstrated using femtosecond&#8208;laser&#8208;processed random plasmonic metasurfaces. Here, the implementation of image multiplexing is extended, thanks to a color&#8208;search algorithm, to various observation modes compatible with naked&#8208;eye observation under incoherent white light and to four&#8208;image multiplexing under polarized light. The laser&#8208;processed random plasmonic metasurfaces enabling image multiplexing exhibit self&#8208;organized patterns that can diffract light or induce dichroism through hybridization between the localized surface plasmon resonance of metallic nanoparticles and a lattice resonance. Improved spatial resolution makes the image quality compatible with commercial use in secured documents as well as the processing time and cost thanks to the use of a nanosecond laser. This high&#8208;speed and flexible laser process, based on energy&#8208;efficient nanoparticle reshaping and self&#8208;organization, produces centimeter&#8208;scale customized tamper&#8208;proof images at low cost, which can serve as overt security features.

         <title>Dynamic Ligand Screening by Magnetic Nanoassembly Modulates Stem Cell Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic screens of various sizes are elastically coupled to RGD&#8208;presenting surfaces with nanogaps. Large magnetic screens exhibiting low RGD distribution stimulate integrin clustering for mechanotransduction&#8208;dependent differentiation of stem cells, which can be dynamically hindered by lowering the nanogaps. Conversely, small magnetic screens facilitate stem cell adhesion and differentiation by dynamically raising the nanogaps.








Abstract
In native microenvironment, diverse physical barriers exist to dynamically modulate stem cell recruitment and differentiation for tissue repair. In this study, nanoassembly&#8208;based magnetic screens of various sizes are utilized, and they are elastically tethered over an RGD ligand (cell&#8208;adhesive motif)&#8208;presenting material surface to generate various nanogaps between the screens and the RGDs without modulating the RGD density. Large screens exhibiting low RGD distribution stimulate integrin clustering to facilitate focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells, which are not observed with small screens. Magnetic downward pulling of the large screens decreases the nanogaps, which dynamically suppress the focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells. Conversely, magnetic upward pulling of the small screens increases the nanogaps, which dynamically activates focal adhesion, mechanotransduction, and differentiation of stem cells. This regulation mechanism is also shown to be effective in the microenvironment in vivo. Further diversifying the geometries of the physical screens can further enable diverse modalities of multifaceted and safe unscreening of the distributed RGDs to unravel and modulate stem cell differentiation for tissue repair.

It is demonstrated that single crystallinity can be totally maintained even through dramatic structural changes, which only requires several seconds. Ultrathin 2D single crystals can be obtained by the strategy, which is difficult for traditional methods. This discovery illustrates the possibility of transforming from 3D frameworks to 2D inorganic single crystals, vastly expanding the research scope of the single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal transformation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal&#8208;to&#8208;single&#8208;crystal (SCSC) transformations have received considerable interest in crystal engineering, owing to providing a key platform for creating new materials. However, because of the limited tolerance of chemical bonds against the lattice strains, it is challenging to maintain the crystallinity when the structure changes dramatically. Here, a peculiar SCSC transformation from organic crystals to inorganic crystals, simultaneously achieving a drastic change in structure, connectivity, and dimension, is reported. As a demonstration, after reacting with liquid gallium, zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) can easily transform to 2D hydroxide single crystals. Interestingly, long&#8208;range ordered metallic atoms of hydroxide inherited from the ordered atomic arrangement of ZIF&#8208;8, but the connectivity is distinct. With good universality and extensibility, this transformation vastly expands the research scope of the SCSC transformations and provides a novel pathway for the synthesis of crystalline materials.

         <title>Interpolation between W Dopant and Co Vacancy in CoOOH for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interpolation principle between W dopant and Co vacancy with opposite modulation effect is proposed to tune the electronic structure of CoOOH for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, near&#8208;optimal electronic states and near&#8208;ideal intermediate energetics are achieved, leading to high catalytic activity. Such an interpolation principle can open up a new methodology for efficient catalyst design.








Abstract
Electronic structure engineering via integrating two defect structures with opposite modulation effects holds the key to fully unlocking the power of a catalyst. Herein, an interpolation principle is proposed to activate CoOOH via W doping and Co vacancies for the oxygen evolution reaction. Density functional theory suggests opposite roles for the W dopant and the Co vacancy but a synergy between them in tuning the electronic states of the Co site, leading to near&#8208;ideal intermediate energetics and dramatically lowered catalytic overpotential. Experimental studies confirm the modulation of the electronic structure and validate the greatly enhanced catalytic activity with a small overpotential of 298.5&#160;mV to drive 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The discovery of the interpolation between dopants and vacancies opens up a new methodology to design efficient catalysts for various electrochemical reactions.

         <title>A Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Plasmonic Semiconductor Photocatalyst for Nitrogen Fixation in a &#8220;One&#8208;Stone&#8208;Two&#8208;Birds&#8221; Manner</title>

         <dc:description>
A Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalyst is designed out of oxygen&#8208;deficient semiconductor MoO3 spheres for efficient nitrogen photofixation. The abundant oxygen vacancies in the spheres &#8220;kill two birds with one stone.&#8221; They serve as active sites for nitrogen molecules and induce localized surface plasmon resonance simultaneously. Apparent quantum efficiencies of over 1% are recorded from 700&#160;nm up to 1064&#160;nm.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis has received much attention owing to attractive plasmonic enhancement effects in improving the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency. However, the photocatalytic efficiencies have remained low mainly due to the short carrier lifetime caused by the rapid recombination of plasmon&#8208;generated hot charge carriers. Although plasmonic metal&#8211;semiconductor heterostructures can improve the separation of hot charge carriers, a large portion of the hot charge carriers are lost when they cross the Schottky barrier. Herein, a Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic semiconductor photocatalyst, MoO3&#8722;x, which allows for efficient N2 photofixation in a &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8208;two&#8208;birds&#8221; manner, is demonstrated. The oxygen vacancies in MoO3&#8722;x serve as the &#8220;stone.&#8221; They &#8220;kill two birds&#8221; by functioning as the active sites for the chemisorption of N2 molecules and inducing localized surface plasmon resonance for the generation of hot charge carriers. Benefiting from this unique strategy, plasmonic MoO3&#8722;x exhibits a remarkable photoreactivity for NH3 production up to the wavelength of 1064&#160;nm with apparent quantum efficiencies over 1%, and a solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion efficiency of 0.057% without any hole scavenger. This work shows the great potential of plasmonic semiconductors to be directly used for photocatalysis. The concept of the Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free design will pave a new path for the rational design of efficient photocatalysts.

         <title>3D Printed, Solid&#8208;State Conductive Ionoelastomer as a Generic Building Block for Tactile Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast photocurable, solid&#8208;state conductive ionoelastomer is designed for high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of soft ionic conductor with arbitrary architectures. The printed building blocks display excellent and temperature&#8208;tolerant electrical&#8211;mechanical properties, as well as can be programmed into 3D flexible tactile devices such as gyroid&#8208;based piezoresistive sensor and gap&#8208;based capacitive sensor, both of which exhibit sensitivities much higher than their bulky counterparts.








Abstract
Shaping soft and conductive materials into preferential architectures via 3D printing is highly attractive for numerous applications ranging from tactile devices to bioelectronics. A landmark type of soft and conductive materials is hydrogels/ionogels. However, 3D&#8208;printed hydrogels/ionogels still suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: limited stability in their electrical&#8211;mechanical properties caused by the evaporation and leakage of liquid within hydrogels/ionogels. Although photocurable liquid&#8208;free ion&#8208;conducting elastomers can circumvent these limitations, the associated photocurable process is cumbersome and hence the printing quality is relatively poor. Herein, a fast photocurable, solid&#8208;state conductive ionoelastomer (SCIE) is developed that enables high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of arbitrary architectures. The printed building blocks possess many promising features over the conventional ion&#8208;conducting materials, including high resolution architectures (even &#8776;50&#160;&#181;m overhanging lattices), good Young's modulus (up to &#8776;6.2&#160;MPa), and stretchability (fracture strain of &#8776;292%), excellent conductivity tolerance in a wide range of temperatures (from &#8722;30 to 80&#160;&#176;C), as well as fine elasticity and antifatigue ability even after 10&#160;000 loading&#8211;unloading cycles. It is further demonstrated that the printed building blocks can be programmed into 3D flexible tactile sensors such as gyroid&#8208;based piezoresistive sensor and gap&#8208;based capacitive sensor, both of which exhibit several times higher in sensitivity than their bulky counterparts.

         <title>3D Printed MXene Aerogels with Truly 3D Macrostructure and Highly Engineered Microstructure for Enhanced Electrical and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printing method based on inkjet printing and unidirectional freeze casting is utilized to fabricate pristine Ti3C2Tx aerogels with truly 3D shapes and vertically aligned MXene sheets. 3D printed aerogels are proposed for flexible/wearable electronics due to their excellent electromechanical performance. Enhanced electrochemical performance of the micro&#8208;supercapacitors is attributed to the improved electrical conductivity and ionic diffusion achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
Assembling 2D materials such as MXenes into functional 3D aerogels using 3D printing technologies gains attention due to simplicity of fabrication, customized geometry and physical properties, and improved performance. Also, the establishment of straightforward electrode fabrication methods with the aim to hinder the restack and/or aggregation of electrode materials, which limits the performance of the electrode, is of great significant. In this study, unidirectional freeze casting and inkjet&#8208;based 3D printing are combined to fabricate macroscopic porous aerogels with vertically aligned Ti3C2Tx sheets. The fabrication method is developed to easily control the aerogel microstructure and alignment of the MXene sheets. The aerogels show excellent electromechanical performance so that they can withstand almost 50% compression before recovering to the original shape and maintain their electrical conductivities during continuous compression cycles. To enhance the electrochemical performance, an inkjet&#8208;printed MXene current collector layer is added with horizontally aligned MXene sheets. This combines the superior electrical conductivity of the current collector layer with the improved ionic diffusion provided by the porous electrode.

&lt;p&gt;A 3D printing method based on inkjet printing and unidirectional freeze casting is utilized to fabricate pristine Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; aerogels with truly 3D shapes and vertically aligned MXene sheets. 3D printed aerogels are proposed for flexible/wearable electronics due to their excellent electromechanical performance. Enhanced electrochemical performance of the micro-supercapacitors is attributed to the improved electrical conductivity and ionic diffusion achieved simultaneously.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assembling 2D materials such as MXenes into functional 3D aerogels using 3D printing technologies gains attention due to simplicity of fabrication, customized geometry and physical properties, and improved performance. Also, the establishment of straightforward electrode fabrication methods with the aim to hinder the restack and/or aggregation of electrode materials, which limits the performance of the electrode, is of great significant. In this study, unidirectional freeze casting and inkjet-based 3D printing are combined to fabricate macroscopic porous aerogels with vertically aligned Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; sheets. The fabrication method is developed to easily control the aerogel microstructure and alignment of the MXene sheets. The aerogels show excellent electromechanical performance so that they can withstand almost 50% compression before recovering to the original shape and maintain their electrical conductivities during continuous compression cycles. To enhance the electrochemical performance, an inkjet-printed MXene current collector layer is added with horizontally aligned MXene sheets. This combines the superior electrical conductivity of the current collector layer with the improved ionic diffusion provided by the porous electrode. The cells fabricated with horizontal MXene sheets alignment as current collector with subsequent vertical MXene sheets alignment layers show the best electrochemical performance with thickness-independent capacitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cr&#8208;Doped Pd Metallene Endows a Practical Formaldehyde Sensor New Limit and High Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D Cr&#8208;doped Pd metallene (Cr&#8208;Pdene) with few atomic layers as an advanced catalyst provides an anti&#8208;poisoning formaldehyde&#8208;to&#8208;CO2 means for the formaldehyde oxidation reaction. The Cr&#8208;Pdene&#8208;based practical electrochemical sensor can accurately detect ppb&#8208;level gaseous formaldehyde and micromolar&#8208;level liquid formaldehyde in indoor air and different foods with long&#8208;term stability, good repeatability, and high selectivity.








Abstract
Electrochemical sensors for detecting micromolecule organics are desirable for improving the perception of environmental quality and human health. However, currently, the electrochemical sensors for formaldehyde are substantially limited on the market due to the long&#8208;term unsolved problems of the low electrooxidation efficiency and CO poisoning issue of commercial Pd catalysts. Here, a 2D Cr&#8208;doped Pd metallene (Cr&#8208;Pdene) with few atomic layers is shown as an advanced catalyst for ultrasensitive and selective sensing of formaldehyde via a highly efficient formaldehyde electrooxidation. It is found that the doping of Cr into Pd metallene can efficiently optimize the electronic structure of Pd and weaken the interaction between Pd and CO, providing an anti&#8208;poisoning means to favor CO2 production and suppress CO adsorption. The Cr&#8208;Pdene&#8208;based electrochemical sensor exhibits one order of magnitude higher detection range and, especially, much higher anti&#8208;interference for formaldehyde than that of the conventional sensors. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that the Cr&#8208;Pdene can be integrated into commercializable wireless sensor networks or handheld instruments for promising applications relating to the environment, health, and food.

Broad&#8208;Spectrum Photodetection
In article number 2107206, Yue&#8208;Yang Liu, Zhongming Wei, and co&#8208;workers show how upward movement of the Fermi level enables multichannel transition of electrons. This mechanism achieves a broad spectral response in a PdPS&#8208;based photodetector. In addition, the PdPS&#8208;based polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector and polarimetric image sensor realize the application of object detection.

In addition, the PdPS-based polarization-sensitive photodetector and polarimetric image sensor realize the application of object detection.

Perovskite Solar Cells
Light&#8208;intensity analysis of JV parameters is introduced by Yulia Galagan and Damian Glowienka in article number 2105920 as a simple method to allow understanding of the dominating mechanisms that limit device performance in perovskite solar cells. The method is based on the drift&#8211;diffusion model and is aimed at helping in the explanation of parasitic losses from trap&#8208;assisted recombination or ohmic losses in devices.

Nanocrystal Dislocations
Inducing dislocations is an efficient approach to generate strain effects in nanomaterials. In article number 2106973, Yanan Chen and co&#8208;workers report a non&#8208;equilibrium high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method (HTS) to induce dislocations in nanocrystals by using liquid nitrogen. The dislocations induced by thermal and structural stress are frozen in nanoparticles. The extreme environmental HTS can introduce dislocations in Pt nanoparticles and improve hydrogen evolution reaction performance.

         <title>A Critical Outlook for the Pursuit of Lower Contact Resistance in Organic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Though organic transistors have long been considered as a potential cornerstone technology for flexible electronics applications, their widespread commercialization in high&#8208;frequency circuits has been substantially impeded by high contact resistance. A review of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reveals the pivotal role of the organic&#8208;semiconductor morphology and the key challenges now to be overcome, such as Fermi&#8208;level pinning and low charge&#8208;carrier densities.








Abstract
To take full advantage of recent and anticipated improvements in the performance of organic semiconductors employed in organic transistors, the high contact resistance arising at the interfaces between the organic semiconductor and the source and drain contacts must be reduced significantly. To date, only a small portion of the accumulated research on organic thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) has reported channel&#8208;width&#8208;normalized contact resistances below 100 &#937;cm, well above what is regularly demonstrated in transistors based on inorganic semiconductors. A closer look at these cases and the relevant literature strongly suggests that the most significant factor leading to the lowest contact resistances in organic TFTs so far has been the control of the thin&#8208;film morphology of the organic semiconductor. By contrast, approaches aimed at increasing the charge&#8208;carrier density and/or reducing the intrinsic Schottky barrier height have so far played a relatively minor role in achieving the lowest contact resistances. Herein, the possible explanations for these observations are explored, including the prevalence of Fermi&#8208;level pinning and the difficulties in forming optimized interfaces with organic semiconductors. An overview of the research on these topics is provided, and potential device&#8208;engineering solutions are discussed based on recent advancements in the theoretical and experimental work on both organic and inorganic semiconductors.

         <title>Challenges and Strategies of Low&#8208;Cost Aluminum Anodes for High&#8208;Performance Al&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al, with the features of high specific capacity, low&#8208;cost, and abundant reserves, is promising for energy storage. The recent progress of Al anodes for various Al&#8208;based batteries is summarized. The challenges of Al anodes leading to a mismatch between theoretical and practical performance are discussed. Comprehensive strategies for Al anodes to boost the electrochemical performance are presented.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing market of electric vehicles and the upcoming grid&#8208;scale storage systems have stimulated the fast growth of renewable energy storage technologies. Aluminum&#8208;based batteries are considered one of the most promising alternatives to complement or possibly replace the current lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to their high specific capacity, good safety, low cost, light weight, and abundant reserves of Al.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ever-growing market of electric vehicles and the upcoming grid-scale storage systems have stimulated the fast growth of renewable energy storage technologies. Aluminum-based batteries are considered one of the most promising alternatives to complement or possibly replace the current lithium-ion batteries owing to their high specific capacity, good safety, low cost, light weight, and abundant reserves of Al. However, the anode problems in primary and secondary Al batteries, such as, self-corrosion, passive film, and volume expansion, severely limit the batteries&#8217; practical performance, thus hindering their commercialization. Herein, an overview of the currently emerged Al-based batteries is provided, that primarily focus on the recent research progress for Al anodes in both primary and rechargeable systems. The anode reaction mechanisms and problems in various Al-based batteries are discussed, and various strategies to overcome the challenges of Al anodes, including surface oxidation, self-corrosion, volume expansion, and dendrite growth, are systematically summarized. Finally, future research perspectives toward advanced Al batteries with higher performance and better safety are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emerging Electrocatalysts for Water Oxidation under Near&#8208;Neutral CO2 Reduction Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent theoretical and experimental development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under near pH&#8208;neutral CO2 reduction conditions is reviewed and future opportunities are discussed. These electrocatalysts range from noble&#8208;metal oxides to nonprecious metal phosphides, carbonates, and (hydro)oxides. Density functional theory, and particularly machine learning, and operando characterizations are also included.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), which produces valuable fuels and chemicals under near&#8208;neutral conditions, offers a renewable approach to alleviate the global energy crisis as well as the increasing concerns on climate change. However, to implement this strategy, one of the major challenges, the sluggish kinetics of the paired oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at anode, needs to be surmounted. It is therefore highly desirable to explore high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective OER electrocatalysts suitable for CO2RR conditions, which is very different from those widely investigated under acidic or alkaline conditions. In this review, the ongoing development of OER electrocatalysts under near pH&#8208;neutral CO2&#8208;saturated (bi)carbonate solutions are highlighted and the future opportunities are discussed. It is started with a brief introduction on OER paired with CO2RR, the relevant theoretical tools such as density functional theory (DFT) and particularly machine learning (ML), and the operando characterization techniques. Then, there are some detailed discussions of recent progress on the rational design of OER electrocatalysts under CO2RR conditions ranging from noble&#8208;metal oxides to nonprecious metal phosphides, carbonates, (hydro)oxides, and so on. Finally, a perspective for developing OER electrocatalysts integrated with CO2 electroreduction is proposed.

         <title>Bioactive Synthetic Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthetic polymers as intrinsically bioactive agents. This review presents new opportunities in the development of synthetic polymers with the ability to selectively recognize and bind biological targets, to exert anticancer and/or antibacterial activity, and others that can agglutinate or otherwise bind to viruses.








Abstract
Synthetic polymers are omnipresent in society as textiles and packaging materials, in construction and medicine, among many other important applications. Alternatively, natural polymers play a crucial role in sustaining life and allowing organisms to adapt to their environments by performing key biological functions such as molecular recognition and transmission of genetic information. In general, the synthetic and natural polymer worlds are completely separated due to the inability for synthetic polymers to perform specific biological functions; in some cases, synthetic polymers cause uncontrolled and unwanted biological responses. However, owing to the advancement of synthetic polymerization techniques in recent years, new synthetic polymers have emerged that provide specific biological functions such as targeted molecular recognition of peptides, or present antiviral, anticancer, and antimicrobial activities. In this review, the emergence of this generation of bioactive synthetic polymers and their bioapplications are summarized. Finally, the future opportunities in this area are discussed.

         <title>3D Bioprinting of Cell&#8208;Laden Hydrogels for Improved Biological Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 2, January 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes recent progress and future opportunities to design dual&#8208;stage crosslinked bioinks, which are gels both prior to and after printing. These active, living materials are composed of both acellular and cellular components. Engineering hydrogels with consideration of cells as an intrinsic component of the printed bioink will enable greater biofunctionality.








Abstract
The encapsulation of cells within gel&#8208;phase materials to form bioinks offers distinct advantages for next&#8208;generation 3D bioprinting. 3D bioprinting has emerged as a promising tool for patterning cells, but the technology remains limited in its ability to produce biofunctional, tissue&#8208;like constructs due to a dearth of materials suitable for bioinks. While early demonstrations commonly used viscous polymers optimized for printability, these materials often lacked cell compatibility and biological functionality. In response, advanced materials that exist in the gel phase during the entire printing process are being developed, since hydrogels are uniquely positioned to both protect cells during extrusion and provide biological signals to embedded cells as the construct matures during culture. Here, an overview of the design considerations for gel&#8208;phase materials as bioinks is presented, with a focus on their mechanical, biochemical, and dynamic gel properties. Current challenges and opportunities that arise due to the fact that bioprinted constructs are active, living hydrogels composed of both acellular and cellular components are also evaluated. Engineering hydrogels with consideration of cells as an intrinsic component of the printed bioink will enable control over the evolution of the living construct after printing to achieve greater biofunctionality.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Lithium Iodide in Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>

The role of iodide as an additive in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries is not well understood, especially in the charging process. The recent advances on LiI are reviewed and the synergistic effect with water is discussed. Alternative approaches for enabling the charging process are also provided.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries possess a high theoretical energy density, which means they could become a potential alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Nevertheless, the charging process of Li&#8211;O2 batteries requires much higher energy, due to the insulating nature of the discharge product. It has been revealed that the anion additive, lithium iodide (LiI), can tune the cell chemistry to form lithium hydroxide (LiOH) as the product and facilitate the kinetics during the charging process. Although numerous studies have been reported, the role of this additive is still under investigation. Herein, the recent advances focusing on the use of LiI in Li&#8211;O2 batteries are reviewed, its catalytic behavior on discharge and charge is discussed, and its synergistic effect with water is understood. The ambiguity existing among the studies are also revealed, and solutions to the current issues are introduced.

         <title>Encapsulation of Metallic Zn in a Hybrid MXene/Graphene Aerogel as a Stable Zn Anode for Foldable Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite anode of metallic zinc (Zn) in graphene&#8211;MXene aerogel is prepared for Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The Zn metal is completely encapsulated inside the host in a 3D microscale manner, which suppresses the side reactions and regulates the Zn deposition. Meanwhile, the aerogel, with excellent flexibility, achieves stable electrochemical performance for foldable Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
A 3D host can effectively mitigate the dendritic growth of a zinc (Zn)&#8208;metal anode. However, the increased electrode/electrolyte reaction area using the 3D substrate accelerates the passivation and corrosion at the anode interface, ultimately degrading the electrochemical performance. Here, an oriented freezing process is used to create a flexible MXene/graphene scaffold. Based on the abundant zincophilic traits and micropores in the structure, Zn is densely encapsulated inside the host by the electrodeposition process.

&lt;p&gt;A composite anode of metallic zinc (Zn) in graphene&#8211;MXene aerogel is prepared for Zn-ion batteries. The Zn metal is completely encapsulated inside the host in a 3D microscale manner, which suppresses the side reactions and regulates the Zn deposition. Meanwhile, the aerogel, with excellent flexibility, achieves stable electrochemical performance for foldable Zn-ion batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 3D host can effectively mitigate the dendritic growth of a zinc (Zn)-metal anode. However, the increased electrode/electrolyte reaction area using the 3D substrate accelerates the passivation and corrosion at the anode interface, ultimately degrading the electrochemical performance. Here, an oriented freezing process is used to create a flexible MXene/graphene scaffold. Based on the abundant zincophilic traits and micropores in the structure, Zn is densely encapsulated inside the host by the electrodeposition process. During cycling, the composite anode endows an in situ solid electrolyte interface with zinc fluoride at the electrode/electrolyte interface due to inherent fluorine terminations in MXene, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth. Furthermore, the design wherein bulk Zn is distributed in a 3D microscale manner suppresses hydrogen evolution reactions (3.8&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and passivation, through in/ex situ tests. As a result, in a symmetrical cell test, the electrode has a long-cycling life of over 1000 h at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. After continuous single folding followed by double folding, a quasi-solid-state foldable cell with the composite anode and a LiMn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathode (60% depth of discharge) maintains high-capacity retention of over 91%. This research presents a revolutionary encapsulating idea for aqueous Zn-ion batteries, as well as foldable investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intracellular Condensates of Oligopeptide for Targeting Lysosome and Addressing Multiple Drug Resistance of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lysosome selective construction of biomolecular hydrogel with emerging biological functions provides a novel strategy for controlling cancer cell fates by inducing lysosomal&#8208;membrane permeabilization and addressing multidrug resistance in a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model.








Abstract
Biomolecular condensates have been demonstrated as a ubiquitous phenomenon in biological systems and play a crucial role in controlling cellular functions. However, the spatiotemporal construction of artificial biomolecular condensates with functions remains challenging and has been less explored. Herein, a general approach is reported to construct biomolecular condensates (e.g., hydrogel) in the lysosome of living cells for cancer therapy and address multiple drug resistance induced by lysosome sequestration. Aromatic&#8208;motif&#8208;appended pH&#8208;responsive hexapeptide (LTP) derived from natural insulin can be uptaken by cancer cells mainly through caveolae&#8208;dependent endocytosis, ensuring the proton&#8208;triggered phase transformation (solution to hydrogel) of LTP inside the lysosome specifically. Lysosomal hydrogelation further leads to enlargement of the lysosome in cancer cells and increases the permeability of the lysosome, resulting in cancer cell death. Importantly, lysosomal assemblies can significantly improve the efficiency of current chemotherapy drugs toward multidrug resistance (MDR) cells in vitro and in xenograft tumor models. As an example of functional artificial condensates in lysosomes, this work provides a new strategy for controlling functional condensates formation precisely in the organelles of living cells and addressing MDR in cancer therapy.

         <title>Loading Single&#8208;Ni Atoms on Assembled Hollow N&#8208;Rich Carbon Plates for Efficient CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembled hollow N&#8208;rich carbon plates with single&#8208;Ni atoms (Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)) are constructed using a novel dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework (ZTF) as precursor. The open structure and high external surface area enable the Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst with fast mass transfer and highly exposed single&#8208;Ni sites towards efficient CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
The rational design of catalysts&#8217; spatial structure is vitally important to boost catalytic performance through exposing the active sites, enhancing the mass transfer, and confining the reactants. Herein, a dual&#8208;linker zeolitic tetrazolate framework&#8208;engaged strategy is developed to construct assembled hollow plates (AHP) of N&#8208;rich carbon (NC), which is loaded with single&#8208;Ni atoms to form a highly efficient electrocatalyst (designated as Ni&#8208;NC(AHP)). In the carbonization process, the thermally unstable linker (5&#8208;aminotetrazole) serves as the self&#8208;sacrificial template and the other linker (2&#8208;methylimidazole) mainly serves as the carbon and nitrogen source to form hollow NC matrix. The formed Ni&#8208;NC(AHP) catalyst possesses enhanced mesoporosity and more available surface area, thus promoting mass transport and affording abundant accessible single&#8208;Ni sites. These features contribute to remarkable performance for electrochemical CO2 reduction with exceptionally high selectivity of nearly 100% towards CO in a wide potential range and dramatically enhanced CO partial current density.

         <title>Controllable SiOx Nanorod Memristive Neuron for Probabilistic Bayesian Inference</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A probabilistic SiOx nanorod memristive neuron is fabricated by employing the glancing angle deposition technique. Due to the SiOx nanorod structure, a multitude of Si switching filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges can be formed, leading to different probabilistic activation functions with controllability. Furthermore, the self&#8208;resting neural operation and probabilistic Bayesian inferences are also demonstrated with the fabricated device.








Abstract
Modern artificial neural network technology using a deterministic computing framework is faced with a critical challenge in dealing with massive data that are largely unstructured and ambiguous. This challenge demands the advances of an elementary physical device for tackling these uncertainties. Here, we&#160;designed and fabricated a SiOx nanorod memristive device by employing the glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique, suggesting a controllable stochastic artificial neuron that can mimic the fundamental integrate&#8208;and&#8208;fire signaling and stochastic dynamics of a biological neuron. The nanorod structure provides the random distribution of multiple nanopores all across the active area, capable of forming a multitude of Si filaments at many SiOx nanorod edges after the electromigration process, leading to a stochastic switching event with very high dynamic range (&#8776;5.15 &#215; 1010) and low energy (&#8776;4.06 pJ). Different probabilistic activation (ProbAct) functions in a sigmoid form are implemented, showing its controllability with low variation by manufacturing and electrical programming schemes. Furthermore, as an application prospect, based on the suggested memristive neuron, we&#160;demonstrated the self&#8208;resting neural operation with the local circuit configuration and revealed probabilistic Bayesian inferences for genetic regulatory networks with low normalized mean squared errors (&#8776;2.41 &#215; 10&#8208;2) and its robustness to the ProbAct variation.

         <title>Mesenchymal Stem Cell&#8208;Derived Extracellular Vesicles with High PD&#8208;L1 Expression for Autoimmune Diseases Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;expressing programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are prepared for autoimmune diseases treatment. As cell&#8208;free carrier, MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 restore tissue lesion by reshaping the local immune microenvironment via programmed cell death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 pathway, which may potentially provide a universal platform technique for the immunotherapy of various autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Autoimmune diseases are the third most common disease influencing the quality of life of many patients. Here, a programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 + (PD&#8208;L1) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) derived extracellular vesicles (MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) using lentivirus&#8208;mediated gene transfection technology is developed for reconfiguration of the local immune microenvironment of affected tissue in autoimmune diseases. MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 exhibits an impressive ability to regulate various activated immune cells to an immunosuppressed state in vitro. More importantly, in dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced ulcerative colitis (UC) and imiquimod&#8208;induced psoriasis mouse models, a significantly high accumulation of MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 is observed in the inflamed tissues compared to the PD&#8208;L1+ MSCs. Therapeutic efficiency in both UC and psoriasis mouse disease models is demonstrated using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to reshape the inflammatory ecosystem in the local immune context. A technology is developed using MSC&#8208;sEVs&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 as a natural delivery platform for autoimmune diseases treatment with high clinical potential.

         <title>Textured Electrodes: Manipulating Built&#8208;In Crystallographic Heterogeneity of Metal Electrodes via Severe Plastic Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large crystallographic heterogeneity, e.g., broad orientational distribution, characteristic of commercial metal foils results in rough electrodeposit morphology in either metal plating/stripping processes. An accumulative roll bonding (ARB) methodology is reported to achieve uniform crystallographic control on macroscopic materials. Electrochemical analysis shows that ARB can produce large improvements in reversibility of metal anodes.








Abstract
Control of crystallography of metal electrodeposit films has recently emerged as a key to achieving long operating lifetimes in next&#8208;generation batteries. It is reported that the large crystallographic heterogeneity, e.g., broad orientational distribution, that appears characteristic of commercial metal foils, results in rough morphology upon plating/stripping. On this basis, an accumulative roll bonding (ARB) methodology&#8212;a severe plastic deformation process&#8212;is developed. Zn metal is used as a first example to interrogate the concept. It is demonstrated that the ARB process is highly effective in achieving uniform crystallographic control on macroscopic materials. After the ARB process, the Zn grains exhibit a strong (002) texture (i.e., [002]Zn//ND). The texture transitions from a classical bipolar pattern to a nonclassical unipolar pattern under large nominal strain eliminate the orientational heterogeneity of the foil. The strongly (002)&#8208;textured Zn remarkably improves the plating/stripping performance by nearly two orders of magnitude under practical conditions. The performance improvements are readily scaled to achieve pouch&#8208;type full batteries that deliver exceptional reversibility. The ARB process can, in principle, be applied to any metal chemistry to achieve similar crystallographic uniformity, provided the appropriate temperature and accumulated strains are employed. This concept is evaluated using commercial Li and Na foils, which, unlike Zn (HCP), are BCC crystals. The simple process for creating strong textures in both hexagonal and cubic metals and illustrating the critical role such built&#8208;in crystallography plays underscores opportunities for developing highly reversible thin metal anodes (e.g., hexagonal Zn, Mg, and cubic Li, Na, Ca, Al).

         <title>Spatiotemporally Controllable Distribution of Combination Therapeutics in Solid Tumors by Dually Modified Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods capable of distributing antitumor therapeutics uniformly and durably throughout an entire tumor would be of great significance in maximizing their treatment efficacy but have proven to be extremely challenging. In this work, bacteria&#8208;mediated spatiotemporally controllable distribution of combination therapeutics is described in solid tumors, which can reprogram the immune microenvironment for optimizing antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Methods capable of distributing antitumor therapeutics uniformly and durably throughout an entire tumor would be of great significance in maximizing their treatment efficacy, but they have proven to be extremely challenging. Here, bacteria&#8208;mediated spatiotemporally controllable distribution of combination therapeutics in solid tumors is reported to reprogram the immune microenvironment for optimizing antitumor efficacy. By combining synthetic biology and interfacial chemistry, bacteria are inside and outside concurrently modified to express photothermal melanin and to attach immune checkpoint inhibitors on their surface. Due to the nature of bacteria to colonize the hypoxia intratumoral environment, both therapeutic agents can be distributed homogenously and lastingly in tumors during ex vivo human and in vivo mouse studies. Spatiotemporally controllable localization of melanin can repeatedly generate a moderate yet uniform heating of the tumor upon light exposure in a broad treatment window. Combination with similarly localized inhibitors elicits a dual photothermally stimulated and checkpoint&#8208;blockade&#8208;mediated immune activation effect, synergistically reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Therapeutic values are demonstrated by significantly inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of mice in both subcutaneous and orthotopic murine models. Colonization of dually modified bacteria paves an avenue for spatiotemporally controllable distribution of therapeutic drugs in solid tumors.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Electroactive Nanoporous Silicon: Large and Fully Reversible Electrochemo&#8208;Mechanical Actuation in Aqueous Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
For large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers in aqueous electrolytes, with laser cantilever bending experiments, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by low operation voltages of 1&#8201;V is demonstrated. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity upon ion adsorption and desorption.








Abstract
Nanoporosity in silicon results in interface&#8208;dominated mechanics, fluidics, and photonics that are often superior to the ones of the bulk material. However, their active control, for example, by electronic stimuli, is challenging due to the absence of intrinsic piezoelectricity in the base material. Here, for large&#8208;scale nanoporous silicon cantilevers wetted by aqueous electrolytes, electrosorption&#8208;induced mechanical stress generation of up to 600&#8201;kPa that is reversible and adjustable at will by potential variations of &#8776;1&#8201;V is shown. Laser cantilever bending experiments in combination with in operando voltammetry and step coulombmetry allow this large electro&#8208;actuation to be traced to the concerted action of 100 billions of parallel nanopores per square centimeter cross&#8208;section and determination of the capacitive charge&#8211;stress coupling parameter upon ion adsorption and desorption as well as the intimately related stress actuation dynamics for perchloric and isotonic saline solutions. A comparison with planar silicon surfaces reveals mechanistic insights on the observed electrocapillarity (Hellmann&#8211;Feynman interactions) with respect to the importance of oxide formation and wall roughness on the single&#8208;nanopore scale. The observation of robust electrochemo&#8208;mechanical actuation in a mainstream semiconductor with wafer&#8208;scale, self&#8208;organized nanoporosity opens up novel opportunities for on&#8208;chip integrated stress generation and actuorics at exceptionally low operation&#160;voltages.

         <title>Cycloruthenated Self&#8208;Assembly with Metabolic Inhibition to Efficiently Overcome Multidrug Resistance in Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cyclometalated Ru(II) complex, RuZ, is reported to be able to self&#8208;assemble and accumulate in high levels in multi&#8208;drug resistant cancer cells. RuZ significantly increases cancer cell death by dual metabolic inhibition and interactions with multiple biological targets. Overall, the results suggest that RuZ could represent a potential treatment for cancers including multi&#8208;drug resistant cancers.








Abstract
The synthesis and the evaluation of the efficacy of a cycloruthenated complex, RuZ, is reported, to overcome multi&#8208;drug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. RuZ can self&#8208;assemble into nanoaggregates in the cell culture medium, resulting in a high intracellular concentration of RuZ in MDR cancer cells. The self&#8208;assembly significantly decreases oxygen consumption and inhibits glycolysis, which decreases cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. The decrease in ATP levels and its low affinity for the ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters (which mediate MDR) significantly increase the retention of RuZ by MDR cancer cells. Furthermore, RuZ increases cellular oxidative stress, inducing DNA damage, and, in combination with the aforementioned effects of RuZ, increases the apoptosis of cancer cells. Proteomic profiling analysis suggests that the RuZ primarily decreases the expression of proteins that mediate glycolysis and aerobic mitochondrial respiration and increases the expression of proteins involved in apoptosis. RuZ inhibits the proliferation of 35 cancer cell lines, of which 7 cell lines are resistant to clinical drugs. It is also active in doxorubicin&#8208;resistant MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231/Adr mouse tumor xenografts. To the best of our&#160;knowledge, the results are the first to show that self&#8208;assembled cycloruthenated complexes are efficacious in inhibiting the growth of MDR cancer cells.

         <title>Self&#8208;Complementary Zwitterionic Peptides Direct Nanoparticle Assembly and Enable Enzymatic Selection of Endocytic Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activated assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using the zwitterionic peptide, LRGD, as a self&#8208;complementary, electrostatic binding moiety is illustrated. PEGylated peptide ligands containing the LRGD sequence are immobilized on the AuNPs.

Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly in biological systems holds promise to convert and amplify disease&#8208;specific signals to physical or mechanical signals that can direct cell fate. However, it remains challenging to design physiologically stable self&#8208;assembling systems that demonstrate tunable and predictable behavior. Here, the use of zwitterionic tetrapeptide modalities to direct nanoparticle assembly under physiological conditions is reported. The self&#8208;assembly of gold nanoparticles can be activated by enzymatic unveiling of surface&#8208;bound zwitterionic tetrapeptides through matrix metalloprotease&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9), which is overexpressed by cancer cells. This robust nanoparticle assembly is achieved by multivalent, self&#8208;complementary interactions of the zwitterionic tetrapeptides. In cancer cells that overexpress MMP&#8208;9, the nanoparticle assembly process occurs near the cell membrane and causes size&#8208;induced selection of cellular uptake mechanism, resulting in diminished cell growth. The enzyme responsiveness, and therefore, indirectly, the uptake route of the system can be programmed by customizing the peptide sequence: a simple inversion of the two amino acids at the cleavage site completely inactivates the enzyme responsiveness, self&#8208;assembly, and consequently changes the endocytic pathway. This robust self&#8208;complementary, zwitterionic peptide design demonstrates the use of enzyme&#8208;activated electrostatic side&#8208;chain patterns as powerful and customizable peptide modalities to program nanoparticle self&#8208;assembly and alter cellular response in biological context.

&lt;p&gt;An enzyme-activated assembly of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using the zwitterionic peptide, LRGD, as a self-complementary, electrostatic binding moiety is illustrated. PEGylated peptide ligands containing the LRGD sequence are immobilized on the AuNPs. Cancer-specific enzymes, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), cleave the peptide ligands and subsequently unveil the LRGD moieties that promote multivalent, electrostatic interactions, leading to the assembly of the AuNPs.

         <title>Breaking the Efficiency Limit of Deep&#8208;Blue Fluorescent OLEDs Based on Anthracene Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) process can recycle nonradiative triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons and enhance the efficiency of fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Conventionally, the theoretical limit of delayed emission ratio by the TTA process is known to be 37.5% in anthracene&#8208;based molecules. In this work, 48% of delayed emission ratio is achieved by TTA with carefully designed blue OLEDs.








Abstract
Triplet harvesting is important for the realization of high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) is one triplet&#8208;harvesting strategy. However, for blue&#8208;emitting anthracene derivatives, the theoretical maximum radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio generated from the TTA process is known to be 15% in addition to the initially generated singlets of 25%, which is insufficient for high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent devices. In this study, nearly 25% of the radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio is realized by TTA using an anthracene derivative, breaking the theoretical limit. As a result, efficient deep&#8208;blue TTA fluorescent devices are developed, exhibiting external quantum efficiencies of 10.2% and 8.6% with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage color coordinates of (0.134, 0.131) and (0.137, 0.076), respectively. The theoretical model provided herein explains the experimental results considering both the TTA and reverse intersystem crossing to a singlet state from higher triplet states formed by the TTA, clearly demonstrating that the radiative singlet ratio generated from TTA can reach 37.5% (total radiative singlet&#8208;exciton ratio: 62.5%), well above 15% (total 40%), despite the molecule having S1, T2&#160;&lt;&#160;2T1&#160;&lt; Q1 energy levels, which will lead to the development of high&#8208;efficiency fluorescent OLEDs with external quantum efficiencies exceeding 28% if the outcoupling efficiency is 45%.

         <title>Viologen&#8208;Immobilized 2D Polymer Film Enabling Highly Efficient Electrochromic Device for Solar&#8208;Powered Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully crystalline viologen&#8208;immobilized 2D polymer (V2DP) film is synthesized, which enables high utilization of viologen moieties and fast ion transport. On this basis, the as&#8208;fabricated V2DP&#8208;based ECDs exhibit a rapid switching speed, and a high coloration efficiency (989 cm2 C&#8722;1). Furthermore, the highly efficient V2DP ECDs are vertically integrated with transparent solar cells, thereby generating energy&#8208;saving EC window systems.








Abstract
Electrochromic devices (ECDs) have emerged as a unique class of optoelectronic devices for the development of smart windows. However, current ECDs typically suffer from low coloration efficiency (CE) and high energy consumption, which have thus hindered their practical applications, especially as components in solar&#8208;powered EC windows. Here, the high&#8208;performance ECDs with a fully crystalline viologen&#8208;immobilized 2D polymer (V2DP) thin film as the color&#8208;switching layer is demonstrated. The high density of vertically oriented pore channels (pore size &#8776; 4.5&#160;nm; pore density &#8776; 5.8 &#215; 1016 m&#8208;2) in the synthetic V2DP film enables high utilization of redox&#8208;active viologen moieties and benefits for Li+ ion diffusion/transport. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated ECDs achieve a rapid switching speed (coloration, 2.8 s; bleaching, 1.2 s), and a high CE (989 cm2 C&#8208;1), and low energy consumption (21.1 &#181;W cm&#8208;2). Moreover, it is managed to fabricate transmission&#8208;tunable, self&#8208;sustainable EC window prototypes by vertically integrating the V2DP ECDs with transparent solar cells. This work sheds light on designing electroactive 2D polymers with molecular precision for optoelectronics and paves a practical route toward developing self&#8208;powered EC windows to offset the electricity consumption of buildings.

         <title>Universal Existence of Localized Single&#8208;Photon Emitters in the Perovskite Film of All&#8208;Inorganic CsPbBr3 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;photon emitters are universally observed from all&#8208;inorganic perovskite films at the cryogenic temperature, owing to local thickness variations of the composing CsPbBr3 microcrystals and the resulting low potential&#8208;energy regions. The discovery of such novel emitting species in a perovskite film, with the enriched structure&#8211;property relationship, will impart significant influences on the advancement of relevant optoelectronic devices and quantum&#8208;light sources.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites have drawn a lot of research attention very recently owing to their potential solution to the instability issue currently faced by the organic&#8211;inorganic counterparts. Meanwhile, the halide perovskites in a solid film are manifested as microscale morphologies whose functionalities are unavoidably affected by the interior or exterior presence of various nanoscale entities. Here all&#8208;inorganic solid films are fabricated with varying densities of single CsPbBr3 microcrystals, showing that very sharp photoluminescence peaks can be universally observed at 4 K with the linewidths being as narrow as hundreds of &#956;eV. The single&#8208;photon emission nature is confirmed for such a photoluminescence peak, whose intensity is completely quenched above &#8776;30&#160;K to suggest its possible origin from a low potential&#8208;energy region of the single microcrystal. The discovery of such a novel emitting species in halide perovskites, with the enriched structure&#8211;property relationship, will surely impart significant influences on the advancement of relevant optoelectronic devices and quantum&#8208;light sources.

         <title>Designing a Zn&#8211;Ag Catalyst Matrix and Electrolyzer System for CO2 Conversion to CO and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalysts, electrodes, and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are developed for the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and beyond. The system consists of highly porous Ag dispersed in a Zn matrix, which leads to high CO2 utilization as described by multiphysics modeling. Coupling to microbiology allows for further upgrading to multicarbon products.








Abstract
CO2 emissions can be transformed into high&#8208;added&#8208;value commodities through CO2 electrocatalysis; however, efficient low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts are needed for global scale&#8208;up. Inspired by other emerging technologies, the authors report the development of a gas diffusion electrode containing highly dispersed Ag sites in a low&#8208;cost Zn matrix. This catalyst shows unprecedented Ag mass activity for CO production: &#8722;614&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.17&#160;mg&#160;of Ag. Subsequent electrolyte engineering demonstrates that halide anions can further improve stability and activity of the Zn&#8211;Ag catalyst, outperforming pure Ag and Au. Membrane electrode assemblies are constructed and coupled to a microbial process that converts the CO to acetate and ethanol.

     alt="Designing a Zn&#8211;Ag Catalyst Matrix and Electrolyzer System for CO2 Conversion to CO and Beyond"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catalysts, electrodes, and membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) are developed for the electrocatalytic conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-CO and beyond. The system consists of highly porous Ag dispersed in a Zn matrix, which leads to high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization as described by multiphysics modeling. Coupling to microbiology allows for further upgrading to multicarbon products.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions can be transformed into high-added-value commodities through CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalysis; however, efficient low-cost electrocatalysts are needed for global scale-up. Inspired by other emerging technologies, the authors report the development of a gas diffusion electrode containing highly dispersed Ag sites in a low-cost Zn matrix. This catalyst shows unprecedented Ag mass activity for CO production: &lt;b&gt;&#8722;&lt;/b&gt;614&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.17&#160;mg&#160;of Ag. Subsequent electrolyte engineering demonstrates that halide anions can further improve stability and activity of the Zn&#8211;Ag catalyst, outperforming pure Ag and Au. Membrane electrode assemblies are constructed and coupled to a microbial process that converts the CO to acetate and ethanol. Combined, these concepts present pathways to design catalysts and systems for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion toward sought-after products.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulating Color Emission in 2D Hybrid Perovskites by Fine Tuning Halide Segregation: A Transparent Green Emitter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled halide substitution in low&#8208;dimensional hybrid perovskites is an effective strategy to vary the material bandgap, obtaining a palette of light emitters, whereby transparent thin films emitting in the green are realized. By fine&#8208;tuning the halide content, nanoscale phase segregation happens, resulting in a controlled nanoscale spatial distribution of recombination centers.








Abstract
Halide perovskite materials offer an ideal playground for easily tuning their color and, accordingly, the spectral range of their emitted light. In contrast to common procedures, this work demonstrates that halide substitution in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites not only progressively modulates the bandgap, but it can also be a powerful tool to control the nanoscale phase segregation&#8212;by adjusting the halide ratio and therefore the spatial distribution of recombination centers. As a result, thin films of chloride&#8208;rich perovskite are engineered&#8212;which appear transparent to the human eye&#8212;with controlled tunable emission in the green. This is due to a rational halide substitution with iodide or bromide leading to a spatial distribution of phases where the minor component is responsible for the tunable emission, as identified by combined hyperspectral photoluminescence imaging and elemental mapping. This work paves the way for the next generation of highly tunable transparent emissive materials, which can be used as light&#8208;emitting pixels in advanced and low&#8208;cost optoelectronics.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Dominated Hyperfine Interaction Impacting the Carrier Spin Dynamics in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building up on the excellent optical properties of perovskite materials, the electron and hole spin dynamics provide fundamental insights into the carrier&#8211;nuclear spin system. In the model perovskite, bulk FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2, Land&#233; factors, key spin relaxation times, and mechanisms are determined. Optically detected NMR reveals the dominance of the lead spin hyperfine interaction at the top of the valence band.








Abstract
The outstanding optical quality of lead halide perovskites inspires studies of their potential for the optical control of carrier spins as pursued in other materials. Entering largely uncharted territory, time&#8208;resolved pump&#8211;probe Kerr rotation is used to explore the coherent spin dynamics of electrons and holes in bulk formamidinium caesium lead iodine bromide (FA0.9Cs0.1PbI2.8Br0.2) and to determine key parameters characterizing interactions of their spins, such as the g&#8208;factors and relaxation times. The demonstrated long spin dynamics and narrow g&#8208;factor distribution prove the perovskites as promising competitors for conventional semiconductors in spintronics. The dynamic nuclear polarization via spin&#8208;oriented holes is realized and the identification of the lead (207Pb) isotope in optically detected nuclear magnetic resonance proves that the hole&#8211;nuclei interaction is dominated by the lead ions. A detailed theoretical analysis accounting for the specifics of the lead halide perovskite materials allows the evaluation of the underlying hyperfine interaction constants, both for electrons and holes. Recombination and spin dynamics evidence that at low temperatures, photogenerated electrons and holes are localized at different regions of the perovskite crystal, resulting in their long lifetimes up to 44&#160;&#956;s. The findings form the base for the tailored development of spin&#8208;optoelectronic applications for the large family of lead halide perovskites and their&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Coupling Spin Defects in a Layered Material to Nanoscale Plasmonic Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of plasmonic gap cavities are used to enhance emission from spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The cavities are silver nanocubes&#160;positioned on top of a gold mirror, encapsulating multilayer hBN with embedded boron vacancy spin defects. Nearly an order of magnitude enhancement is demonstrated at room temperature, associated with an efficient optically detected magnetic resonance readout.








Abstract
Spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride, and specifically the negatively charged boron vacancy (VB&#8208;) centers, are emerging candidates for quantum sensing. However, the VB&#8208; defects suffer from low quantum efficiency and, as a result, exhibit weak photoluminescence. In this work, a scalable approach is demonstrated to dramatically enhance the VB&#8208; emission by coupling to a plasmonic gap cavity. The plasmonic cavity is composed of a flat gold surface and a silver cube, with few&#8208;layer hBN flakes positioned in between. Employing these plasmonic cavities, two orders of magnitude are extracted in photoluminescence enhancement associated with a corresponding twofold enhancement in optically detected magnetic resonance contrast. The work will be pivotal to progress in quantum sensing employing 2D materials, and in realization of nanophotonic devices with spin defects in hexagonal boron nitride.

Abstract
Repeated cold rolling and folding is employed to fabricate a metallurgical composite of sodium&#8211;antimony&#8211;telluride Na2(Sb2/6Te3/6Vac1/6) dispersed in electrochemically active sodium metal, termed &#8220;NST&#8208;Na.&#8221; This new intermetallic has a vacancy&#8208;rich thermodynamically stable face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic structure and enables state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrochemical performance in widely employed carbonate and ether electrolytes. NST&#8208;Na achieves 100% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge (DOD) in 1 m NaPF6 in G2, with 15 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.4%, for 1000 h&#160;of plating/stripping. Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) with NST&#8208;Na and Na3V2(PO4)3&#160;(NVP) or sulfur cathodes give significantly improved energy, cycling, and CE (&gt;99%). An anode&#8208;free battery with NST collector and NVP obtains 0.23% capacity decay per cycle. Imaging and tomography using conventional and cryogenic microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) indicate that the sodium metal fills the open space inside the self&#8208;supporting sodiophilic NST skeleton, resulting in dense (pore&#8208;free and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)&#8208;free) metal deposits with flat surfaces. The baseline Na deposit consists of filament&#8208;like dendrites and &#8220;dead metal&#8221;, intermixed with pores and SEI. Density functional theory calculations show that the uniqueness of NST lies in the thermodynamic stability of the Na atoms (rather than clusters) on its surface that leads to planar wetting, and in its own stability that prevents decomposition during cycling.

NST-Na achieves 100% depth-of-discharge (DOD) in 1 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; NaPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; in G2, with 15 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.4%, for 1000 h&#160;of plating/stripping. Sodium-metal batteries (SMBs) with NST-Na and Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;(NVP) or sulfur cathodes give significantly improved energy, cycling, and CE (&amp;gt;99%). An anode-free battery with NST collector and NVP obtains 0.23% capacity decay per cycle. Imaging and tomography using conventional and cryogenic microscopy (Cryo-EM) indicate that the sodium metal fills the open space inside the self-supporting sodiophilic NST skeleton, resulting in dense (pore-free and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI)-free) metal deposits with flat surfaces. The baseline Na deposit consists of filament-like dendrites and &#8220;dead metal&#8221;, intermixed with pores and SEI. Density functional theory calculations show that the uniqueness of NST lies in the thermodynamic stability of the Na atoms (rather than clusters) on its surface that leads to planar wetting, and in its own stability that prevents decomposition during cycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Catalytic Small Interfering RNA Nanocarriers for Synergistic Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;catalytic siRNA nanocarriers S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with a ceria (CeO2) nanozymes&#8208;mediated rough surface can catalyze the delivery process and amplify the cellular uptake efficiency. The CeO2 nanozymes catalyze excess reactive oxygen species scavenging and cooperate with siSNCA to reduce the formation of &#945;&#8208;syn aggregates in the treatment process. S/Ce&#8208;PABMS exhibit superior synergistic treatment effects and significantly improve dyskinesia of Parkinson's disease mice.








Abstract
Gene therapy has shown great potential for neurodegenerative diseases with complex pathology. However, its therapeutic effect is limited due to the delivery barriers and its own single function. Herein, self&#8208;catalytic small interfering RNA (siRNA) nanocarriers (S/Ce&#8208;PABMS) are developed to catalyze delivery process and treatment process for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. On the one hand, the rough surface of the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS mediated by ceria (CeO2) nanozymes can catalyze cellular uptake in the delivery process, so that S/Ce&#8208;PABMS with acetylcholine analogs penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier and enter neurons more effectively. On the other hand, the CeO2 nanozymes can catalyze the treatment process by scavenging excess reactive oxygen species, and cooperate with siRNA&#8208;targeting SNCA to decrease the &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) aggregation and alleviate the Parkinsonian pathology. Moreover, the S/Ce&#8208;PABMS treatment reduces the number of activated microglia and regulates the release of inflammatory cytokine, thereby relieving neuroinflammation. After treatment with S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease model mice is significantly alleviated. The finding shows that the self&#8208;catalytic nanocarriers, S/Ce&#8208;PABMS, have great potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Enabled Phase Transition of Periodic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;enabled phase transition of stretchable periodic metasurfaces between any two Bravais lattices, which reflect their symmetry, is demonstrated analytically and experimentally. Such transition offers a flexible way to engineer the resonance regime and dispersion relation of metasurfaces. In particular, the strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering leads to linearly and circularly polarized dichroism, which is demonstrated for information decoding.








Abstract
Phase transitions are universal in solid&#8208;state matters, as well as in periodic electromagnetic metasurfaces&#8212;the photonic analogues of crystals. Although such transitions dictate the properties of active metasurfaces, universal ways to describe the structure transition of periodic metasurfaces have not yet been established. Here, the authors report the strain&#8208;enabled phase transition (or lattice deformation) of stretchable metasurfaces with the crystallographic description. They analytically and experimentally demonstrate the phase transition of plasmonic lattices between two arbitrary 2D Bravais lattices under certain strain configurations. The strain&#8208;induced symmetry lowering of the structures gives rise to optical anisotropy upon polarization, namely, linearly and circularly polarized dichroism. They further demonstrate the potential of phase transition in information decoding with applied strain. Interpreting the phase transition of metasurfaces from a standpoint of symmetry would accelerate the discovery of emergent properties, and provide a generalizable approach to designing active metasurfaces.

         <title>Strongly Anisotropic Strain&#8208;Tunability of Excitons in Exfoliated ZrSe3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zirconium triselenide is a 2D semiconductor material with an interesting in&#8208;plane anisotropic crystal structure. Here, it is demonstrated that the excitons of this material are very sensitive to uniaxial strains and, interestingly, their tunability strongly depends on the direction along which the uniaxial strain is applied.








Abstract
The effect of uniaxial strain on the band structure of ZrSe3, a semiconducting material with a marked in&#8208;plane structural anisotropy, is studied. By using a modified three&#8208;point bending test apparatus, thin ZrSe3 flakes are subjected to uniaxial strain along different crystalline orientations monitoring the effect of strain on their optical properties through micro&#8208;reflectance spectroscopy. The obtained spectra show excitonic features that blueshift upon uniaxial tension. This shift is strongly dependent on the direction along which the strain is being applied. When the flakes are strained along the b&#8208;axis, the exciton peak shifts at &#8776;60&#8211;95 meV %&#8722;1, while along the a&#8208;axis, the shift only reaches &#8776;0&#8211;15 meV %&#8722;1. Ab initio calculations are conducted to study the influence of uniaxial strain, applied along different crystal directions, on the band structure and reflectance spectra of ZrSe3, exhibiting a remarkable agreement with the experimental results.

OLEDs based on these CPMR&#8208;TADF emitters show excellent performance, attaining a three&#8208;in&#8208;one advantage: high efficiency, color purity, and circular polarized light simultaneously.








Abstract
Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF), which exhibit novel circularly polarized luminescence and excellent color fidelity, respectively, have gained immense popularity. In this study, integrated CP&#8208;TADF and MR&#8208;TADF (CPMR&#8208;TADF) are prepared by strategic design and synthesis of asymmetrical peripherally locked enantiomers, which are separated and denoted as (P,P&#8243;,P&#8243;)&#8208;/(M,M&#8243;,M&#8243;)&#8208;BN4 and (P,P&#8243;,P&#8243;)&#8208;/(M,M&#8243;,M&#8243;)&#8208;BN5 and exhibit TADF and circularly polarized light (CPL) properties. As the entire molecular frame participates in the frontier molecular orbitals, the resulting helical chirality of (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;BN4&#8208; and (+)/(&#8722;)&#8208;BN5&#8208;based solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) helps in achieving a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 49/49 and 48/48&#160;nm and a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 20.6%/19.0% and 22.0%/26.5%, respectively. Importantly, unambiguous circularly polarized electroluminescence signals with dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;3.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (BN4) and +1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3/&#8722;1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 (BN5) are obtained. The results indicate successful exploitation of CPMR&#8208;TADF&#8208;emitter&#8208;based OLEDs to exhibit three characteristics: high efficiency, color purity, and circularly polarized light.

         <title>Silk Microneedle Patch Capable of On&#8208;Demand Multidrug Delivery to the Brain for Glioblastoma Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk microneedle (SMN) patch allows the integration of multiple therapeutic drugs with controlled release profiles to stop bleeding, inhibit angiogenesis, and promote apoptosis of glioblastoma cells. Drug release kinetics are well&#8208;defined by tuning the crosslinking degree of silk and applying a trigger of transcranial near&#8208;infrared light. SMN effectively suppresses tumor volume and improves the survival rate of mice in vivo.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. Surgery followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy remains the standard treatment strategy for GBM patients. However, challenges still exist when surgery is difficult or impossible to remove the tumor completely. Herein, the design, fabrication and application of a heterogenous silk fibroin microneedle (SMN) patch is reported for circumventing the blood&#8208;brain barrier and releasing multiple drugs directly to the tumor site for drug combination treatment. The biocompatible and biodegradable SMN patch can dissolve slowly over time, allowing the sustained release of multiple drugs at different doses. Furthermore, it can be triggered remotely to induce rapid drug delivery at a designated stage after implantation. In the GBM mouse models, two clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents (thrombin and temozolomide) and targeted drug (bevacizumab) are loaded into the SMN patch with individually controlled release profiles. The drugs are spatiotemporally and sequentially delivered for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and apoptosis of tumor cells. Device application is non&#8208;toxic and results in decreased tumor volume and increased survival rate in mice. The SMN patch with on&#8208;demand multidrug delivery has potential applications for the combined administration of therapeutic drugs for the clinical treatment of brain tumors when other methods are insufficient.

         <title>Digital Light Processing Based Bioprinting with Composable Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Digital Light Processing based (bio)printing system is developed, integrating a microfluidic mixer for the generation of composable gradients of desired (bio)inks on the fly. Various planar and volumetric structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, cell densities, growth factor concentrations, hydrogel stiffness, and porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified, suggesting the promising potential of the technology toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
Recapitulation of complex tissues signifies a remarkable challenge and, to date, only a few approaches have emerged that can efficiently reconstruct necessary gradients in 3D constructs. This is true even though mimicry of these gradients is of great importance to establish the functionality of engineered tissues and devices. Here, a composable&#8208;gradient Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based (bio)printing system is developed, utilizing the unprecedented integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. Notably, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely by adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios. In addition, this setup is designed in such a way that (bio)ink waste is minimized when exchanging the gradient (bio)inks, further enhancing this time&#8208; and (bio)ink&#8208;saving strategy. Various planar and 3D structures exhibiting continual gradients of materials, of cell densities, of growth factor concentrations, of hydrogel stiffness, and of porosities in horizontal and/or vertical direction, are exemplified. The composable fabrication of multifunctional gradients strongly supports the potential of the unique bioprinting system in numerous biomedical applications.

         <title>Exploring the Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 System and Potential for High Capacitive Energy Storage Density and Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and electrical properties of antiferroelectric PbHfO3 and &#8220;potentially&#8221; ferroelectric SrHfO3 are explored. Further, the energy&#8208;storage properties of the solid solution Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&lt;&#160;1) films are probed. An optimum strontium content is identified that leads to increased electric&#8208;breakdown strength and decreased hysteresis&#8208;loss in PbHfO3 resulting in concurrent enhancement of the capacitive energy storage density and efficiency.








Abstract
The hafnate perovskites PbHfO3 (antiferroelectric) and SrHfO3 (&#8220;potential&#8221; ferroelectric) are studied as epitaxial thin films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates with the added opportunity of observing a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in the Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 system. The resulting (240)&#8208;oriented PbHfO3 (Pba2) films exhibited antiferroelectric switching with a saturation polarization &#8776;53 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 at 1.6 MV cm&#8722;1, weak&#8208;field dielectric constant &#8776;186 at 298 K, and an antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition at &#8776;518 K. (002)&#8208;oriented SrHfO3 films exhibited neither ferroelectric behavior nor evidence of a polar P4mm phase . Instead, the SrHfO3 films exhibited a weak&#8208;field dielectric constant &#8776;25 at 298 K and no signs of a structural transition to a polar phase as a function of temperature (77&#8211;623 K) and electric field (&#8211;3 to 3 MV cm&#8722;1). While the lack of ferroelectric order in SrHfO3 removes the potential for MPB, structural and property evolution of the Pb1&#8722;xSrxHfO3 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&lt;&#160;1) system is explored. Strontium alloying increased the electric&#8208;breakdown strength (EB) and decreased hysteresis loss, thus enhancing the capacitive energy storage density (Ur) and efficiency (&#951;). The composition, Pb0.5Sr0.5HfO3 produced the best combination of EB&#160;= 5.12&#160;&#177; 0.5 MV cm&#8722;1, Ur&#160;= 77&#160;&#177; 5 J cm&#8722;3, and &#951;&#160;= 97&#160;&#177; 2%, well out&#8208;performing PbHfO3 and other antiferroelectric oxides.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance, Sensitive, Wearable Multifunctional Sensor Based on Rubber/CNT for Human Motion and Skin Temperature Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional sensor with high performance is fabricated from the hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and sericin&#8208;modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The sensor is a good fit for the basic requirements of full&#8208;human motion detection and real&#8208;time temperature variation monitoring, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human activity and health.








Abstract
Recently, flexible wearable electronic devices have attracted immense interest as an alternative for conventional rigid metallic conductors in personal healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and sensory skins, owing to their intrinsic characteristics. However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross&#8208;linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non&#8208;covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi&#8208;functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S m&#8722;1, and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response (0.01636 &#176;C&#8722;1) and realize the application in the measurement of human body temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the integrated tracking capabilities of real&#8208;time and in situ physiological signals, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human health and sporting applications.

         <title>Transfer&#8208;Enabled Fabrication of Graphene Wrinkle Arrays for Epitaxial Growth of AlN Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the assistance of the transfer medium that has poor wettability on the corrugated surface of graphene, the graphene wrinkle arrays are successfully fabricated without altering the crystalline orientation of entire graphene films, which is promising for numerous applications. This work opens up a new way for periodically modifying the surface properties of graphene for epitaxial growth of AlN films.








Abstract
Formation of graphene wrinkle arrays can periodically alter the electrical properties and chemical reactivity of graphene, which is promising for numerous applications. However, large&#8208;area fabrication of graphene wrinkle arrays remains unachievable with a high density and defined orientations, especially on rigid substrates. Herein, relying on the understanding of the formation mechanism of transfer&#8208;related graphene wrinkles, the graphene wrinkle arrays are fabricated without altering the crystalline orientation of entire graphene films. The choice of the transfer medium that has poor wettability on the corrugated surface of graphene is proven to be the key for the formation of wrinkles. This work provides a deep understanding of formation process of transfer&#8208;related graphene wrinkles and opens up a new way for periodically modifying the surface properties of graphene for potential applications, including direct growth of AlN epilayers and deep ultraviolet light emitting diodes.

         <title>Synthesis of Pd3Sn and PdCuSn Nanorods with L12 Phase for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
L12 PdCuSn, L12 Pd3Sn, and fcc Pd3Sn nanorods are controlled synthesized using a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method. The as&#8208;synthesized ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit a remarkable electrocatalytic activity toward the ethanol oxidation reaction in alkaline media with better performance compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, fcc Pd3Sn nanorods, and the commercial Pd/C catalyst.








Abstract
The crystal phase of nanomaterials is one of the key parameters determining their physicochemical properties and performance in various applications. However, it still remains a great challenge to synthesize nanomaterials with different crystal phases while maintaining the same composition, size, and morphology. Here, a facile, one&#8208;pot, wet&#8208;chemical method is reported to synthesize Pd3Sn nanorods with comparable size and morphology but different crystal phases, that is, an ordered intermetallic and a disordered alloy with L12 and face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phases, respectively. The crystal phase of the as&#8208;synthesized Pd3Sn nanorods is easily tuned by altering the types of tin precursors and solvents. Moreover, the approach can also be used to synthesize ternary PdCuSn nanorods with the L12 crystal phase. When used as electrocatalysts, the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance toward the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared to their fcc counterpart. Impressively, compared to the L12 Pd3Sn nanorods, the ternary L12 PdCuSn nanorods exhibit more enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward the EOR, yielding a high mass current density up to 6.22 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is superior to the commercial Pd/C catalyst and among the best reported Pd&#8208;based EOR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Ratiometric FRET Encoded Hierarchical ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au Cluster for Ultrasensitive Quantifying MicroRNA In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developed probes enable the ultrasensitive quantifying microRNA with zeptomolar level and the distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo, which offers new avenues for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.








Abstract
Here, Zirconium metal&#8722;organic frameworks&#8202;@&#8202;gold (ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au) cluster architectures have been fabricated and then functionalized with two fluorescent dyes (Quasar [QS] and Cyanine5.5 [Cy5.5]) through deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization, to form a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) encoded ZrMOF&#8202;&#8202;@&#8202;&#8202;Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5 complex. In the presence of the target intracellular microRNA (miR)&#8208;21, the fluorescence of Cy5.5 at 705&#160;nm (F705) decreases and the fluorescence of QS at 665&#160;nm (F665) increases when Cy5.5 is released from the surface of ZrMOF&#8202;&#8202;@&#8202;&#8202;Au&#8208;QS/Cy5.5. The change in the fluorescence ratio (F705/F665) shows an outstanding linear range of 0.006&#8211;67.9 amol/ngRNA, and the limit of detection is 4.51 zmol/ngRNA in living cells. The high ratio loading of nucleic acid on surface of ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au cluster and two fluorescence encoded signal enables better sensitivity and reliability. Zeptomolar sensitivity and good linearity against target affords distinct imaging&#8208;based monitoring of the cancer marker miR&#8208;21 both in living cells and in vivo. At the same time, the architecture displays remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency (53.7%) and gives rise to outstanding therapy ability in vivo. This strategy offers new avenues for the intelligent quantification of miRNAs for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early&#8208;stage cancers.

The change in the fluorescence ratio (F&lt;sub&gt;705&lt;/sub&gt;/F&lt;sub&gt;665&lt;/sub&gt;) shows an outstanding linear range of 0.006&#8211;67.9 amol/ng&lt;sub&gt;RNA&lt;/sub&gt;, and the limit of detection is 4.51 zmol/ng&lt;sub&gt;RNA&lt;/sub&gt; in living cells. The high ratio loading of nucleic acid on surface of ZrMOF&#8202;@&#8202;Au cluster and two fluorescence encoded signal enables better sensitivity and reliability. Zeptomolar sensitivity and good linearity against target affords distinct imaging-based monitoring of the cancer marker miR-21 both in living cells and in vivo. At the same time, the architecture displays remarkable photothermal conversion efficiency (53.7%) and gives rise to outstanding therapy ability in vivo. This strategy offers new avenues for the intelligent quantification of miRNAs for simultaneous diagnoses and treatments of early-stage cancers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Metal&#8208;Enabled Mechanical&#8208;Energy&#8208;Induced CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With mechanical energy as the stimulus, CO2 is converted into solid carbon and O2 in a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based reaction system. Using the synergism of Ga nanodroplets and Ag&#8211;Ga nanorods, CO2 conversion proceeds through the triboelectrochemical reaction on Ga, while the Ag&#8211;Ga rods ensure the system's sustainability. This is achieved at a remarkably low energy consumption and high efficiency.








Abstract
A green carbon capture and conversion technology offering scalability and economic viability for mitigating CO2 emissions is reported. The technology uses suspensions of gallium liquid metal to reduce CO2 into carbonaceous solid products and O2 at near room temperature. The nonpolar nature of the liquid gallium interface allows the solid products to instantaneously exfoliate, hence keeping active sites accessible. The solid co&#8208;contributor of silver&#8211;gallium rods ensures a cyclic sustainable process. The overall process relies on mechanical energy as the input, which drives nano&#8208;dimensional triboelectrochemical reactions. When a gallium/silver fluoride mix at 7:1 mass ratio is employed to create the reaction material, 92% efficiency is obtained at a remarkably low input energy of 230 kWh (excluding the energy used for dissolving CO2) for the capture and conversion of a tonne of CO2. This green technology presents an economical solution for CO2 emissions.

         <title>Conjugated Polymer Mesocrystals with Structural and Optoelectronic Coherence and Anisotropy in Three Dimensions</title>

Semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens are demonstrated exhibiting near&#8208;intrinsic properties using channel&#8208;die pressing. Predominant edge&#8208;on orientation is obtained for hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting polymer semicnductors throughout 2 mm&#8208;thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge&#8208;transport anisotropy predicted along all three crystallographic axes, without the need to grow single crystals.








Abstract
Semiconducting mesocrystalline bulk polymer specimens that exhibit near&#8208;intrinsic properties using channel&#8208;die pressing are demonstrated. A predominant edge&#8208;on orientation is obtained for poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (P3HT) throughout 2 mm&#8208;thick/wide samples. This persistent mesocrystalline arrangement at macroscopic scales allows reliable evaluation of the electronic charge&#8208;transport anisotropy along all three crystallographic axes, with high mobilities found along the &#960;&#8208;stacking. Indeed, charge&#8208;carrier mobilities of up to 2.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 are measured along the &#960;&#8208;stack, which are some of the highest mobilities reported for polymers at low charge&#8208;carrier densities (drop&#8208;cast films display mobilities of maximum &#8776;10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). The structural coherence also leads to an unusually well&#8208;defined photoluminescence line&#8208;shape characteristic of an H&#8208;aggregate (measured from the surface perpendicular to the materials flow), rather than the typical HJ&#8208;aggregate feature usually found for P3HT. The approach is widely applicable: to electrical conductors and materials used in n&#8208;type devices, such as poly{[N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)&#8208;naphthalene&#8208;1,4,5,8&#8208;bis(dicarboximide)&#8208;2,6&#8208;diyl]&#8208;alt&#8208;5,5&#8242;&#8208;(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophene)} (N2200) where the mesocrystalline structure leads to high electron transport along the polymer backbones (&#8776;1.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). This versatility and the broad applicability of channel&#8208;die pressing signifies its promise as a straightforward, readily scalable method to fabricate bulk semiconducting polymer structures at macroscopic scales with properties typically accessible only by the tedious growth of single crystals.

         <title>Over 21% Efficiency Stable 2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure formamidinum (FA)&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.07% (certified over 20%), the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date, together with the improved device stability. The high&#8208;efficiency device exhibits a narrowed bandgap and unique 2D&#8211;3D intermixing phase distribution for improved light absorption and superior charge transport.








Abstract
Owing to their insufficient light absorption and charge transport, 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites show relatively low efficiency. In this work, methylammonium (MA), formamidinum (FA), and FA/MA mixed 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are fabricated. Incorporating FA cations extends the absorption range and enhances the light absorption. Optical spectroscopy shows that FA cations substantially increase the portion of 3D&#8208;like phase to 2D phases, and X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) studies reveal that FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite possesses an oblique crystal orientation. Nevertheless, the ultrafast interphase charge transfer results in an extremely long carrier&#8208;diffusion length (&#8776;1.98&#160;&#181;m). Also, chloride additives effectively suppress the yellow &#948;&#8208;phase formation of pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs. As a result, both FA/MA mixed and pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs exhibit a greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20%. Specifically, the pure FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs achieve a record PCE of 21.07% (certified at 20%), which is the highest efficiency for low&#8208;dimensional PSCs (n&#160;&#8804; 10) reported to date. Importantly, the FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs retain 97% of their initial efficiency at 85&#160;&#176;C persistent heating after 1500&#160;h. The results unambiguously demonstrate that pure&#8208;FA&#8208;based 2D PSCs are promising for achieving comparable efficiency to 3D perovskites, along with a better device stability.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Harsh&#8208;Environment&#8208;Resistant GaOX Solar&#8208;Blind Photodetectors via Defect and Doping Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Certain application situations of solar&#8208;blind photodetectors (SBPDs) inevitably face harsh conditions (e.g., high temperature/electronic&#8208;field/radiation). Gallium oxide with an ultrawide bandgap is regarded as one of the most promising materials for SBPDs. Defect and doping engineering, including Ga&#8208;rich design and doping compensation, has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for low&#8208;cost amorphous GaOX to force a way towards harsh&#8208;condition&#8208;resistant SBPDs.








Abstract
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), with an ultrawide bandgap, is currently regarded as one of the most promising materials for solar&#8208;blind photodetectors (SBPDs), which are greatly demanded in harsh environment, such as space exploration and flame prewarning. However, realization of high&#8208;performance SBPDs with high tolerance toward harsh environments based on low&#8208;cost Ga2O3 material faces great challenges. Here, defect and doping (DD) engineering towards amorphous GaOX (a&#8208;GaOX) has been proposed to obtain ultrasensitive SBPDs for harsh condition application. Serious oxygen deficiency and doping compensation of the engineered a&#8208;GaOX film ensure the high response currents and low dark currents, respectively. Annealing item in nitrogen of DD engineering also incurs the recrystallization of material, formation of nanopores by oxygen escape, and suppression of sub&#8208;bandgap defect states. As a result, the tailored GaOX SBPD based on DD engineering not only harvests a record&#8208;high responsivity rejection ratio (R254 nm/R365 nm) of 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;107, 102 times higher detectivity, and 2&#160;&#215;&#160;102 times faster decay speed than the control device, but also keeps a high responsivity, high photo&#8208;to&#8208;dark current ratio, and sharp imaging capability even at high temperature (280&#160;&#176;C) or high bias (100&#160;V). The proposed DD engineering provides an effective strategy towards highly harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant GaOX SBPDs.

     alt="High-Performance Harsh-Environment-Resistant GaOX Solar-Blind Photodetectors via Defect and Doping Engineering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certain application situations of solar-blind photodetectors (SBPDs) inevitably face harsh conditions (e.g., high temperature/electronic-field/radiation). Gallium oxide with an ultrawide bandgap is regarded as one of the most promising materials for SBPDs. Defect and doping engineering, including Ga-rich design and doping compensation, has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for low-cost amorphous GaO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; to force a way towards harsh-condition-resistant SBPDs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallium oxide (Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), with an ultrawide bandgap, is currently regarded as one of the most promising materials for solar-blind photodetectors (SBPDs), which are greatly demanded in harsh environment, such as space exploration and flame prewarning. However, realization of high-performance SBPDs with high tolerance toward harsh environments based on low-cost Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; material faces great challenges. Here, defect and doping (DD) engineering towards amorphous GaO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; (a-GaO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;) has been proposed to obtain ultrasensitive SBPDs for harsh condition application. Serious oxygen deficiency and doping compensation of the engineered a-GaO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; film ensure the high response currents and low dark currents, respectively. Annealing item in nitrogen of DD engineering also incurs the recrystallization of material, formation of nanopores by oxygen escape, and suppression of sub-bandgap defect states. As a result, the tailored GaO&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; SBPD based on DD engineering not only harvests a record-high responsivity rejection ratio (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;254 nm&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;365 nm&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; times higher detectivity, and 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; times faster decay speed than the control device, but also keeps a high responsivity, high photo-to-dark current ratio, and sharp imaging capability even at high temperature (280&#160;&#176;C) or high bias (100&#160;V).

         <title>Investigation of the Effect of 3D Meniscus Geometry on Fluid Dynamics and Crystallization via In Situ Optical Microscopy&#8208;Assisted Mathematical Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D geometrical model of the meniscus is attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy, within which a mathematical model for momentum and mass transport is developed. Utilizing 3D meniscus geometry, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductors is elucidated, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film solidification is a complex process involving various transport phenomena that are intricately dependent on multiple experimental parameters. The difficulty of analyzing this process experimentally or conducting exact numerical simulation make it challenging to understand, predict, and control the solidification process. In this work, a simple and effective technique to analyze the thin&#8208;film solidification process during solution shearing, based on 3D geometrical model of the meniscus, is proposed. The 3D meniscus geometry, which changes depending on the experimental parameters, is attained using high&#8208;speed side&#8208;view and top&#8208;view in situ microscopy. Thereafter, mass and momentum transport mathematical models are applied to obtain numerical solutions of transport phenomena within the meniscus. Utilizing these results, the underlying mechanism of dendritic growth of small molecule organic semiconductor is elucidated, which has previously been unknown. The 3D meniscus modeling is particularly important for this analysis, as dendrite formation is strongly dependent on the meniscus geometry near the contact line and mass transport variation perpendicular to the coating direction. This technique enables the study of complex relationship between experimental parameters and solidification process, which is widely applicable to various materials and coating systems; whereby, better understanding of thin&#8208;film growth and device performance optimization is possible.

Bioprinting
In article number 2107038, Yu Shrike Zhang and co&#8208;workers develop a (bio)printing system based on Digital Light Processing to utilize the integration of a microfluidic mixer for the generation of either continual or discrete gradients of desired (bio)inks in real time. As such, the precisely controlled gradients are composable on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by facilely adjusting the (bio)ink flow ratios, supporting the potential of the platform in numerous biomedical applications.

Artificial Biomolecular Condensates
In article number 2104704, Huaimin Wang and co&#8208;workers report a general approach for constructing artificial biomolecular condensates of oligopeptide in living cells. The rationally designed aromatic&#8208;capped peptides can reversibly form a nanofibrous hydrogel with a change of the conformation and morphologies in the lysosome. The formed condensates undergo swelling in the lysosome, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization and re&#8208;direction of therapeutic drugs to the target.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202104704"&gt;2104704&lt;/a&gt;, Huaimin Wang and co-workers report a general approach for constructing artificial biomolecular condensates of oligopeptide in living cells. The rationally designed aromatic-capped peptides can reversibly form a nanofibrous hydrogel with a change of the conformation and morphologies in the lysosome. The formed condensates undergo swelling in the lysosome, leading to lysosomal membrane permeabilization and re-direction of therapeutic drugs to the target.

Tadf Emitters
Circularly polarized thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;TADF) and multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) properties are integrated into new CPMR&#8208;TADF materials by Xiugang Wu, You&#8208;Xuan Zheng, Weiguo Zhu, Pi&#8208;Tai Chou, and co&#8208;workers, as described in article number 2105080. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on these CPMR&#8208;TADF emitters attain a three&#8208;in&#8208;one advantage simultaneously: high efficiency, color purity, and circular polarized light.

Anode&#8208;Free Batteries
In article number 2106005, Hui Dong, David Mitlin, and co&#8208;workers report an intermetallic for anode&#8208;free batteries. The winter scene shows a birthday cake with lit candles that are melting: the cake represents the complex structure of a cycled sodium&#8208;metal anode with the protruding candles being the dendrites. A slice, obtained by cryogenic focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy, further reveals the underlying porosity that develops during repeated plating and stripping of the metal. The thick non&#8208;uniform red frosting on the cake represents the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that drives the dendrite growth.

Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
Triplet exciton harvesting via triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation, is known to generate only 40% of the total radiative excitons in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) theoretically. In article number 2100161, Yun&#8208;Hi Kim, Jang&#8208;Joo Kim, and co&#8208;workers realize a total radiative exciton ratio of nearly 50% with a carefully designed anthracene derivative and device structure, breaking the theoretical efficiency limit of OLEDs based on anthracene derivatives.

Tumor Therapy
In article number 2106606, Nan Qin, Tiger H. Tao, and co&#8208;workers report a heterogenous silk microneedle patch to spatiotemporally and sequentially deliver multiple therapeutic drugs for hemostasis, anti&#8208;angiogenesis, and apoptosis of brain tumor cells. Drug release kinetics are well&#8208;defined by tuning the crosslinking degree of the silk and applying a trigger of transcranial NIR&#8208;light irradiation. This biodegradable patch has potential applications for the clinical treatment of intracranial tumors.

Deep&#8208;UV Photodetectors
High&#8208;performance harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant deep&#8208;UV (DUV) photodetectors have important applications in space exploration and flame prewarning. In article number 2106923, Xiaolong Zhao, Shibing Long, and co&#8208;workers tailor defect/doping engineering based on the low&#8208;cost GaOX to obtain high&#8208;performance DUV detectors. The defect/doping engineering induces recrystallization, doping compensation, and nanopore formation inside the material, giving it great potential for DUV detection in harsh conditions.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deep-UV Photodetectors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-performance harsh-environment-resistant deep-UV (DUV) photodetectors have important applications in space exploration and flame prewarning. In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202106923"&gt;2106923&lt;/a&gt;, Xiaolong Zhao, Shibing Long, and co-workers tailor defect/doping engineering based on the low-cost GaO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; to obtain high-performance DUV detectors. The defect/doping engineering induces recrystallization, doping compensation, and nanopore formation inside the material, giving it great potential for DUV detection in harsh conditions.

         <title>Processing of Self&#8208;Healing Polymers for Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft robots are inherently safe, but prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. In this work, the variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics in the literature is reviewed and limitations and opportunities are discussed. Two promising research fields are bridged, and a guide is given toward selecting suitable processing methods based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics application.








Abstract
Soft robots are, due to their softness, inherently safe and adapt well to unstructured environments. However, they are prone to various damage types. Self&#8208;healing polymers address this vulnerability. Self&#8208;healing soft robots can recover completely from macroscopic damage, extending their lifetime. For developing healable soft robots, various formative and additive manufacturing methods have been exploited to shape self&#8208;healing polymers into complex structures. Additionally, several novel manufacturing techniques, noted as (re)assembly binding techniques that are specific to self&#8208;healing polymers, have been created. Herein, the wide variety of processing techniques of self&#8208;healing polymers for robotics available in the literature is reviewed, and limitations and opportunities discussed thoroughly. Based on defined requirements for soft robots, these techniques are critically compared and validated. A strong focus is drawn to the reversible covalent and (physico)chemical cross&#8208;links present in the self&#8208;healing polymers that do not only endow healability to the resulting soft robotic components, but are also beneficial in many manufacturing techniques. They solve current obstacles in soft robots, including the formation of robust multi&#8208;material parts, recyclability, and stress relaxation. This review bridges two promising research fields, and guides the reader toward selecting a suitable processing method based on a self&#8208;healing polymer and the intended soft robotics&#160;application.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Driven Biomaterials Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advancement of machine learning (ML) in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds and has made a big impact into biomaterials research, ranging from discovery of bioactive chemical moieties, screening and optimization of material properties, to developing materials that interface better with biological systems. There is still untapped potential to integrate with ML for the next frontier in biomaterials.








Abstract
Biomaterials is an exciting and dynamic field, which uses a collection of diverse materials to achieve desired biological responses. While there is constant evolution and innovation in materials with time, biomaterials research has been hampered by the relatively long development period required. In recent years, driven by the need to accelerate materials development, the applications of machine learning in materials science has progressed in leaps and bounds. The combination of machine learning with high&#8208;throughput theoretical predictions and high&#8208;throughput experiments (HTE) has shifted the traditional Edisonian (trial and error) paradigm to a data&#8208;driven paradigm. In this review, each type of biomaterial and their key properties and use cases are systematically discussed, followed by how machine learning can be applied in the development and design process. The discussions are classified according to various types of materials used including polymers, metals, ceramics, and nanomaterials, and implants using additive manufacturing. Last, the current gaps and potential of machine learning to further aid biomaterials discovery and application are also discussed.

         <title>Bimetallic Janus Nanocrystals: Syntheses and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Janus nanocrystals feature a side&#8208;by&#8208;side arrangement of two distinct metals divided by a heterogeneous interface. This unique structure allows one to present both metals on the same particle while tailoring the plasmonic coupling and electronic interaction between them, making the structure particularly viable for plasmonic, catalytic, and photocatalytic applications.








Abstract
Bimetallic Janus nanocrystals have received considerable interest in recent years owing to their unique properties and niche applications. The side&#8208;by&#8208;side distribution of two distinct metals provides a flexible platform for tailoring the optical and catalytic properties of nanocrystals. First, a brief introduction to the structural features of bimetallic Janus nanocrystals, followed by an extensive discussion of the synthetic approaches, is given. The strategies and experimental controls for achieving the Janus structure, as well as the mechanistic understandings, are specifically discussed. Then, a number of intriguing properties and applications enabled by the Janus nanocrystals are highlighted. Finally, this article is concluded with future directions and outlooks with respect to both syntheses and applications of this new class of functional nanomaterials.

         <title>Advanced Point&#8208;of&#8208;Care Testing Technologies for Human Acute Respiratory Virus Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advanced rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care tests (POCTs), including nucleic acid amplification, optical POCTs, electrochemistry, lateral flow assay, microfluidics, ELISA, and microarray&#8208;based platforms, act figuratively as the Great Wall to the widespread transmission of acute respiratory virus infections by enabling early and rapid detection of these pathogens, as is the case during the current pandemic.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing global threats to human life caused by the human acute respiratory virus (RV) infections have cost billions of lives, created a significant economic burden, and shaped society for centuries. The timely response to emerging RVs could save human lives and reduce the medical care burden. The development of RV detection technologies is essential for potentially preventing RV pandemic and epidemics. However, commonly used detection technologies lack sensitivity, specificity, and speed, thus often failing to provide the rapid turnaround times. To address this problem, new technologies are devised to address the performance inadequacies of the traditional methods. These emerging technologies offer improvements in convenience, speed, flexibility, and portability of point&#8208;of&#8208;care test (POCT). Herein, recent developments in POCT are comprehensively reviewed for eight typical acute respiratory viruses. This review discusses the challenges and opportunities of various recognition and detection strategies and discusses these according to their detection principles, including nucleic acid amplification, optical POCT, electrochemistry, lateral flow assays, microfluidics, enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assays, and microarrays. The importance of limits of detection, throughput, portability, and specificity when testing clinical samples in resource&#8208;limited settings is emphasized. Finally, the evaluation of commercial POCT kits for both essential RV diagnosis and clinical&#8208;oriented practices is included.

         <title>Fiber&#8208;Based Biopolymer Processing as a Route toward Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plastics sustainability is a growing issue and structural biopolymers from nature (e.g., cellulose, chitin, silk) offer new, long&#8208;term solutions. Recent advances with thermoplastic processing, as well as fibrillation strategies, offer new routes to more competitive processing strategies than traditional solution approaches. Challenges remain with scaling, further insight into mechanisms, use of molecular modeling and plasticizer optimization.








Abstract
Some of the most abundant biomass on earth is sequestered in fibrous biopolymers like cellulose, chitin, and silk.&#160;These types of natural materials offer unique and striking mechanical and functional features that have driven strong interest in their utility for a range of applications, while also matching environmental sustainability needs.&#160;However, these material systems are challenging to process in cost&#8208;competitive ways to compete with synthetic plastics due to the limited options for thermal processing.&#160;This results in the dominance of solution&#8208;based processing for fibrous biopolymers, which presents challenges for scaling, cost, and consistency in outcomes. However, new opportunities to utilize thermal processing with these types of biopolymers, as well as fibrillation approaches, can drive renewed opportunities to bridge this gap between synthetic plastic processing and fibrous biopolymers, while also holding sustainability goals as critical to long&#8208;term successful outcomes.

&lt;p&gt;Plastics sustainability is a growing issue and structural biopolymers from nature (e.g., cellulose, chitin, silk) offer new, long-term solutions. Recent advances with thermoplastic processing, as well as fibrillation strategies, offer new routes to more competitive processing strategies than traditional solution approaches. Challenges remain with scaling, further insight into mechanisms, use of molecular modeling and plasticizer optimization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most abundant biomass on earth is sequestered in fibrous biopolymers like cellulose, chitin, and silk.&#160;These types of natural materials offer unique and striking mechanical and functional features that have driven strong interest in their utility for a range of applications, while also matching environmental sustainability needs.&#160;However, these material systems are challenging to process in cost-competitive ways to compete with synthetic plastics due to the limited options for thermal processing.&#160;This results in the dominance of solution-based processing for fibrous biopolymers, which presents challenges for scaling, cost, and consistency in outcomes. However, new opportunities to utilize thermal processing with these types of biopolymers, as well as fibrillation approaches, can drive renewed opportunities to bridge this gap between synthetic plastic processing and fibrous biopolymers, while also holding sustainability goals as critical to long-term successful outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tin Halide Perovskites: From Fundamental Properties to Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thorough overview is given on the fundamental properties of tin halide perovskites tailored to their application in solar cells. A detailed discussion of the crystal structure, electronic properties, photophysics, and thin&#8208;film crystallization of tin halide perovskites provides a foundation to highlight its exceptional properties and reveals research strategies to improve the performance of tin halide solar cells.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have unique optical and electrical properties, which make them an excellent class of materials for a broad spectrum of optoelectronic applications. However, it is with photovoltaic devices that this class of materials has reached the apotheosis of popularity. High power conversion efficiencies are achieved with lead&#8208;based compounds, which are toxic to the environment. Tin&#8208;based perovskites are the most promising alternative because of their bandgap close to the optimal value for photovoltaic applications, the strong optical absorption, and good charge carrier mobilities. Nevertheless, the low defect tolerance, the fast crystallization, and the oxidative instability of tin halide perovskites currently limit their efficiency. The aim of this review is to give a detailed overview of the crystallographic, photophysical, and optoelectronic properties of tin&#8208;based perovskite compounds in their multiple forms from 3D to low&#8208;dimensional structures. At the end, recent progress in tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are reviewed, mainly focusing on the detail of the strategies adopted to improve the device performances. For each subtopic, the current challenges and the outlook are discussed, with the aim to stimulate the community to address the most important issues in a concerted manner.

         <title>Bioinspired and Biomimetic Delivery Platforms for Cancer Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>

Integration of biomimetic designs into delivery platforms for cancer vaccines can enhance efficacy while retaining good safety profiles, which contributes to expediting the clinical translation of cancer vaccines. A detailed overview of current progress, potential challenges, and future directions of bioinspired delivery platforms for cancer vaccines is provided here.








Abstract
Cancer vaccines aim at eliciting tumor&#8208;specific responses for the immune system to identify and eradicate malignant tumor cells while sparing the normal tissues. Furthermore, cancer vaccines can potentially induce long&#8208;term immunological memory for antitumor responses, preventing metastasis and cancer recurrence, thus presenting an attractive treatment option in cancer immunotherapy. However, clinical efficacy of cancer vaccines has remained low due to longstanding challenges, such as poor immunogenicity, immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, tumor heterogeneity, inappropriate immune tolerance, and systemic toxicity. Recently, bioinspired materials and biomimetic technologies have emerged to play a part in reshaping the field of cancer nanomedicine. By mimicking desirable chemical and biological properties in nature, bioinspired engineering of cancer vaccine delivery platforms can effectively transport therapeutic cargos to tumor sites, amplify antigen and adjuvant bioactivities, and enable spatiotemporal control and on&#8208;demand immunoactivation. As such, integration of biomimetic designs into delivery platforms for cancer vaccines can enhance efficacy while retaining good safety profiles, which contributes to expediting the clinical translation of cancer vaccines. Recent advances in bioinspired delivery platforms for cancer vaccines, existing obstacles faced, as well as insights and future directions for the field are discussed here.

         <title>Recent Advances in Fluorinated Graphene from Synthesis to Applications: Critical Review on Functional Chemistry and Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 1, January 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent advances in fluorinated graphene (FG) from the synthesis methods to the broad applications and the relationship between the structures and properties are reviewed in detail. Especially, rational structure engineering and the abundant functional chemistry are the significant directions which are further discussed for the future development of FG.








Abstract
Fluorinated graphene (FG), as an emerging member of the graphene derivatives family, has attracted wide attention on account of its excellent performances and underlying applications. The introduction of a fluorine atom, with the strongest electronegativity (3.98), greatly changes the electron distribution of graphene, resulting in a series of unique variations in optical, electronic, magnetic, interfacial properties and so on. Herein, recent advances in the study of FG from synthesis to applications are introduced, and the relationship between its structure and properties is summarized in detail. Especially, the functional chemistry of FG has been thoroughly analyzed in recent years, which has opened a universal route for the functionalization and even multifunctionalization of FG toward various graphene derivatives, which further broadens its applications. Moreover, from a particular angle, the structure engineering of FG such as the distribution pattern of fluorine atoms and the regulation of interlayer structure when advanced nanotechnology gets involved is summarized. Notably, the elaborated structure engineering of FG is the key factor to optimize the corresponding properties for potential applications, and is also an up&#8208;to&#8208;date research hotspot and future development direction. Finally, perspectives and prospects for the problems and challenges in the study of FG are put forward.
