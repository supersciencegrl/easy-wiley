         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Fibers Embedded with Zincophilic Cu Nanoboxes for Stable Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The practical application of Zn metal anodes (ZMAs) is mainly impeded by the limited lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) resulting from the Zn dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) multi&#8208;functional host consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon fibers embedded with Cu nanoboxes (denoted as Cu NBs@NCFs) is rationally designed and developed for stable ZMAs. The 3D macroporous configuration and hollow structure can lower the local current density and alleviate the large volume change during the repeated cycling processes. Furthermore, zincophilic Cu and in&#8208;situ formed Cu&#8208;Zn alloy can act as homogeneous nucleation sites to minimize the Zn nucleation overpotential, further guiding uniform and dense Zn deposition. As a result, this Cu NBs@NCFs host exhibits high CE of Zn plating/stripping for 1000 cycles. The Cu NBs@NCFs&#8208;Zn electrode shows low voltage hysteresis and prolonged cycling life (450 h) with dendrite&#8208;free behaviors. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a Zn ion full cell is fabricated based on this Cu NBs@NCFs&#8208;Zn anode, which demonstrates decent rate capability and improved cycling performance.

         <title>Rational Synthesis of Solid&#8208;State Ultraviolet B Emitting Carbon Dots via Acetic Acid&#8208;Promoted Fractions of sp3 Bonding Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) have received tremendous attention for their excellent photoluminescence (PL) properties. However, it remains a great challenge to obtain CDs with ultraviolet (UV, 200&#8211;400&#160;nm) emission in solid state, which requires strict control of the CDs structure and overcoming the aggregation caused quenching (ACQ). Herein, a new sp3 compartmentalization strategy is developed to meet these requirements, by employing acetic acid to promote fractions of sp3 bonding during the synthesis of CDs. It markedly decreases the size of sp2 conjugating units in the CDs, and shifts PL emission to the ultraviolet B (UVB) region (&#955;max = 308&#160;nm). Moreover, sp2 domains are well spatially compartmentalized by sp3 domains and the ACQ effect is minimized, enabling the high quantum yield in solid state (20.2%, &#955;ex = 265&#160;nm) with narrow bandwidth of 24&#160;nm and environmental robustness. The solid&#8208;state UVB emissive CDs is highly desired for application in photonic devices. Hence, a demo of UVB light&#8208;emitting diodes is fabricated for plant lighting, leading to a 29% increase of ascorbic acid content in the basil. Overall, we provide a rational and efficient way to construct solid UVB&#8208;CDs phosphors for wide applications.

         <title>Direct Ink Writing: A 3D Printing Technology for Diverse Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) has gained significant attention due to its ability to drive technological development as a sustainable, flexible, and customizable manufacturing scheme. Among the various AM techniques, direct ink writing (DIW) has emerged as the most versatile three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing technique for the broadest range of materials. DIW allows printing of practically any material, as long as the precursor ink can be engineered to demonstrate appropriate rheological behavior. This technique acts as a unique pathway to introduce design freedom, multifunctionality, and stability simultaneously into its printed structures. Here, we present a comprehensive review of DIW of complex 3D structures from various materials, including polymers, ceramics, glass, cement, graphene, metals, and their combinations through multimaterial printing. The review begins with an overview of the fundamentals of ink rheology, followed by an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various methods to tailor the ink for DIW of different classes of materials. Then, the diverse applications of DIW ranging from electronics to food to biomedical industries have been discussed. Finally, we highlight the current challenges and limitations of this technique, followed by its prospects as a guideline towards possible futuristic innovations.

         <title>Supported Lipid Bilayers Coupled to Organic Neuromorphic Devices Modulate Short&#8208;Term Plasticity in Biomimetic Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomembrane&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is fabricated and the short&#8208;term depression of the device is investigated. After morphological and electrical characterization of the lipid bilayer, its ionic barrier behavior is exploited to enhance the neuromorphic operation of the OECT. Such devices pave the way to synapse&#8208;resembling platforms to investigate neurodegenerative processes involving synaptic plasticity loss.








Abstract
Synaptic plasticity is a fundamental process for neuronal communication and is involved in neurodegeneration. This process has been recently exploited to inspire the design of next&#8208;generation bioelectronic platforms. Neuromorphic devices have emerged as ideal candidates in mimicking brain functionalities, thanks to their ionic&#8208;to&#8208;electronic signal transduction, biocompatibility, and their ability to display short&#8208; and long&#8208;term memory as biological synapses. However, these devices still fail in bridging the gap between electronics and biological systems due to the lack of biomimetic features. Here, a biomembrane&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is implemented and the supported&#8208;lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;mediated short&#8208;term depression of the device is investigated. After morphological and electrical characterization of the lipid bilayer, its ionic barrier behavior is exploited to enhance the neuromorphic operation of the OECT. Such biomimetic neuromorphic devices pave the way toward the implementation of synapses&#8208;resembling in vitro platforms to investigate and characterize neurodegenerative processes involving synaptic plasticity loss.

         <title>A Flexible Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodine Microbattery with Unprecedented Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine microbattery with &gt;1500&#160;mWh cm&#8722;3 volumetric energy density and &gt;2000 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2 areal energy density is developed by a simple and effective strategy where an iodine cathode is generated in situ during charging. This work affords an innovative strategy to construct an ideal micro&#8208;power&#8208;source for future miniaturized and integrated electronics.








Abstract
Currently, reported aqueous microbatteries (MBs) only show unsatisfactory electrochemical performance (&#8804;120 mWh cm&#8722;3 volumetric energy density and &lt;1000&#160;&#956;Wh cm&#8722;2 areal energy density) and it remains challenging to develop durable aqueous MBs that can simultaneously offer both high volumetric and areal energy density. Herein, an in situ electrodeposition strategy is adopted to construct a flexible aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine MB (ZIDMB). Notably, the fabrication process well avoids the use of common additives (such as binders, conductive agents, and toxic solvent) and also bypasses subsequent time&#8208;consuming procedures such as grinding, coating, drying, etc., thus greatly simplifying the manufacture of the ZIDMB. Meanwhile, owing to the suppression of the shuttle effect of triiodide ions and the high ionic conductivity of the polyelectrolyte, the ZIDMB can simultaneously deliver record&#8208;high volumetric and areal energy densities of 1647.3 mWh cm&#8722;3 and 2339.1 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2, thus achieving values at least 13.5&#8208; and 2.3&#8208;fold better than those of best available aqueous MBs, respectively. This work affords an innovative strategy to construct an ideal micro&#8208;power&#8208;source for future miniaturized and integrated electronics.

Meanwhile, owing to the suppression of the shuttle effect of triiodide ions and the high ionic conductivity of the polyelectrolyte, the ZIDMB can simultaneously deliver record-high volumetric and areal energy densities of 1647.3 mWh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 2339.1 &#956;Wh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, thus achieving values at least 13.5- and 2.3-fold better than those of best available aqueous MBs, respectively. This work affords an innovative strategy to construct an ideal micro-power-source for future miniaturized and integrated electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Physically Detachable and Operationally Stable Cs2SnI6 Photodetector Arrays Integrated with &#956;&#8208;LEDs for Broadband Flexible Optical System</title>

Abstract
With the surge in perovskite research, practical features for future applications are like to be secured, but the reliability of the materials and the use of hazardous Pb are longstanding problems. Here, an air&#8208;stable Cs2SnI6 (CSI) is prepared via diluted hydriodic acid solvent&#8208;based precursor optimization during scalable hydrothermal growth. Materials characterization is performed using various elemental peak analyses and crystallographic identification. The resulting CSI exhibits long&#8208;term operating stability over 6 months, (i) at elevated temperatures, (ii) in ambient air, and (iii) under light illumination from UV to near&#8208;infrared. More importantly, to demonstrate an intriguing class of application up to system level, physically detachable CSI photodetector arrays (PD&#8208;arrays), integrated with micro&#8208;light emitting diodes (&#956;&#8208;LEDs) arrays, are successfully implemented. In addition, 3&#160;&#215; 3 flexible CSI PDs are fully operational, even in the air, and their spatial uniformity in pixels is quantitatively evaluated. The charge transport mechanisms of the CSI PDs under light and elevated temperature are assessed via temperature&#8208;dependent characterization from 148 K to 373 K, implying the involvement of 3D variable&#8208;range hopping. Multi&#8208;cycle evaluation of the CSI PD&#8208;arrays confirms their operational stability in AC and DC mode, demonstrating this platform's potential benefit for wireless optical interconnection in advanced Si technology.

         <title>Triboresistive Touch Sensing: grid&#8208;free Touch Point Recognition Based on Monolayered Ionic Power Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent growing pursuit of skin&#8208;mountable devices has been impeded by complicated structures of most sensing systems, containing electrode grids, stacked multi&#8208;layers, and even external power sources. Here, we introduce a type of touch sensing, termed triboresistive touch sensing, for gridless touch recognition based on monolayered ionic power generators. A homogeneous monolayer, i.e., ionic PDMS, generates electricity based on the electric field generated by touch. Voltages generated at each corner of ionic PDMS relied on resistance between touch points and each corner, ensuring recognition of the touch positions without need for electrode grid layers and external power sources. With notable advantages of high transparency (96.5%), stretchability (539.1%), and resilience (99.0%) of the ionic PDMS, epidermal triboresistive sensing was demonstrated to express touch position and readily play a musical instrument. Gridless system of triboresistive sensing allowed to rearrange touch sections according to a given situation without any physical modification, and thus easily completed consecutive missions of controlling position, orientation, and gripping functions of a robot.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Airflow Sensors Based on Suspended Carbon Nanotube Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;performance airflow sensors are in great demand in numerous fields but still face many challenges such as slow response speed, low sensitivity, large detection threshold, narrow sensing range, etc. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit many advantages in fabricating airflow sensors due to their nanoscale diameters, excellent mechanical and electrical properties, etc. However, the intrinsic extraordinary properties of CNTs were not fully exhibited in previously reported CNTs&#8208;based airflow sensors due to the mixed structures of macroscale CNT assemblies. Herein, we present suspended CNT networks (SCNTNs) as high&#8208;performance airflow sensors, which were self&#8208;assembled by ultralong CNTs and short CNTs in a one&#8208;step floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition (FCCVD) process. The SCNTNs&#8208;based airflow sensors achieved a record&#8208;breaking short response time of 0.021 s, a high sensitivity of 0.0124 s m&#8722;1, a small detection threshold of 0.11 m s&#8722;1, and a wide detection range of 0.11&#8764;5.51 m s&#8722;1, superior to most of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art airflow sensors. To reveal the sensing mechanism, an acoustic response testing system and a mathematical model were developed. It was found that the airflow&#8208;caused intertube stress change resulted in the resistance variation of SCNTNs.

         <title>Aggregation Control, Surface Passivation, and Optimization of Device Structure Toward Near&#8208;Infrared Perovskite Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with an EQE up to 15.4%</title>

Abstract
In recent years, the performance of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) and QD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) has improved greatly, with the electroluminescence (EL) efficiency of green and red emission exceeding 20%. However, the development of perovskite near&#8208;infrared (NIR) QLEDs has reached stagnation, where the reported maximum EL efficiency is still below 6%, limiting their further applications. In this work, new NIR emissive FAPbI3 QDs were developed by post&#8208;treating long alkyl&#8208;encapsulated QDs with 2&#8208;phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI). The incorporation of PEAI reduces the QD surface defects for giving high photoluminescence quantum yield up to 61.6%. The n&#8208;octane solution of PEAI&#8208;passivated FAPbI3 QDs was spin&#8208;coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS&#8208;treated ITO electrode modified with a thermally cross&#8208;linked hole&#8208;transporting layer to give a full&#8208;coverage, smooth, and dense QD film. Incorporating with an effective electron&#8208;transporting material CN&#8208;T2T with deep LUMO and good electron mobility, the optimal device with EL &#955;max at 772&#160;nm achieved an external quantum efficiency up to 15.4% at a current density of 0.54&#160;mA/cm2 (2.6&#160;V), which is the highest efficiency ever reported for perovskite&#8208;based NIR QLEDs. This study provides a facile strategy to prepare high&#8208;quality perovskite QD films suitable for highly efficient NIR QLEDs applications.

         <title>Blocking Cancer&#8208;Nerve Crosstalk for Treatment of Metastatic Bone Cancer Pain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The tumor microenvironment is a complex milieu where neurons constitute an important non&#8208;neoplastic cell type. From &#8220;Cancer Neuroscience&#8221;, the crosstalk between tumors and neurons favors the rapid growth of both, making the cancer&#8208;nerve interaction a reciprocally beneficial process. Thus, the cancer&#8208;nerve crosstalk may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention against cancer and cancer&#8208;related symptoms. We proposed a nerve&#8208;cancer crosstalk blocking strategy for metastatic bone cancer pain treatment, achieved by Mg/Al&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanoshells (Mg/Al&#8208;LDH) with AZ&#8208;23 loaded inside and alendronate (ALD) decorated outside. The pain&#8208;causing H+ was rapidly eliminated by LDH, with neurogenesis inhibited by the antagonist AZ&#8208;23. As positive feedback, the decreased pain reversed the nerve&#8208;to&#8208;cancer Ca2+ crosstalk&#8208;related cell cycle, dramatically inhibiting tumor growth. All experiments confirmed the improved pain threshold and enhanced tumor inhibition. The study may inspire multidisciplinary researchers to focus on the cancer&#8208;nerve crosstalk for treating cancer and accompanied neuropathic diseases.

Abstract
Semiconductor&#8208;liquid junction (SCLJ), the dominant place in photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis, determines the interfacial activity and stability of photoelectrodes that directly affects the viability of PEC hydrogen generation. Though efforts dedicated in past decades, a challenge remains on creating a synchronously active and stable SCLJ, owing to the technical hurdles on simultaneously overlaying the two advantages. Present work demonstrates that, creating a SCLJ with unique configuration of dual interfacial layers, could yield BiVO4 photoanodes with synchronously boosted photoelectrochemical activity and operational stability with values located at the top in records of such photoelectrodes. The bespoke dual interfacial layers, accessed via grafting laser generated carbon dots with phenolic hydroxyl groups (LGCDs&#8208;PHGs), were experimentally verified effective, not only in generating the uniform layer of LGCDs with covalent anchoring for inhibited photo&#8208;corrosion, but activating respectively the charge separation and transfer in each layer for boosted charge carrier kinetics, resulted in the FeNiOOH&#8208;LGCDs&#8208;PHGs&#8208;MBVO photoanodes with a dual configuration with the photocurrent density of 6.08&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (averagely 6.01&#160;&#177; 0.07&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) @ 1.23 VRHE, and operational stability up to 120 hours (averagely 108&#160;&#177; 12.6 hours) @ 1.23 VRHE. Further work exploring LGCDs&#8208;PHGs from catecholic molecules warrants the proposed strategy a universal alternative of addressing interfacial charge carrier kinetics and operational stability of semiconductor photoelectrodes.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Change&#8208;Enabled, Rapid, High&#8208;Resolution Direct Ink Writing of Soft Silicone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel direct ink writing (DIW) method for 3D printing high&#8208;resolution soft silicones, enabled by the fast control of phase&#8208;change ink's flow behavior is presented. Printed filaments with a diameter of 50 &#181;m set a new benchmark in DIW of soft silicone. This technology exhibits excellent performances in the fabrication of flexible sensors, superhydrophobic surfaces, and shape&#8208;memory bionic devices.








Abstract
Soft silicone is an ideal flexible material for application, e.g., in soft robotics, flexible electronics, bionics, or implantable biomedical devices. However, gravity&#8208;driven sagging, filament stretching, and deformation can cause inevitable defects during rapid manufacturing, making it hard to obtain complex, high&#8208;resolution 3D silicone structures with direct ink writing (DIW) technology. Here, rapid DIW of soft silicone enabled by a phase&#8208;change&#8208;induced, reversible change of the ink's hierarchical microstructure is presented. During printing, the silicone&#8208;based ink, containing silica nanoparticles and wax microparticles, is extruded from a heated nozzle into a cold environment under controlled stress. The wax phase change (solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid) during printing rapidly destroys and rebuilds the particle networks, realizing fast control of the ink flow behavior and printability. This high&#8208;operating&#8208;temperature DIW method is fast (maximum speed &#8776;3100&#160;mm min&#8722;1) and extends the DIW scale range of soft silicone. The extruded filaments have small diameters (50&#160;&#177; 5&#160;&#181;m), and allow for large spans (&#8776;13&#8208;fold filament diameter) and high aspect ratios (&#8776;1), setting a new benchmark in the DIW of soft silicone. Printed silicone structures exhibit excellent performance as flexible sensors, superhydrophobic surfaces, and shape&#8208;memory bionic devices, illustrating the potential of the new 3D printing strategy.

         <title>Peritoneum&#8208;Inspired Janus Porous Hydrogel with Anti&#8208;Deformation, Anti&#8208;Adhesion, and Pro&#8208;Healing Characteristics for Abdominal Wall Defect Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peritoneum&#8208;inspired Janus porous poly(vinyl alchohol) (PVA) hydrogel patch with unique asymmetric cell&#8208;adhesion behaviors and excellent anti&#8208;swelling characteristics demonstrates anti&#8208;adhesion, pro&#8208;healing, and anti&#8208;deformation properties simultaneously, leading to superior repair effect of abdominal wall defects.








Abstract
Implantable meshes used in tension&#8208;free repair operations facilitate treatment of internal soft&#8208;tissue defects. However, clinical meshes fail to achieve anti&#8208;deformation, anti&#8208;adhesion, and pro&#8208;healing properties simultaneously, leading to undesirable surgery outcomes. Herein, inspired by the peritoneum, a novel biocompatible Janus porous poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel (JPVA hydrogel) is developed to achieve efficient repair of internal soft&#8208;tissue defects by a facile yet efficient strategy based on top&#8208;down solvent exchange. The densely porous and smooth bottom&#8208;surface of JPVA hydrogel minimizes adhesion of fibroblasts and does not trigger any visceral adhesion, and its loose extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;like porous and rough top&#8208;surface can significantly improve fibroblast adhesion and tissue growth, leading to superior abdominal wall defect treatment to commercially available PP and PCO meshes. With unique anti&#8208;swelling property (maximum swelling ratio: 6.4%), JPVA hydrogel has long&#8208;lasting anti&#8208;deformation performance and maintains high mechanical strength after immersion in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline (PBS) for 14 days, enabling tolerance to the maximum abdominal pressure in an internal wet environment. By integrating visceral anti&#8208;adhesion and defect pro&#8208;healing with anti&#8208;deformation, the JPVA hydrogel patch shows great prospects for efficient internal soft&#8208;tissue defect repair.

         <title>Stable and Solution&#8208;Processable Cumulenic sp&#8208;Carbon Wires: A New Paradigm for Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cumulenic sp&#8208;carbon wires are employed in large&#8208;area electronics. Transistors based on solution&#8208;processed polycrystalline thin films of tetraphenyl[3]cumulene show ideal p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect behavior, a reliable hole mobility exceeding 0.1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 and promising stability in dark conditions, paving the way to a vast library of sp&#8208;hybridized molecular semiconductors.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed, large&#8208;area, and flexible electronics largely relies on the excellent electronic properties of sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon molecules, either in the form of &#960;&#8208;conjugated small molecules and polymers or graphene and carbon nanotubes. Carbon with sp&#8208;hybridization, the foundation of the elusive allotrope carbyne, offers vast opportunities for functionalized molecules in the form of linear carbon atomic wires (CAWs), with intriguing and even superior predicted electronic properties. While CAWs represent a vibrant field of research, to date, they have only been applied sparingly to molecular devices. The recent observation of the field&#8208;effect in microcrystalline cumulenes suggests their potential applications in solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film transistors but concerns surrounding the stability and electronic performance have precluded developments in this direction. In the present study, ideal field&#8208;effect characteristics are demonstrated for solution&#8208;processed thin films of tetraphenyl[3]cumulene, the shortest semiconducting CAW. Films are deposited through a scalable, large&#8208;area, meniscus&#8208;coating technique, providing transistors with hole mobilities in excess of 0.1&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, as well as promising operational stability under dark conditions. These results offer a solid foundation for the exploitation of a vast class of molecular semiconductors for organic electronics based on sp&#8208;hybridized carbon systems and create a previously unexplored paradigm.

Transition metal dichalcogenides offer unprecedented versatility to engineer 2D materials with tailored properties to explore novel structural and electronic phase transitions. In this work, we present the atomic&#8208;scale evolution of the electronic ground state of a monolayer of Nb1&#8208;&#948;Mo&#948;Se2 across the entire alloy composition range (0 &lt; &#948; &lt;&#160;1) using low&#8208;temperature (300 mK) scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). In particular, we investigate the atomic and electronic structure of this 2D alloy throughout the metal to semiconductor transition (monolayer NbSe2 to MoSe2). Our measurements let us extract the effective doping of Mo atoms, the bandgap evolution and the band shifts, which are monotonic with &#948;. Furthermore, we demonstrate that collective electronic phases (charge density wave and superconductivity) are remarkably robust against disorder. We further show that the superconducting TC changes non&#8208;monotonically with doping. This contrasting behavior in the normal and superconducting state is explained using first&#8208;principles calculations. We show that Mo doping decreases the density of states at the Fermi level and the magnitude of pair&#8208;breaking spin fluctuations as a function of Mo content. Our results paint a detailed picture of the electronic structure evolution in 2D TMD alloys, which is of utmost relevance for future 2D materials design.

         <title>Engineered Living Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Living biological systems, ranging from single cells to whole organisms, can sense, process information, and actuate in response to changing environmental conditions. Inspired by living biological systems, engineered living cells and non&#8208;living matrices are brought together, which gives rise to the technology of engineered living materials. By designing the functionalities of living cells and the structures of non&#8208;living matrices, engineered living materials can be created to detect variability in the surrounding environment and to adjust their functions accordingly, thereby enabling applications in health monitoring, disease treatment, and environmental remediation. Hydrogels, a class of soft, wet, and biocompatible materials, have been widely used as matrices for engineered living cells, leading to the nascent field of engineered living hydrogels. Here, we discuss the interactions between hydrogel matrices and engineered living cells, focusing on how hydrogels influence cell behaviours and how cells affect hydrogel properties. We also discuss the interactions between engineered living hydrogels and their environments, and how these interactions enable versatile applications. Finally, we highlight current challenges facing the field of engineered living hydrogels for their applications in clinical and environmental settings.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Engineered Conjugated Polymer Nanoplatform for Activatable Companion Diagnostics and Multi&#8208;Stage Augmented Synergistic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Companion diagnostics (CDx) provides critical information for precision medicine. However, current CDx is mostly limited to in vitro tests which cannot accurately evaluate the disease progression and treatment response in real time. To overcome this challenge, we herein report a glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;engineered conjugated polymer (polyaniline, PANI) nanoplatform (denoted as PANITG) for activatable imaging&#8208;based CDx and multi&#8208;stage augmented photothermal/starvation synergistic therapy. PANITG comprises a pH&#8208;activatable conjugated polymer as a photothermal convertor and photoacoustic (PA) emitter, a GOx as a cancer starvation inducer as well as a H2O2 and acid producer, and a H2O2&#8208;cleavable linker as a &#8220;switch&#8221; for GOx activity. The in vivo PA imaging and photothermal therapy ability are activated by acidic tumor microenvironment and self&#8208;augmented by the reaction between GOx and glucose. Meanwhile, the photothermal effect would enhance the GOx activity in turn. Such multi&#8208;stage augmentation of the therapeutic effects would facilitate effective cancer management. In addition, the in vivo PA imaging with PANITG reveals the tumor pH level which is correlated to the efficiency of the photothermal therapy and to the catalytic activity of GOx at each stage, enabling real&#8208;time activatable CDx.

         <title>Passive ultra&#8208;conductive thermal metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultra&#8208;conductive heat transport showcases significant potentials in popular thermal managements with convection, phase change, and heat source. However, it is captivated impossible for passive thermal manipulation, usually bounded by intrinsic thermal conductivities of natural materials, to outperform these active recipes in need of extra energy payload. Here, we report a robust recipe to create passive ultra&#8208;conductive thermal metamaterials consisting of nothing but bulk natural materials. Thanks to the local thermal resistance regulation by vertical thermal transport channel, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thermal metamaterials experimentally demonstrate extreme effective conductivity (1915 W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1) solely with naturally occurring materials. The purely conductive modulation without any external energy is comparable to active counterparts, and further reveals its robustness and unexpected convenience. Our findings construct a high&#8208;efficient paradigm of passive thermal management with ultra&#8208;conductive heat transport, and further hint potentials in other Laplace fields, e.g., DC and magnetostatics.

         <title>12.42% Monolithic 25.42 cm2 Flexible Organic Solar Cells Enabled by an Amorphous ITO Modified Metal Grid Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Printed metal nano&#8208;grid electrode exhibits superior characteristics for use in flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the high surface roughness and inhomogeneity between grid and blank region is adverse for performance improvement. In this work, a thin amorphous ITO film (&#945;&#8208;ITO) was introduced to fill the blank and to improve the charge transporting. The introduction of &#945;&#8208;ITO significantly improves the comprehensive properties of metal grid electrode, which exhibited excellent bending resistance and long&#8208;term stability under double 85 condition (under 85&#160;&#176;C and 85% relative humidity) for 200 h. Both experimental and simulation results revealed &#945;&#8208;ITO with a sheet resistance of 20000 &#937;/&#9633; was sufficient to improve the charge transporting within the adjacent grids, leading to a remarkable efficiency of 16.54% for 1 cm2 flexible devices. With area increased to 4.00, 9.00 and 25.42 cm2, the devices still displayed a performance of 16.22%, 14.69% and 12.42%, respectively, showing less efficiency loss during upscaling. And the 25.42 cm2 monolithic flexible device exhibited a certificated efficiency of 12.03%. Moreover, the device showed significantly improved air stability relative to conventional high&#8208;conductive PEDOT:PSS modified device. All these make the &#945;&#8208;ITO modified Ag/Cu electrode promise to achieve high&#8208; efficient and long&#8208;term stable large&#8208;area flexible OSCs.

         <title>Fully Solution&#8208;Printed Photosynaptic Transistor Array with Ultralow Energy Consumption for Artificial Vision Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photosynaptic organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) represent a viable pathway to develop bionic optoelectronics. However, the high operating voltage and current of traditional photosynaptic OFETs lead to huge energy consumption greater than that of the real biological synapses, hindering their further development in new&#8208;generation visual prosthetics and artificial perception systems. Here, we report a fully solution&#8208;printed photosynaptic OFET (FSP&#8208;OFET) with substantial energy consumption reduction by introducing a source Schottky barrier to regulate charge carrier injection, which operates with a fundamentally different mechanism from traditional devices. The FSP&#8208;OFET not only significantly lowers the working voltage and current but also provides extraordinary neuromorphic light perception capabilities. Consequently, the FSP&#8208;OFET successfully emulates visual nervous responses to external light stimuli with ultralow energy consumption of 0.07&#8208;34 fJ per spike in short&#8208;term plasticity and 0.41&#8208;19.87 fJ per spike in long&#8208;term plasticity, both approaching the energy efficiency of biological synapses (1&#8208;100 fJ). Moreover, an artificial optic&#8208;neural network made from an 8 &#215; 8 FSP&#8208;OFET array on a flexible substrate shows excellent image recognition and reinforcement abilities at a low energy cost. The designed FSP&#8208;OFET offers an opportunity to realize photonic neuromorphic functionality with extremely low energy consumption dissipation.

Abstract
Much effort has been devoted to develop agents with superior photoacoustic/photothermal properties for improved disease diagnosis and treatment. Herein, a new fused two isoindigo (DIID)&#8208;based semiconducting conjugated polymer (named PBDT&#8208;DIID) was rationally designed and synthesized with a strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption band ranging from 700&#8211;1000&#160;nm. Water&#8208;dispersing nanoparticles (NPs) of PBDT&#8208;DIID were prepared with good biocompatibility and a rather high photothermal conversion efficiency (70.6%), as the active excited&#8208;state intramolecular twist around the central double bonds in DIID permitted most of the absorbed excitation energy flow to heat deactivation pathway through internal conversion. The photoacoustic signal could be further magnified by incorporation of polylactide (PLA) in the NP core to confine the generated heat of PBDT&#8208;DIID within NPs. The resultant doped NPs showed excellent performance in photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in an orthotopic 4T1 breast tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model. It was also found that the photothermal effect of the PBDT&#8208;DIID NPs was safe and quite efficacious to highly improve the root canal treatment outcome by heating the 1% NaClO solution inside the root canal upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation in a human extracted tooth root canal infection model.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Metaphosphate&#8208;Like Terminals Enable High&#8208;Capacity MXene Anodes for Ultrafast Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active metaphosphate&#8208;like terminals for Nb4C3 MXene, which double the specific capacity of Nb4C3 MXene for ultrafast Na+ storage, are constructed. This study unveils that the molecular&#8208;level design of MXene terminals provides opportunities to alleviate the energy&#8722;power trade&#8208;off often faced by energy&#8208;storage devices.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, so&#8208;called MXenes, are noted as ideal fast&#8208;charging cation&#8208;intercalation electrode materials, which nevertheless suffer from limited specific capacities. Herein, it is reported that constructing redox&#8208;active phosphorus&#8722;oxygen terminals can be an attractive strategy for Nb4C3 MXenes to remarkably boost their specific capacities for ultrafast Na+ storage. As revealed, redox&#8208;active terminals with a stoichiometric formula of PO2&#8208; display a metaphosphate&#8208;like configuration with each P atom sustaining three P&#63743;O bonds and one P&#63742;O dangling bond. Compared with conventional O&#8208;terminals, metaphosphate&#8208;like terminals empower Nb4C3 (denoted PO2&#8208;Nb4C3) with considerably enriched carrier density (fourfold), improved conductivity (12.3&#8208;fold at 300 K), additional redox&#8208;active sites, boosted Nb redox depth, nondeclined Na+&#8208;diffusion capability, and buffered internal stress during Na+ intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. Consequently, compared with O&#8208;terminated Nb4C3, PO2&#8208;Nb4C3 exhibits a doubled Na+&#8208;storage capacity (221.0 mAh g&#8208;1), well&#8208;retained fast&#8208;charging capability (4.9&#160;min at 80% capacity retention), significantly promoted cycle life (nondegraded capacity over 2000 cycles), and justified feasibility for assembling energy&#8722;power&#8208;balanced Na&#8208;ion capacitors. This study unveils that the molecular&#8208;level design of MXene terminals provides opportunities for developing simultaneously high&#8208;capacity and fast&#8208;charging electrodes, alleviating the energy&#8722;power tradeoff typical for energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Ultrafast Sub&#8208;100 fs All&#8208;Optical Modulation and Efficient Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Weyl Semimetal Niobium Phosphide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weyl semimetals are topological materials with promising electronic and optical properties. This work thoroughly characterizes the nonlinear optical properties of the Weyl semimetal niobium phosphide by using third&#8208;harmonic generation and nondegenerate pump&#8211;probe spectroscopy. A measured third&#8208;harmonic generation efficiency of 10&#8722;4% and an ultrafast change in reflectivity of close to 1% paves the way for the coming Weyl&#8208;semimetal&#8208;based nanophotonics.








Abstract
Since their experimental discovery in 2015, Weyl semimetals have generated a large amount of attention due their intriguing physical properties that arise from their linear electron dispersion relation and topological surface states. In particular, in the field of nonlinear (NL) optics and light harvesting, Weyl semimetals have shown outstanding performances and achieved record NL conversion coefficients. In this context, the first steps toward Weyl semimetal nanophotonics are performed here by thoroughly characterizing the linear and NL optical behavior of epitaxially grown niobium phosphide (NbP) thin films, covering the visible to the near&#8208;infrared regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. Despite the measured high linear absorption, third&#8208;harmonic generation studies demonstrate high conversion efficiencies up to 10&#8722;4% that can be attributed to the topological electron states at the surface of the material. Furthermore, nondegenerate pump&#8211;probe measurements with sub&#8208;10 fs pulses reveal a maximum modulation depth of &#8776;1%, completely decaying within 100 fs and therefore suggesting the possibility of developing all&#8208;optical switching devices based on NbP. Altogether, this work reveals the promising NL optical properties of Weyl semimetal thin films, which outperform bulk crystals of the same material, laying the grounds for nanoscale applications, enabled by top&#8208;down nanostructuring, such as light&#8208;harvesting, on&#8208;chip frequency conversion, and all&#8208;optical processing.

         <title>Circular Polarized Light Emission in Chiral Inorganic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) of chiral nanomaterials has cross&#8208;disciplinary importance for fundamental sciences and technologies. Two size&#8208; and organization&#8208;dependent contributions to CPLE are analyzed: circularly polarized luminescenceand circularly polarized scattering. Synergistic integration of luminescence and scattering outputs allows for high spectral purity and strong polarization rotation, which is demonstrated for inorganic nanomaterials with multiscale chirality.








Abstract
Chiral inorganic nanostructures strongly interact with photons changing their polarization state. The resulting circularly polarized light emission (CPLE) has cross&#8208;disciplinary importance for a variety of chemical/biological processes and is essential for development of chiral photonics. However, the polarization effects are often complex and their interpretation is dependent on the several structural parameters of the chiral nanostructure. CPLE in nanostructured media has multiple origins and several optical effects are typically convoluted into a single output. Analyzing CPLE data obtained for nanoclusters, nanoparticles, nanoassemblies, and nanocomposites from metals, chalcogenides, perovskite, and other nanostructures, it is shown here that there are several distinct groups of nanomaterials for which CPLE is dominated either by circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) or circularly polarized scattering (CPS); there are also many nanomaterials for which they are comparable. The following points are also demonstrated: 1) CPL and CPS contributions involve light&#8722;matter interactions at different structural levels; 2) contribution from CPS is especially strong for nanostructured microparticles, nanoassemblies, and composites; and 3) engineering of materials with strongly polarized light emission requires synergistic implementation of CPL and CPS effects. These findings are expected to guide development of CPLE materials in a variety of technological fields, including 3D displays, information storage, biosensors, optical spintronics, and biological probes.

         <title>Stepwise Energy Transfer: Near&#8208;Infrared Persistent Luminescence from Doped Polymeric Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process with an intermediate dye is presented, which provides a universal strategy for tuning the luminescence peak by a large margin. Therefore, bright NIR luminescence with a lifetime up to 0.2 s at 810 nm is achieved based on a new triphenylene&#8208;dye&#8208;doped polymer (TP@PVA) with a blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s.








Abstract
Organic near infrared (NIR) persistent&#8208;luminescence systems with bright and long&#8208;lived emission are highly valuable for applications in communication, imaging, and sensors. However, realizing these materials (especially lifetime over 0.1 s) is a challenge, mainly because of non&#8208;radiative quenching of their long&#8208;lived excitons. Herein, a universal strategy of stepwise F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) for a bright NIR system with remarkable persistent luminescence (up to 0.2 s at 810&#160;nm) is presented, based on a new triphenylene&#8208;dye&#8208;doped polymer (triphenylene&#8208;2&#8208;ylboronic acid@poly(vinyl alcohol) (TP@PVA)) with a persistent blue phosphorescence of 3.29 s. This persistent NIR luminescence is demonstrated for application not only in NIR anti&#8208;counterfeiting but also NIR bioimaging with penetrating a piece of skin as thick as 2.0&#160;mm. By co&#8208;doping a red dye (such as Nile red) and an NIR dye Cyanine 7 (Cy7) into this doped PVA film, the shortage of spectral overlap between TP emission and Cy7 absorbance is successfully solved, through a stepwise FRET process involving triplet to singlet (TS)&#8208;FRET from TP to the intermediate red dye and then singlet to singlet (SS)&#8208;FRET to Cy7. It is noted that the efficiency of the upper TS&#8208;FRET is enhanced significantly by the lower SS&#8208;FRET, leading to high efficiencies for the continuous FRETs.

Abstract
Although Li&#8208;S batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems, their practical applications are limited by the growth of Li dendrites and lithium polysulfide shuttling. These problems can be mitigated through the use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which exhibit the advantages of maximal atom utilization efficiency (&#8764;100%) and unique catalytic properties, thus effectively enhancing the performance of electrode materials in energy storage devices. This review systematically summarizes the recent progress in SACs intended for use in Li metal anodes, S cathodes, and separators, briefly introducing the operating principles of Li&#8208;S batteries, the action mechanisms of the corresponding SACs, and the fundamentals of SACs activity, and then comprehensively describes the main strategies for SACs synthesis. Subsequently, the applications of SACs and the principles of SACs operation in reinforced Li&#8208;S batteries as well as other metal&#8208;S batteries are individually illustrated, and the major challenges of SACs usage in Li&#8208;S batteries as well as future development directions are presented.

         <title>Stabilization of Metastable Halide Perovskite Lattices in the 2D Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size effects of metastability in halide perovskites, especially the phase stabilization in the 2D limit due to the dominance of surface effects, are critically reviewed. This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A&#8208;cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which provide new insights on how the A&#8208;cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites constitute a new class of semiconductors that are structurally tailorable, exhibiting rich structural polymorphs. In this perspective, the polymorphism in lead halide perovskites is described&#8212;a material system currently used for high&#8208;performance photovoltaics and optoelectronics. Strategies for stabilizing the metastable perovskite polymorphs based on crystal size reduction and surface functionalization are critically reviewed. Focus is on an unprecedented stabilization of metastable perovskite lattices in the 2D limit (e.g., with a thickness down to a few unit cells) due to the dominance of surface effects. This stabilization allows the incorporation of various A&#8208;cations that deemed oversized for 3D perovskites into the 2D perovskite lattices, which bring new insights on the relationships between the crystal structures and optoelectronic properties and lead to emergent ferroelectricity in halide perovskites. A comprehensive understanding is provided on how the A&#8208;cations influence the structural, optoelectronic, and ferroelectric properties, with an emphasis on the second order Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion caused by the oversized A&#8208;cations. Finally, future perspectives on new structure exploration and studies of fundamental photophysical properties using stabilized perovskite lattices are provided.

         <title>Generation and Control of Terahertz Spin Currents in Topology&#8208;Induced 2D Ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2|Bi2Te3 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnetism is successfully realized in topological&#8208;insulator&#8208;induced van der Waals Fe3GeTe2, which is evidenced by ultrafast THz emission spectroscopy. Furthermore, the direction of the external magnetic field is rotated and the sample's front surface is reversed to probe the THz radiation symmetry. The results reveal that the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion effect is the dominant THz radiation mechanism.








Abstract
Future information technologies for low&#8208;dissipation quantum computation, high&#8208;speed storage, and on&#8208;chip communication applications require the development of atomically thin, ultracompact, and ultrafast spintronic devices in which information is encoded, stored, and processed using electron spin. Exploring low&#8208;dimensional magnetic materials, designing novel heterostructures, and generating and controlling ultrafast electron spin in 2D magnetism at room temperature, preferably in the unprecedented terahertz (THz) regime, is in high demand. Using THz emission spectroscopy driven by femtosecond laser pulses, optical THz spin&#8208;current bursts at room temperature in the 2D van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) integrated with Bi2Te3 as a topological insulator are successfully realized. The symmetry of the THz radiation is effectively controlled by the optical pumping incidence and external magnetic field directions, indicating that the THz generation mechanism is the inverse Edelstein effect contributed spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. Thickness&#8208;, temperature&#8208;, and structure&#8208;dependent nontrivial THz transients reveal that topology&#8208;enhanced interlayer exchange coupling increases the FGT Curie temperature to room temperature, which provides an effective approach for engineering THz spin&#8208;current pulses. These results contribute to the goal of all&#8208;optical generation, manipulation, and detection of ultrafast THz spin currents in room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetism, accelerating the development of atomically thin high&#8208;speed spintronic devices.

         <title>Photopatternable Porous Separators for Micro&#8208;Electrochemical Energy Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photopatterning of a unique porous separator is demonstrated by modifying the chemistry of SU&#8208;8, an epoxy&#8208;derived photoresist, through the addition of an imidazolium&#8208;based ionic liquid, which serves as a templating agent. The photopatternable SU&#8208;8&#160;separator exhibits good electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical properties, and is integrated and electrochemically validated with nonplanar high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio 3D Li&#8208;ion microbatteries.








Abstract
The miniaturization of electrochemical energy storage (EES) systems, one of the key challenges facing the rapid expansion of the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things, has been limited by poor performance of the various energy&#8208;storage components at the micrometer scale. Here, the development of a unique photopatternable porous separator that overcomes the electrolyte difficulties involving resistive losses at small dimensions is reported. The separator is based on modifying the chemistry of SU&#8208;8, an epoxy&#8208;derived photoresist, through the addition of a miscible ionic liquid. The ionic liquid serves as a templating agent, which is selectively removed by solution methods, leaving the SU&#8208;8&#160;scaffold whose interconnected porosity provides ion transport from the confined liquid electrolyte. The photopatternable separator exhibits good electrochemical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability during the operation of electrochemical devices in both 2D and 3D formats. For the latter, the separator demonstrates the ability to form conformal coatings over 3D structures. The development of the photopatternable separator overcomes the electrolyte issues, which have limited progress in the field of micro&#8208;EES.

The photopatternable separator exhibits good electrochemical, chemical, thermal, and mechanical stability during the operation of electrochemical devices in both 2D and 3D formats. For the latter, the separator demonstrates the ability to form conformal coatings over 3D structures. The development of the photopatternable separator overcomes the electrolyte issues, which have limited progress in the field of micro-EES.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rapid Identification of DNA Fragments through Direct Sequencing with Electro&#8208;Optical Zero&#8208;Mode Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for flash sequencing of DNA molecules using single&#8208;molecule real&#8208;time sequencing is proposed. Electro&#8208;optical zero&#8208;mode waveguides are presented, which use voltage to efficiently load ultralow inputs (picogram&#8208;to&#8208;nanogram levels) of various&#8208;sized DNA fragments, followed by their optically guided sequencing in just a few minutes.








Abstract
In contrast to sequence&#8208;specific techniques such as polymerase chain reaction, DNA sequencing does not require prior knowledge of the sample for surveying DNA. However, current sequencing technologies demand high inputs for a suitable library preparation, which typically necessitates DNA amplification, even for single&#8208;molecule sequencing methods. Here, electro&#8208;optical zero&#8208;mode waveguides (eZMWs) are presented, which can load DNA into the confinement of zero&#8208;mode waveguides with high efficiency and negligible DNA fragment length bias. Using eZMWs, highly efficient voltage&#8208;induced loading of DNA fragments of various sizes from ultralow inputs (nanogram&#8208;to&#8208;picogram levels) is observed. Rapid DNA fragment identification is demonstrated by burst sequencing of short and long DNA molecules (260 and 20&#160;000&#160;bp) loaded from an equimolar picomolar&#8208;level concentration mixture in just a few minutes. The device allows further studies in which low&#8208;input DNA capture is essential, for example, in epigenetics, where native DNA is required for obtaining modified base information.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Insensitive Efficient Inorganic Perovskite Photovoltaics by Bulk Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bulk&#8208;heterojunction strategy is developed to reduce the temperature sensitivity of inorganic perovskite solar cells to operation temperature, which may shed light on extending the application of perovskite solar cells for specific scenarios such as polar regions, near space, and exoplanet exploration.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) emerge as an ideal candidate for applications beyond terrestrial implementation due to their robustness. However, underlying mechanisms regarding their photovoltaic process at different temperatures remain unclear. Based on a stable absorber of CsPbI2.85(BrCl)0.15, considerable variation of corresponding device performance is revealed over temperature and further demonstrates a simple approach to an effective reduction of such variation. Interestingly, this absorber is found to be excitonic with poor carrier transport even at an ambient temperature of 285 K and below. With a novel device configuration of a PTB7&#8208;th/perovskite bulk heterojunction, exciton dissociation and carrier extraction is facilitated. The resultant solar cell attains a best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.2% with the fill factor of &#8776;84%, which represents the highest&#8208;efficiency &#947;&#8208;phase IPSCs reported to date. Importantly, this device is less sensitive to operation temperature, wherein the PCE variation over the temperature range from 210 to 360 K is 60% suppressed compared with the reference. The approach is effectively extended to other IPSCs with different photoactive phases, which may shed light on realizing highly efficient IPSCs for specific scenarios such as polar regions, near&#8208;space, and exoplanet exploration.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Memristors Based on Ultrathin 2D Copper Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenides with intrinsic memristive properties is synthesized via van der Waals epitaxy. The fabricated memristors exhibit relatively small switching voltage, fast switching speed, high switching uniformity, and wide operating temperature range, as well as stable retention and switching characteristics, indicating their tangible applications in future electronics.








Abstract
Copper chalcogenides represent a class of materials with unique crystal structures, high electrical conductivity, and earth abundance, and are recognized as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation green electronics. However, their 2D structures and the corresponding electronic properties have rarely been touched. Herein, a series of ultrathin copper chalcogenide nanosheets with thicknesses down to two unit cells are successfully synthesized, including layered Cu2Te, as well as nonlayered CuSe and Cu9S5, via van der Waals epitaxy, and their nonvolatile memristive behavior is investigated for the first time. Benefiting from the highly active Cu ions with low migration barriers, the memristors based on ultrathin 2D copper chalcogenide crystals exhibit relatively small switching voltage (&#8776;0.4&#160;V), fast switching speed, high switching uniformity, and wide operating temperature range (from 80 to 420 K), as well as stable retention and good cyclic endurance. These results demonstrate their tangible applications in future low&#8208;power, cryogenic, and high temperature harsh electronics.

         <title>Intracellular Self&#8208;Immolative Polyprodrug with Near&#8208;Infrared Light Guided Accumulation and in Vivo Visualization of Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intracellular self&#8208;immolative polyprodrug (PMTO) is developed, wherein the drug accumulation in tumor is significantly enhanced under laser&#8208;triggered mild hyperthermia, and the drug release behavior is real&#8208;time monitored by ratiometric photoacoustic signals. PMTO holds great potential for enhanced targeted chemotherapy efficacy as well as the visualization of drug release in vivo, guiding the clinical medication in cancer treatment.








Abstract
The selective accumulation and real&#8208;time monitoring of drug release at tumor site are the key bottlenecks to the clinical translation of polyprodrug. Herein, an intracellular self&#8208;immolative polyprodrug (PMTO) is exploited, which not only shows the enhanced cellular internalization and selective accumulation in tumor site under the mild hyperthermia triggered by laser irradiation, but also possesses the self&#8208;monitoring drug release ability in vivo. The polyprodrug amphiphiles are synthesized by sequential esterification reaction, and hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) serves as blocking agent. On account of the mild hyperthermia produced by PMTO under the laser irradiation at tumor site, the cell membranous permeability increases, resulting in the enhanced cellular internalization and drug accumulation in tumor. After internalized by cells, the self&#8208;immolative PMTO nanoparticles can release free mitoxantrone (MTO) in intracellular reductive environment, and ratiometric photoacoustic imaging based on distinct signals between MTO and PMTO is presented to trace the drug release in vivo. Finally, this self&#8208;monitoring polyprodrug presents significant tumor suppression efficacy, which exhibits great potential for guiding the clinical medication in cancer treatment.

         <title>Enabling Anionic Redox Stability of P2&#8208;Na5/6Li1/4Mn3/4O2 by Mg Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substitution strategy of partial occupation of the Na&#8208;site by Mg ions in Na0.773Li0.25Mn0.75O2 not only reduces the chemical potential energy of oxygen but also reduces the undercoordinated oxygen, the nonbonded, and electron&#8208;deficient O2p states, thus enhancing the stability of oxygen anodic redox upon long&#8208;term cycling.








Abstract
Oxygen&#8208;based anionic redox reactions have recently emerged as a lever to increase the capacity of Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes in addition to the charge compensation based on cationic redox reactions for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the irreversibility of anionic redox often aggravates irreversible structure change and poor cycling performance. Here, a stable anionic redox is achieved through substituting Na ions by Mg ions in P2&#8208;type Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mg substitution effectively decreases the oxygen chemical potential, causing an improvement in lattice oxygen stability. Moreover, at a highly desodiated state, Mg ions that remain in the lattice and interact with O 2p orbitals can decrease the undercoordinated oxygen and the nonbonded, electron&#8208;deficient O 2p states, facilitating the reversibility of oxygen redox. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.6&#8211;4.5&#160;V where only anionic redox occurs for charge compensation, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 presents a much better reversibility, giving a 4 times better cycle stability than that of Na0.83Li0.25Mn0.75O2. Experimentally, Na0.773Mg0.03Li0.25Mn0.75O2 exhibits a &#8776;1.1% volume expansion during sodium insertion/extraction, suggestive of a &#8220;zero&#8208;strain&#8221; cathode. Overall, the work opens a new avenue for enhancing anionic reversibility of oxygen&#8208;related Mn&#8208;rich cathodes.

&lt;p&gt;A substitution strategy of partial occupation of the Na-site by Mg ions in Na&lt;sub&gt;0.773&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; not only reduces the chemical potential energy of oxygen but also reduces the undercoordinated oxygen, the nonbonded, and electron-deficient O2p states, thus enhancing the stability of oxygen anodic redox upon long-term cycling.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxygen-based anionic redox reactions have recently emerged as a lever to increase the capacity of Mn-rich layered oxide cathodes in addition to the charge compensation based on cationic redox reactions for sodium-ion batteries. Unfortunately, the irreversibility of anionic redox often aggravates irreversible structure change and poor cycling performance. Here, a stable anionic redox is achieved through substituting Na ions by Mg ions in P2-type Na&lt;sub&gt;0.83&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mg substitution effectively decreases the oxygen chemical potential, causing an improvement in lattice oxygen stability. Moreover, at a highly desodiated state, Mg ions that remain in the lattice and interact with O 2p orbitals can decrease the undercoordinated oxygen and the nonbonded, electron-deficient O 2p states, facilitating the reversibility of oxygen redox. When cycled in the voltage range of 2.6&#8211;4.5&#160;V where only anionic redox occurs for charge compensation, Na&lt;sub&gt;0.773&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; presents a much better reversibility, giving a 4 times better cycle stability than that of Na&lt;sub&gt;0.83&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Experimentally, Na&lt;sub&gt;0.773&lt;/sub&gt;Mg&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;Li&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a &#8776;1.1% volume expansion during sodium insertion/extraction, suggestive of a &#8220;zero-strain&#8221; cathode.

         <title>Replicating the Cynandra opis Butterfly's Structural Color for Bioinspired Bigrating Color Filters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking inspiration from the unique structures found in the wings of the butterfly Cynandra opis, two&#8208;photon photolithography is used to fabricate bigrating nanostructures, whose optical properties may be controlled by variation of the height and period of the grating features. It is demonstrated that by tuning the grating period a structural color palette array can be printed and used as an artificial structural color device optimized for technological applications.








Abstract
Multilayer grating structures, such as those found on the wings of the butterfly Cynandra opis, are able to interact with light to generate structural coloration. When illuminated and viewed at defined angles, such structural color is characterized by exceptional purity and brightness. To provide further insight into the mechanism of structural coloration, two&#8208;photon laser lithography is used to fabricate bioinspired bigrating nanostructures, whose optical properties may be controlled by variation of the height and period of the grating features. Through the use of both spectral measurements and finite&#8208;element method simulations, herein specific feature dimensions are identified that due to the combined effects of multilayer interference and diffraction generate excellent spectral characteristics and high color purity over the entire visible range. Additionally, it is demonstrated that variation of feature period and/or height plays a central role in controlling both hue and purity. Importantly, such tuneable bigrating structures are of significant utility in color filtering applications.

By taking advantage of the synergetic effect of diradical feature and strong intermolecular interactions, a stable croconium derivative, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, with high&#8208;spin state and ultra&#8208;broadband absorption covering 300 to 2000&#160;nm in the aggregated state is obtained. CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T demonstrates highly efficient photothermal conversion promoted by multiple nonradiative decay pathways, being a potential candidate for solar thermoelectric generation.








Abstract
Organic materials with radical characteristics are gaining increasing attention, due to their potential implications in highly efficient utilization of solar energy. Manipulating intermolecular interactions is crucial for tuning radical properties, as well as regulating their absorption bands, and thus improving the photothermal conversion efficiency. Herein, a diradical&#8208;featured organic small&#8208;molecule croconium derivative, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, is reported for highly efficient utilization of solar energy. Upon aggregation, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T exists in dimer form, stabilized by the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, and exhibits a rarely reported high&#8208;spin state. Benefiting from the synergic effects of radical characteristics and strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T powder absorbs broadly from 300 to 2000&#160;nm. In&#8208;depth investigations with transient absorption analysis reveal that the strong intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions can promote nonradiative relaxation by accelerating internal conversion and facilitating intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) between dimeric molecules to open up faster internal conversion pathways. Remarkably, CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T powder demonstrates a high photothermal efficiency of 79.5% under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. By employing CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T as a solar harvester, a CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T&#8208;loaded flexible self&#8208;healing poly(dimethylsiloxane) (H&#8208;PDMS) film, named as H&#8208;PDMS/CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T self&#8208;healing film, is fabricated and employed for solar&#8211;thermal applications. These findings provide a feasible guideline for developing highly efficient diradical&#8208;featured organic photothermal materials.

         <title>Endogenous Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Coupled Electrospun Short Fiber via Collecting Wound Exudation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with excellent reversible hydroscopicity and biostable conductivity is fabricated to achieve precise tissue remodeling by collecting a large amount of secretions in the early stages of wound healing and transmitting bioelectrical signals to proactively match the cascade reaction of tissue repair.








Abstract
Endogenous electric fields (EF) are the basis of bioelectric signal conduction and the priority signal for damaged tissue regeneration. Tissue exudation directly affects the characteristics of endogenous EF. However, current biomaterials lead to passive repair of defect tissue due to limited management of early wound exudates and inability to actively respond to coupled endogenous EF. Herein, the 3D bionic short&#8208;fiber scaffold with the functions of early biofluid collection, response to coupled endogenous EF, is constructed by guiding the short fibers into a 3D network structure and subsequent multifunctional modification. The scaffold exhibits rapid reversible water absorption, reaching maximum after only 30 s. The stable and uniform distribution of polydopamine&#8208;reduced graphene oxide endows the scaffold with stable electrical and mechanical performances even after long&#8208;term immersion. Due to its unique &#8208; bionic structure and tissue affinity, the scaffold further acts as an &#8220;electronic skin,&#8221; which transmits endogenous bioelectricity via absorbing wound exudates, promoting the treatment of diabetic wounds. Furthermore, under the endogenous EF, the cascade release of vascular endothelial growth factor accelerates the healing process. Thus, the versatile scaffold is expected to be an ideal candidate for repairing different defect tissues, especially electrosensitive tissues.

         <title>Achieving Ultimate Narrowband and Ultrapure Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Polycyclo&#8208;Heteraborin Multi&#8208;Resonance Delayed&#8208;Fluorescence Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency ultrapure blue delayed&#8208;fluorescence materials are produced by the strategic doping of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms into the fused polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin &#960;&#8208;system. These new fluorophores allow organic light&#8208;emitting diodes to demonstrate ideal narrowband and ultrapure blue electroluminescence, meeting the requirements for modern ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
To achieve an ultimate wide color gamut for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays, there is great demand for the development of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) enabling monochromatic, ultrapure blue electroluminescence (EL). Herein, high&#8208;efficiency and ultrapure blue OLEDs based on polycyclo&#8208;heteraborin multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials, BOBO&#8208;Z, BOBS&#8208;Z, and BSBS&#8208;Z, are reported. The key to the design of the present luminophores is the exquisite combination and interplay of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur heteroatoms embedded in a fused polycyclic &#960;&#8208;system. Comprehensive photophysical and computational investigations of this family of MR&#8208;TADF materials reveal that the systematic implementation of chalcogen (oxygen and sulfur) atoms can finely modulate the emission color while maintaining a narrow bandwidth, as well as the spin&#8208;flipping rates between the excited singlet and triplet states. Consequently, OLEDs based on BOBO&#8208;Z, BOBS&#8208;Z, and BSBS&#8208;Z demonstrate narrowband and ultrapure blue EL emission, with peaks at 445&#8211;463&#160;nm and full width at half maxima of 18&#8211;23&#160;nm, leading to Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage&#8208;y coordinates in the range of 0.04&#8211;0.08. Particularly, for OLEDs incorporating sulfur&#8208;doped BOBS&#8208;Z and BSBS&#8208;Z, notably high maximum external EL quantum efficiencies of 26.9% and 26.8%, respectively, and small efficiency roll&#8208;offs are achieved concurrently.

&lt;p&gt;High-efficiency ultrapure blue delayed-fluorescence materials are produced by the strategic doping of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms into the fused polycyclo-heteraborin &#960;-system. These new fluorophores allow organic light-emitting diodes to demonstrate ideal narrowband and ultrapure blue electroluminescence, meeting the requirements for modern ultrahigh-definition displays.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve an ultimate wide color gamut for ultrahigh-definition displays, there is great demand for the development of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) enabling monochromatic, ultrapure blue electroluminescence (EL). Herein, high-efficiency and ultrapure blue OLEDs based on polycyclo-heteraborin multi-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) materials, &lt;b&gt;BOBO-Z&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;BOBS-Z&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;BSBS-Z&lt;/b&gt;, are reported. The key to the design of the present luminophores is the exquisite combination and interplay of multiple boron, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur heteroatoms embedded in a fused polycyclic &#960;-system. Comprehensive photophysical and computational investigations of this family of MR-TADF materials reveal that the systematic implementation of chalcogen (oxygen and sulfur) atoms can finely modulate the emission color while maintaining a narrow bandwidth, as well as the spin-flipping rates between the excited singlet and triplet states. Consequently, OLEDs based on &lt;b&gt;BOBO-Z&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;BOBS-Z&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;BSBS-Z&lt;/b&gt; demonstrate narrowband and ultrapure blue EL emission, with peaks at 445&#8211;463&#160;nm and full width at half maxima of 18&#8211;23&#160;nm, leading to Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage-&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; coordinates in the range of 0.04&#8211;0.08. Particularly, for OLEDs incorporating sulfur-doped &lt;b&gt;BOBS-Z&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;BSBS-Z&lt;/b&gt;, notably high maximum external EL quantum efficiencies of 26.9% and 26.8%, respectively, and small efficiency roll-offs are achieved concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supramolecular Reinforcement of Polymer&#8211;Nanoparticle Hydrogels for Modular Materials Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyclodextrin&#8208;based supramolecular binding enhances the viscoelastic properties of polymer&#8211;nanoparticle hydrogels and provides modular exchange of building blocks. This paradigm expands the interactions available for the formation of this class of injectable nanocomposite hydrogels, enabling unique applications in 3D printing, magnetic materials, and conductive hydrogels.








Abstract
Moldable hydrogels are increasingly used as injectable or extrudable materials in biomedical and industrial applications owing to their ability to flow under applied stress (shear&#8208;thin) and reform a stable network (self&#8208;heal). Nanoscale components can be added to dynamic polymer networks to modify their mechanical properties and broaden the scope of applications. Viscoelastic polymer&#8211;nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels comprise a versatile and tunable class of dynamic nanocomposite materials that form via reversible interactions between polymer chains and nanoparticles. However, PNP hydrogel formation is restricted to specific interactions between select polymers and nanoparticles, resulting in a limited range of mechanical properties and constraining their utility. Here, a facile strategy to reinforce PNP hydrogels through the simple addition of &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;CD) to the formulation is introduced. The formation of polypseudorotoxanes between &#945;CD and the hydrogel components resulted in a drastic enhancement of the mechanical properties. Furthermore, supramolecular reinforcement of CD&#8211;PNP hydrogels enabled decoupling of the mechanical properties and material functionality. This allows for modular exchange of structural components from a library of functional polymers and nanoparticles. &#945;CD supramolecular binding motifs are leveraged to form CD&#8211;PNP hydrogels with biopolymers for high&#8208;fidelity 3D (bio)printing and drug delivery as well as with inorganic NPs to engineer magnetic or conductive&#160;materials.

         <title>Designing Angstrom&#8208;Scale Asymmetric MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF Cavities for High Monovalent Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ion&#8208;selective membrane that possesses an asymmetrical bi&#8208;layer of functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF) with heterostructured connections between the two MOFs is introduced. The membrane consists of natural asymmetrical nanochannels that exhibit both extraordinary high ionic current rectification and high monovalent ion selectivity.








Abstract
Biological ion channels feature angstrom&#8208;scale asymmetrical cavity structures, which are the key to achieving highly efficient separation and sensing of alkali metal ions from aqueous resources. The clean energy future and lithium&#8208;based energy storage systems heavily rely on highly efficient ionic separations. However, artificial recreation of such a sophisticated biostructure has been technically challenging. Here, a highly tunable design concept is introduced to fabricate monovalent ion&#8208;selective membranes with asymmetric sub&#8208;nanometer pores in which energy barriers are implanted. The energy barriers act against ionic movements, which hold the target ion while facilitating the transport of competing ions. The membrane consists of bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF&#8208;on&#8208;MOF), possessing a 6 to 3.4&#8208;angstrom passable cavity structure. The ionic current measurements exhibit an unprecedented ionic current rectification ratio of above 100 with exceptionally high selectivity ratios of 84 and 80 for K+/Li+ and Na+/ Li+, respectively (1.14 Li+ mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1). Furthermore, using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, it is shown that the combined effect of spatial hindrance and nucleophilic entrapment to induce energy surge baffles is responsible for the membrane's ultrahigh selectivity and ion rectification. This work demonstrates a striking advance in developing monovalent ion&#8208;selective channels and has implications in sensing, energy storage, and separation technologies.

         <title>Miniaturized Multispectral Detector Derived from Gradient Response Units on Single MAPbX3 Microwire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optic&#8208;component&#8208;free miniaturized multispectral detector with response&#8208;modulated photodetector units on gradient bandgap MAPbX3 microwire is fabricated to detect and discriminate incident light from 450 to 790&#160;nm, with 25&#160;nm resolution. This work will push multispectral detectors to universal application and provide guidance for forthcoming research in novel functional perovskite devices.








Abstract
Miniaturized multispectral detectors are urgently desired given the unprecedented prosperity of smart optoelectronic chips for integrated functions including communication, imaging, scientific analysis, etc. However, multispectral detectors require complicated prism optics or interference/interferometric filters for spectral recognition, which hampers the miniaturization and their subsequent integration in photonic integrated circuits. In this work, inspired by the advance of computational imaging, optical&#8208;component&#8208;free miniaturized multispectral detector on 4&#160;mm gradient bandgap MAPbX3 microwire with a diameter of 30&#160;&#181;m, is reported. With accurate composition engineering, halide ions in MAPbX3 microwire vary from Cl to I giving in the gradual variation of optical bandgap from 2.96 to 1.68&#160;eV along axis. The sensing units on MAPbX3 microwire offer the response edge ranging from 450 to 790&#160;nm with the responsivity over 20&#160;mA W&#8722;1, &#8722;3dB&#160;width over 450&#160;Hz, LDR of &#8776;60&#160;dB, and a noise current less than &#8776;1.4 &#215; 10&#8722;12 A Hz&#8722;0.5. As a result, the derived miniaturized detector achieves the function of multispectral sensing and discrimination with spectral resolution of &#8776;25&#160;nm and mismatch of &#8776;10&#160;nm. Finally, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept colorful imaging is successfully conducted with the miniaturized multispectral detector to further confirm its application in spectral recognition.

         <title>Single&#8208;, Dual&#8208;, Triple, and Quadruple&#8208;Wavelength Surface&#8208;Emitting Lasing in Blue&#8208;Phase Liquid Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of how to controllably construct a multiwavelength laser, from single&#8208;, dual&#8208;, triple&#8208; to quadruple&#8208;wavelength, in a simple configuration, i.e., a free&#8208;standing blue&#8208;phase liquid crystals film, is presented. The corresponding principle is also investigated.








Abstract
Soft organic lasers with multiwavelength output and high spectral purity are of crucial importance for versatile photonic devices, owing to their monochromaticity, coherence, and high intensity.&#160;However, there remain challenges for the achievement of&#160;surface&#8208;emitting multiwavelength lasing in soft photonic crystals, and the relative mechanisms need to be investigated. Herein, single&#8208;, dual&#8208;, triple&#8208;, and quadruple&#8208;wavelength lasers are successfully achieved in dye&#8208;doped blue&#8208;phase liquid crystal (BPLC) film. The number and wavelength of the lasing peaks can be manipulated by tuning the center of the bandgap, the order parameter of the laser dye, the quality of the resonance cavity, and even the pump energy. For single&#8208;wavelength lasing, &#160;a lasing peak with&#160;an ultranarrow linewidth of 0.04&#160;nm (Q&#8208;factor of 13&#160;454) is achieved. Multiwavelength lasing is attained based on the following aspects: i) the narrow bandgaps of the BPLCs with&#160;full width at half maximum of 14&#8211;20&#160;nm; ii) a laser dye with high gain over a wide wavelength band, having a low&#8208;order parameter in the liquid crystal matrix; iii) appropriate relative positions between the reflection and fluorescence peaks; and iv) the highly ordered crystal lattice of BPLC film. The proposed single&#8208;to&#8208;quadruple&#8208;wavelength surface&#8208;emitting lasers can be employed as coherent light sources for next&#8208;generation optical devices.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy of how to controllably construct a multiwavelength laser, from single-, dual-, triple- to quadruple-wavelength, in a simple configuration, i.e., a free-standing blue-phase liquid crystals film, is presented. The corresponding principle is also investigated.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft organic lasers with multiwavelength output and high spectral purity are of crucial importance for versatile photonic devices, owing to their monochromaticity, coherence, and high intensity.&#160;However, there remain challenges for the achievement of&#160;surface-emitting multiwavelength lasing in soft photonic crystals, and the relative mechanisms need to be investigated. Herein, single-, dual-, triple-, and quadruple-wavelength lasers are successfully achieved in dye-doped blue-phase liquid crystal (BPLC) film. The number and wavelength of the lasing peaks can be manipulated by tuning the center of the bandgap, the order parameter of the laser dye, the quality of the resonance cavity, and even the pump energy. For single-wavelength lasing, &#160;a lasing peak with&#160;an ultranarrow linewidth of 0.04&#160;nm (&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;-factor of 13&#160;454) is achieved. Multiwavelength lasing is attained based on the following aspects: i) the narrow bandgaps of the BPLCs with&#160;full width at half maximum of 14&#8211;20&#160;nm; ii) a laser dye with high gain over a wide wavelength band, having a low-order parameter in the liquid crystal matrix; iii) appropriate relative positions between the reflection and fluorescence peaks; and iv) the highly ordered crystal lattice of BPLC film. The proposed single-to-quadruple-wavelength surface-emitting lasers can be employed as coherent light sources for next-generation optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Biomimetic Nanovaccines Based on Photothermal and Weak&#8208;Immunostimulatory Nanoparticulate Cores for the Immunotherapy of Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal porous silicon@Au nanocomposites are used as particular cores to be coated by cancer cell membranes to construct biomimetic nanovaccine with good biosafety. The developed nanovaccine shows a good prophylactic and synergistic photothermal&#8211;immunotherapeutic efficacy on the occurrence, growth, and metastasis of solid tumors, via the recruitment and activation of immune&#8208;related cells to elicit antitumor immunity.








Abstract
An alternative strategy of choosing photothermal and weak&#8208;immunostimulatory porous silicon@Au nanocomposites as particulate cores to prepare a biomimetic nanovaccine is reported to improve its biosafety and immunotherapeutic efficacy for solid tumors. A quantitative analysis method is used to calculate the loading amount of cancer cell membranes onto porous silicon@Au nanocomposites. Assisted with foreign&#8208;body responses, these exogenous nanoparticulate cores with weak immunostimulatory effect can still efficiently deliver cancer cell membranes into dendritic cells to activate them and the downstream antitumor immunity, resulting in no occurrence of solid tumors and the survival of all immunized mice during 55 day observation. In addition, this nanovaccine, as a photothermal therapeutic agent, synergized with additional immunotherapies can significantly inhibit the growth and metastasis of established solid tumors, via the initiation of the antitumor immune responses in the body and the reversion of their immunosuppressive microenvironments. Considering the versatile surface engineering of porous silicon nanoparticles, the strategy developed here is beneficial to construct multifunctional nanovaccines with better biosafety and more diagnosis or therapeutic modalities against the occurrence, recurrence, or metastasis of solid tumors in future clinical practice.

         <title>A Universal Cosolvent Evaporation Strategy Enables Direct Printing of Perovskite Single Crystals for Optoelectronic Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite single crystals (SCs) are grown on&#8208;demand at room temperature and integrated directly onto optoelectronic devices via printing and coating using a scalable cosolvent evaporation (CSE) strategy. The CSE strategy controls supersaturation and suppresses competing nucleation during drying to yield high&#8208;quality SCs of 2D, 3D, lead&#8208;free, and mixed&#8208;ion perovskites with minimal residue.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal halide perovskite (MHP) single crystals (SCs) are in high demand for a growing number of printed electronic applications due to their superior optoelectronic properties compared to polycrystalline thin films. There is an urgent need to make SC fabrication facile, scalable, and compatible with the printed electronic manufacturing infrastructure. Here, a universal cosolvent evaporation (CSE) strategy is presented by which perovskite SCs and arrays are produced directly on substrates via printing and coating methods within minutes at room temperature from drying droplets. The CSE strategy successfully guides the supersaturation via controlled drying of droplets to suppress all crystallization pathways but one, and is shown to produce SCs of a wide variety of 3D, 2D, and mixed&#8208;cation/halide perovskites with consistency. This approach works with commonly used precursors and solvents, making it universal. Importantly, the SC consumes the precursor in the droplet, which enables the large&#8208;scale fabrication of SC arrays with minimal residue. Direct on&#8208;chip fabrication of 3D and 2D perovskite photodetector devices with outstanding performance is demonstrated. The approach shows that any MHP SC can now be manufactured on substrates using precision printing and scalable, high&#8208;throughput coating methods.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Twist Fibers toward Rotating Microengines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Untethered twist fibers with reversible responsiveness have shown great potential as rotating microengine, of which high torque and high rotational deformation are desirable. Herein, liquid crystal elastomer twist fiber (LCETF) with fixed twisting orientation is developed, demonstrating outstanding rotational performance due to its significant intrinsic deformation. The obtained LCETF can function as a rotating microengine in an electricity generator.








Abstract
Untethered twist fibers do not require end&#8208;anchoring structures to hold their twist orientation and offer simple designs and convenient operation. The reversible responsiveness of these fibers allows them to generate torque and rotational deformation continuously upon the application of external stimuli. The fibers therefore have potential in rotating microengines. In practical applications, high torque and rotational deformation are desirable to meet work capacity requirements. However, the simultaneous endowment of reversible responsiveness and high rotational performance to untethered twist fibers remains a challenge. In this study, a liquid crystal elastomer twist fiber (LCETF) is designed and developed with a fixed twisting alignment of mesogens to provide untethered and reversible responsiveness. Outstanding rotational performance can be achieved when the mesogenic orientation is disrupted through heat triggering. Owing to the significant intrinsic contractile ratio of the LCE material, the rotational deformation of the LCETF can reach 243.6&#176; mm&#8722;1. More importantly, the specific torque can reach 10.1 N m kg&#8722;1, which exceeds previously reported values. In addition, the LCETF can be exploited in a rotating microengine to convert heat into electricity with an induction voltage as high as 9.4&#160;V. This work broadens the applications of LCEs for energy harvesters, micromachines, and soft robots.

         <title>Highly Bright AIE Nanoparticles by Regulating the Substituent of Rhodanine for Precise Early Detection of Atherosclerosis and Drug Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly bright and atherosclerosis (AS)&#8208;targeting aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobe is designed and synthesized by delicate molecular surgery strategy of AIE luminogen and surface functionalization with anti&#8208;CD47 antibody, which can serve as an effective near&#8208;infrared fluorescent probe for early detection of atherosclerotic plaque, studying the progression of AS, and screening of anti&#8208;AS drugs in a precise, sensitive, and rapid manner.








Abstract
Fluorescent probes capable of precise detection of atherosclerosis (AS) at an early stage and fast assessment of anti&#8208;AS drugs in animal level are particularly valuable. Herein, a highly bright aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) nanoprobe is introduced by regulating the substituent of rhodanine for early detection of atherosclerotic plaque and screening of anti&#8208;AS drugs in a precise, sensitive, and rapid manner. With dicyanomethylene&#8208;substituted rhodanine as the electron&#8208;withdrawing unit, the AIE luminogen named TPE&#8208;T&#8208;RCN shows the highest molar extinction coefficient, the largest photoluminescence quantum yield, and the most redshifted absorption/emission spectra simultaneously as compared to the control compounds. The nanoprobes are obtained with an amphiphilic copolymer as the matrix encapsulating TPE&#8208;T&#8208;RCN molecules, which are further surface functionalized with anti&#8208;CD47 antibody for specifically binding to CD47 overexpressed in AS plaques. Such nanoprobes allow efficient recognition of AS plaques at different stages in apolipoprotein E&#8208;deficient (apoE&#8722;/&#8722;) mice, especially for the recognition of early&#8208;stage AS plaques prior to micro&#8208;computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These features impel to apply the nanoprobes in monitoring the therapeutic effects of anti&#8208;AS drugs, providing a powerful tool for anti&#8208;AS drug screening. Their potential use in targeted imaging of human carotid plaque is further demonstrated.

         <title>A Flexible and Degradable Hybrid Mineral as a Plastic Substitute</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by biomineralization, a flexible and degradable hybrid mineral (HM), which is dominated by minerals, is constructed by the inorganic ionic polymerization of calcium phosphate ionic oligomers under biomimetic control from organic templates (polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate). The HM shows potential to serve as a plastic substitute owing to its superior mechanical properties and environmental friendliness.








Abstract
The development of environmentally friendly plastics is critical to ensure sustainable development. In contrast to polymer plastics derived from petrochemicals, inorganic minerals, which are the most abundant matter in Earth's crust, are environmentally friendly. However, the brittleness of these minerals limits their applications as plastics. Here, because of the advantages of both biomineralization and inorganic ionic polymerization, the calcium phosphate (CaP, a typical geological and biological mineral) oligomers are used for biomimetic mineralization under the regulation of polyvinyl alcohol and sodium alginate, resulting in flexible CaP nanofibers with periodic structural defects. The assembly of CaP nanofibers produces a hierarchically structured bulk hybrid mineral (HM), which overcomes the intrinsic brittleness of minerals and exhibits plasticity characteristics. HM exhibits better hardness and thermostability than classical polymer plastics due to its dominant mineral composition. Notably, HM is environmentally friendly and degradable in nature, as it can potentially participate in geological cycles, indicating that this material is an optimal plastic substitute. The construction of periodic structural defects within flexible minerals expands the current understanding of materials science.

         <title>A Novel Technique for Controlling Anisotropic Ion Diffusion: Bulk Single&#8208;Crystalline Metallic Silicon Clathrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic ion&#8208;diffusion process is developed. This technique can homogeneously extract Na+ from a type&#8208;II Si clathrate regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity by skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force. The synthesis concept behind the technique is expected to expose new exploration areas for thermodynamically metastable materials.








Abstract
Na&#8208;free Si clathrates consisting only of Si cages are an allotrope of diamond&#8208;structured Si. This material is promising for various device applications, such as next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. The probable technique for synthesizing Na&#8208;free Si clathrates is to extract Na+ from the Si cages of Na24Si136. Vacuum annealing is presently a well&#8208;known conventional and effective approach for extracting Na. However, this study demonstrates that Na+ cannot be extracted from the surface of a single&#8208;crystalline type&#8208;II metallic Si clathrate (Na24Si136) in areas deeper than 150&#160;&#181;m. Therefore, a novel method is developed to control anisotropic ion diffusion: this is effective for various compounds with a large difference in the bonding strength between their constituent elements, such as Na24Si136 composed of covalent Si cages and weakly trapped Na+. By skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force, Na+ is homogeneously extracted regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity. Additionally, the proposed point defect model is evaluated via density functional theory, and the migration of Na+ between the Si cages is explained. It is expected that the developed experimental and computational techniques would significantly advance material design for synthesizing thermodynamically metastable materials.

         <title>Interface Engineering Between Multi&#8208;Elemental Alloy Nanoparticles and a Carbon Support Toward Stable Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial engineering approach is used to improve the stability (e.g., nanoparticle agglomeration) of multi&#8208;elemental alloy (MEA) nanoparticles on a carbon substrate. MEA&#8211;oxide&#8211;carbon catalysts with a hierarchical structure are synthesized via a high&#8208;temperature thermal&#8208;shock method. The catalysts show excellent thermal and electrochemical stability, holding great potential for a range of catalytic reactions.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;elemental alloy (MEA) nanoparticles have recently received notable attention owing to their high activity and superior phase stability. Previous syntheses of MEA nanoparticles mainly used carbon as the support, owing to its high surface area, good electrical conductivity, and tunable defective sites. However, the interfacial stability issue, such as nanoparticle agglomeration, remains outstanding due to poor interfacial binding between MEA and carbon. Such a problem often causes performance decay when MEA nanoparticles are used as catalysts, hindering their practical applications. Herein, an interface engineering strategy is developed to synthesize MEA&#8211;oxide&#8211;carbon hierarchical catalysts, where the oxide on carbon helps disperse and stabilize the MEA nanoparticles toward superior thermal and electrochemical stability. Using several MEA compositions (PdRuRh, PtPdIrRuRh, and PdRuRhFeCoNi) and oxides (TiO2 and Cr2O3) as model systems, it is shown that adding the oxide renders superior interfacial stability and therefore excellent catalytic performance. Excellent thermal stability is demonstrated under transmission electron microscopy with in situ heating up to 1023 K, as well as via long&#8208;term cycling (&gt;370 hours) of a Li&#8211;O2 battery as a harsh electrochemical condition to challenge the catalyst stability. This work offers a new route toward constructing efficient and stable catalysts for various applications.

         <title>Nanovesicle&#8208;Mediated Targeted Delivery of Immune Checkpoint Blockades to Potentiate Therapeutic Efficacy and Prevent Side Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anti&#8208;cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4 antibody (&#945;CTLA&#8208;4)&#8208;conjugated and tumor antigen (TA)&#8208;loaded nanovesicles derived from dendritic cells can facilitate spatiotemporal delivery of TA and &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 to tumor&#8208;specific T cells. This leads to selective activation of tumor&#8208;reactive T cells, effective inhibition of tumor growth and prevention of immune&#8208;related adverse events, improving the current immune checkpoint blockade therapies.








Abstract
Despite the clinically proven efficacies of immune checkpoint blockades, including anti&#8208;cytotoxic T lymphocyte&#8208;associated protein 4&#160;antibody (&#945;CTLA&#8208;4), the low response rate and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) in cancer patients represent major drawbacks of the therapy. These drawbacks of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;therapy are mainly due to the suboptimal activation of tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and the systemic nonspecific activation of T cells. To overcome such drawbacks, &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;is delivered by dendritic cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles presenting tumor antigens (DCNV&#8208;TAs) that exclusively interact with tumor&#8208;specific T cells, leading to selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific CTLs. Compared to conventional &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;therapy, treatment with &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#8208;conjugated DCNV&#8208;TAs significantly inhibits tumor growth and reduces irAEs in syngeneic tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study demonstrates that the spatiotemporal presentation of both &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;and tumor antigens enables selective activation of tumor&#8208;specific T cells and potentiates the antitumor efficacy of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4&#160;without inducing systemic irAEs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An RNA&#8211;amorphous calcium phosphate nanomachine that induces extrafibrillar and intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen fibrils and regenerates new bone in a dynamic and programmable manner is developed. This multifunctional nanomachinery is comparable to the function of osteoblasts. The RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines that simulate physiological processes brings new opportunities and challenges to bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
The visionary idea that RNA adopts nonbiological roles in today's nanomaterial world has been nothing short of phenomenal. These RNA molecules have ample chemical functionality and self&#8208;assemble to form distinct nanostructures in response to external stimuli. They may be combined with inorganic materials to produce nanomachines that carry cargo to a target site in a controlled manner and respond dynamically to environmental changes. Comparable to biological cells, programmed RNA nanomachines have the potential to replicate bone healing in vitro. Here, an RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachine is developed, which accomplishes intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar mineralization of collagen scaffolds to mimic bone formation in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulation indicates that noncovalent hydrogen bonding provides the energy source that initiates self&#8208;assembly of these nanomachines. Incorporation of the RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines into collagen scaffolds in vivo creates an osteoinductive microenvironment within a bone defect that is conducive to rapid biomineralization and osteogenesis. Addition of RNA&#8208;degrading enzymes into RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines further creates a stop signal that inhibits unwarranted bone formation in tissues. The potential of RNA in building functional nanostructures has been underestimated in the past. The concept of RNA&#8211;biomineral nanomachines participating in physiological processes may transform the nanoscopic world of life science.

         <title>Inverse Design of Ferroelectric&#8208;Order in Perovskite Crystal for Self&#8208;Powered Ultraviolet Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>

A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered KTa1&#8722;xNbxO3&#160;photodetector is fabricated based on &#8220;inverse&#8208;design&#8221; of the ferroelectric order.








Abstract
It has always been a hot topic to design an orderly mesoscopic structure in functional materials to tailor the macroscopic properties or realize new functions. The existence of domains in ferroelectric materials has been proven to affect the macroscopic properties, being actively studied in nonlinear optical conversion and piezoelectric effects. However, the high&#8208;efficiency photoelectric conversion capability of ferroelectric crystals has not yet been explored. Here, the authors study the orderly arrangement of ferroelectric order in KTa1&#8722;xNbxO3 (KTN) perovskite crystals, and design the &#8220;head&#8208;to&#8208;head&#8221; domains by tuning the Curie temperature Tc, thereby generating abundant charged domain walls and robust conductive channels for electrons and holes. An ultrahigh ultraviolet photoresponsivity is achieved in the KTN crystal under zero bias voltage, being about four orders magnitude higher than that of the well&#8208;known ferroelectric materials. The substantial improvement can be attributed to the judiciously designed ferroelectric order, as demonstrated by the conductive atomic force microscopy. In addition, KTN detector exhibits high stability and reliability after high&#8208;temperature and fatigue treatment. KTN crystal features giant photoresponsivity, high electric&#8211;optical coefficient, and large &#967;(2) nonlinearity concurrently, indicating its great potential for application of all&#8208;optical devices on photonic chips.

         <title>Record&#8208;High Superconductivity in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Emerged in Compressed 2H&#8208;TaS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;Tc superconducting state emerges in 2H&#8208;TaS2 under high pressure. The Tc enhances rapidly and reaches a maximum of &#8776;16.4 K at &#8776;157.4&#160;GPa, which sets a new record for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). It is the first time this remarkable superconducting state has been found in TMDs. The result brings a new broad perspective on layered materials.








Abstract
Pressure has always been an effective method for uncovering novel phenomena and properties in condensed matter physics. Here, an electrical transport study is carried on 2H&#8208;TaS2 up to &#8776;208&#160;GPa, and an unexpected superconducting state (SC&#8208;II) emerging around 86.1&#160;GPa with an initial critical temperature (Tc) of 9.6 K is found. As pressure increases, the Tc enhances rapidly and reaches a maximum of 16.4 K at 157.4&#160;GPa, which sets a new record for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). The original superconducting state (SC&#8208;I) is found to be re&#8208;enhanced above 100&#160;GPa after the recession around 10&#160;GPa, and coexists with SC&#8208;II to the highest pressure applied in this work. In situ high&#8208;pressure X&#8208;ray diffraction and Hall effect measurements reveal that the occurrence of SC&#8208;II is accompanied by a structural modification and a concurrent enhancement of hole carrier density. The new high&#8208;Tc superconducting state in 2H&#8208;TaS2 can be attributed to the change of the electronic states near the Fermi surface, owing to pressure&#8208;induced interlayer modulation. It is the first time finding this remarkable superconducting state in TMDs, which not only brings a new broad of perspective on layered materials but also expands the field of pressure&#8208;modified superconductivity.

         <title>A Programmable Dual&#8208;Regime Spray for Large&#8208;Scale and Custom&#8208;Designed Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable dual&#8208;regime spray that enables direct writing of custom electronic textiles (e&#8208;textiles) into stretch fabrics or garments over meter scale is introduced. The e&#8208;textiles tightly fit various body sizes and shapes of large animals to support reliable monitoring of health data under ambulatory conditions in a wirelessly controlled fashion.








Abstract
Increasing demand for wearable healthcare synergistically advances the field of electronic textiles, or e&#8208;textiles, allowing for ambulatory monitoring of vital health signals. Despite great promise, the pragmatic deployment of e&#8208;textiles in clinical practice remains challenged due to the lack of a method in producing custom&#8208;designed e&#8208;textiles at high spatial resolution across a large area. To this end, a programmable dual&#8208;regime spray that enables the direct custom writing of functional nanoparticles into arbitrary fabrics at sub&#8208;millimeter resolution over meter scale is employed. The resulting e&#8208;textiles retain the intrinsic fabric properties in terms of mechanical flexibility, water&#8208;vapor permeability, and comfort against multiple uses and laundry cycles. The e&#8208;textiles tightly fit various body sizes and shapes to support the high&#8208;fidelity recording of physiological and electrophysiological signals on the skin under ambulatory conditions. Pilot field tests in a remote health&#8208;monitoring setting with a large animal, such as a horse, demonstrate the scalability and utility of the e&#8208;textiles beyond conventional devices. This approach will be suitable for the rapid prototyping of custom e&#8208;textiles tailored to meet various clinical needs.

         <title>Orchestrated Yolk&#8211;Shell Nanohybrids Regulate Macrophage Polarization and Dendritic Cell Maturation for Oncotherapy with Augmented Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;designed yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids Fe3O4@C/MnO2&#8208;PGEA with intrinsic immunomodulatory effects are constructed to realize oncotherapy with augmented antitumor immunity through regulating macrophage polarization and dendritic cell maturation.








Abstract
The protumoral and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments greatly limit the antitumor immune responses of nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy. Here, the intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of orchestrated nanoparticles and their ability to simultaneously trigger tumor antigen release, thereby reversing immunosuppression and achieving potent antitumor immunity and augmented cancer therapy, are explored. By optimizing both the composition and morphology, a facile strategy is proposed to construct yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids (Fe3O4@C/MnO2&#8208;PGEA, FCMP). The intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of FCMP are utilized to reprogram macrophages to M1 phenotype and induce the maturation of dendritic cells. In addition, the chemical, magnetic, and optical properties of FCMP contribute to amplified immunogenic cell death induced by multiaugmented chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and synergistic tumor treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Well-designed yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@C/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PGEA with intrinsic immunomodulatory effects are constructed to realize oncotherapy with augmented antitumor immunity through regulating macrophage polarization and dendritic cell maturation.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protumoral and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments greatly limit the antitumor immune responses of nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy. Here, the intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of orchestrated nanoparticles and their ability to simultaneously trigger tumor antigen release, thereby reversing immunosuppression and achieving potent antitumor immunity and augmented cancer therapy, are explored. By optimizing both the composition and morphology, a facile strategy is proposed to construct yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@C/MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-PGEA, FCMP). The intrinsic immunomodulatory effects of FCMP are utilized to reprogram macrophages to M1 phenotype and induce the maturation of dendritic cells. In addition, the chemical, magnetic, and optical properties of FCMP contribute to amplified immunogenic cell death induced by multiaugmented chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and synergistic tumor treatment. Taking advantage of the unique yolk&#8211;shell structure, accurate &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dual-mode magnetic resonance imaging can be realized and CDT can be maximized through sufficient exposure of both the Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; core and MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell. Potent antitumor effects are found to substantially inhibit the growth of both primary and distant tumors. Furthermore, the strategy can be extended to the synthesis of other yolk&#8211;shell nanohybrids with tailored properties. This work establishes a novel strategy for the fabrication of multifunctional nanoplatforms with yolk-shell structure for effective cancer therapy with immunomodulation-enhanced antitumor immunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surfaces Decorated with Enantiomorphically Pure Polymer Nanohelices via Hierarchical Chirality Transfer across Multiple Length Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;templated approach to prepare nanohelices of chiral parylene polymers on surfaces with tunable length, pitch, and higher&#8208;order mesoscale morphologies by altering the chirality of the template and/or the precursor is described. A phenomenon of chirality transfer from molecular to mesoscale level takes places during chemical vapor deposition, allowing for detection of weak chiral signals on such surfaces.








Abstract
Mesoscale chiral materials are prepared by lithographic methods, assembly of chiral building blocks, and through syntheses in the presence of polarized light. Typically, these processes result in micrometer&#8208;sized structures, require complex top&#8211;down manipulation, or rely on tedious asymmetric separation. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization of chiral precursors into supported films of liquid crystals (LCs) are discovered to result in superhierarchical arrangements of enantiomorphically pure nanofibers. Depending on the molecular chirality of the 1&#8208;hydroxyethyl [2.2]paracyclophane precursor, extended arrays of enantiomorphic nanohelices are formed from achiral nematic templates. Arrays of chiral nanohelices extend over hundreds of micrometers and consistently display enantiomorphic micropatterns. The pitch of individual nanohelices depends on the enantiomeric excess and the purity of the chiral precursor, consistent with the theoretical model of a doubly twisted LC director configuration. During CVD of chiral precursors into cholesteric LC films, aspects of molecular and mesoscale asymmetry combine constructively to form regularly twisted nanohelices. Enantiomorphic surfaces permit the tailoring of a wide range of functional properties, such as the asymmetric induction of weak chiral systems.

         <title>Artificial Nacre with High Toughness Amplification Factor: Residual Stress&#8208;Engineering Sparks Enhanced Extrinsic Toughening Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work illustrates an anti&#8208;intuitive strategy that, with the merit of biomimetic designs, residual stress that is conventionally harmful to ceramics can inversely help improve the fracture toughness of biomimetic ceramics through nanoscale residual stress&#8208;induced platelet strengthening. This provides new insights into the design principles of nacre&#8208;like materials at the bottom level.








Abstract
The high fracture toughness of mollusk nacre is predominantly attributed to the structure&#8208;associated extrinsic mechanisms such as platelet sliding and crack deflection. While the nacre&#8208;mimetic structures are widely adopted in artificial ceramics, the extrinsic mechanisms are often weakened by the relatively low tensile strength of the platelets with a large aspect ratio, which makes the fracture toughness of these materials much lower than expected. Here, it is demonstrated that the fracture toughness of artificial nacre materials with high inorganic contents can be improved by residual stress&#8208;induced platelet strengthening, which can catalyze more effective extrinsic toughening mechanisms that are specific to the nacre&#8208;mimetic structures. Thereby, while the absolute fracture toughness of the materials is not comparable with advanced ceramic&#8208;based composites, the toughness amplification factor of the material reaches 16.1&#160;&#177; 1.1, outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomimetic ceramics. The results reveal that, with the merit of nacre&#8208;mimetic structural designs, the overall fracture toughness of the artificial nacre can be improved by the platelet strengthening through extrinsic toughening mechanisms, although the intrinsic fracture toughness may decrease at platelet level due to the strengthening. It is anticipated that advanced structural ceramics with exceeding performance can be fabricated through these unconventional strategies.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free, Low&#8208;Temperature Crystallization of Stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerosol&#8208;assisted crystallization method to prepare high&#8208;quality, pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films at only 100&#160;&#176;C without chemical additives is reported. Remarkably improved phase stability of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 films and their applications in solar cells are demonstrated. The overriding mechanism of stabilizing &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is shown to be relaxation of residual tensile strains in the films.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) is attractive for photovoltaic devices due to its optimal bandgap at around 1.45&#160;eV and improved thermal stability compared with methylammonium&#8208;based perovskites. Crystallization of phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 conventionally requires high&#8208;temperature thermal annealing at 150&#160;&#176;C whilst the obtained &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 is metastable at room temperature. Here, aerosol&#8208;assisted crystallization (AAC) is reported, which converts yellow &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 into black &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at only 100&#160;&#176;C using precursor solutions containing only lead iodide and formamidinium iodide with no chemical additives. The obtained &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 exhibits remarkably enhanced stability compared to the 150&#160;&#176;C annealed counterparts, in combination with improvements in film crystallinity and photoluminescence yield. Using X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray scattering, and density functional theory simulation, it is identified that relaxation of residual tensile strains, achieved through the lower annealing temperature and post&#8208;crystallization crystal growth during AAC, is the key factor that facilitates the formation of phase&#8208;stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This overcomes the strain&#8208;induced lattice expansion that is known to cause the metastability of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Accordingly, pure FAPbI3 p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells are reported, facilitated by the low&#8208;temperature (&#8804;100&#160;&#176;C) AAC processing, which demonstrates increases of both power conversion efficiency and operational stability compared to devices fabricated using 150&#160;&#176;C annealed films.

         <title>Boosting Reversibility and Stability of Li Storage in SnO2&#8211;Mo Multilayers: Introduction of Interfacial Oxygen Redistribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In assembled SnO2&#8211;Mo multilayers with adjustable interfaces and tunable oxygen distribution, the regulating effect of the SnO2/Mo interfaces on the stability and reversibility of conversion between SnO2 and Sn/Li2O is quantified. Mo/SnO2/Mo with boosted charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, realizes a breakthrough performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.6% and large capacity of 1067 mA h g&#8722;1 retaining &#8776;100% after 700 cycles.








Abstract
Among the promising high&#8208;capacity anode materials, SnO2 represents a classic and important candidate that involves both conversion and alloying reactions toward Li storage. However, the inferior reversibility of conversion reactions usually results in low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE, &#8776;60%), small reversible capacity, and poor cycling stability. Here, it is demonstrated that by carefully designing the interface structure of SnO2&#8211;Mo, a breakthrough comprehensive performance with ultrahigh average ICE of 92.6%, large capacity of 1067 mA h g&#8722;1, and 100% capacity retention after 700 cycles can be realized in a multilayer Mo/SnO2/Mo electrode.

&lt;p&gt;In assembled SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Mo multilayers with adjustable interfaces and tunable oxygen distribution, the regulating effect of the SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo interfaces on the stability and reversibility of conversion between SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Sn/Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is quantified. Mo/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo with boosted charge-transfer kinetics, realizes a breakthrough performance with high initial Coulombic efficiency of 92.6% and large capacity of 1067 mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; retaining &#8776;100% after 700 cycles.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the promising high-capacity anode materials, SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represents a classic and important candidate that involves both conversion and alloying reactions toward Li storage. However, the inferior reversibility of conversion reactions usually results in low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE, &#8776;60%), small reversible capacity, and poor cycling stability. Here, it is demonstrated that by carefully designing the interface structure of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Mo, a breakthrough comprehensive performance with ultrahigh average ICE of 92.6%, large capacity of 1067 mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and 100% capacity retention after 700 cycles can be realized in a multilayer Mo/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo electrode. Furthermore, high capacity retentions are also achieved in pouch-type Mo/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo||Li half cells and Mo/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full cells. The amorphous SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo interfaces, which are induced by redistribution of oxygen between SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Mo, can precisely adjust the reversible capacity and cycling stability of the multilayers, while the stable capacities are parabolic with the interfacial density. Theoretical calculations and in/ex situ investigation reveal that oxygen redistribution in SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Mo heterointerfaces boosts Li-ion transport kinetics by inducing a built-in electric field and improves the reaction reversibility of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This work provides a new understanding of interface&#8211;performance relationship of metal&#8211;oxide hybrid electrodes and pivotal guidance for creating high-performance Li-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A PF6&#8722;&#8208;Permselective Polymer Electrolyte with Anion Solvation Regulation Enabling Long&#8208;Cycle Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PF6&#8722;&#8208;permselective polymer electrolyte with abundant quaternary ammonium motifs, which can facilitate PF6&#8722; desolvation and thus maintain the structural integrity of graphite during cycling, is designed for high&#8208;voltage dual&#8208;ion batteries. Besides, this design philosophy also improves oxidation resistance of electrolyte. Eventually, long&#8208;life 5.4&#160;V&#8208;class dual&#8208;ion batteries with superior Coulombic efficiency (CE) are achieved.








Abstract
Graphitic carbon that allows reversible anion (de)intercalation is a promising cathode material for cost&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;voltage dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs). However, one notorious but overlooked issue is the incomplete interfacial anion desolvation, which not only reduces the oxidative stability of electrolytes, but also results in solvent co&#8208;intercalation into graphite layers. Here, an &#8220;anion&#8208;permselective&#8221; polymer electrolyte with abundant cationic quaternary ammonium motif is developed to weaken the PF6&#8722;&#8211;solvent interaction and thus facilitates PF6&#8722; desolvation. This strategy significantly inhibits solvent co&#8208;intercalation as well as enhances the oxidation resistance of electrolyte, ensuring the structural integrity of graphite. As a result, the as&#8208;assembled graphite||Li cell achieves a superior cyclability with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.0% (vs 95.7% for baseline electrolyte) and 87.1% capacity retention after 2000 cycles even at a high cutoff potential of 5.4&#160;V versus Li+/Li. Besides, this polymer also forms a robust cathode electrolyte interface, working together to enable a long&#8208;life DIB. This strategy of tuning anion coordination environment provides a promising solution to regulate solvent co&#8208;intercalation chemistry for DIBs.

         <title>Differential Polymer Chain Scission Enables Free&#8208;Standing Microcavity Laser Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of differential polymer chain scission is developed to fabricate free&#8208;standing optical microcavities with high&#8208;quality factors by one&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam direct writing on polymer bilayers. This strategy features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the free&#8208;standing optical microstructures, which significantly expands the application scope for versatile photonic and optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Control over material architectures is essential to the performance of photonic devices and systems. Optical isolation of the photonic materials from substrates can significantly enhance their performance but suffers from complicated fabrication processes and limited applications. Here a differential polymer chain scission strategy is proposed to fabricate free&#8208;standing photonic structures based on one&#8208;step electron&#8208;beam direct writing on polymer bilayers (EOB). The polymer molecular mass&#8208;dependent sensitivity to electron beam enables differential patterning of the two layers of polymers, leading to the direct formation of suspended optical microcavities. The EOB technique features high materials compatibility and design flexibility for the optical microcavities, which significantly expands the application scope of the suspended optical microcavities. As well as providing a versatile strategy for building high&#8208;performance photonic materials, the results provide a promising platform for innovative applications of optical microstructures.

         <title>Engineering Metallic Heterostructure Based on Ni3N and 2M&#8208;MoS2 for Alkaline Water Electrolysis with Industry&#8208;Compatible Current Density and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifunctional electrocatalyst consisting of metallic nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide is designed and fabricated for large&#8208;current alkaline water electrolysis. The constructed water electrolyzer operates at an ultralow cell voltage of 1.644&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;with &#8776;100% current density retention over 300&#160;h, superior to the performance of commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO2 (2.41&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;h, 58.2%).








Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis is commercially desirable to realize large&#8208;scale hydrogen production. Although nonprecious catalysts exhibit high electrocatalytic activity at low current density (10&#8211;50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), it is still challenging to achieve industrially&#160;required current density over 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;due to inefficient electron transport and competitive adsorption between hydroxyl and water. Herein, the authors design a novel metallic heterostructure based on nickel nitride and monoclinic molybdenum disulfide (Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2) for extraordinary water electrolysis. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;composite with heterointerface provides two kinds of separated reaction sites to overcome the steric hindrance of competitive hydroxyl/water adsorption. The kinetically decoupled hydroxyl/water adsorption/dissociation and metallic conductivity of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;enable hydrogen production from Ni3N and oxygen evolution from the heterointerface at large current density. The metallic heterostructure is proved to be imperative for the stabilization and activation of Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2, which can efficiently regulate the active electronic states of Ni/N atoms around the Fermi&#8208;level through the charge transfer between the active atoms of Ni3N and Mo&#63743;Mo bonds of 2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;to boost overall water splitting. The Ni3N@2M&#8208;MoS2&#160;incorporated water electrolyzer requires ultralow cell voltage of 1.644&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;with &#8776;100% retention over 300&#160;h, far exceeding the commercial Pt/C&#9553;RuO2 (2.41&#160;V@1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 100&#160;h, 58.2%).

         <title>Toward Exotic Layered Materials: 2D Cuprous Iodide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Only a few dozen 2D crystals have been successfully prepared, though many more&#8212;including metal iodides&#8212;are predicted to exist. A major reason for this disparity is their instability under ambient conditions. A wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize 2D&#8208;CuI, stabilizing it by graphene encapsulation in a one&#8208;step process, is designed, and its chemical structure is imaged.








Abstract
Heterostructures composed of 2D materials are already opening many new possibilities in such fields of technology as electronics and magnonics, but far more could be achieved if the number and diversity of 2D materials were&#160;increased. So far, only a few dozen 2D crystals have been extracted from materials that exhibit a layered phase in ambient conditions, omitting entirely the large number of layered materials that may exist at other temperatures and pressures. This work demonstrates how such structures can be stabilized in 2D van der Waals (vdw) stacks under room temperature via growing them directly in graphene encapsulation by using graphene oxide as the template material. Specifically, an ambient stable 2D structure of copper and iodine, a material that normally only occurs in layered form at elevated temperatures between 645 and 675&#160;K, is produced. The results establish a simple route to the production of more exotic phases of materials that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to stabilize for experiments in&#160;ambient.

A major reason for this disparity is their instability under ambient conditions. A wet-chemical method to synthesize 2D-CuI, stabilizing it by graphene encapsulation in a one-step process, is designed, and its chemical structure is imaged.

Anisotropic Ion Diffusion
An anisotropic ion diffusion process is developed, as reported by Masaya Fujioka and co&#8208;workers in article number 2106754. This technique can homogeneously extract Na+ from a type&#8208;II Si clathrate regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity, by skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anisotropic Ion Diffusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anisotropic ion diffusion process is developed, as reported by Masaya Fujioka and co-workers in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202106754"&gt;2106754&lt;/a&gt;. This technique can homogeneously extract Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from a type-II Si clathrate regardless of the size of the single crystal while maintaining high crystallinity, by skillfully exploiting the difference in the chemical potentials as a driving force. The synthesis concept behind the technique is expected to expose new exploration areas for thermodynamically metastable materials.

Long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of solution&#8208;processable materials with regulated patterning, dimensions, and orientation lays foundation for the integration of high&#8208;performance devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art assembly methods developed based on superwetting interfaces are overviewed. The confined capillary liquids have been highlighted as a versatile and robust platform for the long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites, and colloidal nanoparticles.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integration of solution&#8208;processable materials imposes stringent and simultaneous requirements of controlled nucleation and growth, tunable geometry and dimensions, and long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly, which is challenging in solution process far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Superwetting interfaces, underpinned by programmable surface chemistry and topography, are promising for steering transport, dewetting, and microfluid dynamics of liquids, thus opening a new paradigm for micro&#8208;/nanostructure assembly in solution process. Herein, assembly methods on the basis of superwetting interfaces are reviewed for constructing long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered micro&#8208;/nanostructures. Confined capillary liquids, including capillary bridges and capillary corner menisci realized by controlling local wettability and surface topography, are highlighted for simultaneously attained deterministic patterning and long&#8208;range order. The versatility and robustness of confined capillary liquids are discussed with assembly of single&#8208;crystalline micro&#8208;/nanostructures of organic semiconductors, metal&#8208;halide perovskites, and colloidal&#8208;nanoparticle superlattices, which lead to enhanced device performances and exotic functionalities. Finally, a perspective for promising directions in this realm is provided.

         <title>Fast Ionic Storage in Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion diffusion coefficients are highly related to the size and dimension of tunnels in materials, the radius of various ions, and the coinserted or lattice H2O molecules. Monovalent and divalent ions show significant differences in reaction kinetics in materials for their unique diffusion characteristics. Therefore, comprehensive review and prospects are provided for fast ionic storage in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
The highly dynamic nature of grid&#8208;scale energy systems necessitates fast kinetics in energy storage and conversion systems. Rechargeable aqueous batteries are a promising energy&#8208;storage solution for renewable&#8208;energy grids as the ionic diffusivity in aqueous electrolytes can be up to 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than in organic systems, in addition to being highly safe and low cost. Recent research in this regard has focussed on developing suitable electrode materials for fast ionic storage in aqueous electrolytes. In this review, breakthroughs in the field of fast ionic storage in aqueous battery materials, and 1D/2D/3D and over&#8208;3D&#8208;tunnel materials are summarized, and tunnels in over&#8208;3D materials are not oriented in any direction in particular. Various materials with different tunnel sizes are developed to be suitable for the different ionic radii of Li+, Na+, K+, H+, NH4+, and Zn2+, which show significant differences in the reaction kinetics of ionic storage. New topochemical paths for ion insertion/extraction, which provide superfast ionic storage, are also discussed.

         <title>KTaO3&#8212;The New Kid on the Spintronics Block</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 9, March 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
If a truly multifunctional material with a large spin&#8208;orbit coupling is looked for, it would be hard to beat KTaO3 (KTO). The 2D electron gas housed by KTO&#8208;based thin films and heterostructures exhibits spin&#8208;polarization, ferroelectricity, superconductivity, persistent photocurrent, etc., and provides a platform to realize exotic relativistic quantum particles. Read this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review for all the fascinating details.








Abstract
Long after the heady days of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity, the oxides came back into the limelight in 2004 with the discovery of the 2D electron gas (2DEG) in SrTiO3 (STO) and several heterostructures based on it. Not only do these materials exhibit interesting physics, but they have also opened up new vistas in oxide electronics and spintronics. However, much of the attention has recently shifted to KTaO3 (KTO), a material with all the &#8220;good&#8221; properties of STO (simple cubic structure, high mobility, etc.) but with the additional advantage of a much larger spin&#8208;orbit coupling. In this state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review of the fascinating world of KTO, it is attempted to cover the remarkable progress made, particularly in the last five years. Certain unsolved issues are also indicated, while suggesting future research directions as well as potential applications. The range of physical phenomena associated with the 2DEG trapped at the interfaces of KTO&#8208;based heterostructures include spin polarization, superconductivity, quantum oscillations in the magnetoresistance, spin&#8208;polarized electron transport, persistent photocurrent, Rashba effect, topological Hall effect, and inverse Edelstein Effect. It is aimed to discuss, on a single platform, the various fabrication techniques, the exciting physical properties and future application possibilities of this family of materials.

         <title>Tunable planar focusing based on hyperbolic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Manipulation of the propagation and energy transport characteristics of subwavelength infrared (IR) light fields is critical for the application of nanophotonics devices in photocatalysis, biosensing, and thermal management. In this context, metamaterials are useful composite materials, although traditional metal&#8208;based structures are constrained by their weak mid&#8208;IR response and their optical propagation including focusing is limited by the size of artificial optical structure and poor performance of available active means of control. Herein, a tunable planar focusing device operating in the mid&#8208;IR region was reported by exploiting highly oriented in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3. Specifically, an unprecedented change of effective focal length of polariton waves from 0.7 to 7.4 &#181;m was demonstrated by the following three different means: the dimension of the device, light frequency, and phonon&#8211;plasmon hybridization. The high confinement characteristics of phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 permit the focal length and focal spot size to reduce to 1/15 and 1/33 of the incident wavelength, respectively. In particular, the anisotropic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 were combined with the tunable surface plasmon polaritons in graphene to realize in situ and dynamic control of the focusing performance, thus paving the way for phonon&#8208;polariton&#8208;based planar nanophotonic applications.

         <title>Ultrathin Membranes for Separations: A New Era Driven by Advanced Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrathin membranes are at the forefront of membrane research, offering great opportunities in revolutionizing separations with ultrafast transport. Driven by advanced nanomaterials and manufacturing technology, tremendous progresses have been made over the last fifteen years in the fabrications and applications of sub&#8208;50&#160;nm membranes. Here, an overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultrathin membranes is first introduced, followed by a summary of the fabrication techniques with an emphasis on how to realize such extremely low thickness. Then, different types of ultrathin membranes, categorized based on their structures, i.e., network, laminar or framework structures, are discussed with a focus on the interplays among structure, fabrication methods and separation performances. Recent research and development trends are highlighted. Meanwhile, the performances and applications of current ultrathin membranes for representative separations (gas separation and liquid separation) are thoroughly analyzed and compared. Lastly, the challenges in material design, structure construction and coordination are given, in order to fully realize the potential of ultrathin membranes and facilitate the translation from scientific achievements to industrial productions.

         <title>Microfluidic Oxidation of Graphite in Two Minutes with Capability of Real&#8208;Time Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous flow preparation of graphite oxide and the following post&#8208;treatment are achieved in microchannels, allowing the completion of the oxidization in &#8776;2 min and the capability of on&#8208;line monitoring of the oxidation process with Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Graphite oxide and its exfoliated counterpart, graphene oxide, are important precursors for the large&#8208;scale production of graphene&#8208;based materials and many relevant applications. The current batch&#8208;style preparation of graphite oxide suffers from safety concern, long reaction time, and nonuniform product quality, due to the large volume of reactors and slow energy exchange. Reaction in microchannels can largely enhance the oxidization efficiency of graphite due to the enhanced mass transfer and extremely quick energy exchange, by which the controllable oxidization of graphite is achieved in &#8776;2 min. Comprehensive characterizations show that the graphene oxide obtained through the microfluidic strategy has features like those prepared in laboratory beakers and industrial reactors, yet with the higher oxidization degree and more epoxy groups. More importantly, the microfluidic preparation allows for on&#8208;line monitoring of the oxidization by Raman spectroscopy, ready for the dynamical control of reaction condition and product quality. The capability of continuous preparation is also demonstrated by showing the assembly of fibers and reduction of graphene oxide in microfluidic channels, and the applicability of graphene oxide prepared from the microfluidic strategy for thermally and electrically conductive films.

         <title>Data Mining for Terahertz Generation Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We demonstrate a data mining approach to discover and develop new organic nonlinear optical crystals that produce intense pulses of terahertz radiation. We mine the Cambridge Structural Database for non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials and use this structural data in tandem with density functional theory calculations to predict new materials that efficiently generate terahertz radiation. This enables us to (in a relatively short time) discover, synthesize, and grow large, high&#8208;quality crystals of four promising materials and characterize them for intense terahertz generation. In a direct comparison to the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic terahertz generation crystals, these new materials excel. The discovery and characterization of these novel terahertz generators validates the approach of combining data mining with density functional theory calculations to predict properties of high&#8208;performance organic materials, potentially for a host of exciting applications.

Abstract
Atherosclerosis (AS) is considered one of the primary causes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Unpredictable rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques triggers adverse cardiovascular events such as acute myocardial syndrome (ACS) and even sudden cardiac death (SCD). Therefore, assessing the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques and early intervention are of significant in reducing CVD mortality. Nanomedicine possesses tremendous advantages in achieving the integration of the diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerotic plaques because of its magnetic, optical, thermal, and catalytic properties. Based on the pathological characteristics of vulnerable plaques, stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoplatforms and surface&#8208;functionalized nanoagents have been designed and drawn great attention for accomplishing the precise imaging and treatment of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques due to their superior properties, such as high bioavailability, lesion&#8208;targeting specificity, on&#8208;demand cargo release, and low off&#8208;target damage. Here, we generalize the characteristics of vulnerable plaques, and systematically summarized some targeted strategies for boosting the accuracy of plaque vulnerability evaluation by imaging and the efficacy of plaque stabilization therapy (including antioxidant therapy, macrophage depletion therapy, regulation of lipid metabolism therapy, anti&#8208;inflammation therapy, etc.). In addition, we discuss existing challenges and prospects in this field, and believe it will provide new thinking for the diagnosis and treatment of CVDs in the near future.

         <title>Transferring Liquid Metal to form a Hybrid Solid Electrolyte via a Wettability&#8208;Tuning Technology for Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Integrating solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) into Li metal anodes has demonstrated a great promise to unleash the high energy density of rechargeable Li metal batteries. However, fabricating a highly cyclable SSE/Li metal anode remains a major challenge because densification of SSE is usually incompatible with reactive Li metal. Here, we propose a liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;derived hybrid solid electrolyte (HSE) and report a facile transfer technology to construct artificial HSE on Li metal. By tuning the wettability of transfer substrates, electron&#8208; and ion&#8208; conductive liquid metal was sandwiched between electron&#8208;insulating and ion&#8208;conductive LiF and oxides to form the HSE. The transfer technology renders the HSE continuous, dense, and uniform. The HSE having high ion transport, electron shut&#8208;off, and mechanical strength make the composite anode deliver excellent cyclability for over 4000 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a symmetrical cell. When pairing with LiFePO4 and sulfur cathodes, the HSE&#8208;coated Li metal dramatically enhances the performance of full cells. Therefore, this work demonstrates that tuning the interfacial wetting properties provide an alternative approach to building robust solid electrolyte, which enables high&#8208;efficient Li metal anodes.

Abstract
To achieve high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence satisfying Rec.2020 standard blue gamut, we developed two TADF emitters, 5&#8208;(2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracen&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;10,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[b,e][1,4]azasiline (TDBA&#8208;PAS) and 10&#8208;(2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracen&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (TDBA&#8208;DPAC). Inherited from their parented organoboron multi&#8208;resonance core, both emitters show very promising deep&#8208;blue emissions with relatively narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM, &#8764; 50&#160;nm in solution), high photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 92.3%) and short emission lifetime (&#8804; 2.49 &#956;s) with fast RISC (&gt; 106 s&#8211;1) in doped films. More importantly, replacing the spiro&#8208;centered sp3 C atom (TDBA&#8208;DPAC) with the larger radius sp3 Si atom (TDBA&#8208;PAS), enhanced conformational heterogeneities in bulky group shielded TADF molecules were observed in solution, doped film and device. Consequently, OLEDs based on TDBA&#8208;PAS retain high maximum external quantum efficiencies around 20% with suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off and color index close to Rec.2020 blue gamut over a wide doping range of 10&#8211;50 wt%. This study highlighted a new strategy to restrain spectral broadening and red&#8208;shifting and efficiency roll&#8208;off in the design of deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency ITO&#8208;Free Organic Photovoltaics with Superior Flexibility and Up&#8208;Scalability</title>

Abstract
Developing ITO&#8208;free flexible organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with up&#8208;scaling capacity is of great significance for practical applications of OPVs. Unfortunately, the efficiencies of the corresponding devices lag far behind those of ITO&#8208;based rigid small&#8208;area counterparts. To address this issue, we design and fabricate an advanced device configuration featuring a top&#8208;illuminated structure with ultra&#8208;thin Ag as the transparent electrode. First, a conjugated polyelectrolyte layer, i.e., PCP&#8208;Li, is inserted to effectively connect the bottom Ag anode and the hole transport layer, achieving good photon to electron conversion. Second, charge collecting grids are deposited to suppress the increased resistance loss with the up&#8208;scaling of the device area, realizing almost full retention of device efficiency from 0.06 to 1 cm2. Third, the designed device delivers the best efficiency of 15.56% with the area of 1 cm2 on polyimide (PI) substrate, representing as the record among the ITO&#8208;free, large&#8208;area, flexible OPVs. Interestingly, the device exhibits no degradation after 100,000 bending cycles with a radius of 4&#160;mm, which is the best result for flexible OPVs. This work provides insight into device structure design and optimization for OPVs with high efficiency, low cost, superior flexibility, and up&#8208;scaling capacity, indicating the potential for the future commercialization of OPVs.

         <title>Dative epitaxy of commensurate monocrystalline covalent&#8208;van der Waals moir&#233; supercrystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Realizing van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy in the 80's represents a breakthrough that circumvents the stringent lattice matching and processing compatibility requirements in conventional covalent heteroepitaxy. However, due to the weak vdW interactions, there is little control over film qualities by the substrate. Typically, discrete domains with a spread of misorientation angles are formed, limiting the applicability of vdW epitaxy. Here we report the epitaxial growth of monocrystalline, covalent Cr5Te8 2D crystals on monolayer vdW WSe2 by chemical vapor deposition, driven by interfacial dative bond formation. The lattice of Cr5Te8, with a lateral dimension of a few ten microns, is fully commensurate with that of WSe2 via 3 &#215; 3 (Cr5Te8)/7 &#215; 7 (WSe2) supercell matching, forming a single&#8208;crystalline moir&#233; superlattice. Our work has established a conceptually distinct paradigm of thin film epitaxy termed &#8220;dative epitaxy&#8221;, which takes full advantage of covalent epitaxy with chemical bonding for fixing the atomic registry and crystal orientation, while circumventing its stringent lattice matching and processing compatibility requirements; conversely, it ensures the full flexibility of vdW epitaxy, while avoiding its poor orientation control. Cr5Te8 2D crystals grown by dative epitaxy exhibit square magnetic hysteresis, suggesting minimized interfacial defects that can serve as pinning sites.

Abstract
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) have drawn great attention for promising applications in building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, providing additional power generation for daily uses. The strategy we proposed previously, &#8220;complementary NIR absorption,&#8221; has been widely applied for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs. However, rational material design towards high performance has never been achieved. In this work, an EQE model describing this strategy is developed to explore the full potential of material design on ST&#8208;OPV performance. Guided by the model, we design and synthesize a novel nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), ATT&#8208;9, which possesses optimal bandgap for ST&#8208;OPVs, achieving a record short&#8208;circuit current density of 30&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and a power conversion efficiency of 13.40%, the highest value among devices based on NFAs with bandgaps lower than 1.2&#160;eV. It is noted that at such a low bandgap, the energy loss of the device is only 0.58&#160;eV, which is attributed to the low energetic disorder confirmed by an ultralow Urbach energy of 21.6 meV. Benefiting from the optimal bandgap and low energy loss, ATT&#8208;9&#8208;based ST&#8208;OPV achieves a high light utilization efficiency of 3.33% without optical modulations, and meanwhile shows excellent thermal insulation, exceeding the commercial 3M heat&#8208;insulating window film, demonstrating the outstanding application prospects of multifunctional ST&#8208;OPVs.

         <title>Autonomous Reconstitution of Fractured Hybrid Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The outstanding performance and facile processability turn hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites into one of the most sought&#8208;after class of semiconducting materials for optoelectronics. Yet, their translation into real&#8208;world applications necessitates that challenges with their chemical stability and poor mechanical robustness are first addressed. Here, we report that centimeter&#8208;size single crystals of methylammoniumlead(II) iodide (MAPbI3) are capable of autonomous self&#8208;healing under minimal compression at ambient temperature. When crystals are halved and the fragments and brought in contact, they can readily self&#8208;repair as a result of a liquid&#8208;like behavior in their lattice at the contact surface that leads to a remarkable healing with efficiency of up to 80%. The successful reconstitution of the broken single crystals is reflected in recuperation of their optoelectronic properties. Testing of the healed crystals as photodetectors showed an impressive 74% recovery of the generated photocurrent relative to pristine crystals. This self&#8208;healing capability of MAPbI3 single crystals is an efficient strategy to overcome the poor mechanical properties and low wear resistance of these materials, and paves the way for durable and stable optoelectronic devices based on single crystals of hybrid perovskites.

         <title>Topological Antiferromagnetic Van der Waals Phase in Topological Insulator/Ferromagnet Heterostructures Synthesized by a CMOS&#8208;Compatible Sputtering Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Study of topological magnetic phases formed in topological insulators coupled with a ferromagnet is performed on a high&#8208;quality c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented Bi2Te3 thin film grown using a magnetron sputtering process. A topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase of Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 is revealed in the interface of Bi2Te3 coupled with the ferromagnet, Ni80Fe20. The Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is found to contain Ni&#8722;Te bonds and shows evidence of the formation of the topological AFM compound NiBi2Te4.








Abstract
Breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry by introducing magnetic order, thereby opening a gap in the topological surface state bands, is essential for realizing useful topological properties such as the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. In this work, a novel topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase is created at the interface of a sputtered, c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented, topological insulator/ferromagnet heterostructure&#8212;Bi2Te3/Ni80Fe20 because of diffusion of Ni in Bi2Te3 (Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3). The AFM property of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interfacial layer is established by observation of spontaneous exchange bias in the magnetic hysteresis loop and compensated moments in the depth profile of the magnetization using polarized neutron reflectometry. Analysis of the structural and chemical properties of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is carried out using selected&#8208;area electron diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These studies, in parallel with first&#8208;principles calculations, indicate a solid&#8208;state chemical reaction that leads to the formation of Ni&#8722;Te bonds and the presence of topological antiferromagnetic (AFM) compound NiBi2Te4 in the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 interface layer. The Ne&#233;l temperature of the Ni&#8208;Bi2Te3 layer is &#8776;63 K, which is higher than that of typical magnetic topological insulators (MTIs). The presented results provide a pathway toward industrial complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;process&#8208;compatible sputtered&#8208;MTI heterostructures, leading to novel materials for topological quantum devices.

         <title>An MXene&#8208;Based Metal Anode with Stepped Sodiophilic Gradient Structure Enables a Large Current Density for Rechargeable Na&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deposition&#8208;regulation strategy for Na scaffold is reported to induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of anode. The sodiophilic gradient structure of the new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2&#8208;MXene&#8208;based scaffold significantly improves the affordability for high current density and areal capacity during the charging/discharging process of a Na&#8722;O2 battery.








Abstract
The metal anode is the pivotal component for advanced sodium&#8208;metal batteries such as Na&#8211;O2 batteries. Designing a 3D confinement scaffold is a promising strategy for constructing dendrite&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal anodes; however, cycling stability at a large current density (&gt;10 mA cm&#8722;2) is still difficult to realize. Herein, the design of new lightweight and fibrous hydroxylated Ti3C2 (h&#8208;Ti3C2) MXene based scaffolds with stepped sodiophilic gradient structure (h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG) is reported, and its thickness can be controlled (80&#8722;250&#160;&#181;m). The sodiophilic gradient structure (adjusted by h&#8208;Ti3C2) can effectively induce sodium ions to preferentially deposit at the bottom of the scaffold, thus inhibiting dendrite growth. h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na&#8208;based symmetrical batteries exhibit a low polarization voltage and long cycling life at a high current density (40 mA cm&#8722;2) and a high cut&#8208;off capacity (40 mAh cm&#8722;2). Moreover, a Na&#8211;O2 battery with an h&#8208;M&#8208;SSG/Na anode exhibits a low potential gap of 0.137&#160;V after 45 cycles at 1000 mA g&#8722;1 and 1000 mAh g&#8722;1. This deposition&#8208;regulation strategy would inspire the design of 3D scaffolds for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;metal&#8208;anode&#8208;based batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in soft material chemistry as it relates to direct ink writing and directed assembly through compressive buckling is discussed in relation to advances in 4D fabrication. The discussion focuses on the chemistry of important classes of soft materials, such as gels and elastomers, specifically in ways that allow new possibilities for biomimetic and biologically compliant forms of design.








Abstract
Recent progress in soft material chemistry and enabling methods of 3D and 4D fabrication&#8212;emerging programmable material designs and associated assembly methods for the construction of complex functional structures&#8212;is highlighted. The underlying advances in this science allow the creation of soft material architectures with properties and shapes that programmably vary with time. The ability to control composition from the molecular to the macroscale is highlighted&#8212;most notably through examples that focus on biomimetic and biologically compliant soft materials. Such advances, when coupled with the ability to program material structure and properties across multiple scales via microfabrication, 3D printing, or other assembly techniques, give rise to responsive (4D) architectures. The challenges and prospects for progress in this emerging field in terms of its capacities for integrating chemistry, form, and function are described in the context of exemplary soft material systems demonstrating important but heretofore difficult&#8208;to&#8208;realize biomimetic and biologically compliant behaviors.

         <title>Nanoengineered Neutrophils as a Cellular Sonosensitizer for Visual Sonodynamic Therapy of Malignant Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoengineered neutrophil sonosensitizers are developed for visual sonodynamic therapy (SDT) of solid malignant tumors. Acouscyte/O2 not only has an enhanced multilevel active targeting but also provides oxygen to enhance SDT effects to eliminate tumors, maintain the appearance, and real&#8208;time multimode imaging, which provides a promising theranostic strategy for solid malignant tumors.








Abstract
The rapid evolution of cell&#8208;based theranostics has attracted extensive attention due to their unique advantages in biomedical applications. However, the inherent functions of cells alone cannot meet the needs of malignant tumor treatment. Thus endowing original cells with new characteristics to generate multifunctional living cells may hold a tremendous promise. Here, the nanoengineering method is used to combine customized liposomes with neutrophils, generating oxygen&#8208;carrying sonosensitizer cells with acoustic functions, which are called Acouscyte/O2, for the visual diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Specifically, oxygen&#8208;carried perfluorocarbon and temoporfin are encapsulated into cRGD peptide modified multilayer liposomes (C&#8208;ML/HPT/O2), which are then loaded into live neutrophils to obtain Acouscyte/O2. Acouscyte/O2 can not only carry a large amount of oxygen but also exhibits the ability of long circulation, inflammation&#8208;triggered recruitment, and decomposition. Importantly, Acouscyte/O2 can be selectively accumulated in tumors, effectively enhancing tumor oxygen levels, and triggering anticancer sonodynamics in response to ultrasound stimulation, leading to complete obliteration of tumors and efficient extension of the survival time of tumor&#8208;bearing mice with minimal systemic adverse effects. Meanwhile, the tumors can be monitored in real time by temoporfin&#8208;mediated fluorescence imaging and perfluorocarbon (PFC)&#8208;microbubble&#8208;enhanced ultrasound imaging. Therefore, the nanoengineered neutrophils, i.e., Acouscyte/O2, are a new type of multifunctional cellular drug, which provides a new platform for the diagnosis and sonodynamic therapy of solid malignant tumors.

         <title>Inhaled mRNA Nanoformulation with Biogenic Ribosomal Protein Reverses Established Pulmonary Fibrosis in a Bleomycin&#8208;Induced Murine Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reverse established pulmonary fibrosis, an inhaled nanoformulation is developed with biogenic ribosomal protein for co&#8208;delivering the mRNA of matrix metalloproteinase 13 and keratinocyte growth factor. The nanoformulation&#8208;mediated treatment accelerates the clearance of overwhelming collagen and the alveolar re&#8208;epithelialization in fibrotic foci, which synergistically restores alveolar integrity and improves pulmonary function of the bleomycin&#8208;induced murine model.








Abstract
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a lethal respiratory disease with few treatment options, occurs due to repetitive microinjuries to alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and progresses with an overwhelming deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM), ultimately resulting in fibrotic scars and destroyed the alveolar architecture. Here, an inhaled ribosomal protein&#8208;based mRNA nanoformulation is reported for clearing the intrapulmonary ECM and re&#8208;epithelializing the disrupted alveolar epithelium, thereby reversing established fibrotic foci in IPF. The nanoformulation is sequentially assembled by a ribosomal protein&#8208;condensed mRNA core, a bifunctional peptide&#8208;modified corona and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) with a PEGylated shielding shell. When inhaled via a nebulizer, the nanoformulations carried by microdrops are deposited in the alveoli, and penetrate into fibrotic foci, where the outer KGFs are detached after matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) triggering. The RGD motif&#8208;grafted cores then expose and specifically target the integrin&#8208;elevated cells for the intracellular delivery of mRNA. Notably, repeated inhalation of the nanoformulations accelerates the clearance of locoregional collagen by boosting the intralesional expression of MMP13 and alveolar re&#8208;epithelialization mediated by KGFs, which synergistically ameliorates the lung function of a bleomycin&#8208;induced murine model. Therefore, this work provides an alternative mRNA&#8208;inhalation delivery strategy, which shows great potential for the treatment of IPF.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Switch&#8208;Embedded Organic Photodiode for Capturing Images Against Strong Backlight</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
When the intensity of incident light increases, the photocurrents of organic photodiodes (OPDs) exhibit relatively early saturation, due to which OPDs cannot easily detect objects against strong backlights, such as sunlight. In this study, we address this problem by introducing a light&#8208;intensity&#8208;dependent transition of the operation mode, such that the operation mode of the OPD autonomously changes to overcome early photocurrent saturation as the incident light intensity passes the threshold intensity. The photoactive layer was doped with a strategically designed and synthesized molecular switch, 1,2&#8208;bis&#8208;(2&#8208;methyl&#8208;5&#8208;(4&#8208;cyanobiphenyl)&#8208;3&#8208;thienyl)tetrafluorobenzene (DAB). The proposed OPD exhibits a typical OPD performance with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) &lt;&#160;100% and a photomultiplication behavior with an EQE &gt;&#160;100% under low&#8208;intensity and high&#8208;intensity light illuminations, respectively, thereby resulting in an extension of the photoresponse linearity to a light intensity of 434&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This unique and reversible transition of the operation mode can be explained by the unbalanced quantum yield of photocyclization/photocycloreversion of the molecular switch. The details of the operation mechanism are discussed in conjunction with various photophysical analyses. Furthermore, we establish a prototype image sensor with an array of molecular&#8208;switch&#8208;embedded OPD pixels to demonstrate their extremely high sensitivity against strong light illumination.

         <title>Crystal Growth Regulation of 2D/3D Perovskite Films for Solar Cells with Both High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Reducing the electronic defects in perovskite films has become a substantial challenge to further boost the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. Here, 2D (NpMA)2PbI4 perovskite and 1&#8208;naphthalenemethylammonium iodide (NpMAI) were separately introduced into the PbI2 precursor solutions to regulate the crystal growth in 2D/3D perovskite film using a two&#8208;step deposition method. The (NpMA)2PbI4 modulated perovskite film shows significantly improved film quality with enlarged grain size from &#8764;500&#160;nm to over 1000&#160;nm, which greatly reduce the grain boundary defects, improve the charge carrier lifetime and hinder the ionic diffusion. As a result, the best performing device shows a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.37% for small area (0.10 cm&#8722;2) device and a superior PCE of 22.26% for large area (1.01 cm&#8722;2) device. Importantly, the unencapsulated device shown dramatically improved operational stability with maintained over 98% of its initial efficiency after 1500 h by maximum power point (MPP) tracking under continuous light irradiation.

         <title>Ambipolar Self&#8208;Host Functionalization Accelerates Blue Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence with Internal Quantum Efficiency of 100%</title>

Abstract
Emerging multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters can combine 100% exciton harvesting and high color purity for their organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED). However, highly planar configurations of MR molecules lead to intermolecular interaction induced quenching. A feasible way is integrating host segments into MR molecules, namely &#8220;self&#8208;host&#8221; strategy, but without involving in additional charge transfer and/or vibrational components to excited states. Herein, we firstly demonstrate an ambipolar self&#8208;host featured MR emitter tCBNDADPO, whose ambipolar host segment (DADPO) significantly and comprehensively improves TADF properties, especially greatly accelerated singlet radiative rate constant of 2.11&#215;108 s&#8208;1 and exponentially reduced nonradiative rate constants. Consequently, at the same time of preserving narrowband blue emission with a FWHM of &#8764;28&#160;nm at a high doping concentration of 30%, tCBNDADPO reveals the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies of 99% and 30%, respectively. The corresponding 100% internal quantum efficiency of tCBNDADPO supported by an ultrasimple trilayer and heavily doping device demonstrates the feasibility of ambipolar self&#8208;host strategy for constructing practically applicable MR materials.

         <title>Synergistic Energy Absorption Mechanisms of Architected Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique rate&#8208;dependent energy absorption behavior of architected materials based on liquid crystal elastomers is reported. The synergistic interaction between viscoelastic dissipation and snap&#8208;through buckling causes the energy absorption density to increase with strain rate according to a power&#8208;law relationship and with a number of layers for multilayered structures. The study can contribute to the development of lightweight extreme energy&#8208;absorbing metamaterials.








Abstract
A unique rate&#8208;dependent energy absorption behavior of liquid crystal elastomer (LCE)&#8208;based architected materials is reported. The architected materials consist of repeating unit cells of bistable tilted LCE beams sandwiched between stiff supports. The viscoelastic behavior of the LCE causes the energy absorption to increase with strain rate according to a power&#8208;law relationship, which can be modulated by changing the degree of mesogen alignment and the loading direction relative to the director. For a strain rate of 600 s&#8722;1, the unit cell exhibits up to a 5&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 energy absorption density, which is two orders of magnitude higher than the same structure fabricated from poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer and is comparable to the dissipation from irreversible plastic deformation exhibited by denser metals. For a multilayered structure of unit cells, nonuniform buckling of the different layers produces additional viscoelastic dissipation. This synergistic interaction between viscoelastic dissipation and snap&#8208;through buckling causes the energy absorption density to increase with the number of layers. The sequence of cell collapse can be controlled by grading the beam thickness to further promote viscous dissipation and enhance the energy absorption density. It is envisioned that the study can contribute to the development of lightweight extreme energy&#8208;absorbing metamaterials.

         <title>Electrostatically Driven Polarization Flop and Strain&#8208;Induced Curvature in Free&#8208;Standing Ferroelectric Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic and elastic interactions between the constituent layers in free&#8208;standing ferroelectric superlattices can lead to new polarization arrangements and macroscopic curvature of the sample. In this work, the complex domain structure of ferroelectric microtubes and its response to mechanical deformation is studied using a variety of techniques, paving the way for a combined strain and electrostatic approach to engineering highly responsive materials.








Abstract
The combination of strain and electrostatic engineering in epitaxial heterostructures of ferroelectric oxides offers many possibilities for inducing new phases, complex polar topologies, and enhanced electrical properties. However, the dominant effect of substrate clamping can also limit the electromechanical response and often leaves electrostatics to play a secondary role. Releasing the mechanical constraint imposed by the substrate can not only dramatically alter the balance between elastic and electrostatic forces, enabling them to compete on par with each other, but also activates new mechanical degrees of freedom, such as the macroscopic curvature of the heterostructure. In this work, an electrostatically driven transition from a predominantly out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized to an in&#8208;plane polarized state is observed when a PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattice with a SrRuO3 bottom electrode is released from its substrate. In turn, this polarization rotation modifies the lattice parameter mismatch between the superlattice and the thin SrRuO3 layer, causing the heterostructure to curl up into microtubes. Through a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based scanning X&#8208;ray diffraction imaging, Raman scattering, piezoresponse force microscopy, and scanning transmission electron microscopy, the crystalline structure and domain patterns of the curved superlattices are investigated, revealing a strong anisotropy in the domain structure and a complex mechanism for strain accommodation.

Abstract
Moir&#233; fringe patterns created by stacking different two&#8208;dimensional layered materials as artificial van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have become novel platform to study and engineer optically generated excitonic properties. The moir&#233; patterns contribute to the formation of spatially ordered excitonic states (excitons and trions), which can be used in the quantum simulation of many&#8208;body systems and ensembles of coherent quantum light emitters. The intriguing moir&#233; excitonic properties are affected by and controlled via the interaction with magnetic elements. Here we report a moir&#233; excitonic system interacting with the magnetic elementary excitation of antiferromagnetic orders in MoSe2/MnPS3 vdW heterostructures. We carefully investigated the low&#8208;temperature photoluminescence spectra with additional fine spectral structures on the low&#8208;energy side, which are coupled magnon&#8211;trion peaks below the N&#233;el temperature of MnPS3. The fine spectral structures with long lifetime and coherence time are assigned to intralayer trion&#8211;magnon complexes trapped in the moir&#233; potentials (moir&#233; trion&#8211;magnon complexes). Our findings highlight the emergence of moir&#233; trion&#8211;magnon complexes and provide a new way to explore novel quantum phenomena in moir&#233; excitonic systems with magnetic functionalities.

         <title>Alloying Co Species into Ordered and Interconnected Macroporous Carbon Polyhedra for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Engineering non&#8208;precious transition metal (TM)&#8208;based electrocatalysts to simultaneously achieve an optimal intrinsic activity, high density of active sites and rapid mass transfer ability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, a hybrid composite consisting of FexCo alloy nanoparticles uniformly implanted into hierarchically ordered macro&#8208;/meso&#8208;/microporous N&#8208;doped carbon polyhedra (HOMNCP) was rationally designed in this study. The combined results of experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the alloying of Co enables a favorable electronic structure for the formation of the &#160;OH intermediate, while the periodically trimodal&#8208;porous&#8208;structured carbon matrix structure not only provides highly accessible channels for active site utilization but also dramatically facilitates mass transfer in the catalytic process. As expected, the Fe0.5Co@HOMNCP composite catalyst exhibited extraordinary ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.903&#160;V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), surpassing most Co&#8208;based catalysts reported to date. More remarkably, the use of the Fe0.5Co@HOMNCP catalyst as the air electrode in a zinc&#8211;air battery resulted in superior open&#8208;circuit voltage and power density compared to a commercial Pt/C+IrO2 catalyst. The results of this study are expected to inspire the development of advanced TM&#8208;based catalysts for energy storage and conversion applications.

Abstract
Intercalation chemistry is of great importance in solid&#8208;state physics and chemistry for the ability to modulate electronic structures for constructing new materials with exotic properties. This ancient and versatile discipline has recently become prevailing in the synthesis and regulation of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with atomic thickness due to diverse host&#8208;guest configurations and their impact on the layered frameworks, which bring in extensive applications in electronics, optoelectronics and other energy&#8208;based devices. In order to prepare 2D TMDs materials with desired structure and properties, it is essential to gain in&#8208;depth understanding of the key role the intercalation chemistry plays in the preparation process. In this review, we provide a focused review on recent advances regarding 2D TMDs materials through intercalation exfoliation from the view of host, guest and solvent interactions. We comprehensively review the effect of intercalation chemistry on TMDs nanosheets synthesis and modification. We also try to clarify the interactions between host and guest from the aspects of lattice strain, interlayer distance and carrier density. Finally, a prospectus of the future research opportunities is provided for the intercalation chemistry of 2D materials.

         <title>Integrated Afterglow and Self&#8208;Trapped Exciton Emissions in Hybrid Metal Halides for Anticounterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid metal halides (0D HMHs) are considered to be promising luminescent emitters. 0D HMHs commonly exhibit self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) emissions originating from inorganic metal halide anion units. Exploring and utilizing the emission features of organic cation units in 0D HMHs is highly desired to enrich their optical properties as multifunctional luminescent materials. Here, tunable emissions from organic and inorganic units are successfully achieved in triphenylsulfonium (Ph3S+)&#8208;based 0D HMHs. Notably, the integrated afterglow and STE emissions with adjustable intensities are obtained in (Ph3S)2Sn1&#8208;xTexCl6 (x = 0&#8211;1) via the delicate combination of [SnCl6]2&#8211; and [TeCl6]2&#8211;. Moreover, such a strategy can be readily extended to develop other HMH materials with intriguing optical properties. As a demonstration, 0D (Ph3S)2Zn1&#8208;xMnxCl4 (x = 0&#8211;1) are constructed to achieve integrated afterglow and Mn2+ d&#8208;d emissions with high efficiency. Consequently, these novel 0D HMHs with colorful afterglow and STE emissions have been applied in multiple anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Seed crystal induced cold sintering toward metal halide transparent ceramic scintillators</title>

Abstract
Scintillators with high spatial resolution at a low radiation dose rate are desirable for X&#8208;ray medical imaging. To challenge the state&#8208;of&#8208;art technology, it is necessary to design the large&#8208;area wafers with high light yield, oriented light transport, and reduced light scattering. Here, we adopt a seed crystal induced cold sintering and fabricate a &#706;001&gt;&#8208;textured TPP2MnBr4 (TPP: tetraphenylphosphonium) transparent ceramic with a large&#8208;area wafer of 5&#160;cm in diameter, exhibiting high optical transparency of above 68% over 450&#8211;600&#160;nm range. Compelling scintillation performance of TPP2MnBr4 wafer includes light yield of ca.78000&#160;&#177; 2000 photons per MeV, low detection limit 8.8 nanograys per second, about 625 times lower than the requirement of X&#8208;ray diagnostics (5500 nanograys per second), and energy resolution of 17% for high&#8208;energy &#947;&#8208;rays (662&#160;keV). X&#8208;ray imaging demonstrated a high spatial resolution of 15.7 lp mm&#8211;1. Moreover, the designed material exhibits good retention of the radioluminescence intensity and light yield. This work presented a paradigm for achieving light&#8208;guiding property with high transparency and large&#8208;area fabrication by grain orientation engineering, and we expect the transparent, textured metal halide ceramic scintillator to provide a route for advancement in the X&#8208;ray imaging of tomorrow.

         <title>Atomic short&#8208;range order in a cation&#8208;deficient perovskite anode for fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion batteries</title>

Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;type oxides are widely used for energy conversion and storage, but the rate&#8208;inhibiting phase transition and large volume change hinder the applications of most perovskite&#8208;type oxides for high&#8208;rate electrochemical energy storage. Here, we show that a cation&#8208;deficient perovskite CeNb3O9 (CNO) can store a sufficient amount of lithium at a high charge/discharge rate, even when the sizes of the synthesized particles are on the order of micrometers. At 60 C (15 A g&#8208;1), corresponding to a one&#8208;minute charge, the CNO anode delivered over 52.8 percent of its capacity. In addition, the CNO anode material exhibited 96.6% capacity retention after 2000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles at 50 C (12.5 A g&#8208;1), indicating exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability at high rates. The excellent cycling performance is attributed to the formation of atomic short&#8208;range order which significantly prevents local and long&#8208;range structural rearrangements, stabilizing the host structure and being responsible for the small volume evolution. Moreover, the extremely high rate capacity can be explained by the intrinsically large interstitial sites in multiple directions, intercalation pseudocapacitance, atomic short&#8208;range order and cation vacancy&#8208;enhanced three&#8208;dimensional&#8208;conduction networks for lithium ions. These structural characteristics and mechanisms can be used to design advanced perovskite electrode materials for fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Stretchable, Breathable and Stable Lead&#8208;free Perovskite/Polymer Nanofiber Composite for Hybrid Triboelectric and Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halide perovskite&#8208;based mechanical energy harvesters display excellent electrical output due to their unique ferroelectricity and dielectricity. However, the high toxicity and moisture sensitivity impede their practical applications. Herein, a stretchable, breathable and stable nanofiber composite (LPPS&#8208;NFC) is fabricated through electrospinning of lead&#8208;free perovskite/poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and styrene&#8208;ethylene&#8208;butylene&#8208;styrene. The Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskites serve as efficient electron acceptors and local nucleating agents for the crystallization of polymer chains, thereby enhancing the electron&#8208;trapping capacity and polar crystalline phase in LPPS&#8208;NFC. The excellent energy level matching between Cs3Bi2Br9 and PVDF&#8208;HFP boosts the electron transfer efficiency and reduces the charge loss, thereby promoting the electron&#8208;trapping process. Consequently, this LPPS&#8208;NFC&#8208;based energy harvester displays an excellent electrical output (400&#160;V, 1.63 &#956;A cm&#8722;2, and 2.34 W m&#8722;2), setting a record of the output voltage among halide perovskite&#8208;based nanogenerators. The LPPS&#8208;NFC also exhibits excellent stretchability, waterproofness and breathability, enabling the fabrication of robust wearable devices that convert mechanical energy from different biomechanical motions, into electrical power to drive common electronic devices. The LPPS&#8208;NFC&#8208;based energy harvesters also endure extreme mechanical deformations (washing, folding and crumpling) without performance degradation, and maintain stable electrical output up to five months, demonstrating their promising potential for uses as smart textiles and wearable power sources.

The LPPS-NFC also exhibits excellent stretchability, waterproofness and breathability, enabling the fabrication of robust wearable devices that convert mechanical energy from different biomechanical motions, into electrical power to drive common electronic devices. The LPPS-NFC-based energy harvesters also endure extreme mechanical deformations (washing, folding and crumpling) without performance degradation, and maintain stable electrical output up to five months, demonstrating their promising potential for uses as smart textiles and wearable power sources.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Realization of A Half Metal with a Record&#8208;high Curie Temperature in Perovskite Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Half metal, in which one spin channel is conducting while the other is insulating with an energy gap, are theoretically considered to comprise 100% spin&#8208;polarized conducting electrons, and thus have promising applications in high&#8208;efficiency magnetic sensors, computer memory, magnetic recording and so on. However, for practical applications, a high Curie temperature combined with a wide spin energy gap and large magnetization is required. Realizing such a high&#8208;performance combination is a key challenge. Herein, we report on a novel A&#8208; and B&#8208;site ordered quadruple perovskite oxide LaCu3Fe2Re2O12 with the charge format of Cu2+/Fe3+/Re4.5+. The strong Cu2+(&#8593;)Fe3+(&#8593;)Re4.5+(&#8595;) spin interactions lead to a ferrimagnetic Curie temperature as high as 710 K, which is the reported record in perovskite&#8208;type half metals thus far. The saturated magnetic moment determined at 300 K is 7.0 &#956;B/f.u. and further increases to 8.0 &#956;B/f.u. at 2 K. First&#8208;principles calculations revealed a half&#8208;metallic nature with a spin&#8208;down conducting band while a spin&#8208;up insulating band with a large energy gap up to 2.27&#160;eV. The currently unprecedented realization of record Curie temperature coupling with the wide energy gap and large moment in LaCu3Fe2Re2O12 opens a way for potential applications in advanced spintronic devices at/above room temperature.

         <title>Intrinsic carbon defects induced reversible antimony chemistry for high&#8208;energy aqueous alkaline batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing high&#8208;capacity, dendrite&#8208;free and stable anode materials for robust aqueous alkaline batteries (AABs) is an ongoing challenge. Antimony (Sb) is predicated as an attractive anode material, but it still suffers from low capacity and poor stability caused by the obstructed kinetic behavior and uncontrollable nucleation for SbO2&#8211;. Herein, designing a new rich&#8208;defective carbon skeleton (D&#8208;CS), we realized a highly reversible Sb anode with ultralong cycling stability at practical levels of capacity and high depth of discharge (DOD). The abundant intrinsic carbon defects could effectively form positive charge centers to weaken electrostatic repulsion between SbO2&#8211; and electrode surface, facilitating the fast ion kinetics and provide generous controllable nucleation sites. In addition, the uniform electric field distribution of the D&#8208;CS induces manageable plating and stripping of Sb metal, which effectively boosts its electrochemical reversibility and restrains adverse reactions. Accordingly, the Sb/D&#8208;CS electrode achieves a long cycle life of over 500 h with a capacity of 2 mAh cm&#8211;2. Even at an ultrahigh capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8211;2, it can still work stably up to 40 h. Furthermore, its feasibility as advanced anode in AABs is also confirmed by the assembled Ni//Sb/D&#8208;CS full batteries with an ultrahigh capacity of 13.5 mAh cm&#8211;2 and considerable stability of 4500 cycles.

         <title>Bioinspired, Omnidirectional and Hypersensitive Flexible Strain Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sensors are widely used in various fields, among which flexible strain sensors that can sense minuscule mechanical signals and be easy to adapt to many irregular surfaces are attractive for structure health monitoring, early detections, and failure prevention in humans, machines, or buildings. In practical applications, subtle and abnormal vibrations generated from any direction are highly desired to detect and even orientate their directions initially to eliminate potential hazards. However, it is challenging for flexible strain sensors to achieve hypersensitivity and omnidirectionality simultaneously due to the restrictions of many materials with anisotropic mechanical/electrical properties and some micro/nanostructures they employed. Herein, we reveal that the vision&#8208;degraded scorpion detects subtle vibrations spatially and omnidirectionally using a slit sensillum with fan&#8208;shaped grooves. A bioinspired flexible strain sensor consisting of curved microgrooves arranged around a central circle is devised, exhibiting an unprecedented gauge factor of over 18,000 and stability over 7,000 cycles. It can sense and recognize vibrations of diverse input waveforms at different locations, bouncing behaviors of a free&#8208;falling bead, and human wrist pulses regardless of sensor installation angles. The geometric designs can be translated to other material systems for potential applications including human health monitoring and engineering failure detection.

         <title>Selective Targeting Anchor Strategy Afford Efficient and Stable Ideal Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mixed lead&#8208;tin perovskite solar cells (LTPSCs) with ideal bandgap have been demonstrated as a promising candidate to reach higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than their Pb&#8208;counterparts. Herein, we selected the Br&#8208;free mixed lead&#8208;tin perovskite material, FA0.8MA0.2Pb0.8Sn0.2I3 with a bandgap of 1.33&#160;eV as perovskite absorber. Through DFT calculations and optoelectronic techniques, we demonstrated both Pb&#8208; and Sn&#8208;related A&#8208;site vacancy were pushed into deeper energetic depth, causing severe non&#8208;radiative recombination. Hence, we established selective targeting anchor strategy (STA) that employing phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) and ethylenediamine diiodide (EDAI) as co&#8208;modifier to selectively anchor with Pb&#8208; and Sn&#8208;related active site and passivate bimetallic traps, respectively. Furthermore, selectivity of molecular oriented anchor passivation was demonstrated through energetic depth specificity of Pb&#8208; and Sn&#8208;related traps. As a result, a substantially enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) from 0.79&#160;V to 0.90V&#160;for the LTPSCs has been achieved, yielding a champion PCE of 22.51%, which is the highest PCE among the reported ideal bandgap PSCs. The VOC loss has been reduced to 0.43&#160;V.

         <title>Boosting energy efficiency and stability of Li&#8208;CO2 battery via synergy between Ru atom cluster and single atom Ru&#8208;N4 site in electrocatalyst cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Li&#8208;CO2 battery is a novel strategy for CO2 capture and energy storage applications. However, the sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution reactions cause large overpotential and poor cycling performance. Herein, we fabricate a new catalyst containing well defined ruthenium atomic cluster (RuAC) and single atom Ru&#8208;N4 (RuSA) composite sites on carbon nanobox substrate (RuAC+SA@NCB), by utilizing the different complexation effects between Ru cation and amine group (&#8208;NH2) on carbon quantum dots (CQDs) or nitrogen moieties on NCB. Systematic experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate the vital role of electronic synergy between RuAC and Ru&#8208;N4 in improving the electrocatalytic activity toward CO2ER and CO2RR. The electronic properties of Ru&#8208;N4 sites are essentially modulated by the adjacent RuAC species, which optimize the interactions with key reaction intermediates thereby reduce the energy barriers in the rate&#8208;determining steps of CO2RR and CO2ER. Remarkably, the RuAC+SA@NCB based cell displays unprecedented overpotentials as low as 1.65 and 1.86&#160;V at ultrahigh rates of 1 and 2 A g&#8211;1, and two&#8208;fold cycling lifespan than the baselines. The findings provide a novel strategy to construct catalysts with composite active sites comprising multiple atom assemblies for high&#8208;perform metal&#8208;CO2 batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery is a novel strategy for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture and energy storage applications. However, the sluggish CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and evolution reactions cause large overpotential and poor cycling performance. Herein, we fabricate a new catalyst containing well defined ruthenium atomic cluster (Ru&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt;) and single atom Ru-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Ru&lt;sub&gt;SA&lt;/sub&gt;) composite sites on carbon nanobox substrate (Ru&lt;sub&gt;AC+SA&lt;/sub&gt;@NCB), by utilizing the different complexation effects between Ru cation and amine group (-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on carbon quantum dots (CQDs) or nitrogen moieties on NCB. Systematic experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate the vital role of electronic synergy between Ru&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt; and Ru-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in improving the electrocatalytic activity toward CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. The electronic properties of Ru-N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites are essentially modulated by the adjacent Ru&lt;sub&gt;AC&lt;/sub&gt; species, which optimize the interactions with key reaction intermediates thereby reduce the energy barriers in the rate-determining steps of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER. Remarkably, the Ru&lt;sub&gt;AC+SA&lt;/sub&gt;@NCB based cell displays unprecedented overpotentials as low as 1.65 and 1.86&#160;V at ultrahigh rates of 1 and 2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and two-fold cycling lifespan than the baselines. The findings provide a novel strategy to construct catalysts with composite active sites comprising multiple atom assemblies for high-perform metal-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Controlled Crystal Plane Orientations in ZnO Transport Layer enables High Responsivity, Low Dark Current Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQD) have emerged as attractive materials for infrared (IR) photodetector applications because of their tunable bandgaps and facile processing. Presently, zinc oxide is the electron transport layer (ETL) of choice in CQD photodetectors; however, ZnO relies on continuous ultraviolet (UV) illumination to remove adsorbed oxygen and maintain high external quantum efficiency, speed, and photocurrent. Here we show that ZnO is dominated by electropositive crystal planes which favor excessive oxygen adsorption, and that this leads to a high density of trap states, an undesired shift in band alignment, and consequent poor performance. Over prolonged operation without UV exposure, oxygen accumulates at the electropositive planes, trapping holes and degrading performance. We address this problem by developing an electroneutral plane composition at the ZnO surface, aided by atomic layer deposition (ALD) as the means of materials processing. We find that ALD ZnO has 10x lower binding energy for oxygen than does conventionally deposited ZnO. IR CQD photodetectors made with this ETL do not require UV activation to maintain low dark current and high EQE.

         <title>Unblocked Electron Channels Enable Efficient Contact Prelithiation for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The isolation of electron channels leads to a low Li source utilization for contact prelithiation, and the resultant &#8220;dead Li&#8221; greatly degrades battery performance. Creating more electron channels at the Li source/anode interface not only dissipates the local current density to stabilize the electron channels, but also promotes the reaction kinetics, thus supporting an improved Li utilization for contact prelithiation.








Abstract
Contact prelithiation is strongly considered for compensating the initial capacity loss of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, exhibiting great potential for ultralong cycle life of working batteries and the application of large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage systems. However, the utilization of the sacrificial Li source for contact prelithiation is low (&lt;65%). Herein the fundamental mechanism of contact prelithiation is described from the perspective of the Li source/anode interfaces by regulating the initial contact state, and a clear illustration of the pathogeny for capacity attenuation is successfully delivered. Specifically, creating plentiful electron channels is an access to making contact prelithiation with a higher Li utilization, as the mitigated local current density that reduces the etching of Li dissolution and SEI extension on electron channels. A vacuum thermal evaporation for depositing the Li film enables the contact interface to possess an adequate electron channel construction, rendering a Li utilization of 91.0%, and the dead Li yield is significantly reduced in a working battery.

         <title>High Performance Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence with Simultaneous Narrowband Emission, High Efficiency and Large Dissymmetry Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that can simultaneously achieve narrowband emission, high efficiency, and circularly polarized luminescence remain a formidable challenge. In this study, a simple strategy was developed to address this challenge. A chiral exciplex&#8208;forming co&#8208;host was first designed by employing a chiral donor and an achiral acceptor molecule. The chiral exciplex host enables an achiral green multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter to achieve high&#8208;performance circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) with a high external quantum efficiency of 33.2%, large electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of 2.8 &#215; 10&#8211;3, and a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 42&#160;nm. This work provides a general approach for realizing CP&#8208;EL using easily available achiral emitters and can significantly extend the scope of CP&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>A Quadri&#8208;Dimensional Manipulable Laser with an Intrinsic Chiral Photoswitch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quadri&#8208;dimensional manipulable laser emission with optically dynamic controllable wavelength, wavefront, spin, and orbital angular momentum is achieved, enabled by an intrinsic chiral photoswitch with excellent thermal stability and fatigue&#8208;resistance, thereby exploiting a new way toward information encoding, security imprinting, and integrated photonics.








Abstract
Dynamic and multi&#8208;dimensional manipulation of laser emission with light allows for optical coding, computing, and imaging photonic chips. However, the coupling balance between photonic resonance and transmission is a formidable challenge due to the uncontrollable chiral microcavity with photo&#8208;reversibility, which is limited to the multi&#8208;freedom of the laser with sustainable and repeatable output beams. Herein, a helical superstructure system with a unique intrinsic chiral photoswitch is developed for resolving the always pendent problems on organized defects in the microcavity. The unique intrinsic chirality based on the photoswitchable system allows laser emission with a sharp and narrow band&#8208;width, with both remarkable thermodynamic stability and robust fatigue&#8208;resistance. A quadri&#8208;dimensional manipulable laser, featuring wavelength&#8208;tunability, wavefront&#8208;shaping, spin angular momentum (SAM), and orbital angular momentum (OAM), is successfully established with the assistance of the photoresponsive intrinsic chiral superstructure with photoreversibility. This technology marks an important milestone, and sketches a future framework for the realms of nanophotonic information encoding, security imprinting, and integrated photonics.

         <title>Folding and Fracture of Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene Grown on a Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly oriented and long graphene folds are spontaneously formed in chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition (CVD)&#8208;grown single&#8208;crystal graphene film on a Cu(111) foil surface, and this is triggered by the formation of highly ordered bunched Cu steps under the graphene. Such folds are fractured into &#8220;back&#8208;and&#8208;forth&#8221; subfold patterns at bunched Cu step edge regions, with cracks propagating along zigzag or armchair directions.








Abstract
A single&#8208;crystal graphene film grown on a Cu(111) foil by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has ribbon&#8208;like fold structures. These graphene folds are highly oriented and essentially parallel to each other. Cu surface steps underneath the graphene are along the &lt;110&gt;&#160;and &lt;211&gt;&#160;directions, leading to the formation of the arrays of folds. The folds in the single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) are not continuous but break up into alternating patterns. A &#8220;joint&#8221; (an AB&#8208;stacked bilayer graphene) region connects two neighboring alternating regions, and the breaks are always along zigzag or armchair directions. Folds formed in bilayer or few&#8208;layer graphene are continuous with no breaks. Molecular dynamics simulations show that SLG suffers a significantly higher compressive stress compared to bilayer graphene when both are under the same compression, thus leading to the rupture of SLG in these fold regions. The fracture strength of a CVD&#8208;grown single&#8208;crystal SLG film is simulated to be about 70&#160;GPa. This study greatly deepens the understanding of the mechanics of CVD&#8208;grown single&#8208;crystal graphene and such folds, and sheds light on the fabrication of various graphene origami/kirigami structures by substrate engineering. Such oriented folds can be used in a variety of further studies.

The fracture strength of a CVD-grown single-crystal SLG film is simulated to be about 70&#160;GPa. This study greatly deepens the understanding of the mechanics of CVD-grown single-crystal graphene and such folds, and sheds light on the fabrication of various graphene origami/kirigami structures by substrate engineering. Such oriented folds can be used in a variety of further studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Library of ROS&#8208;Catalytic Metalloenzyme Mimics with Atomic Metal Centers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;catalytic metalloenzyme mimics with 20 different types of atomic metal centers is synthesized to compare and disclose the catalytic activities, substrate selectivities, kinetics, and ROS products. These prepared biocatalysts not only show remarkably high ROS&#8208;catalytic performances but also clearly reveal that the catalytic paths and activities are highly related to the electronic structures of metal centers.








Abstract
Metal&#63743;N&#8208;coordinated centers supported by carbonaceous substrates have emerged as promising artificial metalloenzymes (AMEs) to mimic the biocatalytic effects of their natural counterparts. However, the synthesis of well&#8208;defined AMEs that contain different atomic metal&#63743;N centers but present similar physicochemical and coordination structures remains a substantial challenge. Here, 20 different types of AMEs with similar geometries and well&#8208;defined atomic metal&#63743;N&#8208;coordinated centers are synthesized to compare and disclose the catalytic activities, substrate selectivities, kinetics, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) products. Their oxidase (OXD)&#8208;, peroxidase (POD)&#8208;, and halogen peroxidase (HPO)&#8208;mimetic catalytic behaviors are systematically explored. The Fe&#8208;AME shows the highest OXD&#8208; and HPO&#8208;mimetic activities compared to the other AMEs due to its high vmax (0.927&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;6 m s&#8722;1) and low Km (1.070&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m), while the Cu&#8208;AME displays the best POD&#8208;like performance. Furthermore, theoretical calculation reveals that the ROS&#8208;catalytic paths and activities are highly related to the electronic structures of the metal centers. Benefiting from its facile adsorption of H2O2 molecule and lower energy barrier to generating &#8226;O2&#8722;, the Fe&#8208;AME displays higher ROS&#8208;catalytic performances than the Mn&#8208;AME. The engineered AMEs show not only remarkably high ROS&#8208;catalytic performances but also provide new guidance toward developing metal&#63743;N&#8208;coordinated biocatalysts for broad application fields.

         <title>Prussian Blue Nanozyme as a Pyroptosis Inhibitor Alleviates Neurodegeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the excellent intrinsic reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging properties, intra&#8208;cerebroventricular injection of Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) reduces the production of mitochondrial ROS induced by 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), inhibits the activation of microglial nucleotide&#8208;binding domain and leucine&#8208;rich repeat family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and downstream pyroptosis of microglia, and further rescues the loss of dopaminergic neurons in MPTP&#8208;induced cell and mouse models of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Current pharmacological interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) remain unsatisfactory in clinical settings. Inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis represents a potential therapeutic target for the alleviation of neurodegenerative diseases. The development of inflammasome&#8208;mediated pyroptosis agonists or antagonists may transform the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the identification of specific compounds that inhibit pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, Prussian blue nanozyme (PBzyme) is revealed as a pyroptosis inhibitor to alleviate the neurodegeneration in mouse and cell models of PD. PBzyme protects the microglia and neurons against 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;4&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1,2,3,6&#8208;tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). PBzyme alleviates motor deficits, attenuates the damage of mitochondrial membrane potential, and rescues dopaminergic neurons. Furthermore, intra&#8208;cerebroventricular injection of PBzyme reduces dopaminergic degeneration and inhibits neuroinflammation in an MPTP&#8208;induced PD mouse model. Both in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate that PBzyme reduces the activation of microglial nucleotide&#8208;binding domain and leucine&#8208;rich repeat family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes and caspase&#8208;1 by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thereby downregulating gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage as well as inflammatory factor production, and eventually leading to the inhibition of microglia pyroptosis. Overall, this work highlights the neuroprotective effects of PBzyme as a pyroptosis inhibitor and provides valuable mechanistic insights and a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.

         <title>2D Covalent Organic Frameworks: From Synthetic Strategies to Advanced Optical&#8208;Electrical&#8208;Magnetic Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the synthesis of 2D COF powders, single crystals, and thin films, as well as their advanced optical, electrical, and magnetic functionalities are systematically summarized. The challenging issues and potential opportunities are also proposed for further inspiring their development in structure, synthesis, and functionalities.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), an emerging class of organic crystalline polymers with highly oriented structures and permanent porosity, can adopt 2D or 3D architectures depending on the different topological diagrams of the monomers. Notably, 2D COFs have particularly gained much attention due to the extraordinary merits of their extended in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugation and topologically ordered columnar &#960;&#8208;arrays. These properties together with high crystallinity, large surface area, and tunable porosity distinguish 2D COFs as an ideal candidate for the fabrication of functional materials. Herein, this review surveys the recent research advances in 2D COFs with special emphasis on the preparation of 2D COF powders, single crystals, and thin films, as well as their advanced optical, electrical, and magnetic functionalities. Some challenging issues and potential research outlook for 2D COFs are also provided for promoting their development in terms of structure, synthesis, and functionalities.

         <title>Harnessing Plasma&#8208;Assisted Doping Engineering to Stabilize Metallic Phase MoSe2 for Fast and Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adopting a novel plasma&#8208;assisted doping&#8208;triggered phase&#8208;transition engineering, stabilized P&#8208;doped metallic phase selenide molybdenum (MoSe2) nanoflower composites (P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs) with expanded interlayer spacing, metallic electronic conductivity, facilitated Na+ adsorption, and reduced Na+ diffusion barrier are fabricated for high&#8208;performance sodium storage. The underlying mechanism analysis provides informative guide for designing advanced materials for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.








Abstract
Metallic&#8208;phase selenide molybdenum (1T&#8208;MoSe2) has become a rising star for sodium storage in comparison with its semiconductor phase (2H&#8208;MoSe2) owing to the intrinsic metallic electronic conductivity and unimpeded Na+ diffusion structure. However, the thermodynamically unstable nature of 1T phase renders it an unprecedented challenge to realize its phase control and stabilization. Herein, a plasma&#8208;assisted P&#8208;doping&#8208;triggered phase&#8208;transition engineering is proposed to synthesize stabilized P&#8208;doped 1T phase MoSe2 nanoflower composites (P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs). Mechanism analysis reveals significantly decreased phase&#8208;transition energy barriers of the plasma&#8208;induced Se&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich MoSe2 from 2H to 1T owing to its low crystallinity and reduced structure stability. The vacancy&#8208;rich structure promotes highly concentrated P doping, which manipulates the electronic structure of the MoSe2 and urges its phase transition, acquiring a high transition efficiency of 91% accompanied with ultrahigh phase stability. As a result, the P&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2 NFs deliver an exceptional high reversible capacity of 510.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with no capacity fading over 1000 cycles at 5000&#160;mA g&#8722;1 for sodium storage. The underlying mechanism of this phase&#8208;transition engineering verified by profound analysis provides informative guide for designing advanced materials for next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>A 3D Hierarchical Host with Enhanced Sodiophilicity Enabling Anode&#8208;Free Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically porous carbon particles with open channels allow rapid Na&#8208;ion flux, and evenly distributed carbon&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles on the carbon surface induce uniform Na deposition owing to the enhanced Na binding energy. The hierarchical host enables superior cycling performance as Na&#8208;metal anodes under extremely high current conditions as well as demonstration of anode&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered as a compliment to lithium&#8208;metal batteries for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries because of their low cost and the abundance of sodium (Na). Herein, a 3D nanostructured porous carbon particle containing carbon&#8208;shell&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles (PC&#8208;CFe) is employed as a highly reversible Na&#8208;metal host. PC&#8208;CFe has a unique 3D hierarchy based on sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized carbon particles, ordered open channels, and evenly distributed carbon&#8208;coated Fe nanoparticles (CFe) on the surface. PC&#8208;CFe achieves high reversibility of Na plating/stripping processes over 500 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 with 10 mAh cm&#8211;2 in Na//Cu asymmetric cells, as well as over 14&#160;400 cycles at 60&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in Na//Na symmetric cells. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the superior cycling performance of PC&#8208;CFe stems from the stronger adsorption of Na on the surface of the CFe, providing initial nucleation sites more favorable to Na deposition. Moreover, the full cell with a PC&#8208;CFe host without Na metal and a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (10&#160;mg cm&#8211;2) maintains a high capacity of 103 mAh g&#8211;1 at 1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 even after 100 cycles, demonstrating the operation of anode&#8208;free SMBs.

         <title>Biobased Elastomer Nanofibers Guide Light&#8208;controlled Human iPSC&#8208;derived Skeletal Myofibers</title>

Abstract
Generating skeletal muscle tissue which mimics the cellular alignment, maturation and function of native skeletal muscle is an ongoing challenge in disease modelling and regenerative therapies. Skeletal muscle cultures require extracellular guidance and mechanical support to stabilize contractile myofibers. Existing microfabrication&#8208;based solutions are limited by complex fabrication steps, low throughput, and challenges in measuring dynamic contractile function. Here we present the synthesis and characterization of a new biobased nanohybrid elastomer which is electrospun into aligned nanofiber sheets to mimic the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix. The polymer exhibits remarkable hyperelasticity well&#8208;matched to that of native skeletal muscle (&#8764;11&#8208;50&#160;kPa), with ultimate strain &#8764;1000% and elastic modulus &#8764;25kPa.&#160;Uniaxially aligned nanofibers guide myoblast alignment, enhance sarcomere formation, promote a &#8764;32% increase in myotube fusion and &#8764;50% increase in myofiber maturation. The elastomer nanofibers stabilize optogenetically&#8208;controlled human induced pluripotent stem cell&#8208;derived skeletal myofibers. When activated by blue light, the myofiber&#8208;nanofiber hybrid constructs maintain a significantly higher (&gt; 200%) contraction velocity and specific force (&gt; 280%) compared to conventional culture methods. The engineered myofibers exhibit a power density of &#8764;35W m&#8722;3. This system is a promising new skeletal muscle tissue model for applications in muscular disease modelling, drug discovery and muscle regeneration.

         <title>Searching for an Optimal Multi&#8208;metallic Alloy Catalyst by Active Learning Combined with Experiments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Searching for an optimal component and composition of multi&#8208;metallic alloy catalysts, comprising two or more elements, is one of the key issues in catalysis research. Due to the exhaustive data requirement of conventional machine learning (ML) models and the high cost of experimental trials, current approaches rely mainly on the combination of density functional theory (DFT) and ML techniques. In this study, a significant step was taken toward overcoming limitations by the interplay of experiment and active learning to effectively search for an optimal component and composition of multi&#8208;metallic alloy catalysts. The active learning model is iteratively updated using by examining electro&#8208;catalytic performance of fabricated solid&#8208;solution nanoparticles for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). An optimal metal precursor composition of Pt0.65Ru0.30Ni0.05 exhibited an HER overpotential of 54.2&#160;mV, which is superior to that of a pure Pt catalyst. This result indicates the successful construction of the model by only utilizing the precursor mixture composition as input data, thereby improving the overpotential by searching for an optimal catalyst. This method appears to be widely applicable since it was able to determine an optimal component and composition of electrocatalyst without obvious restriction to the types of catalysts to which it can be applied.

         <title>Highly Efficient Cellular Acoustic Absorber of Graphene Ultrathin Drums</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient acoustic absorber is realized by integrating ultrathin graphene membranes into commercial polymer sponges, to fulfill the outstanding resonance properties of 2D graphene sheets in acoustic absorption and satisfy the urgent demands in acoustic absorption from noise protection, instruments to building design, and acoustic devices.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D graphene sheets exhibit unparalleled in&#8208;plane stiffness and large out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elasticity, thereby providing strong mechanical resonance for nanomechanical devices. The exceptional resonance behavior of ultrathin graphene, which promises the fabrication of superior acoustic absorption materials, however, remains unfulfilled for the lack of applicable form and assembly methods. Here, a highly efficient acoustic absorber is presented, wherein cellular networks of ultrathin graphene membranes are constructed into polymer foams. The ultrathin graphene drums exhibit strong resonances and efficiently dissipate sound waves in a broad frequency range. A record specific noise reduction coefficient (51.3 at 30&#160;mm) is achieved in the graphene&#8208;based acoustic absorber, fully realizing the superior resonance properties of graphene sheets. The scalable method facilely transforms commercial polymer foams to superior acoustic absorbers with a &#8776;320% enhancement in average absorption coefficient across wide frequencies from 200 to 6000&#160;Hz. The graphene acoustic absorber offers a convenient method to exploit the extraordinary resonance properties of 2D sheets, opening extensive new applications in noise protection, building design, instruments and acoustic devices.

         <title>Mulberry Leaves Derived Red Emissive Carbon Dots for Feeding Silkworms to Produce Brightly Fluorescent Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fluorescent silk has promising applications in dazzling textiles, biological engineering and medical products, but the natural bombyx mori silk has almost no fluorescence. Here carbon dots (CDs) made from mulberry leaves are reported, which have a strong near infrared fluorescence with absolute quantum yield (QY) of 73% and a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 20&#160;nm. After feeding with such CDs, silkworms exhibit bright red fluorescence, grow healthily, cocoon normally and turn to moths finally. The cocoons are pink in daylight and show bright red fluorescence under ultraviolet (UV) light. After breaking out of such cocoons, the red emissive moths can mate and lay fluorescent eggs which would hatch normally. The growth cycle of the second generation of the test silkworm is the same as that of the control group, which means such CDs have excellent biocompatiblility. Dissection and analyses on both the test silkworms and cocoons disclose the metabolic route of CDs, i.e., the fluorescent CDs are absorbed by silkworms from alimentary canals, then transferred to silk glands, and finally to cocoons, while those unabsorbed CDs are excreted with the feces. All experimental results confirm the excellent biocompatibility and fluorescence stability of such CDs.

         <title>A gradient pH&#8208;sensitive polymer&#8208;based antiviral strategy via viroporin&#8208;induced membrane acidification</title>

Abstract
Recently, lipid membrane&#8208;targeting strategies hold great promise for development of broad&#8208;spectrum antivirals. However, it remains a big challenge to identify novel membrane&#8208;based targets of viruses and virus&#8208;infected cells for development of precision targeted approaches. Here, we discover that viroporins, viral&#8208;encoded ion channels which have been reported to mediate release of hydrogen ions, trigger membrane acidification of virus&#8208;infected cells. Through development of a fine&#8208;scale library of gradient pH&#8208;sensitive (GPS) polymeric nanoprobes, we measure the cellular membrane pH transition from pH 6.8&#8208;7.1 (un&#8208;infection) to pH 6.5&#8208;6.8 (virus&#8208;infection). In response to the subtle pH alterations, the GPS polymer with sharp response at pH 6.8 (GPS6.8) selectively binds to virus&#8208;infected cell membranes or viral envelope, and even completely disrupts viral envelope. Accordingly, GPS6.8 treatment exerts suppressive effects on a wide variety of viruses including SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 through triggering viral envelope lysis rather than affecting immune pathway or viability of host cells. Murine viral infection models exhibit that supplementation of GPS6.8 decreases viral titers and ameliorates inflammatory damage. Thus, the gradient pH&#8208;sensitive nanotechnology offers a promising strategy for accurate detection of biological pH environments and robust interference with viruses.

&lt;p&gt;Recently, lipid membrane-targeting strategies hold great promise for development of broad-spectrum antivirals. However, it remains a big challenge to identify novel membrane-based targets of viruses and virus-infected cells for development of precision targeted approaches. Here, we discover that viroporins, viral-encoded ion channels which have been reported to mediate release of hydrogen ions, trigger membrane acidification of virus-infected cells. Through development of a fine-scale library of gradient pH-sensitive (GPS) polymeric nanoprobes, we measure the cellular membrane pH transition from pH 6.8-7.1 (un-infection) to pH 6.5-6.8 (virus-infection). In response to the subtle pH alterations, the GPS polymer with sharp response at pH 6.8 (GPS&lt;sub&gt;6.8&lt;/sub&gt;) selectively binds to virus-infected cell membranes or viral envelope, and even completely disrupts viral envelope.

         <title>Patterning of Wafer&#8208;scale MXene Films for High&#8208;performance Image Sensor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As a rapidly growing family of two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, MXenes have been recognized as promising materials for the development of future electronics and optoelectronics. So far, the reported patterning methods for MXene films lack efficiency, resolution and compatibility, resulting in limited device integration and performance. Here we report a high&#8208;performance MXene image sensor array fabricated by a wafer&#8208;scale combination patterning method of a MXene film. This method combines MXene centrifugation, spin&#8208;coating, photolithography and dry&#8208;etching and is highly compatible with mainstream semiconductor processing, with a resolution up to 2&#160;&#956;m, which is at least 100 times higher than other large&#8208;area patterning methods reported previously. As a result, we fabricated a high&#8208;density integrated array of 1024&#8208;pixel Ti3C2Tx/Si photodetectors with a detectivity of 7.73 &#215; 1014 Jones and a light&#8208;dark current ratio (Ilight/Idark) of 6.22 &#215; 106, which is the ultrahigh value among all reported MXene&#8208;based photodetectors. This patterning technique paves a way for large&#8208;scale high&#8208;performance MXetronics compatible with mainstream semiconductor processes.

         <title>Ultrahigh Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Efficiency and Selectivity Manipulation by Single&#8208;Tungsten&#8208;Atom Oxide at the Atomic Step of TiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a sustainable route to the direct conversion of greenhouse gases into chemicals without additional energy consumption. Given the vast amount of greenhouse gas, numerous efforts have been devoted to developing inorganic photocatalysts, e.g., titanium dioxide (TiO2), due to their stability, low cost and environmentally friendly properties. However, a more efficient TiO2 photocatalyst without noble metals is highly desirable for CO2 reduction, and it is both difficult and urgent to produce selectively valuable compounds, including industrial chemicals and fuels, from TiO2. Here, we develop a novel &#8220;single&#8208;atom site at the atomic step&#8221; strategy by anchoring a single tungsten (W) atom site with oxygen&#8208;coordination at the intrinsic steps of classic TiO2 nanoparticle. The composition of active sites for CO2RR can be controlled by tuning the additional W5+, resulting in both significant CO2 reduction efficiency and selectivity for methane (CH4) over carbon monoxide (CO). The W5+&#8208;O&#8208;Ti3+&#8208;anchored catalysts achieved an ultrahigh photocatalytic CH4 production rate of 60.6 &#956;mol/g/h (86.5% selectivity), while the Ti3+&#8208;dominated catalysts achieved a CO production rate of 182.1 &#956;mol/g/h (88.2% selectivity); both exceed those of pristine TiO2 by more than one order of magnitude. The mechanism relies on the accurate control of the single&#8208;atom sites at step with 22.8% coverage of surface sites and the subsequent excellent electron&#8208;hole separation along with the favorable adsorption&#8208;desorption of intermediates at the sites. This approach not only provides a novel strategy for fabricating single inorganic catalytic sites with superior performance but also identifies the rational design mechanisms of efficient sites that can promote controllable production.

         <title>Engineering Macrophage Exosome Disguised Biodegradable Nanoplatform for Enhanced Sonodynamic Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biodegradable glioblastoma&#8208;tumor&#8208;targeted delivery system CSI@Ex&#8208;A is successfully fabricated for enhanced sonodynamic therapy. The AS1411 engineered macrophage exosome endows CSI@Ex&#8208;A with efficient BBB penetration and good cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting capability. The GSH depletion and O2&#8208;self&#8208;supplying enhanced sonodynamic therapy is achieved.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) exhibits high tissue penetration and negligible radiation damage to normal tissues, and thus emerges as a promising cancer therapeutic modality for glioblastoma (GBM). However, the blood&#8722;brain barrier (BBB) and hypoxic microenvironment greatly limit the SDT efficiency. In this work, a biodegradable nanoplatform (termed as CSI) is fabricated by encapsulating catalase (CAT) into silica nanoparticles (CAT@SiO2) for tumor hypoxia relief, and then loaded with the sonosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG). Inspired by the ability of macrophages to cross the BBB, CSI is further coated with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;modified macrophage exosomes to form CSI@Ex&#8208;A, which possesses efficient BBB penetration and good cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting capability. After tumor cell endocytosis, highly expressed glutathione (GSH) triggeres biodegradation of the nanoplatform and the released CAT catalyzes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia. The GSH depletion and O2 self&#8208;supplying effectively enhances the SDT efficiency both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the resulting CSI@Ex&#8208;A exhibits good biocompatibility and long circulation time. These findings demonstrate that CSI@Ex&#8208;A may serve as a competent nanoplatform for GBM therapy, with potential for clinical translation.

         <title>A High&#8208;Efficiency Mo2C Electrocatalyst Promoting the Polysulfide Redox Kinetics for Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient electrocatalytic conversion and adsorption of polysulfides are realized by combining a metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived porous carbon structure and introducing a conductive catalyst Mo2C. The synergistic effect of physical confinement and electrocatalysis improves the utilization rate and stability of S. It shows the excellent rate performance (483 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycle life (503 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 after 800 cycles).








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries, as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage candidates, are drawing more and more attention due to the high energy density and abundant elements reserved in the earth. However, the native downsides of RT Na&#8208;S batteries (i.e., enormous volume changes, the polysulfide shuttle, and the insulation and low reactivity of S) impede their further application. To conquer these challenges, hierarchical porous hollow carbon polyhedrons embedded with uniform Mo2C nanoparticles are designed deliberately as the host for S. The micro&#8208; and&#160;mesoporous hollow carbon indeed dramatically enhances the reactivity of the S cathodes and&#160;accommodates the volume changes. Meanwhile, the highly conductive dispersed Mo2C has a strong chemical adsorption to polysulfides and catalyzes the transformation of polysulfides, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides and accelerate the reaction kinetics. Thus, the as&#8208;prepared S cathode can display a high reversible capacity (1098 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 120 cycles) and superior rate performance (483 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.0 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a new method to boost the performance of RT Na&#8211;S batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Efficient electrocatalytic conversion and adsorption of polysulfides are realized by combining a metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF)-derived porous carbon structure and introducing a conductive catalyst Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C. The synergistic effect of physical confinement and electrocatalysis improves the utilization rate and stability of S. It shows the excellent rate performance (483 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and ultralong cycle life (503 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 800 cycles).

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Room-temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries, as promising next-generation energy storage candidates, are drawing more and more attention due to the high energy density and abundant elements reserved in the earth. However, the native downsides of RT Na-S batteries (i.e., enormous volume changes, the polysulfide shuttle, and the insulation and low reactivity of S) impede their further application. To conquer these challenges, hierarchical porous hollow carbon polyhedrons embedded with uniform Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C nanoparticles are designed deliberately as the host for S. The micro- and&#160;mesoporous hollow carbon indeed dramatically enhances the reactivity of the S cathodes and&#160;accommodates the volume changes. Meanwhile, the highly conductive dispersed Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C has a strong chemical adsorption to polysulfides and catalyzes the transformation of polysulfides, which can effectively inhibit the dissolution of polysulfides and accelerate the reaction kinetics. Thus, the as-prepared S cathode can display a high reversible capacity (1098 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 120 cycles) and superior rate performance (483 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 10.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work provides a new method to boost the performance of RT Na&#8211;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Future&#8208;Oriented Advanced Diarylethene Photoswitches: From Molecular Design to Spontaneous Assembly Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diarylethenes are a new type of photochromic molecules with attractive photofatigue resistance and reversibility. The result of a lot of effort has led to the rapid development of photoresponsive diarylethylenes for smart material applications. The recent advances in the design and assembly of diarylethylene as a multifunctional photoresponsive trigger unit are reviewed.








Abstract
Diarylethene (DAE) photoswitch is a new and promising family of photochromic molecules and has shown superior performance as a smart trigger in stimulus&#8208;responsive materials. During the past few decades, the DAE family has achieved a leap from simple molecules to functional molecules and developed toward validity as a universal switching building block. In recent years, the introduction of DAE into an assembly system has been an attractive strategy that enables the photochromic behavior of the building blocks to be manifested at the level of the entire system, beyond the DAE unit itself. This assembly&#8208;based strategy will bring many unexpected results that promote the design and manufacture of a new generation of advanced materials. Here, recent advances in the design and fabrication of diarylethene as a trigger in materials science, chemistry, and biomedicine are reviewed.

         <title>All&#8208;Dielectric Metasurface&#8208;Enabled Multiple Vortex Emissions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining an orbital angular momentum (OAM) multiplexing metalens array and semiconductor microlasers, the simultaneous generation of a vortex emission array with versatile topological charges is experimentally demonstrated, paving an essential step toward on&#8208;chip integrated OAM sources.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integrated micro&#8208; and nanoscale vortex lasers are key elements for addressing the exponentially growing demand for information capacity. Although tunable vortex microlasers have been reported, each laser pulse still possesses one particular topological charge and requires additional multiplexing. In this study, the simultaneous generation of coherent laser arrays with different topological charges by combining metalenses with semiconductor microlasers is demonstrated. A TiO2 vortex metalens converts two orbital angular momentum beams into the same diffraction&#8208;limit spot with opposite circular polarizations through spin&#8208;to&#8208;orbital conversion. Consequently, the microlaser emission at the focal spot, which can be decomposed into two circularly polarized beams, is collimated into vortex microlaser beams with two different topological charges through a time&#8208;reversal process. This concept is extended to a 2 &#215; 2 metalens array by introducing off&#8208;axis terms, and eight topological charges are produced simultaneously. This research is a significant step toward the on&#8208;chip integration of micro&#8208; and nanolasers.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Organic Logic Gates: A Promising Perspective on a Dual&#8208;Gate Antiambipolar Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reconfigurable logic circuits are achieved using a dual&#8208;gate organic antiambipolar transistor. Suitable top&#8208; and bottom&#8208;gate voltages demonstrate five logic gate operations: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR. Additionally, by varying the drain voltage, it is possible to electrically switch two logic gates. Thus, the proposed device concept provides a way of realizing multifunctional logic circuits using a simple circuit design.








Abstract
Electrically reconfigurable organic logic circuits are promising candidates for realizing new computation architectures, such as artificial intelligence and neuromorphic devices. In this study, multiple logic gate operations are attained based on a dual&#8208;gate organic antiambipolar transistor (DG&#8208;OAAT). The transistor exhibits a &#923;&#8208;shaped transfer curve, namely, a negative differential transconductance at room temperature. It is important to note that the peak voltage of the drain current is precisely tuned by three input signals: bottom&#8208;gate, top&#8208;gate, and drain voltages. This distinctive feature enables multiple logic gate operations with &#8220;only a single DG&#8208;OAAT,&#8221; which are not obtainable in conventional transistors. Five logic gate operations, which correspond to AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and XOR, are demonstrated by adjusting the bottom&#8208;gate and top&#8208;gate voltages. Moreover, varying the drain voltage makes it possible to reversibly switch two logic gates, e.g., NAND/NOR and OR/XOR. In addition, the DG&#8208;OAATs show a high degree of stability and reliability. The logic gate operations are observed even months later. The hysteresis in the transfer curves is also negligible. Thus, the device concept is promising for realizing multifunctional logic circuits with a simple transistor configuration. Hence, these findings are expected to surpass the current limitations in complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor devices.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells: Progressive Deposition Techniques and Future Prospects on Large&#8208;Area Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The possibilities of different deposition techniques which can bring quantum dot (QD)&#8208;based solar cells to the industrial level are assessed. With perovskite QDs showing dramatic improvements in photovoltaics, the discussions on the challenges particularly for perovskite QD solar cells are given in an attempt to achieve large&#8208;area fabrication solving pivotal energy and environmental issues.








Abstract
Colloidally grown nanosized semiconductors yield extremely high&#8208;quality optoelectronic materials. Many examples have pointed to near perfect photoluminescence quantum yields, allowing for technology&#8208;leading materials such as high purity color centers in display technology. Furthermore, because of high chemical yield, and improved understanding of the surfaces, these materials, particularly colloidal quantum dots (QDs) can also be ideal candidates for other optoelectronic applications. Given the urgent necessity toward carbon neutrality, electricity from solar photovoltaics will play a large role in the power generation sector. QDs are developed and shown dramatic improvements over the past 15 years as photoactive materials in photovoltaics with various innovative deposition properties which can lead to exceptionally low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance devices. Once the key issues related to charge transport in optically thick arrays are addressed, QD&#8208;based photovoltaic technology can become a better candidate for practical application. In this article, the authors show how the possibilities of different deposition techniques can bring QD&#8208;based solar cells to the industrial level and discuss the challenges for perovskite QD solar cells in particular, to achieve large&#8208;area fabrication for further advancing technology to solve pivotal energy and environmental issues.

A&#160;new Zn4SO4&#183;(OH)6&#183;xH2O (ZSH)&#8208;assisted deposition and dissolution reaction model is proposed and validated for aqueous Zn&#8211;Mn batteries in mild sulfate electrolytes. It is shown that MnO2 is not a compulsory cathode; and various metal oxides, including ZSH, ZnO, MgO, and CaO, can be used as the cathode materials for aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8211;Mn batteries have garnered extensive attention for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;safety energy storage. However, the charge&#8208;storage chemistry of Zn&#8211;Mn batteries remains controversial. Prevailing mechanisms include conversion reaction and cation (de)intercalation in mild acid or neutral electrolytes, and a MnO2/Mn2+ dissolution&#8722;deposition reaction in strong acidic electrolytes. Herein, a Zn4SO4&#183;(OH)6&#183;xH2O (ZSH)&#8208;assisted deposition&#8722;dissolution model is proposed to elucidate the reaction mechanism and capacity origin in Zn&#8211;Mn batteries based on mild acidic sulfate electrolytes. In this new model, the reversible capacity originates from a reversible conversion reaction between ZSH and ZnxMnO(OH)2 nanosheets in which the MnO2 initiates the formation of ZSH but contributes negligibly to the apparent capacity. The role of ZSH in this new model is confirmed by a series of operando characterizations and by constructing Zn batteries using other cathode materials (including ZSH, ZnO, MgO, and CaO). This research may refresh the understanding of the most promising Zn&#8211;Mn batteries and guide the design of high&#8208;capacity aqueous Zn batteries.

         <title>Urine&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Initiated Composite Hydrogel Patch Reconfiguration Propels Scarless Memory Repair and Reinvigoration of the Urethra</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A urine&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel patch featuring robust antiswelling is engineered, which can respond to Ca2+ in urine to trigger structure reconfiguration and antiswelling for enhancing mechanical stiffness and realizing scarless memory repair via enhancing collagen deposition, recalling mechanical memory, inhibiting fibrosis and inflammation, and accelerating angiogenesis especially when combining with moderate photo&#8208;provoked reactive oxygen species birth.








Abstract
The harsh urine microenvironment (UME), as an inherent hurdle, endangers and renders urethral repair unreachable. Innovatively, the unfavorable UME is utilized as the design source to construct a UME&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed hydrogel patch for realizing scarless memory repair, wherein laser&#8208;excited reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mechanical strength elevation using chemically crosslinked silicon quantum dots are accessible. Intriguingly, the proposed composite scaffolds can respond to Ca2+ in urine, cause structure reconfiguration, and repress swelling to further enhance scaffold stiffness. Systematic experiments validate that ROS birth and unexpected stiffness elevation in such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds can realize scarless memory repair of the urethra in vivo. Comprehensive mechanism explorations uncover that the activations of cell proliferation and collagen&#8208;related genes (e.g., MMP&#8208;1 and COL3A1) and the dampening of fibrosis&#8208;related (e.g., TGF&#8208;&#946;/Smad) and mechanosensitive genes (e.g., YAP/TAZ) are responsible for the scarless memory repair of such UME&#8208;responsive scaffolds via enhancing collagen deposition, recalling mechanical memory, decreasing fibrosis and inflammation, and accelerating angiogenesis. The design rationales (e.g., UME&#8208;initiated structure reconfiguration and antiswelling) can serve as an instructive and general approach for urethra repair.

         <title>Collagen Fiber&#8208;Based Advanced Separation Materials: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen fibers (CFs), the structural proteins ubiquitously existing in animal skins, feature unique hierarchically fibrous structure, amphiphilicity&#8208;enabled surface wetting behaviors, and versatile reactivity. Owing to the intrinsic merits of CFs, progressive successes have been achieved in developing CFs&#8208;based advanced separation materials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent development of CFs&#8208;based separation materials and their future perspectives.








Abstract
Separation plays a critical role in a broad range of industrial applications. Developing advanced separation materials is of great significance for the future development of separation technology. Collagen fibers (CFs), the typical structural proteins, exhibit unique structural hierarchy, amphiphilic wettability, and versatile chemical reactivity. These distinctive properties provide infinite possibilities for the rational design of advanced separation materials. During the past 2 decades, many progressive achievements in the development of CFs&#8208;derived advanced separation materials have been witnessed already. Herein, the CFs&#8208;based separation materials are focused on and the recent progresses in this topic are reviewed. CFs widely existing in animal skins display unique hierarchically fibrous structure, amphiphilicity&#8208;enabled surface wetting behaviors, multi&#8208;functionality guaranteed covalent/non&#8208;covalent reaction versatility. These outstanding merits of CFs bring great opportunities for realizing rational design of a variety of advanced separation materials that were&#160;capable of achieving high&#8208;performance separations to diverse specific targets, including oily pollutants, natural products, metal ions, anionic contaminants and proteins, etc. Besides, the important issues for the further development of CFs&#8208;based advanced separation materials are also discussed.

         <title>High&#8208;Polarizability Organic Ferroelectric Materials Doping for Enhancing the Built&#8208;In Electric Field of Perovskite Solar Cells Realizing Efficiency over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic ferroelectric material poly(vinylidene fluoride):dabcoHReO4 as a perovskite dopant can be partially polarized by the built&#8208;in electric field of perovskite solar cell (pero&#8208;SC) itself, which produces an additional electric field, thus promoting the charge&#8208;carrier transportation. A promising 24.23% power conversion efficiency (PCE) (certified PCE of 23.45%) and robust operational stability are obtained.








Abstract
The built&#8208;in electric field (BEF) intensity of silicon heterojunction solar cells can be easily enhanced by selective doping to obtain high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), while it is challenging for perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) because of the difficulty in doping perovskites in a controllable way. Herein, an effective method is reported to enhance the BEF of FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 perovskite by doping an organic ferroelectric material, poly(vinylidene fluoride):dabcoHReO4 (PVDF:DH) with high polarizability, that can be driven even by the BEF of the device itself. The polarization of PVDF:DH produces an additional electric field, which is maintained permanently, in a direction consistent with that of the BEF of the pero&#8208;SC. The BEF superposition&#160;can more sufficiently drive the charge&#8208;carrier transport and extraction, thus suppressing the nonradiative recombination occurring in the pero&#8208;SCs. Moreover, the PVDF:DH dopant benefits the formation of a mesoporous PbI2 film, via a typical two&#8208;step processing method, thereby promoting perovskite growth with high crystallinity and a few defects. The resulting pero&#8208;SC shows a promising PCE of 24.23% for a 0.062 cm2 device (certified PCE of 23.45%), and a remarkable PCE of 22.69% for a 1 cm2 device, along with significantly improved moisture resistances and operational stabilities.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Scale Auxetic Hierarchical Mechanical Metamaterials for Shape Morphing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents novel 2D and 3D microscopic hierarchical mechanical metamaterials capable of exhibiting a broad range of the highly unusual auxetic behavior that can be fully controlled through design parameters. The proposed hierarchical systems can also form composites capable of shape morphing where the initial structures can assume arbitrary predefined shapes.








Abstract
Shape morphing and the possibility of having control over mechanical properties via designed deformations have attracted a lot of attention in the materials community and led to a variety of applications with an emphasis on the space industry. However, current materials normally do not allow to have a full control over the deformation pattern and often fail to replicate such behavior at low scales which is essential in flexible electronics. Thus, in this paper, novel 2D&#160;and 3D microscopic hierarchical mechanical metamaterials using mutually&#8208;competing substructures within the system that are capable of exhibiting a broad range of the highly unusual auxetic behavior are proposed. Using experiments (3D microprinted polymers) supported by computer simulations, it is shown that such ability can be controlled through geometric design parameters. Finally it is demonstrated that the considered structure can form a composite capable of shape morphing allowing it to deform to a predefined shape.

Using experiments (3D microprinted polymers) supported by computer simulations, it is shown that such ability can be controlled through geometric design parameters. Finally it is demonstrated that the considered structure can form a composite capable of shape morphing allowing it to deform to a predefined shape.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced Flame&#8208;Retardant Methods for Polymeric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flame&#8208;retardant methods for polymeric materials are reviewed with particular focus on advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods developed in recent years. Both the advantages and drawbacks of these methods are discussed, and prospects for the future development of flame&#8208;retardant methods are presented. It is hope that this review will guide the development of flame&#8208;retardant polymeric materials.








Abstract
Most organic polymeric materials have high flammability, for which the large amounts of smoke, toxic gases, heat, and melt drips produced during their burning cause immeasurable damages to human life and property every year. Despite some desirable results having been achieved by conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods, their application is encountering more and more difficulties with the ever&#8208;increasing high flame&#8208;retardant requirements such as high flame&#8208;retardant efficiency, great persistence, low release of heat, smoke, and toxic gases, and more importantly not deteriorating or even enhancing the overall properties of polymers. Under such condition, some advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods have been developed in the past years based on &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; intumescence, nanotechnology, in situ reinforcement, intrinsic char formation, plasma treatment, biomimetic coatings, etc., which have provided potential solutions to the dilemma of conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods. This review briefly outlines the development, application, and problems of conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods, including bulk&#8208;additive, bulk&#8208;copolymerization, and surface treatment, and focuses on the raise, development, and potential application of advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods. The future development of flame&#8208;retardant methods is further discussed.

         <title>Polymerized Small Molecular Acceptor with Branched Side Chains for All Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency over 16.7%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polymer acceptors named PY&#8208;X have been synthesized. By optimizing the length of branched alkyl chains, PY&#8208;HD (2&#8208;hexyldecyl substitution)&#8208;based all polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) delivers a high efficiency of 16.76%, with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.949&#160;V, and an extremely low non&#8208;radiative voltage loss of 0.18&#160;V, representing the highest efficiency for binary all&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of small molecule acceptor (SMA)&#8208;based organic solar cells have already exceeded 18%. However, the development of polymer acceptors still lags far behind their SMA counterparts mainly due to the lack of efficient polymer acceptors. Herein, a series of polymer acceptors named PY&#8208;X (with X being the branched alkyl chain) are&#160;designed and synthesized by employing the same central core with the SMA L8&#8208;BO but with different branched alkyl chains on the pyrrole motif. It is found that the molecular packing of SMA&#8208;HD featuring 2&#8208;hexyldecyl side chain used in the synthesis of PY&#8208;HD is similar to L8&#8208;BO, in which the branched alkyl chains lead to condensed and high&#8208;order molecular assembly in SMA&#8208;HD molecules. When combined with PM6, PY&#8208;HD&#8208;based all polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) exhibits a high PCE of 16.41%, representing the highest efficiency for the binary all&#8208;PSCs. Moreover, the side&#8208;chain modification on the pyrrole site position further improves the performance of the all&#8208;PSCs, and the PY&#8208;DT&#8208;based device delivers a new record high efficiency of 16.76% (certified as 16.3%). The work provides new insights for understanding the structure&#8211;property relationship of polymer acceptors and paves a feasible avenue to develop efficient conjugated polymer acceptors.

         <title>Critical Review on Low&#8208;Temperature Li&#8208;Ion/Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A timely and critical review on fundamental mechanisms, recent advances, and design strategies of electrolytes, electrodes, and battery structures for low&#8208;temperature Li batteries is provided.








Abstract
With the highest energy density ever among all sorts of commercialized rechargeable batteries, Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have stimulated an upsurge utilization in 3C devices, electric vehicles, and stationary energy&#8208;storage systems. However, a high performance of commercial LIBs based on ethylene carbonate electrolytes and graphite anodes can only be achieved at above &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, which restricts their applications in harsh environments. Here, a comprehensive research progress and in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors leading to the poor low&#8208;temperature performance of LIBs is provided; the distinctive challenges on the anodes, electrolytes, cathodes, and electrolyte&#8211;electrodes interphases are sorted out, with a special focus on Li&#8208;ion transport mechanism therein. Finally, promising strategies and solutions for improving low&#8208;temperature performance are highlighted to maximize the working&#8208;temperature range of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion/metal batteries.

         <title>A MOF&#8208;Derivative Decorated Hierarchical Porous Host Enabling Ultrahigh Rates and Superior Long&#8208;Term Cycling of Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elaborate design is reported to fabricate novel 3D host for Zn metal anodes by assembling carbon nanotubes and graphene into a hierarchical porous structure, followed by decorating with Zn&#8208;metal&#8211;organic framework derivatives, which enables a significant boost on both charging/discharging rate and long&#8208;term cycling performance for Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn metal batteries have attracted much attention due to their high intrinsic capacity, high safety, and low cost. Nevertheless, uncontrollable dendrite growth and adverse side reactions of Zn anodes seriously hinder their further application. Herein, a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous graphene&#8208;carbon nanotubes scaffold decorated with metal&#8211;organic framework derived ZnO/C nanoparticles (3D&#8208;ZGC) is fabricated as the host for dendrite&#8208;free Zn&#8208;metal composite anodes. The zincophilic ZnO/C nanoparticles act as preferred deposition sites with low nucleation barriers to induce homogeneous Zn deposition. The mechanically robust 3D scaffold with high conductivity not only suppresses the formation of dendritic Zn by reducing the local current density and homogenizing Zn2+ ion flux, but also inhibits volume changes during the long&#8208;term plating/stripping process. As a result, the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anodes afford unprecedented Zn plating&#8208;stripping stability at an ultrahigh current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 for 1500 cycles with low overpotential (&lt;65&#160;mV) when used in a symmetric cell. When coupled with MnO2 cathodes, the assembled Zn@3D&#8208;ZGC//MnO2 full batteries deliver an enhanced cycling stability for up to 6000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8208;1, demonstrating the potential of the 3D&#8208;ZGC composite anode for advanced Zn metal batteries.

         <title>Mechanistically Scoping Cell&#8208;Free and Cell&#8208;Dependent Artificial Scaffolds in Rebuilding Skeletal and Dental Hard Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rebuilding mineralized structures in tooth and bone is always the supreme goal in fields of regenerative dentistry and orthopedics. Mechanistic understandings of artificial scaffolds in rebuilding skeletal and dental hard tissues are reviewed, by which better clinical choices and research directions may be approached.








Abstract
Rebuilding mineralized tissues in skeletal and dental systems remains costly and challenging. Despite numerous demands and heavy clinical burden over the world, sources of autografts, allografts, and xenografts are far limited, along with massive risks including viral infections, ethic crisis, and so on. Per such dilemma, artificial scaffolds have emerged to provide efficient alternatives. To date, cell&#8208;free biomimetic mineralization (BM) and cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds have both demonstrated promising capabilities of regenerating mineralized tissues. However, BM and cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds have distinctive mechanisms for mineral genesis, which makes them methodically, synthetically, and functionally disparate. Herein, these two strategies in regenerative dentistry and orthopedics are systematically summarized at the level of mechanisms. For BM, methodological and theoretical advances are focused upon; and meanwhile, for cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds, it is demonstrated how scaffolds orchestrate osteogenic cell fate.

     alt="Mechanistically Scoping Cell-Free and Cell-Dependent Artificial Scaffolds in Rebuilding Skeletal and Dental Hard Tissues"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding mineralized structures in tooth and bone is always the supreme goal in fields of regenerative dentistry and orthopedics. Mechanistic understandings of artificial scaffolds in rebuilding skeletal and dental hard tissues are reviewed, by which better clinical choices and research directions may be approached.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding mineralized tissues in skeletal and dental systems remains costly and challenging. Despite numerous demands and heavy clinical burden over the world, sources of autografts, allografts, and xenografts are far limited, along with massive risks including viral infections, ethic crisis, and so on. Per such dilemma, artificial scaffolds have emerged to provide efficient alternatives. To date, cell-free biomimetic mineralization (BM) and cell-dependent scaffolds have both demonstrated promising capabilities of regenerating mineralized tissues. However, BM and cell-dependent scaffolds have distinctive mechanisms for mineral genesis, which makes them methodically, synthetically, and functionally disparate. Herein, these two strategies in regenerative dentistry and orthopedics are systematically summarized at the level of mechanisms. For BM, methodological and theoretical advances are focused upon; and meanwhile, for cell-dependent scaffolds, it is demonstrated how scaffolds orchestrate osteogenic cell fate. The summary of the experimental advances and clinical progress will endow researchers with mechanistic understandings of artificial scaffolds in rebuilding hard tissues, by which better clinical choices and research directions may be approached.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Dual&#8208;Type Signal Vector Sensor for Smart Robotics and Automatic Vehicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered dual&#8208;type signal vector sensor is designed by integrating an alternating&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and a direct&#8208;current TENG, which achieves a high sensing precision and stability, and provides an effective movement direction recognition method by self&#8208;powered switching of signal type in real&#8208;time motion monitoring of a mechanical arm and automatic steering wheel.








Abstract
Automatic control systems are the most efficient technology for reducing labor cost while improving work efficiency. Vector motion monitoring is indispensable for the normal operation of automatic control systems. Here, a self&#8208;powered dual&#8208;type signal triboelectric nanogenerator (DS&#8208;TENG) is designed through integrating an alternating&#8208;current TENG and a direct&#8208;current TENG, which can monitor vector movement in real time based on pulse signal counts. As a result, the DS&#8208;TENG avoids the shortcoming of traditional self&#8208;powered sensors based on signal amplitude that is sensitive to the working environment, achieves a high sensing precision, and maintains stability after reciprocating motion of 500&#160;000 cycles. Moreover, it realizes effective movement direction recognition by self&#8208;powered switching of signal type in reverse movement. This dual&#8208;type signal TENG exhibits high precision and automatic direction recognition in vector motion monitor and trajectory tracker, paving the way for the application of the self&#8208;powered TENG sensor in automatic control systems in the future.

         <title>2D Materials for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces current progress of 2D materials (2DM) application in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLB) to deal with the limitation of ASSLBs. 2DMs are applied in the different composition of the ASSLBs to enhance its performance. By summarizing the properties, synthesis, application, and characterization, this review points out the future development direction of 2DMs application in ASSLBs.








Abstract
Although one of the most mature battery technologies, lithium&#8208;ion batteries still have many aspects that have not reached the desired requirements, such as energy density, current density, safety, environmental compatibility, and price. To solve these problems, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLB) based on lithium metal anodes with high energy density and safety have been proposed and become a research hotpot in recent years. Due to the advanced electrochemical properties of 2D materials (2DM), they have been applied to mitigate some of the current problems of ASSLBs, such as high interface impedance and low electrolyte ionic conductivity. In this work, the background and fabrication method of 2DMs are reviewed initially. The improvement strategies of 2DMs are categorized based on their application in the three main components of ASSLBs: The anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Finally, to elucidate the mechanisms of 2DMs in ASSLBs, the role of in situ characterization, synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques, and other advanced characterization are discussed.

         <title>The molecular ordering and double channel carrier generation of non&#8208;fullerene photovoltaics within multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale morphology</title>

Abstract
The success of non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) solar cells lies in their unique physical properties beyond the extended absorption and suitable energy levels. The current study investigates the morphology and photo physical behavior of PM6 donor blending with ITIC, 4TIC, and 6TIC acceptors. Single crystal study shows that the pi&#8208;pi stacking and side&#8208;chain interaction dictate molecular assembly, which can be carried to blended films, forming a multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale morphology. Spontaneous carrier generation is seen in ITIC, 4TIC and 6TIC neat films and their blended thin films using PBDB&#8208;T donor, providing a new avenue of zero energy loss carrier formation. The molecular packing associated with specific contacts and geometry is key in influencing the photo physics, as demonstrated by the charge transfer and carrier lifetime results. We see the 2D layer of 6TIC that facilitates the exciton to polaron conversion and obtains the largest photo&#8208;generated polaron yield. The new mechanism in together with the highly efficient blending region carrier generation prospect the fundamental advantage for NFA solar cells, from molecular assembly to thin film morphology.

         <title>Terahertz chiral metamaterials enabled by textile manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Easy&#8208;to&#8208;fabricate, large&#8208;area, and inexpensive microstructures that realize control of the polarization of terahertz (THz) radiation are of fundamental importance to the development of the field of THz wave photonics. However, due to the lack of natural materials which can facilitate strong THz radiation&#8208;matter interactions, THz polarization components remain an undeveloped technology. Strong resonance&#8208;based responses offered by THz metamaterials have led to the recent development of THz metadevices, whereas, for polarization control devices, micrometer&#8208;scale fabrication techniques including aligned photolithography are generally required to create multilayer microstructures. In this work, leveraging a two&#8208;step textile manufacturing approach, a chiral metamaterial capable of exhibiting strong chiroptical responses at THz frequencies is demonstrated. Chiral&#8208;selective transmission and pronounced optical activity are experimentally observed. In sharp contrast to smart clothing related devices (e.g., textile antennas), the investigated chiral metamaterials gain their THz properties directly from the yarn&#8208;twisting enabled micro&#8208;helical strings. We envision that the interplay between meta&#8208;atom designs and textile manufacturing technology will lead to a new family of metadevices for complete control over the phase, amplitude, and polarization of THz radiation.

         <title>Bioinspired Lipoproteins of Furoxans&#8211;Oxaliplatin Remodel Physical Barriers in Tumor to Potentiate T&#8208;Cell Infiltration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The abnormal tumor vasculature and dense tumor stroma constitute a formidable physical barrier that strikingly limits the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors. Herein, a stromal&#8208;cell&#8208;accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system loading a reduction&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8211;oxaliplatin is designed, which profoundly paves the way for CTL infiltration in tumors and synergizes immune&#8208;checkpoint&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;mediated anticancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in tumors is critically challenged by the intricate intratumor physical barriers, which is emerging as an important issue of anticancer immunotherapy. Herein, a reduction&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8211;oxaliplatin is synthesized and a stroma&#8208;cell&#8208;accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system (S&#8208;LFO) is designed, aiming to facilitate CTL infiltration in tumors for anticancer immunotherapy. S&#8208;LFO treatment significantly promotes tumor vessel normalization and eliminates multiple components of tumor stroma, ultimately producing a 2.96&#8208;fold, 5.02&#8208;fold, and 8.65&#8208;fold increase of CD3+CD8+ T cells, their interferon&#8208;&#947;&#8208; and granzyme B&#8208;expressing subtypes when comparing to the negative control, and considerably facilitating their trafficking to the cancer cell regions in tumors. Moreover, the combination of S&#8208;LFO with an antiprogrammed death ligand&#8208;1 produces notable therapeutic benefits of retarded tumor growth and extends survivals in three murine tumor models. Therefore, this study provides an encouraging strategy of remodeling the intratumor physical barriers to potentiate CTL infiltration for anticancer immunotherapy.

Herein, a reduction-sensitive nitric oxide donor conjugate of furoxans&#8211;oxaliplatin is synthesized and a stroma-cell-accessible bioinspired lipoprotein system (S-LFO) is designed, aiming to facilitate CTL infiltration in tumors for anticancer immunotherapy. S-LFO treatment significantly promotes tumor vessel normalization and eliminates multiple components of tumor stroma, ultimately producing a 2.96-fold, 5.02-fold, and 8.65-fold increase of CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, their interferon-&#947;- and granzyme B-expressing subtypes when comparing to the negative control, and considerably facilitating their trafficking to the cancer cell regions in tumors. Moreover, the combination of S-LFO with an antiprogrammed death ligand-1 produces notable therapeutic benefits of retarded tumor growth and extends survivals in three murine tumor models. Therefore, this study provides an encouraging strategy of remodeling the intratumor physical barriers to potentiate CTL infiltration for anticancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Twin&#8208;structured Graphene Metamaterials with Anomalous Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Typically, solid materials exhibit transverse contraction in response to stretching in the orthogonal direction and transverse expansion under compression conditions. However, when flexible graphene nanosheets are assembled into three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous architecture, the orientation arrangement delivered directional deformation of micro&#8208;nanosheets may induce anomalous mechanical properties. In this study, a 3D hierarchical graphene metamaterial (GTM) with twin&#8208;structured morphologies is assembled by manipulating the temperature gradient for the ice growth during in situ freeze&#8208;casting procedures. GTM has demonstrated anomalous anisotropic compression performance with programable Poisson's ratios (PRs) and improved mechanical properties (e.g., elasticity, strength, modulus and fatigue resistance) along different directions. Owing to the designed three&#8208;phase deformation (elastic bending, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane buckling, and large deflection) of two&#8208;dimensional graphene sheets as basic elements in the microscale, the twin&#8208;structure GTM delivers distinctive characteristics of compressive curves with an apparent stress plateau and follows a strengthening tendency. This multiscale deformation behavior facilitates the enhancement of energy loss coefficient under large compression. In addition, a finite element theory based numerical model is established to optimize the structural design, and validate the multiscale tunable PR mechanism and oriented structural evolution. The mechanical and thermal applications of GTM indicate that the rational manipulation&#8208;driven design of meta&#8208;structures paves the way for exploring graphene&#8208;based multifunctional materials with anomalous properties.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;diffusion induced Capacity Losses in Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable lithium&#8208;based batteries generally exhibit gradual capacity losses resulting in decreasing energy and power densities. For negative electrode materials the capacity losses are largely attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and volume expansion effects. For positive electrode materials, the capacity losses are, instead, mainly ascribed to structural changes and metal ion dissolution. This Review focuses on another, so far largely unrecognized, type of capacity loss stemming from diffusion of lithium atoms or ions as a result of concentration gradients present in the electrode. An incomplete delithiation step is then seen for a negative electrode material while an incomplete lithiation step is obtained for a positive electrode material. Evidence for diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity losses is presented based on published experimental data and results obtained in recent studies focusing on this trapping effect. The implications of the diffusion&#8208;controlled Li&#8208;trapping induced capacity losses, which are discussed using a straightforward diffusion&#8208;based model, are compared with those of other phenomena expected to give capacity losses. Approaches that can be used to identify and circumvent the diffusion&#8208;controlled Li&#8208;trapping problem (e.g., regeneration of cycled batteries) are discussed, in addition to remaining challenges and proposed future research directions within this important research area.

         <title>A Reconfigurable Two&#8208;WSe2&#8208;Transistor Synaptic Cell for Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hardware implementation for reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is demonstrated with a unique 2T synaptic cell structure, which realizes the functions of both STDP and anti&#8208;STDP using a simple hardware structure. The total synaptic weight is increased (decreased) by applying feedback signal to gate1 or gate2 when, respectively, a positive or negative reward signal comes.








Abstract
Reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is a brain&#8208;inspired reinforcement learning (RL) rule, exhibiting potential for decision&#8208;making tasks and artificial general intelligence. However, the hardware implementation of the reward&#8208;modulation process in R&#8208;STDP usually requires complicated Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) circuit design that causes high power consumption and large footprint. Here, a design with two synaptic transistors (2T) connected in a parallel structure is experimentally demonstrated. The 2T unit based on WSe2 ferroelectric transistors exhibits reconfigurable polarity behavior, where one channel can be tuned as n&#8208;type and the other as p&#8208;type due to nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization. In this way, opposite synaptic weight update behaviors with multilevel (&gt;6 bit) conductance states, ultralow nonlinearity (0.56/&#8722;1.23), and large Gmax/Gmin ratio of 30 are realized. By applying positive/negative reward to (anti&#8208;)STDP component of 2T cell, R&#8208;STDP learning rules are realized for training the spiking neural network and demonstrated to solve the classical cart&#8211;pole problem, exhibiting a way for realizing low&#8208;power (32 pJ per forward process) and highly area&#8208;efficient (100 &#181;m2) hardware chip for reinforcement learning.

         <title>Heterojunction Annealing Enabling Record Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage in Antimony Triselenide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterojunction post&#8208;annealing treatment is utilized to suppress the nonradiative recombination for a highly competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 520&#160;mV in Sb2Se3 thin&#8208;film solar cells. The VOC deficit of the device is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cells.








Abstract
Despite the fact that antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) thin&#8208;film solar cells have undergone rapid development in recent years, the large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit still remains as the biggest bottleneck, as even the world&#8208;record device suffers from a large VOC deficit of 0.59&#160;V. Here, an effective interface engineering approach is reported where the Sb2Se3/CdS heterojunction (HTJ) is subjected to a post&#8208;annealing treatment using a rapid thermal process. It is found that nonradiative recombination near the Sb2Se3/CdS HTJ, including interface recombination and space charge region recombination, is greatly suppressed after the HTJ annealing treatment. Ultimately, a substrate Sb2Se3/CdS thin&#8208;film solar cell with a competitive power conversion efficiency of 8.64% and a record VOC of 0.52&#160;V is successfully fabricated. The device exhibits a much mitigated VOC deficit of 0.49&#160;V, which is lower than that of any other reported efficient antimony chalcogenide solar cell.

         <title>Antifreezing Hydrogel Electrolyte with Ternary Hydrogen Bonding for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible and antifreezing polysaccharide hydrogel is realized in situ with Zn(ClO4)2 salts through the Hofmeister effect. The chaotropic ClO4&#8722; anions can form weak hydrogen bonds with both water and polymer chains to decrease the electrolyte freezing point and endow the hydrogel with good mechanical flexibility, thus enabling the zinc&#8208;ion batteries with high performance ranging from &#8722;30 to 50&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The new&#8208;generation flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries require enhanced mechanical properties and ionic conductivities at low temperature for practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;A flexible and antifreezing polysaccharide hydrogel is realized in situ with Zn(ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; salts through the Hofmeister effect. The chaotropic ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions can form weak hydrogen bonds with both water and polymer chains to decrease the electrolyte freezing point and endow the hydrogel with good mechanical flexibility, thus enabling the zinc-ion batteries with high performance ranging from &#8722;30 to 50&#160;&#176;C.

Abstract
Fullerenes are a molecular form of carbon allotrope and bear certain solubility, which allow the supramolecular assembly of fullerene molecules &#8211; also together with other complementary compound classes &#8211; via solution&#8208;based wet processes. By well&#8208;programmed organizing these building blocks and precisely modulating over the assembly process, supramolecularly assembled fullerene micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;architectures (FMNAs) are obtained. These FMNAs exhibit remarkably enhanced functions as well as tuneable morphologies and dimensions at different size scales, leading to their applications in diverse fields. In this review, both traditional and newly developed assembly strategies are reviewed, with an emphasis on the morphological evolution mechanism of FMNAs. The discussion is then focused on how to precisely regulate the dimensions and morphologies to generate functional FMNAs through solvent engineering, co&#8208;crystallization, surfactant incorporation, or post&#8208;fabrication treatment. In addition to C60&#8208;based FMNAs, this review particularly focuses on recently fabricated FMNAs comprising higher fullerenes (e.g., C70) and metallofullerenes. Meanwhile, an overview of the property modulation is presented and multidisciplinary applications of FMNAs in various fields are summarized, including sensors, optoelectronics, biomedicines, and energy. At the end, the prospects for future research, application opportunities, and challenges associated with FMNAs are proposed.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Uniform 1&#8208;nm&#8208;Level Amorphous Carbon Layers from 3D Conformal Polymer Brushes. A &#8220;Next&#8208;Generation&#8221; Cu Diffusion Barrier?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A uniform 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level of amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) layer as a diffusion barrier for Cu interconnects is obtained by the &#8220;self&#8208;limited&#8221; grafting of a polystyrene brush on oxide dielectric followed by UV crosslinking then carbonization. This approach for generating large area, ultra&#8208;uniform, and ultrathin polymer coatings shows promise for many new research directions and for a broad array of applications.








Abstract
A reliable method for preparing a conformal amorphous carbon (a&#8208;C) layer with a thickness of 1&#8208;nm&#8208;level, is tested as a possible Cu diffusion barrier layer for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;density semiconductor device miniaturization. A polystyrene brush of uniform thickness is grafted onto 4&#8208;inch SiO2/Si wafer substrates with &#8220;self&#8208;limiting&#8221; chemistry favoring such a uniform layer. UV crosslinking and subsequent carbonization transforms this polymer film into an ultrathin a&#8208;C layer without pinholes or hillocks. The uniform coating of nonplanar regions or surfaces is also possible. The Cu diffusion &#8220;blocking ability&#8221; is evaluated by time&#8208;dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) tests using a metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (MOS) capacitor structure. A 0.82&#160;nm&#8208;thick a&#8208;C barrier gives TDDB lifetimes 3.3&#215; longer than that obtained using the conventional 1.0&#160;nm&#8208;thick TaNx diffusion barrier. In addition, this exceptionally uniform ultrathin polymer and a&#8208;C film layers hold promise for selective ion permeable membranes, electrically and thermally insulating films in electronics, slits of angstrom&#8208;scale thickness, and, when appropriately functionalized, as a robust ultrathin coating with many other potential applications.

         <title>Interpretation of Rubidium&#8208;Based Perovskite Recipes toward Electronic Passivation and Ion&#8208;Diffusion Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rb+&#8208;based perovskite recipes are widely adopted in a large amount of significant advancements regarding perovskite solar cells with several performance records. Combining seminal theoretical calculations with cutting&#8208;edge experimental characterizations, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in doping concentration on electronic defects, ion migration, and phase stability is thoroughly investigated.








Abstract
Rubidium cation (Rb+) addition is witnessed to play a pivotal role in boosting the comprehensive performance of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. However, the origin of such success derived from irreplaceable superiorities brought by Rb+ remains ambiguous. Herein, grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;including atomic models are adopted for the accurate theoretical analysis of practical Rb+ distribution in perovskite structures. The spatial distribution, covering both the grain interiors and boundaries, is thoroughly identified by virtue of synchrotron&#8208;based grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction. On this basis, the prominent elevation of the halogen vacancy formation energy, improved charge&#8208;carrier dynamics, and the electronic passivation mechanism in the grain interior are expounded. As evidenced by the increased energy barrier and suppressed microcurrent, the critical role of Rb+ addition in blocking the diffusion pathway along grain boundaries, inhibiting halide phase segregation, and eventually enhancing intrinsic stability is elucidated. Hence, the linkage avalanche effect of occupied location dominated by subtle changes in Rb+ concentration on electronic defects, ion migration, and phase stability is completely investigated in detail, shedding a new light on the advancement of high&#8208;efficiency cascade&#8208;incorporating strategies and perovskite compositional engineering.

         <title>Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Actuators and Waveguides that Operate at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elegant approach is described for conversion of elastic molecular crystals into flexible actuators that operate in low&#8208;temperature environments. These materials are tested in micromechanical actuation operations such as soft gripping of delicate objects, autonomous motion over flat surfaces, and measurement of temperature.








Abstract
Applications in extreme conditions, such as those encountered in space exploration, require lightweight materials that can retain their elasticity in extremely cold environments. However, cryogenic treatment of most soft polymeric and elastomeric materials results in complete loss of their ability for elastic flow, whereby such materials that are normally ductile become stiff, brittle, and prone to cracking. Here, a facile method for preparation of hybrid organic crystalline materials that are not only cryogenically robust but are also capable of large, recoverable, and reversible deformation at low temperatures is reported. To that end, flexible organic crystals are first mechanically reinforced by a polymer coating and combined with a thermally responsive polymer. The resulting hybrid materials respond linearly and reversibly to temperatures from &#8722;15 to &#8722;120 &#176;C without fatigue in air as well as in cold vacuum. The approach proposed here not only circumvents one of the main drawbacks that are inherent to the amorphous nature and has thus far limited the applications of polymeric materials at low temperatures, but it also provides a cost&#8208;effective access to a myriad of lightweight sensing, electronic, optical or actuating devices that can operate in low&#8208;temperature environmental settings.

         <title>3D Continuously Porous Graphene for Energy Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D continuously porous graphene formed by folding a single&#8208;sheet graphene into a 3D porous architecture has well&#8208;retained 2D properties of graphene and novel functionalities from 3D structure, representing a distinct class of graphene materials with numerous unique and extraordinary properties. A comprehensive review of 3D continuously porous graphene and their applications in energy conversion and storage is provided.








Abstract
Constructing bulk graphene materials with well&#8208;reserved 2D properties is essential for device and engineering applications of atomically thick graphene. In this article, the recent progress in the fabrications and applications of sterically continuous porous graphene with designable microstructures, chemistries, and properties for energy storage and conversion are reviewed. Both template&#8208;based and template&#8208;free methods have been developed to synthesize the 3D continuously porous graphene, which typically has the microstructure reminiscent of pseudo&#8208;periodic minimal surfaces. The 3D graphene can well preserve the properties of 2D graphene of being highly conductive, surface abundant, and mechanically robust, together with unique 2D electronic behaviors. Additionally, the bicontinuous porosity and large curvature offer new functionalities, such as rapid mass transport, ample open space, mechanical flexibility, and tunable electric/thermal conductivity. Particularly, the 3D curvature provides a new degree of freedom for tailoring the catalysis and transport properties of graphene. The 3D graphene with those extraordinary properties has shown great promises for a wide range of applications, especially for energy conversion and storage. This article overviews the recent advances made in addressing the challenges of developing 3D continuously porous graphene, the benefits and opportunities of the new materials for energy&#8208;related applications, and the remaining challenges that warrant future study.

         <title>Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylene Lamellar&#8208;Thin Framework on Square Meter Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new member of low&#8208;dimensional structures with square meter lateral size by commodity polymer is introduced. This macroscopic low dimensional material is highly transparent optically and electronically, sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;porous, and self&#8208;standing with Young's Modulus of giga pascal level. Its potential applications include separation process and flexible electronics.








Abstract
A new member of low&#8208;dimensional structures with a high aspect ratio (LDHA) is introduced. For the first time, commodity polymer is processed into LDHA, which has long been stagnated by the lack of suitable processing techniques. The key to solve the current bottleneck is to overcome the trade&#8208;off between kinetic processability and thermodynamic stability. These two factors are both highly determined by intermolecular interaction level (IIL). Thus with a wide tuning range of IIL, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is selected and investigated to break through the trade&#8208;off. Polymeric LDHA preparation needs both thinning and stiffening. By focusing on one then the other sequentially, they are realized simultaneously. Thus the over sixty&#8208;year&#8208;old material is finally thinned down by seven orders of magnitude into a 65.5&#160;nm thick and 0.64 m2 large lamellar&#8208;thin framework (LTF). LTF exhibits a series of exceptional properties such as over&#8208;95% transparency, and seven times higher specific strength referred to steel. For the first time, cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) is utilized to observe commodity polymers directly. This new LDHA material is promising to expand the scale boundaries of both fundamental research and practical applications, not only for UHMWPE, but also for more commodity polymers to come.

         <title>An Advanced High&#8208;Entropy Fluorophosphate Cathode for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Increased Working Voltage and Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy effect is delicately introduced into fluorophosphate cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries by in situ partial substitution of active V central atom, preparing a high&#8208;entropy carbon&#8208;free Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 cathode, suppressing the occurrence of detrimental phase transition process in the low&#8208;voltage region, and further lifting up the mean working voltage of pristine Na3V2(PO4)2F3, enhancing sodium storage behavior, rate capability, and cycle performance.








Abstract
Impossible voltage plateau regulation for the cathode materials with fixed active elemental center is a pressing issue hindering the development of Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) cathodes in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a high&#8208;entropy substitution strategy, to alter the detailed crystal structure of NVPF without changing the central active V atom, is pioneeringly utilized, achieving simultaneous electronic conductivity enhancement and diffusion barrier reduction for Na+, according to theoretical calculations. The as&#8208;prepared carbon&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy Na3V1.9(Ca,Mg,Al,Cr,Mn)0.1(PO4)2F3 (HE&#8208;NVPF) cathode can deliver higher mean voltage of 3.81&#160;V and more advantageous energy density up to 445.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, which is attributed by the diverse transition&#8208;metal elemental substitution in high&#8208;entropy crystalline. More importantly, high&#8208;entropy introduction can help realize disordered rearrangement of Na+ at Na(2) active sites, thereby to refrain from unfavorable discharging behaviors at low&#8208;voltage region, further lifting up the mean working voltage to realize a full Na&#8208;ion storage at the high voltage plateau. Coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HE&#8208;NVPF//HC SIB full cells can deliver high specific energy density of 326.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 5 C with the power density of 2178.9 W kg&#8722;1. This route means the unlikely potential regulation in NASICON&#8208;type crystal with unchangeable active center becomes possible, inspiring new ideas on elevating the mean working voltage for SIB cathodes.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Artificial Hybrid Nanocells for Boosted Vascular Regeneration in Ischemic Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of stem cell&#8208;based therapeutics faces some bottleneck problem in the progression of cellular approaches. This study introduces a cell&#8208;like nanoparticle delivery system that is capable of recapitulating multiple cell functions, providing superior effects on targeting ischemic tissues and spatiotemporal triggering of vascular regeneration in ischemic tissues.








Abstract
Restoration of sufficient blood supply for the treatment of ischemia remains a significant scientific and clinical challenge. Here, a cell&#8208;like nanoparticle delivery technology is introduced that is capable of recapitulating multiple cell functions for the spatiotemporal triggering of vascular regeneration. Specifically, a copper&#8208;containing protein is successfully prepared using a recombinant protein scaffold based on a de novo design strategy, which facilitates the timely release of nitric oxide and improved accumulation of particles within ischemic tissues. Through closely mimicking physiological cues, the authors demonstrate the benefits of bioactive factors secreted from hypoxic stem cells on promoting angiogenesis. Following this cell&#8208;mimicking manner, artificial hybrid nanosized cells (Hynocell) are constructed by integrating the hypoxic stem cell secretome into nanoparticles with surface coatings of cell membranes fused with copper&#8208;containing protein. The Hynocell, hybridized with different cell&#8208;derived components, provides synergistic effects on targeting ischemic tissues and promoting vascular regeneration in acute hindlimb ischemia and acute myocardial infarction models. This study offers new insights into the utilization of nanotechnology to potentiate the development of cell&#8208;free therapeutics.

         <title>Flexible Electronics and Devices as Human&#8211;Machine Interfaces for Medical Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible electronics and devices could potentially revolutionize the paradigm and future direction of medical robotics. Herein, the materials, structures, and mechanisms in flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces used in prosthetic and rehabilitation robots are summarized in five primary areas: sensing, recording, communication, actuation, and stimulation. The current challenges and outlook of these technologies in medical robotics are discussed.

Medical robots are invaluable players in non&#8208;pharmaceutical treatment of disabilities. Particularly, using prosthetic and rehabilitation devices with human&#8211;machine interfaces can greatly improve the quality of life for impaired patients. In recent years, flexible electronic interfaces and soft robotics have attracted tremendous attention in this field due to their high biocompatibility, functionality, conformability, and low&#8208;cost. Flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces on soft robotics will make a promising alternative to conventional rigid devices, which can potentially revolutionize the paradigm and future direction of medical robotics in terms of rehabilitation feedback and user experience. In this review, the fundamental components of the materials, structures, and mechanisms in flexible human&#8208;machine interfaces are summarized by recent and renowned applications in five primary areas: physical and chemical sensing, physiological recording, information processing and communication, soft robotic actuation, and feedback stimulation. This review further concludes by discussing the outlook and current challenges of these technologies as a human&#8211;machine interface in medical robotics.

         <title>Fermi Level Pinning Dependent 2D Semiconductor Devices: Challenges and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New and in&#8208;depth insight into the fundamental mechanism of Fermi level pinning in 2D semiconductor devices is presented in this review. The related device characteristics and contact strategies utilizing both the Fermi level pinning and depinning are introduced.








Abstract
Motivated by the high expectation for efficient electrostatic modulation of charge transport at very low voltages, atomically thin 2D materials with a range of bandgaps are investigated extensively for use in future semiconductor devices. However, researchers face formidable challenges in 2D device processing mainly originated from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) structure of ultrathin 2D materials. As major challenges, untunable Schottky barrier height and the corresponding strong Fermi level pinning (FLP) at metal interfaces are observed unexpectedly with 2D vdW materials, giving rise to unmodulated semiconductor polarity, high contact resistance, and lowered device mobility. Here, FLP observed from recently developed 2D semiconductor devices is addressed differently from those observed from conventional semiconductor devices. It is understood that the observed FLP is attributed to inefficient doping into 2D materials, vdW gap present at the metal interface, and hybridized compounds formed under contacting metals. To provide readers with practical guidelines for the design of 2D devices, the impact of FLP occurring in 2D semiconductor devices is further reviewed by exploring various origins responsible for the FLP, effects of FLP on 2D device performances, and methods for improving metallic contact to 2D materials.

         <title>Selective Center Charge Density Enables Conductive 2D Metal&#8722;Organic Frameworks with Exceptionally High Pseudocapacitance and Energy Density for Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of selective center charge density to expand the traditional electrode materials to the electrode&#8722;electrolyte coupled system with prototypical of 2D Co&#8208;catecholate is proposed. The lower electron cloud density of the metal&#8208;ion center in the Z&#8208;axis provides the ability to attract a group of electron donors, leading to exceptionally high pseudocapacitance and energy density.








Abstract
Conductive 2D conjugated metal&#8722;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs) are attractive electrode materials due to their high intrinsic electrical conductivities, large specific surface area, and abundant unsaturated bonds/functional groups. However, the 2D c&#8208;MOFs reported so far have limited charge storage capacity during electrochemical charging and discharging, and the energy density is still unsatisfactory. In this work, a strategy of selective center charge density to expand the traditional electrode materials to the electrode&#8722;electrolyte coupled system with the prototypical of 2D Co&#8208;catecholate (Co&#8208;CAT) is proposed. Electrochemical mechanism studies and density functional theory calculations reveal that dual redox sites are achieved with the quinone groups (CAT) and metal&#8208;ion linkages (Co&#8722;O) serving as the active sites of pseudocapacitive cation (Na+) and redox electrolyte species (SO32&#8722;). The resultant electrode delivers an exceptionally high capacity of 1160 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and a special self&#8208;discharge rate (86.8% after 48&#160;h). Moreover, the packaged asymmetric device exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy density of 158 W h kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 2000 W kg&#8722;1 and an excellent self&#8208;discharge rate of 80.6% after 48 h. This success will provide a new perspective for the performance enhancement for the 2D&#8208;MOF&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism in Perylene Diimide Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic semiconductors with negligible spin&#8211;orbital couplings are potential materials for spintronics. Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism is revealed in perylene diimide (PDI) semiconductor with high mobility. PDI ferromagnets show Curie temperature of more than 400 K and saturation magnetization above 1 emu g&#8722;1. This work paves a new way to realize room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductors.








Abstract
The development of pure organic magnets with high Curie temperatures remains a challenging task in material science. Introducing high&#8208;density free radicals to strongly interacting organic molecules may be an effective method to this end. In this study, a solvothermal approach with excess hydrazine hydrate is used to concurrently reduce and dissolve rigid&#8208;backbone perylene diimide (PDI) crystallites into the soluble dianion species with a remarkably high reduction potential. The as&#8208;prepared PDI powders comprising radical anion aggregates are fabricated by a subsequent self&#8208;assembly and spontaneous oxidation process. The results of magnetic measurements show that the PDI powders exhibit room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism and a Curie temperature higher than 400 K, with a vast saturation magnetization that reaches &#8776;1.2 emu g&#8722;1. Elemental analysis along with the diamagnetic signal of the ablated residue are used to rule out the possibility that the magnetism is due to metal contamination. The findings suggest that the long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering can survive at room&#8208;temperature in organic semiconductors, and offers a new optional way to create room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductors.

Hygroscopic chemistry enables fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitors with a self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte. High&#8208;temperature&#8208;induced fire is a common safety risk that is extremely serious in energy storage devices. Here, a fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitor achieved by the self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte is reported, in which hygroscopic solute spontaneously absorbs water from the air as the solvent to recover the disenabled supercapacitor even after burning.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature&#8208;induced fire is an extremely serious safety risk in energy storage devices; which can be avoided by replacing their components with nonflammable materials. However; these devices are still destroyed by the high&#8208;temperature decomposition; lacking reliability. Here, a fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitor is further demonstrated that recovers after burning with a self&#8208;healable &#8220;solute&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221; electrolyte. Using fire&#8208;tolerant electrodes and separator with a semiopen device configuration; hygroscopic CaCl2 in the air (&#8220;CaCl2&#8208;in&#8208;air&#8221;) is designed as a self&#8208;healable electrolyte; which loses its water solvent at high temperatures but spontaneously absorbs water from the air to recover by itself at low temperatures. The supercapacitor is disenabled at 500 &#176;C; while it recovers after cooling in the air. Especially; it even recovers after burning at around 647 &#176;C with enhanced performance. The study offers a self&#8208;healing strategy to design high&#8208;safety; high&#8208;reliability; and fire&#8208;tolerant supercapacitors; which inspires a promising way to deal with general fire&#8208;related risks.

         <title>Synergy Between Palladium Single Atoms and Nanoparticles Via Hydrogen Spillover for Enhancing CO2 Photoreduction to CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Selective photoreduction of CO2 into carbon&#8208;neutral fuels (such as CH4) is extremely desirable but remains a challenge since sluggish multiple proton&#8208;electron coupling transfer and various C1 intermediates are involved. Herein, we present a synergistic function between single Pd atoms (Pd1) and Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) on C3N4 for photocatalytic CO2 methanation. The catalyst achieved a high selectivity of 97.8% for CH4 production with a yield of 20.3&#160;&#956;mol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. Mechanistic studies revealed that Pd1 sites activated CO2, while PdNPs sites boosted H2O dissociation for increased H* coverage. The H* produced by PdNPs migrated to the Pd1 sites to promote multiple proton&#8208;electron coupling transfer via hydrogen spillover. Moreover, the adjacent Pd1 and PdNPs effectively stabilized intermediates such as *CHO, thereby favoring the pathway for CH4 production. This work provides a new perspective into the development of selective photocatalytic CO2 conversion through the artful design of synergistic catalytic sites.

         <title>A van der Waals Interface Hosting Two Groups of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multiple magnetic skyrmion phases add an additional degree of freedom for skyrmion based ultrahigh&#8208;density spin memory devices. Extending the field to two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals magnets is a rewarding challenge, where the realizable degree of freedoms (e.g. thickness, twist angle and electrical gating) and high skyrmion density result in intriguing new properties and enhanced functionality. We&#160;report a van der Waals interface, formed by two 2D ferromagnets Cr2Ge2Te6 and Fe3GeTe2 with a Curie temperature of &#8764; 65 K and &#8764; 205 K, respectively, hosting two groups of magnetic skyrmions. Two sets of topological Hall effect signals are observed below 60 K when Cr2Ge2Te6 is magnetically ordered. These two groups of skyrmions are directly imaged using magnetic force microscopy, and supported by micromagnetic simulations. Interestingly, the magnetic skyrmions persist in the heterostructure in the remanent state with zero applied magnetic field. Our&#160;results are promising for the realization of skyrmionic devices based on van der Waals heterostructures hosting multiple skyrmion&#160;phases.

         <title>Anionic Lipid Nanoparticles Preferentially Deliver mRNA to the Hepatic Reticuloendothelial System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the leading non&#8208;viral technology for the delivery of exogenous RNA to target cells in vivo. As systemic delivery platforms, these technologies are exemplified by Onpattro&#174;, an approved LNP&#8208;based RNA interference (RNAi) therapy, administered intravenously and targeted to parenchymal liver cells. The discovery of systemically administered LNP technologies capable of preferential RNA delivery beyond hepatocytes has, however, proven more challenging. Here, preceded by comprehensive mechanistic understanding of in vivo nanoparticle biodistribution and bodily clearance, we rationally design an LNP&#8208;based mRNA delivery platform to preferentially target the hepatic reticuloendothelial system (RES). Evaluated in embryonic zebrafish, validated in mice and directly compared to LNP&#8208;mRNA systems based on the lipid composition of Onpattro&#174;, RES&#8208;targeted LNPs significantly enhance mRNA expression both globally within the liver and specifically within hepatic RES cell types. Hepatic RES targeting requires just a single lipid change within the formulation of Onpattro&#174; to switch LNP surface charge from neutral to anionic. This technology not only provides new opportunities to treat liver&#8208;specific and systemic diseases in which RES cell types play a key role but, more importantly, exemplifies that rational design of advanced RNA therapies must be preceded by a robust understanding of the dominant nano&#8208;bio interactions involved.

         <title>Versatile Polymer&#8208;Initiating Biomineralization for Tumor Blockade Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor blockade therapy is a promising penetration&#8208;independent antitumor modality, which effectively inhibits the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and information between the tumor and surrounding microenvironments. However, the current blockade therapy strategies have limited antitumor efficacy due to defects of inadequate tumor obstruction, possible side effects, and short duration. For these reasons, a facilely synthesized versatile polymer, 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;N&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;alendronate (DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;ALN, DPA), was developed to initiate the formation of biomineral shell around osteosarcoma as a potent physical barrier. The DSPE moiety shared a similar chemical structure with cytomembrane, allowing the membrane insertion of DPA. The bisphosphonic acid groups in ALN attracted ions to realize biomineralization around cells. After injection in the invasive osteosarcoma tissue, DPA inserted into the cytomembrane, induced continuous mineral deposition, and ultimately built a physical barrier around the tumor. Meanwhile, ALN in DPA alleviated bone destruction by suppressing the activity of osteoclasts. Through hindering the exchange of necessary substances, the biomineralization coating inhibited the growth of primary osteosarcoma and pulmonary metastasis simultaneously. Therefore, the multi&#8208;functional polymer&#8208;initiating blockade therapy provides a promising modality for tumor inhibition in clinic with high efficacy and negligible side effects.

         <title>Full&#8208;Dimensional Grain Boundary Stress Release for Flexible Perovskite Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics are strong potential candidates to drive low&#8208;power off&#8208;grid electronics for indoor applications. Compared with rigid devices, flexible perovskite devices can provide a more suitable surface for indoor small electronic devices, enabling them have a broader indoor application prospect. However, the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite photovoltaics is an urgent issue solved. Herein, we selected a kind of three&#8208;dimensional crosslinking agent named borax to carry out grain boundary penetration treatment on perovskite film to realize full&#8208;dimensional stress release. This strategy improves the mechanical and phase stabilities of perovskite films subjected to external forces or large temperature changes. The fabricated perovskite photovoltaics deliver a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.63% under AM 1.5G illumination, which is the highest one to date. The merit of low trap states under weak light makes the devices present a superior indoor PCE of 31.85% under 1062 lux (LED, 2956 K), which is currently the best flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaic device. This work provides a full&#8208;dimensional grain boundary stress release strategy for highly stable flexible perovskite indoor photovoltaics.
