Abstract
For preparing next&#8208;generation sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), the solvent&#8208;free manufacturing process have huge potential for the advantages of economic, thick electrode, and avoidance of organic solvents. However, the dominating solvent&#8208;free process is based on the fibrillation of polytetrafluoroethylene, suffering from poor mechanical property and electrochemical instability. Herein, a continuously solvent&#8208;free paradigm of fusion bonding technique is developed. A percolation network of thermoplastic polyamide (TPA) binder with low viscosity in viscous state is constructed with Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) by thermocompression (&#8804;5&#160;MPa), facilitating the formation of ultrathin LPSC film (&#8804;25&#160;&#956;m). This composite sulfide film (CSF) exhibits excellent mechanical properties, ionic conductivity (2.1 mS/cm), and unique stress&#8208;dissipation to promote interface stabilization. Thick LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 cathode can be prepared by this solvent&#8208;free method and tighly adhered to CSF by interfacial fusion of TPA for integrated battery. This integrated ASSB shows high&#8208;energy&#8208;density feasibility (&gt;2.5 mAh&#183;cm&#8722;2 after 1400 cycles of 9200 hours and run for more than 10&#8239;000 hours), and energy density of 390 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 and 1020 Wh&#183;L&#8722;1. More specially, high&#8208;voltage bipolar cell (&#8805;8.5&#160;V) and bulk&#8208;type pouch cell (326 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1) are facilely assembled with good cycling performance. This work inspires commercialization of ASSBs by a solvent&#8208;free method and provides beneficial guiding for stable batteries.

         <title>Phase Evolution of Multi&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides with Conversion&#8208;Alloying Hybrid Mechanism for Superior Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Traditional lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) anodes, whether intercalation&#8208;type like graphite or alloying&#8208;type like silicon, which employ a single lithium storage mechanism, are often limited by modest capacity or substantial volume changes. Here, we introduce the kesterite multi&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (CZTSSe) as an anode material that harnesses a conversion&#8208;alloying hybrid lithium storage mechanism. Results unveil that during the charge&#8208;discharge processes, the CZTSSe undergoes a comprehensive phase evolution, transitioning from kesterite structure to multiple dominant phases of sulfides, selenides, metals, and alloys. The involvement of multi&#8208;components facilitates electron transport and mitigates swelling stress; meanwhile, it results in the formation of abundant defects and heterojunctions, allowing for increased lithium storage active sites and reduced lithium diffusion barrier. The CZTSSe delivers a high specific capacity of up to 2266&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 while maintaining a stable output of 116&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 10000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1. It also demonstrates remarkable low&#8208;temperature performance, retaining 987&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 even after 600 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. When employed in full cells, a high specific energy of 562&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is achieved, rivalling many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art LIBs. This research offers valuable insights into the design of LIB electrodes leveraging multiple lithium storage mechanisms.

         <title>A Vacancy&#8208;Engineering Ferroelectric Nanomedicine for Cuproptosis/Apoptosis Co&#8208;Activated Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Low efficacy of immunotherapy due to the poor immunogenicity of most tumors and their insufficient infiltration by immune cells highlights the importance of inducing immunogenic cell death and activating immune system for achieving better treatment outcomes. Herein, ferroelectric Bi2CuO4 nanoparticles (NPs) with rich copper vacancies (named BCO&#8208;VCu) were rationally designed and engineered for ferroelectricity enhanced apoptosis, cuproptosis, and the subsequently evoked immunotherapy. In this structure, the suppressed recombination of the electron&#8211;hole pairs by the vacancies and the band bending by the ferroelectric polarization lead to high catalytic activiy, triggering reactive oxygen species bursts and inducing apoptosis. The cell fragments produced by apoptosis serve as antigens to activate T cells. Moreover, due to the generated charge by the ferroelectric catalysis, this nanomedicine can act as &#8220;a smart switch&#8221; to open the cell membrane, promote nanomaterial endocytosis, and shut down the Cu+ outflow pathway to evoke cuproptosis, and thus a strong immune response is triggered by the reduced content of adenosine triphosphate. Ribonucleic acid transcription tests reveal the pathways related to immune response activation. Thus, our study firstly demonstrates a feasible strategy for enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy using single ferroelectric semiconductor&#8211;induced apoptosis and cuproptosis.

         <title>Freestanding Ammonium Vanadate Composite Cathodes with Lattice Self&#8208;Regulation and ion&#8208;exchange for Long&#8208;Lasting Ca&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Calcium&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) have emerged as a promising alternative for electrochemical energy storage. The lack of high&#8208;performance cathode materials severely limits the development of CIBs. Vanadium oxides are particularly attractive as cathode materials for CIBs, and pre&#8208;insertion chemistry is often used to improve their calcium storage performance. However, the room temperature cycling lifespan of vanadium oxides in organic electrolytes still falls short of 1,000 cycles. Here, based on pre&#8208;insertion chemistry, we further improved the cycling life of vanadium oxides by integrated electrode and electrolyte engineering. Utilizing a tailored Ca electrolyte, the constructed freestanding (NH4)2V6O16&#183;1.35H2O@graphene oxide@carbon nanotubes (NHVO&#8208;H@GO@CNT) composite cathode achieves a 305 mAh g&#8722;1 high capacity and 10,000 cycles record&#8208;long life. Additionally, for the first time, a Ca&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor full cell is assembled and delivers a capacity of 62.8 mAh g&#8722;1. The calcium storage mechanism of NHVO&#8208;H@GO@CNT based on a two&#8208;phase reaction and the exchange of NH4+ and Ca2+ during cycling are revealed. The lattice self&#8208;regulation of V&#8208;O layers is observed and the layered vanadium oxides with Ca2+ pillars formed by ion exchange exhibits higher capacity. This work provides novel strategies to enhance the calcium storage performance of vanadium oxides via integrated structural design of electrodes and electrolytes modification.

         <title>Correlating Aggregation Ability of Polymer Donors with Film Formation Kinetics for Organic Solar Cells with Improved Efficiency and Processability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Film formation kinetics significantly impact the molecular processability and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this article, we report two kinds of ternary random copolymerization polymers, D18&#8208;N&#8208;p and D18&#8208;N&#8208;m, to modulate the aggregation ability of the conventional polymer donor D18 by introducing trifluoromethyl substituted pyridine unit at para&#8208; and meta&#8208;position, respectively. The introduction of the pyridine unit significantly reduced material aggregation ability and adjusted the interactions with acceptor L8&#8208;BO, thereby leading to largely changed film formation kinetics with earlier phase separation and longer film formation times, which enlarged fiber sizes in blend films and improved carrier generation and transport. As a result, D18&#8208;N&#8208;p with moderate aggregation ability delivered a high PCE of 18.82% by pairing with L8&#8208;BO, which was further improved to 19.45% via interface engineering. Despite the slightly inferior small area device performances, D18&#8208;N&#8208;m showed improved solubility, which inspired us to adjust the ratio of meta&#8208;trifluoromethyl pyridine carefully and obtain a polymer donor D18&#8208;N&#8208;m&#8208;10 with good solubility in non&#8208;halogenated solvent o&#8208;xylene. High PCEs of 13.07% and 12.43% in 1 cm2 device and 43 cm2 module fabricated with slot&#8208;die coating method were achieved based on D18&#8208;N&#8208;m&#8208;10: L8&#8208;BO blends. Our work emphasizes film formation kinetics optimization in device fabrication via aggregation ability modulation of polymer donors for efficient devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Film formation kinetics significantly impact the molecular processability and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this article, we report two kinds of ternary random copolymerization polymers, D18-N-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; and D18-N-&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;, to modulate the aggregation ability of the conventional polymer donor D18 by introducing trifluoromethyl substituted pyridine unit at &lt;i&gt;para-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;meta-&lt;/i&gt;position, respectively. The introduction of the pyridine unit significantly reduced material aggregation ability and adjusted the interactions with acceptor L8-BO, thereby leading to largely changed film formation kinetics with earlier phase separation and longer film formation times, which enlarged fiber sizes in blend films and improved carrier generation and transport. As a result, D18-N-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; with moderate aggregation ability delivered a high PCE of 18.82% by pairing with L8-BO, which was further improved to 19.45% via interface engineering. Despite the slightly inferior small area device performances, D18-N-&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; showed improved solubility, which inspired us to adjust the ratio of meta-trifluoromethyl pyridine carefully and obtain a polymer donor D18-N-&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-10 with good solubility in non-halogenated solvent &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-xylene. High PCEs of 13.07% and 12.43% in 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; device and 43 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; module fabricated with slot-die coating method were achieved based on D18-N-&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;-10: L8-BO blends.

         <title>Surface Reconstruction for Efficient NiOx&#8208;based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Functional agents have been verified to efficiently enhance device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through surface engineering. However, the influence of intrinsic characteristics of molecules on final device performance has been overlooked. Here, we develop a surface reconstruction strategy to enhance the efficiency of inverted PSCs by mitigating the adverse effects of lead chelation (LC) molecules. We choose bathocuproine (BCP), as the representative of LC molecules for its easy accessibility and outstanding optoelectronic properties. During this strategy, BCP molecules on perovskite surface are first dissolved in solvents and then captured specially by undercoordinated Pb2+ ions, preventing adverse n&#8208;type doping by the molecules themselves. In this case, the BCP molecule exhibits outstanding passivation effect on perovskite surface, which leads to an obviously increased open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC). Therefore, a record PCE of 25.64% for NiOx&#8208;based inverted PSCs is achieved, maintaining over 80% of initial efficiency after exposure to ambient condition for &#8764;1500 hours.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anode Based on Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The performance of lithium metal batteries is severely hampered by uncontrollable dendrite growth and volume change within the anode. This work tackles these obstacles by introducing a novel strategy: applying an isotropic and internal grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;free layer, specifically, a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass layer with nano&#8208;porosity onto the electrochemical plated lithium metal anode. Both ab initio and classical molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the MOF glass layer makes the lithium transport smooth and uniform via its internal monolithic and interfacial advantages. This MOF glass layer with the fast and more uniform lithium diffusion in the monolithic interior and its interface enables dendrite&#8208;free lithium plating and stripping through surface confinement effect and interfacial effect. When employed in symmetric batteries, the achieved Li metal anode can operate over 300 hours at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The full batteries matched with LiFePO4 exhibit high capacity (148 mAh g&#8722;1), excellent rate performance (61 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C), and outstanding cycling stability (with capacity retention of &#8764;90% after 1000 cycles). The full batteries matched with high&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 also show superior performances. Therefore, the strategy of utilizing a MOF glass layer enables the development of high&#8208;performance lithium metal anodes.

         <title>Visualizing the Internal Nanocrystallinity of Calcite Due to Nonclassical Crystallization by 3D Coherent X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcite particles are synthesized using two approaches and their 3D internal crystalline structure is characterized using coherent X&#8208;ray imaging. A defects&#8217; analysis reveals the existence of multiple domains for the samples synthesized under nonequilibrium conditions with the presence of null electron density regions, while the particles synthesized under near&#8208;equilibrium conditions show a much less defective structure.








Abstract
The internal crystallinity of calcite is investigated for samples synthesized using two approaches: precipitation from solution and the ammonium carbonate diffusion method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses reveal that the calcite products precipitated using both approaches have a well&#8208;defined rhombohedron shape, consistent with the euhedral crystal habit of the mineral. The internal structure of these calcite crystals is characterized using Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) to determine the 3D electron density and the atomic displacement field. BCDI reconstructions for crystals synthesized using the ammonium carbonate diffusion approach have the expected euhedral shape, with internal strain fields and few internal defects. In contrast, the crystals synthesized by precipitation from solution have very complex external shapes and defective internal structures, presenting null electron density regions and pronounced displacement field distributions. These heterogeneities are interpreted as multiple crystalline domains, created by a nonclassical crystallization mechanism, where smaller nanoparticles coalescence into the final euhedral particles. The combined use of SEM, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and BCDI allows for structurally differentiating calcite crystals grown with different approaches, opening new opportunities to understand how grain boundaries and internal defects alter calcite reactivity.

         <title>Polarization Saturation in Multilayered Interfacial Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that rhombohedral layers of binary compounds exhibit polarization saturation beyond a critical stack thickness. The underlying saturation mechanism points to a purely electronic redistribution involving bandgap closure that allows for cross&#8208;stack charge transfer and the emergence of free surface charge. The findings, which are of general nature, should be accounted for when designing switching and/or conductive devices based on ferroelectric layered materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals polytypes of broken inversion and mirror symmetries &#160;have been recently shown to exhibit switchable electric polarization even at the ultimate two&#8208;layer thin limit. Their out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization has been found to accumulate in a ladder&#8208;like fashion with each successive layer, offering 2D building blocks for the bottom&#8208;up construction of 3D ferroelectrics. Here, it is demonstrated experimentally that beyond a critical stack thickness, the accumulated polarization in rhombohedral polytypes of molybdenum disulfide saturates. The underlying saturation mechanism, deciphered via density functional theory and self&#8208;consistent Poisson&#8211;Schr&#246;dinger calculations, point to a purely electronic redistribution involving: 1.&#160;Polarization&#8208;induced bandgap closure that allows for cross&#8208;stack charge transfer and the emergence of free surface charge; 2. Reduction of the polarization saturation value, as well as the critical thickness at which it is obtained, by the presence of free carriers. The resilience of polar layered structures to atomic surface reconstruction, which is essentially unavoidable in polar 3D crystals, potentially allows for the design of new devices with mobile surface charges. The findings, which are of general nature, should be accounted for when designing switching and/or conductive devices based on ferroelectric layered materials.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Matching Metal&#8208;Ion Organic Hybrid Interface to Enhance Energy Storage of Polymer&#8208;Based Composite Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the interfacial mismatch between nanosheets and polymers in nanocomposite dielectrics, a &#8220;Metal&#8208;Ion Organic Hybrid Interface&#8221; (MOHI) between nanosheets and polymers is designed. The outstanding energy storage density &#8776;4.75 J cm&#8722;3 with high efficiency of &gt;90% is achieved at 150&#160;&#176;C, which is more than ten times that of polyimide (PI).








Abstract
In this work, a distinctive &#8220;metal&#8208;ion organic hybrid interface&#8221; (MOHI) between polyimide (PI) and calcium niobate (CNO) nanosheets is designed. The metal ions in the MOHI can achieve atomic&#8208;level matching not only with the inorganic CNO, but also with the PI chains, forming uniform and strong chemical bonds. These results are demonstrated by experiment and theory calculations. Significantly, the MOHI reduces the free volume and introduces deep traps across the filler&#8208;matrix interfacial area, thus suppressing the electric field distortion in PI&#8208;based composite dielectrics. Consequently, PI&#8208;based dielectric containing the MOHI exhibits excellent energy storage performance. The energy storage densities (Ue) of the composite dielectric reach 9.42 J cm&#8722;3 and 4.75 J cm&#8722;3 with energy storage efficiency (&#951;) of 90% at 25&#160;&#176;C and 150&#160;&#176;C respectively, which are 2.6 and 11.6 times higher than those of pure PI. This study provides new ideas for polymer&#8208;based composite dielectrics in high energy storage.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Helicoidal Nanocellulose&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Compartment Assemblies with Tunable Chiroptical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly and grazing incidence spraying is used to fabricate organized nanocellulose&#8208;based structures with nanoscale controlled helicoidal arrangement of cellulose nanofibrils. Experimental results demonstrate that this additive manufacturing approach allows for high tunability in layer composition and structure, resulting in nanocomposite films with complex controlled internal structures and tailored chiroptical properties.








Abstract
Cellulose&#8208;based nanocomposites are highly appealing for the development of next&#8208;generation sustainable functional materials. Although many advances have been made in this direction, the true potential of fibrillar nanocomposites has yet to be realized because available fabrication approaches are inadequate for achieving precise structural control at the sub&#8208;micrometer scale. Here a spray&#8208;assisted alignment methodology of cellulose nanofibrils is combined with the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly into an additive manufacturing process in which the alignment direction of each cellulose layer is rationally selected to achieve thin films with a helicoidal arrangement of the nanofibrils. The helicoidal structure of the films is verified by measuring the circular dichroism (CD) of the samples. The sign and position of the structural CD peak show that the handedness and the pitch of the chiral structures can be easily tuned by deliberately selecting simple parameters, such as the number of consecutive cellulose layers sprayed in the same direction, and the angle of rotation between successive stacks of layers. To the authors&#8217; knowledge, this approach is unique as it offers the possibility to prepare complex nanocomposite architectures with various nanoscale&#8208;controlled sub&#8208;structures from different anisometric objects, which is enabling novel designs of composite films with damage&#8208;resistant and/or optical filtering functionalities.

         <title>2D Free&#8208;Standing GeS1&#8722;xSex with Composition&#8208;Tunable Bandgap for Tailored Polarimetric Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The free&#8208;standing GeS1&#8722;xSex nanoplates are grown by low&#8208;pressure rapid physical vapor deposition (LPRPVD). Tailored polarimetric optoelectronic properties of GeS1&#8722;xSex&#8208;based devices are achieved under the modulation of composition&#8208;dependent electronic band structure. These results verify that free&#8208;standing GeS1&#8722;xSex nanoplates possess promising potential in tailored polarimetric optoelectronics and type&#8208;III heterostructure phototransistors with tunable electrical properties.








Abstract
Germanium&#8208;based monochalcogenides (i.e., GeS and GeSe) with desirable properties are promising candidates for the development of next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices. However, they are still stuck with challenges, such as relatively fixed electronic band structure, unconfigurable optoelectronic characteristics, and difficulty in achieving free&#8208;standing growth. Herein, it is demonstrated that two&#8208;dimensional (2D) free&#8208;standing GeS1&#8722;xSex (0 &#8804; x &#8804;&#8201;1) nanoplates can be grown by low&#8208;pressure rapid physical vapor deposition (LPRPVD), fulfilling a continuously composition&#8208;tunable optical bandgap and electronic band structure. By leveraging the synergistic effect of composition&#8208;dependent modulation and free&#8208;standing growth, GeS1&#8722;xSex&#8208;based optoelectronic devices exhibit significantly configurable hole mobility from 6.22 &#215; 10&#8722;4 to 1.24 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8315;1 and tunable responsivity from 8.6 to 311 A&#160;W&#8722;1 (635&#160;nm), as x varies from 0 to 1. Furthermore, the polarimetric sensitivity can be tailored from 4.3 (GeS0.29Se0.71) to 1.8 (GeSe) benefiting from alloy engineering. Finally, the tailored imaging capability is also demonstrated to show the application potential of GeS1&#8722;xSex alloy nanoplates. This work broadens the functionality of conventional binary materials and motivates the development of tailored polarimetric optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Reprocessability in Engineering Thermosets Achieved Through Frontal RingOpening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) is shown to be an effective technique to manufacture high&#8208;performance poly(dicyclopentadiene) (pDCPD) thermosets with regenerative capabilities. The rapid curing of FROMP preserves the metathesis used to make the material, allowing effective reclamation of pDCPD performance across multiple generations. The strategy is simple and holds real promise to tackle end&#8208;of&#8208;life management challenges in industrial materials.








Abstract
While valued for their durability and exceptional performance, crosslinked thermosets are challenging to recycle and reuse. Here, inherent reprocessability in industrially relevant polyolefin thermosetsis unveiled. Unlike prior methods, this approach eliminates the need to introduce exchangeable functionality to regenerate the material, relying instead on preserving the activity of the metathesis catalyst employed in the curing reaction. Frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) proves critical to preserving this activity. Conditions controlling catalytic viability are explored to successfully reclaim performance across multiple generations of material, thus demonstrating long&#8208;term reprocessability. This straightforward and scalable remolding strategy is poised for widespread adoption. Given the anticipated growth in polyolefin thermosets, these findings represent an important conceptual advance in the pursuit of a fully circular lifecycle for thermoset polymers.

         <title>High Performance As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells Enabled by a Refined Double&#8208;Fibril Network Morphology and Improved Dielectric Constant of Active Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;cast organic solar cell with a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) is constructed via introducing a novel polymer acceptor (PY&#8208;TPT) into the D18:L8&#8208;BO blend to form a favorable double&#8208;fibril network morphology. Consequently, the as&#8208;cast device affords a champion PCE of 18.60% and excellent device stability, which bring new insights into the construction of efficient as&#8208;cast device.








Abstract
High performance organic solar cells (OSCs) are usually realized by using post&#8208;treatment and/or additive, which can induce the formation of metastable morphology, leading to unfavorable device stability. In terms of the industrial production, the development of high efficiency as&#8208;cast OSCs is crucially important, but it remains a great challenge to obtain appropriate active layer morphology and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, efficient as&#8208;cast OSCs are constructed via introducing a new polymer acceptor PY&#8208;TPT with a high dielectric constant into the D18:L8&#8208;BO blend to form a double&#8208;fibril network morphology. Besides, the incorporation of PY&#8208;TPT enables an enhanced dielectric constant and lower exciton binding energy of active layer. Therefore, efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport are realized in D18:L8&#8208;BO:PY&#8208;TPT&#8208;based device, affording a record&#8208;high PCE of 18.60% and excellent photostability in absence of post&#8208;treatment. Moreover, green solvent&#8208;processed devices, thick&#8208;film (300&#160;nm) devices, and module (16.60 cm2) are fabricated, which show PCEs of 17.45%, 17.54%, and 13.84%, respectively. This work brings new insight into the construction of efficient as&#8208;cast devices, pushing forward the practical application of OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;As-cast organic solar cell with a record-high power conversion efficiency (PCE) is constructed via introducing a novel polymer acceptor (PY-TPT) into the D18:L8-BO blend to form a favorable double-fibril network morphology. Consequently, the as-cast device affords a champion PCE of 18.60% and excellent device stability, which bring new insights into the construction of efficient as-cast device.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High performance organic solar cells (OSCs) are usually realized by using post-treatment and/or additive, which can induce the formation of metastable morphology, leading to unfavorable device stability. In terms of the industrial production, the development of high efficiency as-cast OSCs is crucially important, but it remains a great challenge to obtain appropriate active layer morphology and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, efficient as-cast OSCs are constructed via introducing a new polymer acceptor PY-TPT with a high dielectric constant into the D18:L8-BO blend to form a double-fibril network morphology. Besides, the incorporation of PY-TPT enables an enhanced dielectric constant and lower exciton binding energy of active layer. Therefore, efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport are realized in D18:L8-BO:PY-TPT-based device, affording a record-high PCE of 18.60% and excellent photostability in absence of post-treatment. Moreover, green solvent-processed devices, thick-film (300&#160;nm) devices, and module (16.60 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) are fabricated, which show PCEs of 17.45%, 17.54%, and 13.84%, respectively.

         <title>Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Colloidal QD Photodetector with Nanosecond Response Times Enabled by Ultrathin Absorber Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The record 4 ns response time in colloidal quantum dot photodiodes (QDPDs) that operate at short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) wavelengths is reported, the first result reaching the requirement of SWIR light detection and ranging based on colloidal QDs. These ultrafast QDPDs combine a thin active layer to reduce the carrier transport time and a small area to inhibit slow capacitive discharging.








Abstract
Ultrafast short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) photodetection is of great interest for emerging automated vision and spatial mapping technologies. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) stand out for SWIR photodetection compared to epitaxial (In,Ga)As or (Hg,Cd)Te semiconductors by their combining a size&#8208;tunable bandgap and a suitability for cost&#8208;effective, solution&#8208;based processing. However, achieving ultrafast, nanosecond&#8208;level response time has remained an outstanding challenge for QD&#8208;based SWIR photodiodes (QDPDs). Here, record 4&#160;ns response time in PbS&#8208;based QDPDs that operate at SWIR wavelengths is reported, a result reaching the requirement of SWIR light detection and ranging based on colloidal QDs. These ultrafast QDPDs combine a thin active layer to reduce the carrier transport time and a small area to inhibit slow capacitive discharging. By implementing a concentration gradient ligand exchange method, high&#8208;quality p&#8211;n junctions are fabricated in these ultrathin QDPDs. Moreover, these ultrathin QDPDs attain an external quantum efficiency of 42% at 1330&#160;nm, due to a 2.5&#8208;fold enhanced light absorption through the formation of a Fabry&#8211;Perot cavity within the QDPD and the highly efficient extraction (98%) of photogenerated charge carriers. Based on these results, it is estimated that a further increase of the charge&#8208;carrier mobility can lead to PbS QDPDs with sub&#8208;nanosecond response time.

         <title>Nonlinear Elastic Bottlebrush Polymer Hydrogels Modulate Actomyosin Mediated Protrusion Formation in Mesenchymal Stromal Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear elastic extracellular matrix properties are difficult to recapitulate without the use of fibrous architectures, which couple strain&#8208;stiffening and stress&#8208;relaxation. Herein, bottlebrush polymer hydrogels are used to isolate and tune the strain&#8208;stiffening biomechanical feedback sensed by human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) in non&#8208;fibrous engineered microenvironments. Nonlinear elastic mechanics induces a protrusion&#8208;rich hMSC phenotype regulated by focal adhesions and actomyosin dynamics.








Abstract
The nonlinear elasticity of many tissue&#8208;specific extracellular matrices is difficult to recapitulate without the use of fibrous architectures, which couple strain&#8208;stiffening with stress relaxation. Herein, bottlebrush polymers are synthesized and crosslinked to form poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based hydrogels and used to study how strain&#8208;stiffening behavior affects human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). By tailoring the bottlebrush polymer length, the critical stress associated with the onset of network stiffening is systematically varied, and a unique protrusion&#8208;rich hMSC morphology emerges only at critical stresses within a biologically accessible stress regime. Local cell&#8208;matrix interactions are quantified using 3D traction force microscopy and small molecule inhibitors are used to identify cellular machinery that plays a critical role in hMSC mechanosensing of the engineered, strain&#8208;stiffening microenvironment. Collectively, this study demonstrates how covalently crosslinked bottlebrush polymer hydrogels can recapitulate strain&#8208;stiffening biomechanical cues at biologically relevant stresses and be used to probe how nonlinear elastic matrix properties regulate cellular processes.

         <title>Seeding Atomic Silver into Internal Lattice Sites of Transition Metal Oxide for Advanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates how the internal lattice sites of transition metal oxide, more specifically, MnO2, can be utilized for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) by accommodating atomic Ag catalysts within its sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel space. A dual&#8208;form Ag catalyst featuring faceted Ag nanoparticles on MnO2 surface and atomic Ag strings within MnO2 tunnels is thus designed with high eCO2RR performance.








Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are widely studied for loading of various catalysts due to their low cost and high structure flexibility. However, the prevailing close&#8208;packed nature of most TMOs crystals has restricted the available loading sites to surface only, while their internal bulk lattice remains unactuated due to the inaccessible narrow space that blocks out most key reactants and/or particulate catalysts. Herein, using tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2, this study demonstrates how TMO's internal lattice space can be activated as extra loading sites for atomic Ag in addition to the conventional surface&#8208;only loading, via which a dual&#8208;form Ag catalyst within MnO2 skeleton is established. In this design, not only faceted Ag nanoparticles are confined onto MnO2 surface by coherent lattice&#8208;sharing, Ag atomic strings are also seeded deep into the sub&#8208;nanoscale MnO2 tunnel lattice, enriching the catalytically active sites. Tested for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), such dual&#8208;form catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency (94%), yield (67.3&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and durability (&#8776;48&#160;h) for CO production, exceeding commercial Ag nanoparticles and most Ag&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations further reveal the concurrent effect of such dual&#8208;form catalyst featuring facet&#8208;dependent eCO2RR for Ag nanoparticles and lattice&#8208;confined eCO2RR for Ag atomic strings, inspiring the future design of catalyst&#8211;substrate configuration.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Electrolyte Additive Design for Long Life Alkaline Zinc Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article demonstrates a dual&#8208;function additive strategy aimed at addressing the capacity loss in alkaline aqueous zinc&#8208;based flow batteries (AZFBs) during long&#8208;duration operations in real&#8208;world applications. This dual&#8208;function additive promotes uniform zinc deposition, slows down corrosion in alkaline environments, and inhibits the formation of dead zinc, thereby enhancing the capacity retention of AZFBs and significantly extending their battery cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;based flow batteries (AZFBs) have emerged as a promising electrochemical energy storage technology owing to Zn abundance, high safety, and low cost. However, zinc dendrite growth and the formation of dead zinc greatly impede the development of AZFBs. Herein, a dual&#8208;function electrolyte additive strategy is proposed to regulate zinc nucleation and mitigate the hydroxide corrosion of zinc depositions for stable AZFBs. This strategy, as exemplified by urea, introduces an electrolyte additive to coordinate with Zn2+/Zn with proper strength, slowing zinc deposition kinetics to induce uniform nucleation and protecting the deposited zinc surface from attack by hydroxide ions through preferable adsorption. The zincate complexes with urea are identified to be Zn(OH)2(urea)(H2O)2 and Zn2(OH)4(H2O)4(urea), which exhibit slow zinc deposition kinetics, allowing instantaneous nucleation. Calculation results reveal an additional energy barrier of 1.29&#160;eV for the subsequent adsorption of an OH&#8722; group when a urea molecule absorbs on the zinc cluster, significantly mitigating the formation of dead zinc. Consequently, prolonged cell cycling of the prototype alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow battery demonstrates stable operation for over 130 h and an average coulombic efficiency of 98.5%. It is anticipated that this electrolyte additive strategy will pave the way for developing highly stable AZFBs.

The zincate complexes with urea are identified to be Zn(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(urea)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(urea), which exhibit slow zinc deposition kinetics, allowing instantaneous nucleation. Calculation results reveal an additional energy barrier of 1.29&#160;eV for the subsequent adsorption of an OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; group when a urea molecule absorbs on the zinc cluster, significantly mitigating the formation of dead zinc. Consequently, prolonged cell cycling of the prototype alkaline zinc-iron flow battery demonstrates stable operation for over 130 h and an average coulombic efficiency of 98.5%. It is anticipated that this electrolyte additive strategy will pave the way for developing highly stable AZFBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrically Conductive Collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS Hydrogel Prevents Post&#8208;Infarct Cardiac Arrhythmia and Supports hiPSC&#8208;Cardiomyocyte Function</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrically conductive hydrogel is developed to prevent arrhythmia after myocardial infarction (MI), allowing human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#8208;cardiomyocyte function and maturation. Incorporation of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) in collagen results in a hydrogel with different microstructure, enhanced gelation kinetics, and increased conductivity. hiPSC&#8208;cardiomyocytes exhibit in this hydrogel mature sarcomeric structures and enhanced calcium handling. Transplanting collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels is sufficient to protect the infarcted heart against ventricular tachycardia.








Abstract
Myocardial infarction (MI) causes cell death, disrupts electrical activity, triggers arrhythmia, and results in heart failure, whereby 50&#8211;60% of MI&#8208;associated deaths manifest as sudden cardiac deaths (SCD). The most effective therapy for SCD prevention is implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). However, ICDs contribute to adverse remodeling and disease progression and do not prevent arrhythmia. This work develops an injectable collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) hydrogel that protects infarcted hearts against ventricular tachycardia (VT) and can be combined with human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#8208;cardiomyocytes to promote partial cardiac remuscularization. PEDOT:PSS improves collagen gel formation, micromorphology, and conductivity. hiPSC&#8208;cardiomyocytes in collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels exhibit near&#8208;adult sarcomeric length, improved contractility, enhanced calcium handling, and conduction velocity. RNA&#8208;sequencing data indicate enhanced maturation and improved cell&#8208;matrix interactions. Injecting collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels in infarcted mouse hearts decreases VT to the levels of healthy hearts. Collectively, collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels offer a versatile platform for treating cardiac injuries.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Modulating of Ionic AIE Photosensitizers for Enhanced ROS Generation and NIR&#8208;II Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation induced emission photosensitizer, DTP&#8208;In, is constructed with strong dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) donor and indolium (In) acceptor, achieving redshift in absorption and emission wavelength and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rate simultaneously. DTP&#8208;In can self&#8208;assemble into positively charged nanoaggregates in aqueous solutions and specifically target to the mitochondria, leading to enhanced photodynamic therapy effect under 660 nm laser irradiation.








Abstract
Photosensitizers (PSs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics are competitive candidates for bioimaging and therapeutic applications. However, their short emission wavelength and nonspecific organelle targeting hinder their therapeutic effectiveness. Herein, a donor&#8211;acceptor modulation approach is reported to construct a series of ionic AIE photosensitizers with enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) outcomes and fluorescent emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. By employing dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) and indolium (In) as the strong donor and acceptor, respectively, the compound DTP&#8208;In exhibits a substantial redshift in absorption and fluorescent emission reach to NIR&#8208;II region. The reduced energy gap between singlet and triplet states in DTP&#8208;In also increases the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rate. Further, DTP&#8208;In can self&#8208;assemble in aqueous solutions, forming positively charged nanoaggregates, which are superior to conventional encapsulated nanoparticles in cellular uptake and mitochondrial targeting. Consequently, DTP&#8208;In aggregates show efficient photodynamic ablation of 4T1 cancer cells and outstanding tumor theranostic in vivo under 660&#160;nm laser irradiation. This work highlights the potential of molecular engineering of donor&#8211;acceptor AIE PSs with multiple functionalities, thereby facilitating the development of more effective strategies for cancer therapy.

         <title>Primary Human Breast Cancer&#8208;Associated Endothelial Cells Favor Interactions with Nanomedicines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor blood vessels are barriers for nanomedicines en route to solid tumors. This study indicates that primary human breast tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells exhibit higher nanoparticle uptake efficiency than normal mammary microvascular endothelial cells, along with an increased number of intracellular vesicles and upregulated transport&#8208;related genes. These findings may advance the development of safer and more effective cancer nanomedicines.








Abstract
Cancer nanomedicines predominately rely on transport processes controlled by tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells to deliver therapeutic and diagnostic payloads into solid tumors. While the dominant role of this class of endothelial cells for nanoparticle transport and tumor delivery is established in animal models, the translational potential in human cells needs exploration. Using primary human breast cancer as a model, the differential interactions of normal and tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells with clinically relevant nanomedicine formulations are explored and quantified. Primary human breast cancer&#8208;associated endothelial cells exhibit up to &#8776;2&#160;times higher nanoparticle uptake than normal human mammary microvascular endothelial cells. Super&#8208;resolution imaging studies reveal a significantly higher intracellular vesicle number for tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells, indicating a substantial increase in cellular transport activities. RNA sequencing and gene expression analysis indicate the upregulation of transport&#8208;related genes, especially motor protein genes, in tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells. Collectively, the results demonstrate that primary human breast cancer&#8208;associated endothelial cells exhibit enhanced interactions with nanomedicines, suggesting a potentially significant role for these cells&#160;in nanoparticle tumor delivery in human patients. Engineering nanoparticles that leverage the translational potential of tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cell&#8208;mediated transport into human solid tumors may lead to the development of safer and more effective clinical cancer nanomedicines.

         <title>A Precursor&#8208;derived Ultramicroporous Carbon for Printing Iontronic Logic Gates and Super&#8208;Varactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
We present a liquid precursor for 3D printing ultramicroporous carbons (pore width &lt; 0.7&#160;nm) to create a novel in&#8208;plane capacitive&#8208;analogue of semiconductor&#8208;based diodes (CAPodes). This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept integrates functional EDLCs into microstructured iontronic devices. The working principle is based on selective ion&#8208;sieving, controlling the size of the electrolyte ions and the nanoporous sieving carbon's pore size. By blocking bulky electrolyte ions from entering the sub&#8208;nanometer pores, a unidirectional charging characteristic with controllable ion flux is achieved, leading to diodic U&#8208;I characteristics with high rectification ratio. The liquid precursor approach enables successful printing of miniaturized in&#8208;plane CAPodes. A combination of inkjet and extrusion printing techniques with suitable inks was explored to fabricate electrode materials with engineered porosity. Deliberate fine&#8208;tuning of the ultramicroporous carbon's porosity and surface area was achieved using a customized carbon precursor and CO2 etching techniques. Electrochemical evaluation of the printed CAPodes demonstrated successful miniaturization compared with macroscopic film assembly. 3D manufacturing and miniaturization allow for the integration of CAPodes into logic gate circuits (OR, AND). For the first time, these switchable devices are used as variable capacitors in a high&#8208;pass filter application, adjusting the cut&#8208;off frequency of applied alternating voltage analogous to an I&#8208;MOS varactor.

         <title>Swarm Autonomy: From Agent Functionalization to Machine Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Swarm behaviors observed in nature have inspired the development of synthetic swarms. This review covers key aspects of synthetic swarms, including features of individual agents, external stimuli, swarm behaviors, and applications, examines underlying mechanisms of swarm generation and the emergence of machine intelligence, and envisions the realization of swarm autonomy.








Abstract
Swarm behaviors are common in nature, where individual organisms collaborate via perception, communication, and adaptation. Emulating these dynamics, large groups of active agents can self&#8208;organize through localized interactions, giving rise to complex swarm behaviors, which exhibit potential for applications across various domains. This review presents a comprehensive summary and perspective of synthetic swarms, to bridge the gap between the microscale individual agents and potential applications of synthetic swarms.

     alt="Swarm Autonomy: From Agent Functionalization to Machine Intelligence"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm behaviors observed in nature have inspired the development of synthetic swarms. This review covers key aspects of synthetic swarms, including features of individual agents, external stimuli, swarm behaviors, and applications, examines underlying mechanisms of swarm generation and the emergence of machine intelligence, and envisions the realization of swarm autonomy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swarm behaviors are common in nature, where individual organisms collaborate via perception, communication, and adaptation. Emulating these dynamics, large groups of active agents can self-organize through localized interactions, giving rise to complex swarm behaviors, which exhibit potential for applications across various domains. This review presents a comprehensive summary and perspective of synthetic swarms, to bridge the gap between the microscale individual agents and potential applications of synthetic swarms. It is begun by examining active agents, the fundamental units of synthetic swarms, to understand the origins of their motility and functionality in the presence of external stimuli. Then inter-agent communications and agent-environment communications that contribute to the swarm generation are summarized. Furthermore, the swarm behaviors reported to date and the emergence of machine intelligence within these behaviors are reviewed. Eventually, the applications enabled by distinct synthetic swarms are summarized. By discussing the emergent machine intelligence in swarm behaviors, insights are offered into the design and deployment of autonomous synthetic swarms for real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sensitized Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation in Nanostructured Polymeric Scintillators Allows for Pulse Shape Discrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured polymer scintillators embedding liquid nanodomains where triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation dye capable and a triplet sensitizer are dissolved allow discriminating &#945;&#160;particles, neutrons, and &#947;&#8208;rays with a better time response than commercial scintillators.








Abstract
Scintillating materials emit light when exposed to ionizing radiation or particles and are used for the detection of nuclear threats, medical imaging, high&#8208;energy physics, and other usages. For some of these applications, it is vital to distinguish neutrons and charged particles from &#947;&#8208;rays. This is achievable by pulse shape discrimination (PSD), a time&#8208;gated technique, which exploits that the scintillation kinetics can depend on the nature of the incident radiation. However, it proves difficult to realize efficient PSD with plastic scintillators, which have several advantages over liquid or crystalline scintillating materials, including mechanical robustness and shapeability. It is shown here that sensitive and rapid PSD is possible with nanostructured polymer scintillators that consist of a solid polymer matrix and liquid nanodomains in which an organic dye capable of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) is dissolved. The liquid nature of the nanodomains renders TTA highly efficient so that delayed fluorescence can occur at low energy density. The nanostructured polymer scintillators allow discriminating &#945; particles, neutrons, and &#947;&#8208;rays with a time response that is better than that of commercial scintillators. Exploiting that the liquid nanodomains can facilitate energy transfer processes otherwise difficult to realize in solid polymers, an auxiliary triplet sensitizer is incorporated. This approach further increases the scintillator's sensitivity toward &#945; particles and neutrons and other high&#8208;energy processes where localized interactions are involved.

         <title>Anomalous&#8208;Chern Steering of Topological Nonreciprocal Guided Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nonreciprocal topological edge states based on external magnetic bias have been regarded as a panacea for genuine unidirectional wave transport, showing superior robustness over topological states with preserved time&#8208;reversal symmetry. However, fast and efficient reconfigurability of their trajectory has remained a formidable challenge due to the difficulty in controlling the spatial distribution of magnetic fields over large areas and short times. Here, we&#160;solve this vexing issue by leveraging the rich topology of unitary scattering networks, and achieve fast steering of nonreciprocal topological transport at an interface between a Chern and an anomalous topological insulator, without having to control a magnetic field. Such interface can be drawn by doping the network with scatterers located at the center of each link, whose level of reflection is electrically tuned. With experiments in the GHz range, we&#160;demonstrate the possibility to actively steer the way of unidirectional edge states, switching the transmission path thousands of times per second in a fully&#8208;robust topological heterostructure. Our&#160;approach represents a significant step towards the realization of practical reconfigurable topological meta&#8208;devices with broken time&#8208;reversal symmetry, and their application to future robust communication&#160;technologies.

         <title>Stable Oxyhalide&#8208;Nitride Fast Ionic Conductors for all&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLMBs) utilizing inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) are promising for electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale grid energy storage. However, the Li dendrite growth in SSEs still constrains the practical utility of ASSLMBs. To achieve a high dendrite&#8208;suppression capability, SSEs must be chemically stable with Li, possess fast Li transfer kinetics, and exhibit high interface energy. Herein, we design a class of low&#8208;cost, eco&#8208;friendly, and sustainable oxyhalide&#8208;nitride solid electrolytes (ONSEs), denoted as LixNyIz&#8208;qLiOH (where x = 3y + z, 0 &#8804; q &#8804; 0.75) to fulfil all the requirements. As&#8208;prepared oxyhalide&#8208;nitride fast conductors demonstrate chemically stable against Li and high interface energy (&gt; 43.08 meV &#197;&#8722;2), effectively restraining Li dendrite growth and the self&#8208;degradation at the LMA interfaces. Furthermore, improved thermodynamic oxidation stability of ONSEs (&gt; 3&#160;V versus Li+/Li, 0.45&#160;V for pure Li3N), arising from the increased ionicity of Li&#8208;N bonds, contributes to the stability in ASSLMBs. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the optimized ONSEs possess high ionic conductivity of 0.52 mS cm&#8722;1 and achieve long&#8208;term cycling of Li||Li symmetric cell for over 500&#160;h. When coupled with the Li3InCl6 SSE for high&#8208;voltage cathodes, the bi&#8208;layer oxyhalide&#8208;nitride/Li3InCl6 electrolyte imparts 90% capacity retention over 500 cycles for Li||1 mAh cm&#8722;2 LiCoO2 cells. This work heralds a class of stable ONSEs with exceptional Li compatibility, good oxidative resistance, as well as high ionic conductivity to significantly ASSLMBs
 advance.

         <title>Bioinspired Slippery Surfaces for Liquid Manipulation from Tiny Droplet to Bulk Fluid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Slippery surfaces, which originate in nature with special wettability, have drawn a great deal of attention for both fundamental research and practical applications in a variety of fields due to their unique characteristics of super&#8208;low liquid friction and adhesion. Although the research of bioinspired slippery surfaces is in its infancy, it is a rapidly growing and enormously promising field. Herein, we present a systematic review of recent progress in bioinspired slippery surfaces, beginning with a brief introduction of several typical creatures with slippery property in nature. Subsequently, a detailed discussion the basic concepts of the wetting, friction and drag from micro and macro aspects and focus on the underlying slippery mechanism. We next summarize state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments of the three categories of slippery surfaces of air&#8208;trapped, liquid&#8208;infused and liquid&#8208;like slippery surfaces, including materials, design principles and preparation methods of slippery surfaces and highlight the emerging applications. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of various slippery surfaces are addressed.

         <title>Tunable Negative and Positive Photoconductance in Van Der Waals Heterostructure for Image Preprocessing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The processing of visual information occurs mainly in the retina, and the retinal preprocessing function greatly improves the transmission quality and efficiency of visual information. The artificial retina system provides a promising path to efficient image processing. Here, we&#160;propose graphene/InSe/h&#8208;BN heterogeneous structure, which exhibits negative and positive photoconductance effects by altering the strength of a single wavelength laser. Moreover, we&#160;present a modified theoretical model based on the power&#8208;dependent photoconductivity effect of laser: Iph=&#8722;mP&#945;1+nP&#945;2$\rm I_{\rm ph}\,=\,\rm {-mP}^{\rm \alpha _{1}} + \rm {nP}^{\rm \alpha _{2}}$, which can reveal the internal physical mechanism of negative/positive photoconductance effects. The present two&#8208;dimensional (2D) structure design allows the field effect transistor (FET) to exhibit excellent photoelectric performance (RNPC&#160;=&#160;1.1&#215; 104&#160;A/w, RPPC&#160;=&#160;13&#160;A/w) and performance stability. Especially, the retinal pretreatment process is successfully simulated based on the negative and positive photoconductive effects. Moreover, the pulse signal input improves the device responsivity by 167%, and the transmission quality and efficiency of the visual signal can also be enhanced. This work provides a new design idea and direction for the construction of artificial vision, and lay a foundation for the integration of the next generation of optoelectronic&#160;devices.

Moreover, we&#160;present a modified theoretical model based on the power-dependent photoconductivity effect of laser: Iph=&#8722;mP&#945;1+nP&#945;2$\rm I_{\rm ph}\,=\,\rm {-mP}^{\rm \alpha _{1}} + \rm {nP}^{\rm \alpha _{2}}$, which can reveal the internal physical mechanism of negative/positive photoconductance effects. The present two-dimensional (2D) structure design allows the field effect transistor (FET) to exhibit excellent photoelectric performance (R&lt;sub&gt;NPC&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;1.1&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;A/w, R&lt;sub&gt;PPC&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;13&#160;A/w) and performance stability. Especially, the retinal pretreatment process is successfully simulated based on the negative and positive photoconductive effects. Moreover, the pulse signal input improves the device responsivity by 167%, and the transmission quality and efficiency of the visual signal can also be enhanced. This work provides a new design idea and direction for the construction of artificial vision, and lay a foundation for the integration of the next generation of optoelectronic&#160;devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Scalable optical nose realized with a chemiresistively modulated light&#8208;emitter array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biological olfaction relies on a large number of receptors that function as sensors to detect gaseous molecules. It has been challenging to realize artificial olfactory systems that contain similarly large numbers of sensory materials. We show that combinatorial materials processing with vapor deposition can be used to fabricate large arrays of distinct chemiresistive sensing materials. By combining these with light&#8208;emitting diodes, we obtain an array of chemiresistively&#8208;modulated light&#8208;emitting diodes, or ChemLEDs, that permit a simultaneous optical read&#8208;out in response to an analyte. The optical nose uses a common voltage source and ground for all sensing elements and thus eliminates the need for complex wiring of individual sensors. Our optical nose contains one hundred ChemLEDs and generates unique light patterns in response to gases and their mixtures. Optical pattern recognition methods enable the quantitative prediction of the corresponding concentrations and compositions, thereby paving the way for massively parallel artificial olfactory systems. ChemLEDs open the possibility to explore demanding gas sensing applications, including in environmental, food quality monitoring, and potentially diagnostic settings.

         <title>Black Phosphorus Nanosheets Protect Neurons by Degrading Aggregative &#945;&#8208;syn and Clearing ROS in Parkinson's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although evidence indicates that the abnormal accumulation of &#945;&#8208;synuclein (&#945;&#8208;syn) in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra is the main pathological feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), no compounds that have both &#945;&#8208;syn anti&#8208;aggregation and &#945;&#8208;syn degradation functions have been successful in treating the disease in the clinic. Here, we show that black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNSs) interact directly with &#945;&#8208;syn fibrils to trigger their disaggregation for PD treatment. Moreover, BPNSs have a specific affinity for &#945;&#8208;syn through van der Waals forces. And BPNSs are found to activate autophagy to maintain &#945;&#8208;syn homeostasis, improve mitochondrial dysfunction, reduce reactive oxygen species levels, and rescue neuronal death and synaptic loss in PC12 cells. We have also observed that BPNSs penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier and protect against dopamine neuron loss, alleviating behavioral disorders in MPTP induced mouse model and hA53T &#945;&#8208;syn transgenic mice. Together, our study reveals that BPNSs have the potential as a novel integrated nanomedicine for clinical diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;made Doses of Pharmaceuticals by Tunable Modular Design: a Case Study on Tapering Antidepressant Medication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An abrupt cessation of antidepressant medication can be challenging due to the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. A slow hyperbolic tapering of an antidepressant, such as citalopram hydrobromide (CHB), can mitigate the withdrawal syndrome. However, there are no viable dosage forms on the market to implement the tapering scheme. A solution using a modular design approach to produce flexible and accurate doses of CHB is proposed. This design consists of two parts: (1) a module with a fixed amount of preloaded CHB in a freeze&#8208;dried polymer matrix, and (2) fine&#8208;tuning the CHB dose by inkjet printing. A non&#8208;contact food&#8208;grade printer, used for the first time for printing pharmaceuticals, is modified to allow for accurate printing of the highly concentrated CHB ink on the porous CHB&#8208;free or CHB&#8208;preloaded modules. The produced modules with submicron precision are bench&#8208;marked with commercially available CHB tablets that are manually divided. The proposed tunable modular design (TMD) covers the entire range of doses needed for the tapering (0.5&#8208;23.8&#160;mg). The greatest variance is 13% and 88% when comparing TMD and self&#8208;tapering, respectively. Self&#8208;tapering is proven inaccurate and showcases the need for the TMD to make available accurate and personalized doses to wean off treatment with CHB.

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Multiple&#8208;Resonance Emitters Based on Azepine&#8208;Decorated &#925;&#8208;DABNA for CIEy below 0.06</title>

Abstract
Ultrapure deep&#8208;blue emitters are in high demand for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Although color coordinates serve as straightforward parameters for assessing color purity, precise control over the maximum wavelength and full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum is necessary to optimize OLED performance, including luminance efficiency and luminous efficacy. Multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters are promising candidates for achieving ideal luminescence properties; consequently, a wide variety of MR frameworks have been developed. However, most of these emitters experience a wavelength displacement from the ideal color, which limits their practical applicability. Therefore, a molecular design that is compatible with MR emitters for modulating their energy levels and color output is particularly valuable. Here, we demonstrate that the azepine donor unit induces an appropriate blue&#8208;shift in the emission maximum while maintaining efficient MR characteristics, including high photoluminescence quantum yield, narrow emission, and a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate. OLEDs using newly developed MR emitters based on the &#957;&#8208;DABNA framework simultaneously exhibit a high quantum efficiency of &#8764;30%, luminous efficacy of &#8764;20&#160;lm W&#8722;1, exceptional color purity with Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates as low as (0.14, 0.06), and notably high operational stability. These results demonstrate unprecedentedly high levels compared with those observed in previously reported deep&#8208;blue emitters.

         <title>Approaching the Ideal Linearity in Epitaxial Crystalline&#8208;type Memristor by Controlling Filament Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing has attracted widespread attention owing to its ability to perform parallel and energy&#8208;efficient computation. However, the synaptic weight of amorphous/polycrystalline oxide based memristor usually exhibits large nonlinear behaviour with high asymmetry, which aggravates the complexity of peripheral circuit system.[6&#8208;10] Controllable growth of conductiv filaments is highly demanded for achieving the highly&#8208;linear conductance modulat ion. However, the stochastic behaviour of the filament growth in commonly used amorphous/polycrystalline oxide memristor makes it very challenging. Here, we report the epitaxially grown Hf0.5Zr0.5O2&#8208;based memristor with the linearity and symmetry approaching ideal case. A layer of Cu nanoparticles is inserted into epitaxially grown Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 film to form the grain boundaries due to the breaking of the epitaxial growth. By combining with the local electric field enhancement, the growth of filament is confined in the grain boundaries due to the fact that the diffusion of oxygen vacancy in crystalline lattice is more difficult than that in the grain boundaries. Furthermore, the decimal operation and high&#8208;accuracy neural network are demonstrated by utilizing the highly&#8208;linear and multi&#8208;level conductance modulation capacity. Our method opens an avenue to control the filament growth for the application of resistance random access memory (RRAM) and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Optical&#8208;Cavity&#8208;Incorporated Colorful All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrochromic Devices for Dual Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design strategy that is structured around all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device is developed to circumvent the critical problem in conventional all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device, which offers personalized devices that exhibit vivid structural colors and dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting, accompanied by fast switching responses and excellent cycling performance.








Abstract
The fusion of electrochromic technology with optical resonant cavities presents an intriguing innovation in the electrochromic field. However, this fusion is mainly achieved in liquid electrolyte&#8208;based or sol&#8211;gel electrolyte&#8208;based electrochromic devices, but not in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices, which have broader industrial applications. Here, a new all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device is demonstrated with a metal&#8211;dielectric&#8211;metal (MDM) resonant cavity, which can achieve strong thin&#8208;film interference effects through resonance, enabling the device to achieve unique structural colors that have rarely appeared in reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices, such as yellow green, purple, and light red. The color gamut of the device can be further expanded due to the adjustable optical constants of the electrochromic layer. What is more, this device exhibits remarkable cycling stability (maintaining 84% modulation capability after 7200 cycles), rapid switching time (coloration in 2.6 s and bleaching in 2.8 s), and excellent optical memory effect (only increasing by 13.8% after almost 36&#8239;000 s). In addition, this exquisite structural design has dual&#8208;responsive anti&#8208;counterfeiting effects based on voltage and angle, further demonstrating the powerful color modulation capability of this device.

         <title>All&#8208;Round Passivation Strategy Yield Flexible Perovskite/CuInGaSe2 Tandem Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 26.5%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceeding 26.5%&#8208;efficient all flexible Perovskite/CIGS Tandem solar cell is achieved by all&#8208;round passivation strategy termed Dual Passivation at Grains and Interfaces which improve film crystallinity and maximize the passivation of defects at various locations within the solar cell structure, effectively minimizing nonradiative recombination losses.








Abstract
The perovskite/Cu(InGa)Se2 (CIGS) tandem solar cells (TSCs) presents a compelling technological combination poised for the next generation of flexible and lightweight photovoltaic (PV) tandem devices, featuring a tunable bandgap, high power conversion efficiency (PCE), lightweight flexibility, and enhanced stability and durability. Over the years, the imperative to enhance the performance of wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has grown significantly, particularly in the context of a flexible tandem device. In this study, an all&#8208;round passivation strategy known as Dual Passivation at Grains and Interfaces (DPGI) is introduced for WBG PSCs in perovskite/CIGS tandem structures. The implementation of DPGI is tailored to improve film crystallinity and passivate defects across the solar cell structure, leading to a substantial performance enhancement for WBG PSCs. Subsequently, both rigid and flexible tandem devices are assembled. Impressively, a fully flexible 4T perovskite/CIGS TSCs is successfully fabricated with a PCE of 26.57%, making it the highest value in this field and highlighting its potential applications in the next generation of flexible lightweight PV tandem devices.

         <title>Defect Engineering for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reaction on Transition Metal Oxides: The Role of Metal Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a strategy for regulating metal defects, including theoretical predictions and experimental validation. The activation of octahedral sites facilitates the adsorption of reactants, deprotonation of OH*, and the desorption of reaction products, ultimately leading to the achievement of a highly efficient dual&#8208;function catalyst for ORR and OER.








Abstract
Metal defect engineering is a highly effective strategy for addressing the prevalent high overpotential issues associated with transition metal oxides functioning as dual&#8208;function commercial oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction catalysts for increasing their activity and stability. However, the high formation energy of metal defects poses a challenge to the development of strategies to precisely control the selectivity during metal defect formation. Here, density functional theory calculations are used to demonstrate that altering the pathway of metal defect formation releases metal atoms as metal chlorides, which effectively reduces the formation energy of defects. The metal defects on the monometallic metal oxide surface (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) are selectively produced using chlorine plasma. The characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that catalytic activity is enhanced owing to electronic delocalization induced by metal defects, which reduces the theoretical overpotential. Notably, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, ex situ XPS, and in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS suggest that metal defects effectively improve the adsorption of reactive species on active sites and enhance the efficiency of product desorption, thereby boosting catalytic performance.

         <title>Formation of 2D Amorphous Lithium Sulfide Enabled by Mo2C Clusters Loaded Carbon Scaffold for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of trending a shift in the configuration of lithium sulfide toward an amorphous structure is first proposed by using a leaf&#8208;like carbon scaffold (LCS) with the modification of Mo2C cluster (Mo2C@LCS) as a sulfur host. It is revealed that the formation of amorphous lithium sulfides shows significantly improved kinetics for lithium sulfides deposition and decomposition.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, operated through the interconversion between sulfur and solid&#8208;state lithium sulfide, are regarded as next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the sluggish kinetics of lithium sulfide deposition/dissolution, caused by its insoluble and insulated nature, hampers the practical use of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, leaf&#8208;like carbon scaffold (LCS) with the modification of Mo2C clusters (Mo2C@LCS) is reported as host material of sulfur powder. During cycles, the dissociative Mo ions at the Mo2C@LCS/electrolyte interface are detected to exhibit competitive binding energy with Li ions for lithium sulfide anions, which disrupts the deposition behavior of crystalline lithium sulfide and trends a shift in the configuration of lithium sulfide toward an amorphous structure. Combining the related electrochemical study and first&#8208;principle calculation, it is revealed that the formation of amorphous lithium sulfides shows significantly improved kinetics for lithium sulfide deposition and decomposition. As a result, the obtained Mo2C@LCS/S cathode shows an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.015% per cycle at a high mass loading of 9.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 after 700 cycles. More strikingly, an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 61.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 can also be achieved. This work defines an efficacious strategy to advance the commercialization of Mo2C@LCS host for Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Crack&#8208;Resistant and Tissue&#8208;Like Artificial Muscles with Low Temperature Activation and High Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial muscle combining crack&#8208;resistance (fracture energy of 33&#8239;720 J m&#8722;2 and fatigue threshold of 2250 J m&#8722;2), tissue&#8208;matched modulus (0.7&#160;MPa), low&#8208;temperature activation (40&#160;&#176;C), and high power density (450&#160;W kg&#8722;1) is created by introducing crystallizable segments and ethylene glycol flexible spacer into a liquid crystalline network, where the crystallization and covalent crosslinking density are finely controlled.








Abstract
Constructing soft robotics with safe human&#8211;machine interactions requires low&#8208;modulus, high&#8208;power&#8208;density artificial muscles that are sensitive to gentle stimuli. In addition, the ability to resist crack propagation during long&#8208;term actuation cycles is essential for a long service life. Herein, a material design is proposed to combine all these desirable attributes in a single artificial muscle platform. The design involves the molecular engineering of a liquid crystalline network with crystallizable segments and an ethylene glycol flexible spacer. A high degree of crystallinity can be afforded by utilizing aza&#8208;Michael chemistry to produce a low covalent crosslinking density, resulting in crack&#8208;insensitivity with a high fracture energy of 33&#160;720 J m&#8722;2 and a high fatigue threshold of 2250 J m&#8722;2. Such crack&#8208;resistant artificial muscle with tissue&#8208;matched modulus of 0.7&#160;MPa can generate a high power density of 450&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at a low temperature of 40&#160;&#176;C. Notably, because of the presence of crystalline domains in the actuated state, no crack propagation is observed after 500 heating&#8211;cooling actuation cycles under a static load of 220&#160;kPa. This study points to a pathway for the creation of artificial muscles merging seemingly disparate, but desirable properties, broadening their application potential in smart devices.

         <title>Optimizing Ionomer Distribution in Anode Catalyst Layer for Stable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anode catalyst layer (ACL) is the key to determining the lifetime of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. In this work, an efficient gradient ionomer distributed ACL structure is fabricated through optimizing the catalyst ink, which improves the durability by a factor of three compared to the normal ACL when operating at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 and 80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The high cost of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) originates from the usage of precious materials, insufficient efficiency, and lifetime. In this work, an important degradation mechanism of PEMWE caused by dynamics of ionomers over time in anode catalyst layer (ACL), which is a purely mechanical degradation of microstructure, is identified. Contrary to conventional understanding that the microstructure of ACL is static, the micropores are inclined to be occupied by ionomers due to the localized swelling/creep/migration, especially near the ACL/PTL (porous transport layer) interface, where they form transport channels of reactant/product couples. Consequently, the ACL with increased ionomers at PTL/ACL interface exhibit rapid and continuous degradation. In addition, a close correlation between the microstructure of ACL and the catalyst ink is discovered. Specifically, if more ionomers migrate to the top layer of the ink, more ionomers accumulate at the ACL/PEM interface, leaving fewer ionomers at the ACL/PTL interface. Therefore, the ionomer distribution in ACL is successfully optimized, which exhibits reduced ionomers at the ACL/PTL interface and enriches ionomers at the ACL/PEM interface, reducing the decay rate by a factor of three when operated at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 and 80&#160;&#176;C. The findings provide a general way to achieve low&#8208;cost hydrogen production.

         <title>Capillarity&#8208;Driven Enrichment and Hydrodynamic Trapping of Trace Nucleic Acids by Plasmonic Cavity Membrane for Rapid and Sensitive Detections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a plasmonic cavity membrane that is designed to not only enrich and capture trace nucleic acids in a clinically relevant large sample volume by taking advantage of capillarity and hydrodynamic trapping but also achieve rapid amplification and sensitive detection is reported.








Abstract
Small&#8208;reactor&#8208;based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has attracted considerable attention. A significant number of tiny reactors must be prepared in parallel to capture, amplify, and accurately quantify few target genes in clinically relevant large volume, which, however, requires sophisticated microfabrication and longer sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer time. Here, single plasmonic cavity membrane is reported that not only enriches and captures few nucleic acids by taking advantage of both capillarity and hydrodynamic trapping but also quickly amplifies them for sensitive plasmonic detection. The plasmonic cavity membrane with few nanoliters in a void volume is fabricated by self&#8208;assembling gold nanorods with SiO2 tips. Simulations reveal that hydrodynamic stagnation between the SiO2 tips is mainly responsible for the trapping of the nucleic acid in the membrane. Finally, it is shown that the plasmonic cavity membrane is capable of enriching&#160;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) genes up to 20&#160;000&#8208;fold within 1&#160;min, amplifying within 3&#160;min, and detecting the trace genes as low as a single copy &#181;L&#8722;1. It is anticipated that this work not only expands the utility of PCR but also provides an innovative way of the enrichment and detection of trace biomolecules in a variety of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing applications.

         <title>Closed Twisted Hydrogel Ribbons with Self&#8208;Sustained Motions under Static Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of M&#246;bius strip and Seifert ribbon robots are devised by using identical slender muscle&#8208;like anisotropic hydrogel. These closed twisted ribbon hydrogels exhibit continuous flipping and rotation under static light irradiation. The self&#8208;sustainability of hydrogel robots arises from the synergy of fast response of the gel, self&#8208;shadowing effect, and geometry&#8208;facilitated refresh of the light&#8208;exposed regions.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sustained motions are widespread in biological systems by harvesting energy from surrounding environments, which inspire scientists to develop autonomous soft robots. However, most&#8208;existing soft robots require dynamic heterogeneous stimuli or complex fabrication with different components. Recently, control of topological geometry has been promising to afford soft robots with physical intelligence and thus life&#8208;like motions. Reported here are a series of closed twisted ribbon robots, which exhibit self&#8208;sustained flipping and rotation under constant light irradiation. Both M&#246;bius strip and Seifert ribbon robots are devised for the first time by using an identical hydrogel, which responds to light irradiation on either side. Experiment and simulation results indicate that the self&#8208;regulated motions of the hydrogel robots are related to fast and reversible response of muscle&#8208;like gel, self&#8208;shadowing effect, and topology&#8208;facilitated refresh of light&#8208;exposed regions. The motion speeds and directions of the hydrogel robots can be tuned over a wide range. These closed twisted ribbon hydrogels are further applied to execute specific tasks in aqueous environments, such as collecting plastic balls, climbing a vertical rod, and transporting objects. This work presents new design principle for autonomous hydrogel robots by benefiting from material response and topology geometry, which may be inspirative for the robotics community.

         <title>Deep Learning Prediction of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Parameters in Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) decay model is implemented and deep learning (DL) model for the prediction of kinetic coefficients is developed using the new TTA model, which DL model presented superior predictability by obtaining determination coefficient value of 0.992 and 0.999 of the TTA rate coefficient and TTA ratio.








Abstract
The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) ratio and the rate coefficient (kTT) of TTA are key factors in estimating the contribution of triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons in fluorescent TTA organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. In this study, deep learning models are implemented to predict key factors from transient electroluminescence (trEL) data using new numerical equations. A new TTA model is developed that considers both polaron and exciton dynamics, enabling the distinction between prompt and delayed singlet decays with a fundamental understanding of the mechanism. In addition, deep learning models for predicting the kinetic coefficients and TTA ratio are established. After comprehensive optimization inspired by photophysics, determination coefficient values of 0.992 and 0.999 are achieved in the prediction of kTT and TTA ratio, respectively, indicating a nearly perfect prediction. The contribution of each kinetic parameter of polaron and exciton dynamics to the trEL curve is discussed using various deep&#8208;learning models.

         <title>Beyond Metallic Electrode: Spontaneous Formation of Fluidic Electrodes from Operational Liquid in Highly Functional Droplet&#8208;Based Electricity Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The droplet&#8208;based electricity generator (DEG) has facilitated efficient droplet energy harvesting, yet diversifying its applications necessitates the incorporation of various to the DEG. In this study, we first propose a methodology for advancing the DEG by substituting its conventional metallic electrode with electrically conductive water electrode (WE), which is spontaneously generated during the operation of the DEG with operating liquid. Due to the inherent conductive and fluidic nature of water, the introduction of the WE maintains the electrical output performance of the DEG while imparting functionalities such as high transparency and flexibility. So, the resultant WE applied DEG (WE&#8208;DEG) exhibits high optical transmittance (&#8764; 99%) and retains its electricity&#8208;generating capability under varying deformations, including bending and stretching. This innovation expands the versatility of the DEG, and especially, a sun&#8208;raindrop dual&#8208;mode energy harvester is demonstrated by hybridizing the WE&#8208;DEG and photovoltaic (PV) cell. This hybridization effectively addresses the weather&#8208;dependent limitations inherent in each energy harvester and enhances the temperature&#8208;induced inefficiencies typically observed in PV cells, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency. The introduction of the WE will be poised to catalyze new developments in DEG research, paving the way for broader applicability and enhanced efficiency in droplet energy harvesting technologies.

         <title>Constructing High&#8208;Active Surface of Plasmonic Tungsten Oxide for Photocatalytic Alcohol Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Plasmonic semiconductors with broad spectral response hold significant promise for sustainable solar energy utilization. However, their surface inertness limits the photocatalytic activity. Herein, we propose a novel approach to improve the body crystallinity and increase the surface oxygen vacancies of plasmonic tungsten oxide by the combination of hydrochloric acid regulation and light irradiation, which can promote the adsorption of tert&#8208;butyl alcohol (TBA) on plasmonic tungsten oxide and overcome the hindrance of the surface depletion layer in photocatalytic alcohol dehydration. Additionally, this process can concentrate electrons for strong plasmonic electron oscillation on the near surface, facilitating rapid electron transfer within the adsorbed TBA molecules for C&#8208;O bond cleavage. As a result, the activation barrier for TBA dehydration is significantly reduced by 93% to 6.0&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1, much lower than that of thermocatalysis (91&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1). Therefore, an optimal isobutylene generation rate of 1.8&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (selectivity of 99.9%) is achieved. A small flow reaction system is further constructed, which shows an isobutylene generation rate of 12&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 under natural sunlight irradiation. This work highlights the potential of plasmonic semiconductors for efficient photocatalytic alcohol dehydration, thereby promoting the sustainable utilization of solar energy.

         <title>Side Reactions/Changes in Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Mechanisms and Strategies for Creating Safer and Better Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), in which lithium ions function as charge carriers, are considered the most competitive energy storage devices due to their high energy and power density. However, battery materials, especially with high capacity undergo side reactions and changes that result in capacity decay and safety issues. A deep understanding of the reactions that cause changes in the battery's internal components and the mechanisms of those reactions is needed to build safer and better batteries. This review focuses on the processes of battery failures, with voltage and temperature as the underlying factors. Voltage&#8208;induced failures result from anode interfacial reactions, current collector corrosion, cathode interfacial reactions, overcharge, and overdischarge, while temperature&#8208;induced failure mechanisms include SEI decomposition, separator damage, and interfacial reactions between electrodes and electrolytes. The review also presents protective strategies for controlling these reactions. As a result, the reader is offered a comprehensive overview of the safety features and failure mechanisms of various LIB components.

         <title>Metallic Ru&#8208;Ru Interaction in Ruthenium Oxide Enabling Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing efficient and robust electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). RuO2 possesses intrinsically high OER activity, but the concurrent electrochemical dissolution leads to rapid deactivation. Here we report a unique RuO2 catalyst containing metallic Ru&#8208;Ru interactions (m&#8208;RuO2), which maintains stable in practical PEMWE for 100&#160;h at 60 &#176;C and 1 A cm&#8211;2. Experimental and theoretical investigations suggest that the presence of Ru&#8208;Ru interactions significantly increases the energy barrier for the formation of RuO2(OH)2, which is a key intermediate for Ru dissolution, and hence substantially mitigates the electrochemical corrosion of m&#8208;RuO2. Meanwhile, the Ru4d band center downshifts, accordingly, ensuring the high OER activity, and the participation of lattice oxygen in the OER is also suppressed at the Ru&#8208;Ru sites, further contributing to the enhanced durability. Interestingly, such enhanced stability is also dependent on the size of metallic Ru&#8208;Ru cluster, where the energy barrier is further increased for Ru3, but is decreased for Ru5. These results highlight the significance of local coordination structure modulation on the electrochemical stability of RuO2 and open a feasible avenue toward the development of robust OER electrocatalysts for high&#8208;performance PEMWE.

         <title>Functional Amyloids: The Biomaterials of Tomorrow?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functional amyloid from bacteria, particularly CsgA and FapC, are emerging as promising new biomaterials with applications within areas as diverse as gastrointestinal colonization, tissue engineering, water purification, CO2 fixation, biosensing, and more recently biocatalysis. This is thanks to their high stability, efficient and controllable formation, easy and scalable availability and ready engineering opportunities.








Abstract
Functional amyloid (FAs), particularly the bacterial proteins CsgA and FapC, have many useful properties as biomaterials: high stability, efficient, and controllable formation of a single type of amyloid, easy availability as extracellular material in bacterial biofilm and flexible engineering to introduce new properties. CsgA in particular has already demonstrated its worth in hydrogels for stable gastrointestinal colonization and regenerative tissue engineering, cell&#8208;specific drug release, water&#8208;purification filters, and different biosensors. It also holds promise as catalytic amyloid; existing weak and unspecific activity can undoubtedly be improved by targeted engineering and benefit from the repetitive display of active sites on a surface. Unfortunately, FapC remains largely unexplored and no application is described so far. Since FapC shares many common features with CsgA, this opens the window to its development as a functional scaffold. The multiple imperfect repeats in CsgA and FapC form a platform to introduce novel properties, e.g., in connecting linkers of variable lengths. While exploitation of this potential is still at an early stage, particularly for FapC, a thorough understanding of their molecular properties will pave the way for multifunctional fibrils which can contribute toward solving many different societal challenges, ranging from CO2 fixation to hydrolysis of plastic nanoparticles.

         <title>Responsively Degradable Nanoarmor&#8208;Assisted Super Resistance and Stable Colonization of Probiotics for Enhanced Inflammation&#8208;Targeted Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior armored probiotic (EcN@PC&#8211;Fe/HA) with an inflammation&#8208;targeting capacity is developed to enhance the efficacy and timely action of bacterial therapy against inflammatory bowel disease. EcN@PC&#8211;Fe/HA shows excellent prophylactic efficacy and therapeutic performance against dextran sulfate sodium&#8208;induced colitis including alleviating inflammation, restoring intestinal barrier function, and reshaping the dysbiosis of intestinal bacteria.








Abstract
Manipulation of the gut microbiota using oral microecological preparations has shown great promise in treating various inflammatory disorders. However, delivering these preparations while maintaining their disease&#8208;site specificity, stability, and therapeutic efficacy is highly challenging due to the dynamic changes associated with pathological microenvironments in the gastrointestinal tract. Herein, a superior armored probiotic with an inflammation&#8208;targeting capacity is developed to enhance the efficacy and timely action of bacterial therapy against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The coating strategy exhibits suitability for diverse probiotic strains and has negligible influence on bacterial viability. This study demonstrates that these armored probiotics have ultraresistance to extreme intraluminal conditions and stable mucoadhesive capacity. Notably, the HA&#8208;functionalized nanoarmor equips the probiotics with inflamed&#8208;site targetability through multiple interactions, thus enhancing their efficacy in IBD therapy. Moreover, timely &#8220;awakening&#8221; of ingested probiotics through the responsive transferrin&#8208;directed degradation of the nanoarmor at the site of inflammation is highly beneficial for bacterial therapy, which requires the bacterial cells to be fully functional. Given its easy preparation and favorable biocompatibility, the developed single&#8208;cell coating approach provides an effective strategy for the advanced delivery of probiotics for biomedical applications at the cellular level.

         <title>Intense Left&#8208;handed Circularly Polarized Luminescence in Chiral Nematic Hydroxypropyl Cellulose Composite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) derived luminescent materials exhibit intense and multicolored left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (CPL), opening the way for the practical application of nanocellulosic chirality in durable multimode anticounterfeiting and enantioselective photopolymerization. The versatility, high glum, and large &#934; of this system will promote its applications in chiral sensing, chiroptical devices, 3D display technologies, and CPL chiral imaging.








Abstract
Integrating optically active components into chiral photonic cellulose to fabricate circularly polarized luminescent materials has transformative potential in disease detection, asymmetric reactions, and anticounterfeiting techniques. However, the lack of cellulose&#8208;based left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light (L&#8208;CPL) emissions hampers the progress of these chiral functionalizations. Here, this work proposes an unprecedented strategy: incorporating a chiral nematic organization of hydroxypropyl cellulose with robust aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens to generate intense L&#8208;CPL emission. By utilizing N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide as a good solvent for fluorescent components and cellulose matrices, this work produces a right&#8208;handed chiral nematic structure film with a uniform appearance in reflective and fluorescent states. Remarkably, this system integrates a high asymmetric factor (0.51) and an impressive emission quantum yield (55.8%) into one fascinating composite. More meaningfully, this approach is versatile, allowing for the incorporation of luminogen derivatives emitting multicolored L&#8208;CPL. These chiral fluorescent films possess exceptional mechanical flexibility (toughness up to 0.9 MJ m&#8722;3) and structural stability even under harsh environmental exposures, making them promising for the fabrication of various products. Additionally, these films can be cast on the fabrics to reveal multilevel and durable anticounterfeiting capabilities or used as a chiral light source to induce enantioselective photopolymerization, thereby offering significant potential for diverse practical applications.

         <title>Solid Additive Dual&#8208;Regulates Spectral Response Enabling High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel solid additive is proposed to dual&#8208;regulate donor/acceptor diffusion and molecular stacking, thus tuning the spectral response of resulting semi&#8208;transparent devices. The weakened visible light absorption intensity and extended utilization of NIR light enable ST&#8208;OSCs to simultaneously possess high average visible transmittance and high photocurrent, which results in a record&#8208;breaking light utilization efficiency in the AVT range of 40&#8211;50%.








Abstract
Semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) possess significant potential for applications in vehicles and buildings due to their distinctive visual transparency. Conventional device engineering strategies are typically used to optimize photon selection and utilization at the expense of power conversion efficiency (PCE); moreover, the fixed spectral utilization range always imposes an unsatisfactory upper limit to its light utilization efficiency (LUE). Herein, a novel solid additive named&#160;1,3&#8208;diphenoxybenzene (DB) is employed to dual&#8208;regulate donor/acceptor molecular aggregation and crystallinity, which effectively broadens the spectral response of ST&#8208;OSCs&#160;in near&#8208;infrared region. Besides, more visible light is allowed to pass through the devices, which enables ST&#8208;OSCs to possess satisfactory photocurrent and high average visible transmittance (AVT) simultaneously. Consequently, the optimal ST&#8208;OSC based on PP2+DB/BTP&#8208;eC9+DB achieves a superior LUE of 4.77%, representing the highest value within AVT range of 40&#8211;50%, which also correlates with the formation of multi&#8208;scale phase&#8208;separated morphology. Such results indicate that the ST&#8208;OSCs can simultaneously meet the requirements for minimum commercial efficiency and plant photosynthesis when integrated with the roofs of agricultural greenhouses. This work emphasizes the significance of additives to tune the spectral response in ST&#8208;OSCs, and charts the way for organic photovoltaics in economically sustainable agricultural development.

         <title>Engineering a Dynamic Solvent&#8208;Phobic Liquid Electrolyte Interphase for Long&#8208;Life Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;phobic dynamic liquid electrolyte interphase (DLEI) on a Li metal surface (Li&#8211;PFbTHF) is developed to improve the cycling performance of practical Li metal batteries in carbonate electrolytes. Evidence from advanced techniques indicated that the C&#8211;F&#8208;rich groups of PFbTHF induce LiF/Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI. Consequently, the LiFePO4||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells exhibit long&#8208;term cycling stability and a high rate capacity.








Abstract
The heterogeneity, species diversity, and poor mechanical stability of solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) in conventional carbonate electrolytes result in the irreversible exhaustion of lithium (Li) and electrolytes during cycling, hindering the practical applications of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, this work proposes a solvent&#8208;phobic dynamic liquid electrolyte interphase (DLEI) on a Li metal (Li&#8211;PFbTHF (perfluoro&#8208;butyltetrahydrofuran)) surface that selectively transports salt and induces salt&#8208;derived SEI formation. The solvent&#8208;phobic DLEI with C&#8211;F&#8208;rich groups dramatically reduces the side reactions between Li, carbonate solvents, and humid air, forming a LiF/Li3PO4&#8208;rich SEI. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics demonstrate that DLEI effectively stabilizes the interface between Li metal and the carbonate electrolyte. Specifically, the LiFePO4||Li&#8211;PFbTHF cells deliver 80.4% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1.0 C, excellent rate capacity (108.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 C), and 90.2% capacity retention after 550 cycles at 1.0 C in full&#8208;cells (negative/positive (N/P) ratio of 8) with high LiFePO4 loadings (15.6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) in carbonate electrolyte. In addition, the 0.55 Ah pouch cell of 252.0&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 delivers stable cycling. Hence, this study provides an effective strategy for controlling salt&#8208;derived SEI to improve the cycling performances of carbonate&#8208;based LMBs.

         <title>Interlayer Biatomic Pair Bridging the van der Waals Gap for 100% Activation of 2D Layered Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to achieve 100% activation is reported of atoms on the basal plane of 2D layered materials by constructing an interlayer biatomic bridge. New gap states at the Fermi level are introduced and interlayer conductivity is enhanced in this catalyst. Exposed basal plane atoms are optimized to a state favorable for adsorbing catalytic intermediates.








Abstract
2D layered materials are regarded as prospective catalyst candidates due to their advantageous atomic exposure ratio. Nevertheless, the predominant population of atoms residing on the basal plane with saturated coordination, exhibit inert behavior, while a mere fraction of atoms located at the periphery display reactivity. Here, a novel approach is reported to attain complete atom activation in 2D layered materials through the construction of an interlayer biatomic pair bridge. The atoms in question have been strategically optimized to achieve a highly favorable state for the adsorption of intermediates. This optimization results from the introduction of new gap states around the Fermi level. Moreover, the presence of the interlayer bridge facilitates the electron transfer across the van der Waals gap, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics. The hydrogen evolution reaction exhibits an impressive ultrahigh current density of 2000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 397&#160;mV, surpassing the pristine MoS2 by approximately two orders of magnitude (26&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 397&#160;mV). This study provides new insights for enhancing the efficacy of 2D layered catalysts.

         <title>Solid Electrolyte Bimodal Grain Structures for Improved Cycling Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the low critical current density obstacle facing Li7La3Zr2O12 solid&#8208;state electrolytes, a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy is validated by obtaining a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure. By tuning the ratio and spatial distribution of coarse and fine grains, the optimized bimodal microstructure allows cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density is ramped from 1.0 up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The application of solid&#8208;state electrolytes in Li batteries is hampered by the occurrence of Li&#8208;dendrite&#8208;caused short circuits. To avoid cell failure, the electrolytes can only be stressed with rather low current densities, severely restricting their performance. As grain size and pore distributions significantly affect dendrite growth in ceramic electrolytes such as Li7La3Zr2O12 and its variants; here, a &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; strategy to bring the superiority of both coarse and fine grains into play, is proposed. To validate the mechanism, a coarse/fine bimodal grain microstructure is obtained by seeding unpulverized large particles in the green body. The rearrangement of coarse grains and fine pores is fine&#8208;tuned by changing the ratio of pulverized and unpulverized powders. The optimized bimodal microstructure, obtained when the two powders are equally mixed, allows, without extra interface decoration, cycling for over 2000&#160;h as the current density is increased from 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, and gradually, up to 2.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. The &#8220;detour and buffer&#8221; effects are confirmed from postmortem analysis. The complex grain boundaries formed by fine grains discourage the direct infiltration of Li. Simultaneously, the coarse grains further increase the tortuosity of the Li path. This study sheds light on the microstructure optimization for the polycrystalline solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

         <title>Enabling Self&#8208;Adaptive Water&#8208;Energy&#8208;Balance of Photothermal Water Diode Evaporator: Dynamically Maximizing Energy Utilization Under the Ever&#8208;Changing Sunlight</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal water diode (WD) evaporator concept by an integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic absorber is proposed to address the critical issue of low energy utilization. Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, the WD evaporator can bring dynamic management and self&#8208;regulation on water supply when encountering different suns, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization.








Abstract
Maintaining a match between input solar energy and required energy by water supply management is key to achieving efficient interfacial solar&#8208;driven evaporation (ISDE). In practice, the solar radiation flux is constantly changing throughout the day, so keeping a dynamic water&#8208;energy&#8208;balance of ISDE is a big challenge. Herein, a photothermal water diode (WD) evaporator concept is proposed by an integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic Janus absorber to overcome the issue. Due to the unique unidirectional water transport properties induced by asymmetric wettability, a self&#8208;adaptive balance between photothermal energy input and water uptake is established, thus realizing the energy matching and utilization maximization. The experimental and simulation results exhibit that with the increase of sunlight intensity, the water supply speed is significantly accelerated due to the dynamic management and self&#8208;regulation on water replenishment. Therefore, an excellent evaporation rate of up to 2.14&#160;kg&#160;m&#8211;2&#160;h&#8211;1 with a high efficiency of 93.7% under 1&#160;sun illumination is achieved. This water diode engineering with Janus wettability provides a novel strategy and extends the path for designing solar evaporation systems with diverse water supply properties, which shows great potential in different environmental conditions.

         <title>Fully Memristive Elementary Motion Detectors for a Maneuver Prediction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully memristive elementary motion detector (M&#8208;EMD) is proposed to emulate the biological vision system. Inspired by the structure and function of the biological motion&#8208;detecting neural circuit, the detector achieves agile and efficient motion detection using a simple configuration composed only of memristors. The proposed detector is applicable to a motion&#8208;detecting element for edge&#8208;level neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Insects can efficiently perform object motion detection via a specialized neural circuit, called an elementary motion detector (EMD). In contrast, conventional machine vision systems require significant computational resources for dynamic motion processing. Here, a fully memristive EMD (M&#8208;EMD) is presented that implements the Hassenstein&#8211;Reichardt (HR) correlator, a biological model of the EMD. The M&#8208;EMD consists of a simple Wye (Y) configuration, including a static resistor, a dynamic memristor, and a Mott memristor. The resistor and dynamic memristor introduce different signal delays, enabling spatio&#8208;temporal signal integration in the subsequent Mott memristor, resulting in a direction&#8208;selective response. In addition, a neuromorphic system is developed employing the M&#8208;EMDs to predict a lane&#8208;changing maneuver by vehicles on the road. The system achieved a high accuracy (&gt; 87%) in predicting future lane&#8208;changing maneuvers on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset while reducing the computational cost by 92.9% compared to the conventional neuromorphic system without the M&#8208;EMD, suggesting its strong potential for edge&#8208;level computing.

         <title>Competing Mechanisms Determine Oxygen Redox in Doped Ni&#8211;Mn Based Layered Oxides for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Beyond the well&#8208;known P2 to O2 phase transition, oxygen redox is a main bottleneck for capacity retention. Using synchrotron&#8208;based methods, it is revealed that competing mechanisms between Ni and Mg (or Li, Zn, and Cu) are critical for controlling the degree of oxygen redox in doped Ni&#8211;Mn based layered oxides in Na&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Cation doping is an effective strategy for improving the cyclability of layered oxide cathode materials through suppression of phase transitions in the high voltage region. In this study, Mg and Sc are chosen as dopants in P2&#8208;Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2, and both have found to&#160;positively impact the cycling stability, but influence the high voltage regime in different ways. Through a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based methods and theoretical calculations it is shown that it is more than just suppression of the P2 to O2 phase transition that is critical for promoting the favorable properties, and that the interplay between Ni and O activity is also a critical aspect that dictates the performance. With Mg doping, the Ni activity can be enhanced while simultaneously suppressing the O activity. This is surprising because it is in contrast to what has been reported in other Mn&#8208;based layered oxides where Mg is known to trigger oxygen redox. This contradiction is addressed by proposing a competing mechanism between Ni and Mg that impacts differences in O activity in Na0.67MgxNi0.33&#8208;xMn0.67O2 (x&#160;&lt;&#160;0&#160;&lt;&#160;0.33). These findings provide a new direction in understanding the effects of cation doping on the electrochemical behavior of layered oxides.

         <title>Physically and Chemically Stable Molybdenum&#8208;Based Composite Electrodes for p&#8211;i&#8211;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a pivotal component within solar devices, the electrode has a profound impact on the device performance. Herein, device configuration based on the physically and chemically stable molybdenum electrode is engineered to fundamentally tackle the instability factors introduced by electrodes in perovskite solar cells. A titanium seed layer is further introduced to optimize the electrode interfacial contact. 








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered much attention in recent years. Despite the remarkable advancements in PSCs utilizing traditional metal electrodes, challenges such as stability concerns and elevated costs have necessitated the exploration of innovative electrode designs to facilitate industrial commercialization. Herein, a physically and chemically stable molybdenum (Mo) electrode is developed to fundamentally tackle the instability factors introduced by electrodes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered much attention in recent years. Despite the remarkable advancements in PSCs utilizing traditional metal electrodes, challenges such as stability concerns and elevated costs have necessitated the exploration of innovative electrode designs to facilitate industrial commercialization. Herein, a physically and chemically stable molybdenum (Mo) electrode is developed to fundamentally tackle the instability factors introduced by electrodes. The combined spatially resolved element analyses and theoretical study demonstrate the high diffusion barrier of Mo ions within the device. Structural and morphology characterization also reveals the negligible plastic deformation and halide-metal reaction during aging when Mo is in contact with perovskite (PVSK). The electrode/underlayer junction is further stabilized by a thin seed layer of titanium (Ti) to improve Mo film's uniformity and adhesion. Based on a corresponding p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs (ITO/PTAA/PVSK/C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/ITO/Ti/Mo), the champion sample could deliver an efficiency of 22.25%, which is among the highest value for PSCs based on Mo electrodes. Meanwhile, the device shows negligible performance decay after 2000 h operation, and retains 91% of the initial value after 1300 h at 50&#8211;60 &#176;C. In summary, the multilayer Mo electrode opens an effective avenue to all-round stable electrode design in high-performance PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

When fluorine&#8208;free meets bio&#8208;based: the suitable combination of a fluorine&#8208;free lithium bis(oxalato)borate salt with a bio&#8208;based &#436;&#8208;valerolactone solvent is demonstrated in this work. This novel and sustainable electrolyte not only presents enhanced safety and the ability to prevent aluminum dissolution, but also enables the realization of lithium&#8208;ion capacitors with excellent energy&#8208;to&#8208;power performance and outstanding long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
In this work, the properties of a novel electrolyte based on the combination of bio&#8208;based &#436;&#8208;valerolactone (GVL) solvent with lithium bis(oxalato)borate (LiBOB) salt and its use for lithium&#8208;ion capacitors (LICs) are presented. It is shown that the 1 m LiBOB in GVL electrolyte displays good transport properties, high thermal stability, and the ability to prevent anodic dissolution. Its impact on the performance of both battery&#8208;type and capacitive&#8208;type electrodes is evaluated. In this regard, special attention is paid to the filming properties associated with LiBOB and GVL decomposition at the electrode surfaces. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, the full&#8208;cell devices assembled in this study are the first example of a fluorine&#8208;free LIC. These devices exhibit a favorable energy&#8208;to&#8208;power ratio, delivering 80&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1AM at 10&#160;000&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1AM along with excellent cycling stability, retaining 80% of the initial capacitance after 25&#160;000 cycles. Furthermore, post&#8208;mortem analysis of the LIC electrodes is conducted to gain deeper insights into the degradation mechanisms within the device.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Multicolor Emissions of the Coumarin&#8208;Modified Cs3LnCl6 Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Nanocrystals and LED Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing coumarin molecule, various Cs3LnCl6 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) emitting light across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum are systemically prepared. The Cs3EuCl6 NC can achieve an impressive photoluminescence quantum yield of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional energy transfer efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, the lanthanide&#8208;based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue are successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based lead&#8208;free perovskite materials hold great promise for the development of high&#8208;resolution full&#8208;color displays in the future. Here, various Cs3LnCl6 perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) emitting light across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum with remarkably high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are systemically prepared. Especially, by introducing multifunctional coumarin small molecules into Cs3EuCl6 NCs as an intermediate state, Cs3EuCl6 NCs can achieve an impressive PLQY of 92.4% with pure red emission and an exceptional energy transfer efficiency of nearly 93.2%. Furthermore, the lanthanide&#8208;based electroluminescent devices in red, green, and blue are successfully fabricated. Among them, the Cs3EuCl6&#8208;NC&#8208;based red light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) demonstrates a FWHM of 18&#160;nm at 617&#160;nm, an external quantum efficiency up to 5.17%, and a maximum brightness of 2373&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which is the most excellent reported for lead&#8208;free narrowband (within 20&#160;nm) emission devices. Notably, these devices exhibit an operating half&#8208;life of 440 h at a brightness level of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, surpassing the performance of most reported lead&#8208;free perovskite LEDs (PLEDs). This work opens up exciting possibilities for the future commercialization of lanthanide&#8208;based PLEDs in the display industry, paving the way for more vibrant, energy&#8208;efficient, and long&#8208;lasting display technologies.

         <title>On&#8208;Command Disassembly of Microrobotic Superstructures for Transport and Delivery of Magnetic Micromachines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magnetically driven microrobotic superstructure is designed for navigation in microscale environments. The superstructure consists of microhelices interlocked with a gelatin composite chassis containing iron oxide nanoparticles. The helices serve as the motion component, while the nanoparticles enable the gelatin to dissolve via magnetic hyperthermia. Upon dissolution, the helices are released and navigate through smaller conduits using a rotating field.








Abstract
Magnetic microrobots have been developed for navigating microscale environments by means of remote magnetic fields. However, limited propulsion speeds at small scales remain an issue in the maneuverability of these devices as magnetic force and torque are proportional to their magnetic volume. Here, a microrobotic superstructure is proposed, which, as analogous to a supramolecular system, consists of two or more microrobotic units that are interconnected and organized through a physical (transient) component (a polymeric frame or a thread). The superstructures consist of microfabricated magnetic helical micromachines interlocked by a magnetic gelatin nanocomposite containing iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). While the microhelices enable the motion of the superstructure, the IONPs serve as heating transducers for dissolving the gelatin chassis via magnetic hyperthermia. In a practical demonstration, the superstructure's motion with a gradient magnetic field in a large channel, the disassembly of the superstructure and release of the helical micromachines by a high&#8208;frequency alternating magnetic field, and the corkscrew locomotion of the released helices through a small channel via a rotating magnetic field, is showcased. This adaptable microrobotic superstructure reacts to different magnetic inputs, which can be used to perform complex delivery procedures within intricate regions of the human body.

         <title>Ultrathin Magnesium&#8208;Based Coating as an Efficient Oxygen Barrier for Superconducting Circuit Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a combined experimental and computational study, it is demonstrated that an ultrathin Mg capping layer effectively suppresses the oxidation of tantalum (Ta), a promising material for superconducting qubits. With Mg acting as an oxygen barrier and getter, the superconducting properties of the underlaying Ta thin films are improved, exhibiting sharper transition to the Meissner state at higher critical temperature.








Abstract
Scaling up superconducting quantum circuits based on transmon qubits necessitates substantial enhancements in qubit coherence time. Over recent years, tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a promising candidate for transmon qubits, surpassing conventional counterparts in terms of coherence time.

&lt;p&gt;Through a combined experimental and computational study, it is demonstrated that an ultrathin Mg capping layer effectively suppresses the oxidation of tantalum (Ta), a promising material for superconducting qubits. With Mg acting as an oxygen barrier and getter, the superconducting properties of the underlaying Ta thin films are improved, exhibiting sharper transition to the Meissner state at higher critical temperature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaling up superconducting quantum circuits based on transmon qubits necessitates substantial enhancements in qubit coherence time. Over recent years, tantalum (Ta) has emerged as a promising candidate for transmon qubits, surpassing conventional counterparts in terms of coherence time. However, amorphous surface Ta oxide layer may introduce dielectric loss, ultimately placing a limit on the coherence time. In this study, a novel approach for suppressing the formation of tantalum oxide using an ultrathin magnesium (Mg) capping layer is presented. Synchrotron-based X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies demonstrate that oxide is confined to an extremely thin region directly beneath the Mg/Ta interface. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the superconducting properties of thin Ta films are improved following the Mg capping, exhibiting sharper and higher-temperature transitions to superconductive and magnetically ordered states. Moreover, an atomic-scale mechanistic understanding of the role of the capping layer in protecting Ta from oxidation is established based on computational modeling. This work provides valuable insights into the formation mechanism and functionality of surface tantalum oxide, as well as a new materials design principle with the potential to reduce dielectric loss in superconducting quantum materials. Ultimately, the findings pave the way for the realization of large-scale, high-performance quantum computing systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrasound Imaging of Tumor Vascular CD93 with MMRN2 Modified Microbubbles for Immune Microenvironment Prediction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor endothelial expression of CD93 inversely correlates with the tumor vasculature normalization and immune activation. Ultrasound molecular imaging CD93 using targeted MBs armed with MMRN2, an endogenous ligand of CD93, provides a noninvasive and accurate strategy to evaluate the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and predict immunotherapy response.








Abstract
Vascular microenvironment is found to be closely related to immunotherapy efficacy. Identification and ultrasound imaging of the unique vascular characteristics, able to predict immune microenvironment, is important for immunotherapy decision&#8208;making. Herein, it is proved that high CD93 expression in the tumor vessels is closely related to the poor immune response of prostate cancer. For ultrasound molecular imaging of CD93, CD93&#8208;targeted microbubbles (MBs) consist a gaseous core and the MMRN2 (Multimerin&#8208;2) containing cell membrane (CM) /lipid hybrid membrane is then synthesized. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate that these MBs can recognize CD93 efficiently and then accumulate within tumor regions highly expressing CD93. Contrast&#8208;enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging with CD93&#8208;targeted MBs demonstrates that targeted ultrasound intensity is negatively related to inflammatory tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. Together, endothelial expression of CD93 in tumor is a unique predictor of immunosuppressive microenvironment and CD93&#8208;targeted MBs have a great potential to evaluate tumor immune status.

         <title>Robust Fiber&#8208;Shaped Flexible Temperature Sensors for Safety Monitoring with Ultrahigh Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber&#8208;shaped flexible temperature sensors with outstanding deformability and temperature sensing characteristics (broad working range and high sensitivity) are achieved through a two&#8208;step synthetic method. The temperature sensors can effectively capture diverse thermal signals in various applications. Notably, a temperature monitoring and warning system is developed to prevent fire accidents resulting from abnormal thermal runaway in electronic devices.








Abstract
Flexible temperature sensors capable of detecting and transmitting temperature data from the human body, environment, and electronic devices hold significant potential for applications in electronic skins, human&#8211;machine interactions, and disaster prevention systems. Nonetheless, fabricating flexible temperature sensors with exceptional sensing performance remains a formidable task, primarily due to the intricate process of constructing an intrinsically flexible sensing element with high sensitivity. In this study, a facile in situ two&#8208;step synthetic method is introduced for fabricating flexible fiber&#8208;shaped NiO/carbon nanotube fiber (CNTF) composites. The resulting NiO/CNTF flexible temperature sensors demonstrate outstanding deformability and temperature sensing characteristics, encompassing a broad working range (&#8722;15 to 60&#160;&#176;C) and high sensitivity (maximum TCR of &#8722;20.2%&#160;&#176;C&#8722;1 and B value of 3332 K). Importantly, the mechanical and thermal behaviors of the sensor in various application conditions are thoroughly examined using finite element analysis simulations. Moreover, the temperature sensors can effectively capture diverse thermal signals in wearable applications. Notably, a temperature monitoring and warning system is developed to prevent fire accidents resulting from abnormal thermal runaway in electronic devices.

         <title>Polymorphism&#8208;Dependent Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescent Scintillation for X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two phenothiazine derivatives exhibiting intriguing polymorphism&#8208;dependent phosphorescent radioluminescence features in the crystal under X&#8208;ray irradiation are synthesized. The results reveal that stabilizing triplet excitons by intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions can achieve efficient X&#8208;ray phosphorescent scintillation. The low detection limit of 278 nGys&#8722;1 of resulting scintillators demonstrates the potential of flexible and low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray radiography.








Abstract
Organic phosphorescent scintillating materials have shown great potential for applications in radiography and radiation detection due to their efficient utilization of excitons. However, revealing the relationship between molecule stacking and the phosphorescent radioluminescence of scintillators is still challenging. This study reports on two phenothiazine derivatives with polymorphism&#8208;dependent phosphorescence radioluminescence. The experiments reveal that molecule stacking significantly affects the non&#8208;radiation decay of the triplet excitons of scintillators, which further determines the phosphorescence scintillation performance under X&#8208;ray irradiation. These phosphorescent scintillators exhibit high radio stability and have a low detection limit of 278 nGys&#8722;1. Additionally, the potential application of these scintillators in X&#8208;ray radiography, based on their X&#8208;ray excited radioluminescence properties, is demonstrated. These findings provide a guideline for obtaining high&#8208;performance phosphorescent scintillating materials by shedding light on the effect of crystal packing on the radioluminescence of organic molecules.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the treatment of iron poisoning, here, the authors propose a remotely unwrapping strategy of metal&#8208;polyphenol&#8208;packaged hyaluronidase (named PPFH) by sequentially injecting PPFH and a clinically used iron&#8208;chelator deferoxamine. Such a cost&#8208;effective HAase delivery strategy memorably improves the subsequent photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT)&#8208;induced intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ T cells and the cross&#8208;talk between tumor and tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes.








Abstract
The therapy of solid tumors is often hindered by the compact and rigid tumoral extracellular matrix (TECM). Precise reduction of TECM by hyaluronidase (HAase) in combination with nanotechnology is promising for solid tumor therapeutics, yet remains an enormous challenge. Inspired by the treatment of iron poisoning, here a remotely unwrapping strategy is proposed of metal&#8208;polyphenol&#8208;packaged HAase (named PPFH) by sequentially injecting PPFH and a clinically used iron&#8208;chelator deferoxamine (DFO). The in situ dynamic disassembly of PPFH can be triggered by the intravenously injected DFO, resulting in the release, reactivation, and deep penetration of encapsulated HAase inside tumors. Such a cost&#8208;effective HAase delivery strategy memorably improves the subsequent photothermal and photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT)&#8208;induced intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocyte cells and the cross&#8208;talk between tumor and tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLN), thereby decreasing the immunosuppression and optimizing tumoricidal immune response that can efficiently protect mice from tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence in multiple mouse cancer models. Overall, this work presents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the dynamic disassembly of metal&#8208;polyphenol nanoparticles for extracellular drug delivery as well as the modulation of TECM and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

         <title>Giant Blue Energy Harvesting in Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Membranes with Spatially Aligned Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel ion transporting membranes enhance power density during osmotic energy conversion. In this study, positively charged propidium&#8208;based 2D polymer membranes are synthesized with both skeleton and intrinsic space charges. When mixing artificial seawater and river water, a great power density of 48 W m&#8722;2 is achieved, surpassing the performance of most nanofluidic membranes.








Abstract
Blue energy between seawater and river water is attracting increasing interest, as one of the sustainable and renewable energy resources that can be harvested from water. Within the reverse electrodialysis applied in blue energy conversion, novel membranes with nanoscale confinement that function as selective ion transport mediums are currently in high demand for realizing higher power density. The primary challenge lies in constructing well&#8208;defined nanochannels that allow for low&#8208;energy barrier transport. This work proposes a concept for nanofluidic channels with a simultaneous dual electrostatic effect that can enhance both ion selectivity and flux. To actualize this, this work has synthesized propidium iodide&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional polymer (PI&#8208;2DP) membranes possessing both skeleton charge and intrinsic space charge, which are spatially aligned along the ion transport pathway. The dual charge design of PI&#8208;2DP significantly enhances the electrostatic interaction between the translocating anions and the cationic polymer framework, and a high anion selectivity coefficient (&#8776;0.8) is reached. When mixing standard artificial seawater and river water, this work achieves a considerable power density of 48.4&#160;W m&#8722;2, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanofluidic membranes. Moreover, when applied between the Mediterranean Sea and the Elbe River, an output power density of 42.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 is achieved by the PI&#8208;2DP. This nanofluidic membrane design with dual&#8208;layer charges will inspire more innovative development of ion&#8208;selective channels for blue energy conversion that will contribute to global energy consumption.

         <title>Functionality Modulation Toward Thianthrene&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Free Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodical functionality modulation is carried out to construct an efficient electrocatalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The incorporation of cyanovinylene linkage enhances the hydrophilicity and stability of the porous polymers. Furthermore, a gradual insertion of electroactive moieties into the structural backbone leads to the construction of a hollow spherical porous polymer as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst.








Abstract
The development of metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is significant but rarely demonstrated. Porous organic polymers (POPs) with well&#8208;defined electroactive functionalities show superior performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Precise control of the active sites' local environment requires careful modulation of linkers through the judicious selection of building units. Here, a systematic strategy is introduced for modulating functionality to design and synthesize a series of thianthrene&#8208;based bifunctional sp2 C&#9552;C bonded POPs with hollow spherical morphologies exhibiting superior electrocatalytic activity. This precise structural tuning allowed to gain insight into the effects of heteroatom incorporation, hydrophilicity, and variations in linker length on electrocatalytic activity. The most efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst THT&#8208;PyDAN achieves a current density of 10 mA cm&#9472;2 at an overpotential (&#951;10) of &#8776;65 mV (in 0.5 m H2SO4) and &#8776;283 mV (in 1 m KOH) for HER and OER, respectively. THT&#8208;PyDAN exhibits superior activity to all previously reported metal&#8208;free bifunctional electrocatalysts in the literature. Furthermore, these investigations demonstrate that THT&#8208;PyDAN maintains its performance even after 36 h of chronoamperometry and 1000 CV cycling. Post&#8208;catalytic characterization using FT&#8208;IR, XPS, and microscopic imaging techniques underscores the long&#8208;term durability of THT&#8208;PyDAN.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions above Room Temperature in a van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature N&#233;el skyrmions in Fe3GaTe2 are observed through Lorentz transmission electron microscopy . Upon an optimized field cooling procedure, zero&#8208;field skyrmion lattices are successfully generated in nanoflakes with an extended thickness range. Significantly, these skyrmion lattices remain stable up to 355 K, setting a new record for the highest temperature at which skyrmions can be hosted.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic crystals are a promising platform for innovative spintronic devices based on magnetic skyrmions, thanks to their high flexibility and atomic thickness stability. However, room&#8208;temperature skyrmion&#8208;hosting vdW materials are scarce, which poses a challenge for practical applications. In this study, a chemical vapor transport (CVT) approach is employed to synthesize Fe3GaTe2 crystals and room&#8208;temperature N&#233;el skyrmions are observed in Fe3GaTe2 nanoflakes above 58&#160;nm in thickness through in situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy (L&#8208;TEM). Upon an optimized field cooling procedure, zero&#8208;field hexagonal skyrmion lattices are successfully generated in nanoflakes with an extended thickness range (30&#8211;180&#160;nm). Significantly, these skyrmion lattices remain stable up to 355 K, setting a new record for the highest temperature at which skyrmions can be hosted. The research establishes Fe3GaTe2 as an emerging above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature skyrmion&#8208;hosting vdW material, holding great promise for future spintronics.

         <title>Flexible, Biodegradable, and Wireless Magnetoelectric Paper for Simple In Situ Personalization of Bioelectric Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper featuring homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality is presented. This paper synergistically combines lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles for external magnetic field&#8208;induced electrical stimulation and flexible, biodegradable nanofibers for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. Scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability are demonstrated through simple paper crafting techniques such as origami and kirigami.








Abstract
Bioelectronic implants delivering electrical stimulation offer an attractive alternative to traditional pharmaceuticals in electrotherapy. However, achieving simple, rapid, and cost&#8208;effective personalization of these implants for customized treatment in unique clinical and physical scenarios presents a substantial challenge. This challenge is further compounded by the need to ensure safety and minimal invasiveness, requiring essential attributes such as flexibility, biocompatibility, lightness, biodegradability, and wireless stimulation capability. Here, a flexible, biodegradable bioelectronic paper with homogeneously distributed wireless stimulation functionality for simple personalization of bioelectronic implants is introduced. The bioelectronic paper synergistically combines i) lead&#8208;free magnetoelectric nanoparticles (MENs) that facilitate electrical stimulation in response to external magnetic field and ii) flexible and biodegradable nanofibers (NFs) that enable localization of MENs for high&#8208;selectivity stimulation, oxygen/nutrient permeation, cell orientation modulation, and biodegradation rate control. The effectiveness of wireless electrical stimulation in vitro through enhanced neuronal differentiation of neuron&#8208;like PC12 cells and the controllability of their microstructural orientation are shown. Also, scalability, design flexibility, and rapid customizability of the bioelectronic paper are shown by creating various 3D macrostructures using simple paper crafting techniques such as cutting and folding. This platform holds promise for simple and rapid personalization of temporary bioelectronic implants for minimally invasive wireless stimulation therapies.

         <title>Harnessing High&#8208;Throughput Computational Methods to Accelerate the Discovery of Optimal Proton Conductors for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells</title>

Pivoting to advanced computational methods accelerates the discovery of optimal proton conductors. Calculations predict that BaSnxCe0.8&#8208;xYb0.2O3&#8208;&#948; (BSCYb) exhibits superior conductivity and stability over existing materials. Experimental studies confirm these insights, demonstrating outstanding performance in BSCYb&#8208;based protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs). This research underscores the potential of computational methodologies in propelling more efficient PCEC systems for power generation and fuel production.









Abstract
The pursuit of high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;lasting protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) is impeded by the lack of efficient and enduring proton conductors. Conventional research approaches, predominantly based on a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodology, have proven to be demanding of resources and time&#8208;consuming. Here, this work reports the findings in harnessing high&#8208;throughput computational methods to expedite the discovery of optimal electrolytes for PCECs. This work methodically computes the oxygen vacancy formation energy (EV), hydration energy (EH), and the adsorption energies of H2O and CO2 for a set of 932 oxide candidates. Notably, these findings highlight BaSnxCe0.8&#8208;xYb0.2O3&#8208;&#948; (BSCYb) as a prospective game&#8208;changing contender, displaying superior proton conductivity and chemical resilience when compared to the well&#8208;regarded BaZrxCe0.8&#8208;xY0.1Yb0.1O3&#8208;&#948; (BZCYYb) series. Experimental validations substantiate the computational predictions; PCECs incorporating BSCYb as the electrolyte achieved extraordinary peak power densities in the fuel cell mode (0.52 and 1.57&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 450 and 600 &#176;C, respectively), a current density of 2.62 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3&#160;V and 600 &#176;C in the electrolysis mode while demonstrating exceptional durability for over 1000&#8208;h when exposed to 50% H2O. This research underscores the transformative potential of high&#8208;throughput computational techniques in advancing the field of proton&#8208;conducting oxides for sustainable power generation and hydrogen production.

         <title>Out&#8208;of&#8208;Equilibrium Mechanical Disruption of &#946;&#8208;Amyloid&#8208;Like Fibers using Light&#8208;Driven Molecular Motors</title>

         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;driven rotary motor is co&#8208;self&#8208;assembled in a &#946;&#8208;amyloid&#8208;like structure forming supramolecular hydrogels. Upon UV irradiation, the work produced by the continuous rotation of the motor is shown to disrupt the hydrogen bonds of the self&#8208;assembled system, leading to an endergonic gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition in out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium conditions. The structure of the original hydrogel is subsequently recovered in the dark.








Abstract
Artificial molecular motors have the potential to generate mechanical work on their environment by producing autonomous unidirectional motions when supplied with a source of energy. However, the harnessing of this mechanical work to subsequently activate various endoenergetic processes that can be useful in materials science remains elusive. Here, it is shown that by integrating a light&#8208;driven rotary motor through hydrogen bonds in a &#946;&#8208;amyloid&#8208;like structure forming supramolecular hydrogels, the mechanical work generated during the constant rotation of the molecular machine under UV irradiation is sufficient to disrupt the &#946;&#8208;amyloid fibers and to trigger a gel&#8208;to&#8208;sol transition at macroscopic scale. This melting of the gel under UV irradiation occurs 25 &#176;C below the temperature needed to melt it by solely using thermal activation. In the dark, a reversible sol&#8211;gel transition is observed as the system fully recovers its original microstructure, thus illustrating the possible access to new kinds of motorized materials that can be controlled by advanced out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium thermodynamics.

         <title>Boosting the Performances of Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics via Synergetic Near&#8208;Infrared Light Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>

Core&#8211;bishell PdCu@Au@SiO2&#160;nanotripods significantly enhance photon absorption in the NIR range for semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells. An optical coupling&#160;multilayer&#160;consisting of ZnS(130&#160;nm)/Na3AlF6(60&#160;nm)/WO3(100&#160;nm)/LaF3(50&#160;nm) enhances the NIR light utilization and the visible transparency. These strategies&#160;result in a record&#8208;high PCE of 16.14% along with an excellent AVT of over 30%, correspond to the record LUE of 5.33%.









Abstract
Semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) offer promising prospects for application in building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic systems and greenhouses, but further improvement of their performance faces a delicate trade&#8208;off between the two competing indexes of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and average visible transmittance (AVT). Herein, the authors take advantage of coupling plasmonics with the optical design of ST&#8208;OPVs to enhance near&#8208;infrared absorption and hence simultaneously improve efficiency and visible transparency to the maximum extent. By integrating core&#8211;bishell PdCu@Au@SiO2 nanotripods that act as optically isotropic Lambertian sources with near&#8208;infrared&#8208;customized localized surface plasmon resonance in an optimal ternary PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based ST&#8208;OPV, it is shown that their interplay with a multilayer optical coupling layer, consisting of ZnS(130&#160;nm)/Na3AlF6(60&#160;nm)/WO3(100&#160;nm)/LaF3(50&#160;nm) identified from high&#8208;throughput optical screening, leads to a record&#8208;high PCE of 16.14% (certified as 15.90%) along with an excellent AVT of 33.02%. The strong enhancement of the light utilization efficiency by &#8776;50% as compared to the counterpart device without optical engineering provides an encouraging and universal pathway for promoting breakthroughs in ST&#8208;OPVs from meticulous optical design.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Visualization of Multiferroicity in Monolayer NiI2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in monolayer NiI2. Its type&#8208;II multiferroic order arises from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling. These results on magnetoelectric effects at the atomic scale suggest new ways to engineer multiferroic orders in van der Waals materials and their heterostructures.








Abstract
Progress in layered van der Waals materials has resulted in the discovery of ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials down to the monolayer limit. Recently, evidence of the first purely 2D multiferroic material was&#160;reported in monolayer NiI2. However, probing multiferroicity with scattering&#8208;based and optical bulk techniques is challenging on 2D materials, and experiments on the atomic scale are needed to fully characterize the multiferroic order at the monolayer limit. Here, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to probe and characterize the multiferroic order in monolayer NiI2. It is demonstrated that the type&#8208;II multiferroic order displayed by NiI2, arising from the combination of a magnetic spin spiral order and a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, allows probing the multiferroic order in the STM experiments. Moreover, the magnetoelectric coupling of NiI2 is directly probed by external electric field manipulation of the multiferroic domains. The findings establish a novel point of view to analyze magnetoelectric effects at the microscopic level, paving the way toward engineering new multiferroic orders in van der Waals materials and their&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>Nonlocal Acoustic Moir&#233; Hyperbolic Metasurfaces</title>

         <dc:description>
The topological transition in twisted bilayer materials has attracted considerable attention in nano&#8208;optics. In the analogue of acoustics, however, no such topological transition has been found experimentally due to the inherent scalar property of sound pressure. In this work, by using a nonlocal design, the in&#8208;plane acoustic pressure is transformed into a spatially distributed vector field using twisted multilayer metasurfaces.








Abstract
The discovery of the topological transition in twisted bilayer (tBL) materials has attracted considerable attention in nano&#8208;optics. In the analogue of acoustics, however, no such topological transition has been found due to the inherent nondirectional scalar property of acoustic pressure. In this work, by using a theory&#8208;based nonlocal anisotropic design, the in&#8208;plane acoustic pressure is transformed into a spatially distributed vector field using twisted multilayer metasurfaces. So&#8208;called &#8220;acoustic magic angle&#8221;&#8208;related acoustic phenomena occur, such as nonlocal polariton hybridization and the topological Lifshitz transition. The dispersion becomes flat at the acoustic magic angle, enabling polarized excitations to propagate in a single direction. Moreover, the acoustic topological transition (from hyperbolic to elliptic dispersion) is experimentally observed for the first time as the twist angle continuously changes. This unique characteristic facilitates low&#8208;loss tunable polariton hybridization at the subwavelength scale. A twisted trilayer acoustic metasurface is also experimentally demonstrated, and more possibilities for manipulating acoustic waves are found. These discoveries not only enrich the concepts of moir&#233; physics and topological acoustics but also provide a complete framework of theory and methodologies for explaining the phenomena that are observed.

         <title>Discovering a New Drug Against Acute Kidney Injury by Using a Tailored Photoacoustic Imaging Probe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Given the revelation of myeloperoxidase overexpression and redox imbalance of ClO&#8722;/GSH in acute kidney injury (AKI), a tailored photoacoustic (PA) probe is developed that enables real&#8208;time, noninvasive monitoring of AKI levels through PA imaging. Leveraging this probe, this work has established a drug screening approach and has discovered, for the first time, the therapeutic potential of astragalin in treating AKI.








Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) has become an increasing concern for patients due to the widespread clinical use of nephrotoxic drugs. Currently, the early diagnosis of AKI is still challenging and the available therapeutic drugs cannot meet the clinical demand. Herein, this work has investigated the key redox couple involved in AKI and develops a tailored photoacoustic (PA) imaging probe (AB&#8208;DiOH) which can reversibly respond to hypochlorite (ClO&#8722;)/glutathione (GSH) with high specificity and sensitivity. This probe enables the real&#8208;time monitoring of AKI by noninvasive PA imaging, with better detection sensitivity than the blood test. Furthermore, this probe is utilized for screening nephroprotective drugs among natural products. For the first time, astragalin is discovered to be a potential new drug for the treatment of AKI. After oral administration, astragalin can be efficiently absorbed by the animal body, alleviate kidney injury, and meanwhile induce no damage to other normal tissues. The treatment mechanism of astragalin has also been revealed to be the simultaneous inhibition of oxidative stress, ferroptosis, and cuproposis. The developed PA imaging probe and the discovered drug candidate provide a promising new tool and strategy for the early diagnosis and effective treatment of AKI.

         <title>Sustainable and Rapid Water Purification at the Confined Hydrogel Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the design insight into the peroxymonosulfate activation system by boosting the mass transfer performance within hydrogel interfaces for ultrafast water purification.








Abstract
Emerging organic contaminants in water matrices have challenged ecosystems and human health safety. Persulfate&#8208;based advanced oxidation processes (PS&#8208;AOPs) have attracted much attention as they address potential water purification challenges. However, overcoming the mass transfer constraint and the catalyst's inherent site agglomeration in the heterogeneous system remains urgent. Herein, the abundant metal&#8208;anchored loading (&#8776;6&#8211;8&#160;g m&#8722;2) of alginate hydrogel membranes coupled with cross&#8208;flow mode as an efficient strategy for water purification applications is proposed. The organic flux of the confined hydrogel interfaces sharply enlarges with the reduction of the thickness of the boundary layer via the pressure field. The normalized property of the system displays a remarkable organic (sulfonamides) elimination rate of 4.87 &#215; 104&#160;mg min&#8722;1 mol&#8722;1. Furthermore, due to the fast reaction time (&lt;1&#160;min), cross&#8208;flow mode only reaches a meager energy cost (&#8776;2.21&#160;Wh m&#8722;3) under the pressure drive field. It is anticipated that this finding provides insight into the novel design with ultrafast organic removal performance and low techno&#8208;economic cost (i.e., energy operation cost, material, and reagent cost) for the field of water purification under various PS&#8208;AOPs challenging scenarios.

         <title>In Situ Piezoelectric&#8208;Catalytic Anti&#8208;Inflammation Promotes the Rehabilitation of Acute Spinal Cord Injury in Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an effective and controllable H2&#8208;based nanocatalytic treatment strategy in which biocompatible Au@BT NPs are constructed to catalyze H2 generation in response to ultrasound exposure to achieve anti&#8208;inflammatory effect through scavenging ROS; thus, achieving a notable therapeutic improvement in their motor function.








Abstract
Relieving inflammation via scavenging toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the acute phase of spinal cord injury (SCI) proves to be an effective strategy to mitigate secondary spinal cord injury and improve recovery of motor function. However, commonly used corticosteroid anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs show adverse side effects which may induce increased risk of wound infection. Fortunately, hydrogen (H2), featuring selective antioxidant performance, easy penetrability, and excellent biosafety, is being extensively investigated as a potential anti&#8208;inflammatory therapeutic gas for the treatment of SCI. In this work, by a facile in situ growth approach of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the piezoelectric BaTiO3, a particulate nanocomposite with Schottky heterojunction (Au@BT) is synthesized, which can generate H2 continuously by catalyzing H+ reduction through piezoelectric catalysis. Further, theoretical calculations are employed to reveal the piezoelectric catalytic mechanism of Au@BT. Transcriptomics analysis and nontargeted large&#8208;scale metabolomic analysis reveal the deeper mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of H2 therapy. The as&#8208;prepared Au@BT nanoparticle is first explored as a flexible hydrogen gas generator for efficient SCI therapy. This study highlights a promising prospect of nanocatalytic medicine for disease treatments by catalyzing H2 generation; thus, offering a significant alternative to conventional approaches against refractory spinal cord injury.

         <title>Early Diagnosis and Prognosis Prediction of Pancreatic Cancer Using Engineered Hybrid Core&#8208;Shells in Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops designer Au@SiO2@ZrO2 core&#8208;shells with tunable structural features for direct laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS) based recording of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs), enabling both early diagnosis and prognostic prediction of pancreatic cancer (PC). This work highlights the synergistic effect of core&#8208;shell structures in LDI and offers insights into the material&#8208;based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.








Abstract
Effective detection of bio&#8208;molecules relies on the precise design and preparation of materials, particularly in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS). Despite significant advancements in substrate materials, the performance of single&#8208;structured substrates remains suboptimal for LDI&#8208;MS analysis of complex systems. Herein, designer Au@SiO2@ZrO2 core&#8208;shell substrates are developed for LDI&#8208;MS&#8208;based early diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC). Through controlling Au core size and ZrO2 shell crystallization, signal amplification of metabolites up to 3 orders is not only achieved, but also the synergistic mechanism of the LDI process is revealed. The optimized Au@SiO2@ZrO2 enables a direct record of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) by LDI&#8208;MS. Subsequently, SMFs are employed to distinguish early PC (stage I/II) from controls, with an accuracy of 92%. Moreover, a prognostic prediction scoring system is established with enhanced efficacy in predicting PC survival compared to CA19&#8208;9 (p &lt; 0.05). This work contributes to material&#8208;based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

This work highlights the synergistic effect of core-shell structures in LDI and offers insights into the material-based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective detection of bio-molecules relies on the precise design and preparation of materials, particularly in laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS). Despite significant advancements in substrate materials, the performance of single-structured substrates remains suboptimal for LDI-MS analysis of complex systems. Herein, designer Au@SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; core-shell substrates are developed for LDI-MS-based early diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC). Through controlling Au core size and ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell crystallization, signal amplification of metabolites up to 3 orders is not only achieved, but also the synergistic mechanism of the LDI process is revealed. The optimized Au@SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enables a direct record of serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) by LDI-MS. Subsequently, SMFs are employed to distinguish early PC (stage I/II) from controls, with an accuracy of 92%. Moreover, a prognostic prediction scoring system is established with enhanced efficacy in predicting PC survival compared to CA19-9 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). This work contributes to material-based cancer diagnosis and prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Freeze&#8208;Thaw Microfluidic System Produces &#8220;Themis&#8221; Nanocomplex for Cleaning Persisters&#8208;Infected Macrophages and Enhancing Uninfected Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC) is fabricated via a microfluidic chip based on the freeze&#8208;thaw strategy. For infected macrophages, TNC releases heme to reconstruct the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. For uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulates TCA cycle and OXPHOS, contributing to the immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacteria therapy.








Abstract
Macrophages are the primary effectors against potential pathogen infections. They can be &#8220;parasitized&#8221; by intracellular bacteria, serving as &#8220;accomplices&#8221;, protecting intracellular bacteria and even switching them to persisters. Here, using a freeze&#8208;thaw strategy&#8208;based microfluidic chip, a &#8220;Themis&#8221; nanocomplex (TNC) is created. The TNC consists of Lactobacillus reuteri&#8208;derived membrane vesicles, heme, and vancomycin, which cleaned infected macrophages and enhanced uninfected macrophages. In infected macrophages, TNC releases heme that led to the reconstruction of the respiratory chain complexes of intracellular persisters, forcing them to regrow. The revived bacteria produces virulence factors that destroyed host macrophages (accomplices), thereby being externalized and becoming vulnerable to immune responses. In uninfected macrophages, TNC upregulates the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), contributing to immunoenhancement. The combined effect of TNC of cleaning the accomplice (infected macrophages) and reinforcing uninfected macrophages provides a promising strategy for intracellular bacterial therapy.

         <title>Mapping Extracellular Space Features of Viral Encephalitis to Evaluate the Proficiency of Anti&#8208;Viral Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust approach that utilizes single particle diffusion fingerprinting of quantum dots, along with machine learning, to map brain extracellular space features and predict the efficacy of drugs against viral encephalitis is developed.








Abstract
The extracellular space (ECS) is an important barrier against viral attack on brain cells, and dynamic changes in ECS microstructure characteristics are closely related to the progression of viral encephalitis in the brain and the efficacy of antiviral drugs. However, mapping the precise morphological and rheological features of the ECS in viral encephalitis is still challenging so far. Here, a robust approach is developed using single&#8208;particle diffusional fingerprinting of quantum dots combined with machine learning to map ECS features in the brain and predict the efficacy of antiviral encephalitis drugs. These results demonstrated that this approach can characterize the microrheology and geometry of the brain ECS at different stages of viral infection and identify subtle changes induced by different drug treatments. This approach provides a potential platform for drug proficiency assessment and is expected to offer a reliable basis for the clinical translation of drugs.

         <title>Mitocytosis Mediated by an Enzyme&#8208;Activable Mitochondrion&#8208;Disturbing Polymer&#8208;Drug Conjugate Enhances Active Penetration in Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activable mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine assembled from an amphiphilic block polymer&#8208;drug conjugate is developed for achieving efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) crossing and deep glioblastoma (GBM) penetration. This nanomedicine interferes mitochondrial homeostasis, which mediates the process of mitocytosis for mitochondrial quality control, facilitating mitosome&#8208;mediated active transcellular transport in GBM tissues.








Abstract
The application of nanomedicines for glioblastoma (GBM) therapy is hampered by the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the dense glioblastoma tissue. To achieve efficient BBB crossing and deep GBM penetration, this work demonstrates a strategy of active transcellular transport of a mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine, pGBEMA22&#8208;b&#8208;pSSPPT9 (GBEPPT), in the GBM tissue through mitocytosis. GBEPPT is computer&#8208;aided designed and prepared by self&#8208;assembling a conjugate of an amphiphilic block polymer and a drug podophyllotoxin (PPT). When GBEPPT is delivered to the tumor site, overexpressed &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) on the brain&#8211;blood endothelial cell, or the GBM cell triggered enzymatic hydrolysis of &#947;&#8208;glutamylamide on GBEPPT to reverse its negative charge to positive. Positively charged GBEPPT rapidly enter into the cell and target the mitochondria. These GBEPPT disturb the homeostasis of mitochondria, inducing mitocytosis&#8208;mediated extracellular transport of GBEPPT to the neighboring cells via mitosomes. This intracellular&#8208;to&#8208;intercellular delivery cycle allows GBEPPT to penetrate deeply into the GBM parenchyma, and exert sustainable action of PPT released from GBEPPT on the tumor cells along its penetration path at the tumor site, thus improving the anti&#8208;GBM effect. The process of mitocytosis mediated by the mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine may offer great potential in enhancing drug penetration through malignant tissues, especially poorly permeable solid tumors.

         <title>Monolithic 2D Perovskites Enabled Artificial Photonic Synapses for Neuromorphic Vision Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new persistent photocurrent mechanism based on ion motion and ion&#8208;exciton coupling is proposed in two dimensional perovskites. The special charge carrier dynamics lead to the bio&#8208;plausible synaptic characteristics of the photodetectors. The light&#8208;tunable synaptic plasticity enables not only to realize image preprocessing, but also effectively recognizes target images by learning critical features.








Abstract
Neuromorphic visual sensors (NVS) based on photonic synapses hold a significant promise to emulate the human visual system. However, current photonic synapses rely on exquisite engineering of the complex heterogeneous interface to realize learning and memory functions, resulting in high fabrication cost, reduced reliability, high energy consumption and uncompact architecture, severely limiting the up&#8208;scaled manufacture, and on&#8208;chip integration. Here a photo&#8208;memory fundamental based on ion&#8208;exciton coupling is innovated to simplify synaptic structure and minimize energy consumption. Due to the intrinsic organic/inorganic interface within the crystal, the photodetector based on monolithic 2D perovskite exhibits a persistent photocurrent lasting about 90&#160;s, enabling versatile synaptic functions. The electrical power consumption per synaptic event is estimated to be&#8776;1.45&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;16&#160;J, one order of magnitude lower than that in a natural biological system. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept image preprocessing using the neuromorphic vision sensors enabled by photonic synapse demonstrates 4 times enhancement of classification accuracy. Furthermore, getting rid of the artificial neural network, an expectation&#8208;based thresholding model is put forward to mimic the human visual system for facial recognition. This conceptual device unveils a new mechanism to simplify synaptic structure, promising the transformation of the NVS and fostering the emergence of next generation neural networks.

         <title>Enhancing Photosynthesis Efficiency of Hydrogen Peroxide by Modulating Side Chains to Facilitate Water Oxidation at Low&#8208;Energy Barrier Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linked electron donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymers are constructed alternately and introduce electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into the side chains of electron donors to mediate the active sites responsible for water oxidation. Under anaerobic conditions, its H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency via water oxidation reaction reaches an impressive 1365&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;h&#8208;1. Remarkably, the photocatalyst achieves a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 0.64%, the highest reported in natural water.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a crucial oxidant in advanced oxidation processes. In situ, photosynthesis of it in natural water holds the promise of practical application for water remediation. However, current photosynthesis of H2O2 systems primarily relies on oxygen reduction, leading to limited performance in natural water with low dissolved oxygen or anaerobic conditions found in polluted water. Herein, a novel photocatalyst based on conjugated polymers with alternating electron donor&#8211;acceptor structures and electron&#8208;withdrawing side chains on electron donors is introduced. Specifically, carbazole functions as the electron donor, triazine serves as the electron acceptor, and cyano acts as the electron&#8208;withdrawing side chain. Notably, the photocatalyst exhibits a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion of 0.64%, the highest reported in natural water. Furthermore, even in anaerobic conditions, it achieves an impressive H2O2 photosynthetic efficiency of 1365&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, surpassing all the reported photosynthetic systems of H2O2. This remarkable improvement is attributed to the effective relocation of the water oxidation active site from a high&#8208;energy carbazole to a low&#8208;energy acetylene site mediated by the side chains, resulting in enhanced O2 or H2O2 generation from water. This breakthrough offers a new avenue for efficient water remediation using advanced oxidation technologies in oxygen&#8208;limited environments, holding significant implications for environmental restoration.

         <title>Highly Flexible, High&#8208;Performance, and Stretchable Piezoelectric Sensor Based on a Hierarchical Droplet&#8208;Shaped Ceramics with Enhanced Damage Tolerance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic showing the development of stretchable hierarchical ceramic sensors through a novel soft&#8208;rigid hybrid strategy, whose configuration ensures excellent mechanical flexibility, high piezoelectric activity and structural robustness, including a linear response, wide&#8208;angle twisting, and wide range of stretching. This new sensor is successfully used for both wireless gesture recognition and the assessment of the progression of knee osteoarthritis.








Abstract
Stretchable self&#8208;powered sensors are of significant interest in next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, current strategies for creating stretchable piezoelectric sensors based on piezoelectric polymers or 0&#8211;3 piezoelectric composites face several challenges such as low piezoelectric activity, low sensitivity, and poor durability. In this paper, a biomimetic soft&#8208;rigid hybrid strategy is used to construct a new form of highly flexible, high&#8208;performance, and stretchable piezoelectric sensor. Inspired by the hinged bivalve Cristaria plicata, hierarchical droplet&#8208;shaped ceramics are manufactured and used as rigid components, where computational models indicate that the unique arched curved surface and rounded corners of this bionic structure can alleviate stress concentrations. To ensure electrical connectivity of the piezoelectric phase during stretching, a patterned liquid metal acts as a soft circuit and a silicone polymer with optimized wettability and stretchability serves as a soft component that forms a strong mechanical interlock with the hierarchical ceramics. The novel sensor design exhibits excellent sensitivity and durability, where the open circuit voltage remains stable after 5000 stretching cycles at 60% strain and 5000 twisting cycles at 180&#176;. To demonstrate its potential in heathcare applications, this new stretchable sensor is successfully used for wireless gesture recognition and assessing the progression of knee osteoarthritis.

         <title>Beyond Conventional Carbon Activation: Creating Porosity without Etching Using Cesium Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and efficient synthetic strategy is proposed for highly porous carbons with a high yield of 25% and a specific surface area of 3008 m2 g&#8722;1 upon thermal treatment of carboxylic acids and Cs2CO3. The unconventional roles of Cs species are unraveled as an electron injector and intercalation agent to promote the formation of carbonaceous frameworks and porous structures.








Abstract
Facile synthesis of porous carbon with high yield and high specific surface area (SSA) from low&#8208;cost molecular precursors offers promising opportunities for their industrial applications. However, conventional activation methods using potassium and sodium hydroxides or carbonates suffer from low yields (&lt;20%) and poor control over porosity and composition especially when high SSAs are targeted (&gt;2000 m2 g&#8722;1) because nanopores are typically created by etching. Herein, a non&#8208;etching activation strategy is demonstrated using cesium salts of low&#8208;cost carboxylic acids as the sole precursor in producing porous carbons with yields of up to 25% and SSAs reaching 3008 m2 g&#8722;1. The pore size and oxygen content can be adjusted by tuning the synthesis temperature or changing the molecular precursor. Mechanistic investigation unravels the non&#8208;classical role of cesium as an activating agent. The cesium compounds that form in situ, including carbonates, oxides, and metallic cesium, have extremely low work function enabling electron injection into organic/carbonaceous framework, promoting condensation, and intercalation of cesium ions into graphitic stacks forming slit pores. The resulting porous carbons deliver a high capacity of 252 mAh g&#8722;1 (567 F g&#8722;1) and durability of 100&#160;000 cycles as cathodes of Zn&#8208;ion capacitors, showing their potential for electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Bioengineered Neutrophils for Smart Response in Brain Infection Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CellUs integrates live neutrophils enveloping a liposomal formulation of antibiotic ceftriaxone, steroidal anti&#8208;inflammatory drug dexamethasone, and oxygen&#8208;loaded perfluorocarbon, for treating brain infections. CellUs leverages the natural chemotactic property of neutrophils to penetrate the blood&#8211;brain barrier, accurately targets infection sites, and synchronizes the release of therapeutic agents under the ultrasound stimulation, thereby combating both bacterial infection and excess inflammatory cytokines.








Abstract
Brain infections, frequently accompanied by significant inflammation, necessitate comprehensive therapeutic approaches targeting both infections and associated inflammation. A major impediment to such combined treatment is the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which significantly restricts therapeutic agents from achieving effective concentrations within the central nervous system. Here, a neutrophil&#8208;centric dual&#8208;responsive delivery system, coined &#8220;CellUs,&#8221; is pioneered. This system is characterized by live neutrophils enveloping liposomes of dexamethasone, ceftriaxone, and oxygen&#8208;saturated perfluorocarbon (Lipo@D/C/P). CellUs is meticulously engineered to co&#8208;deliver antibiotics, anti&#8208;inflammatory agents, and oxygen, embodying a comprehensive strategy against brain infections. CellUs leverages the intrinsic abilities of neutrophils to navigate through BBB, accurately target infection sites, and synchronize the release of Lipo@D/C/P with local inflammatory signals. Notably, the incorporation of ultrasound&#8208;responsive perfluorocarbon within Lipo@D/C/P ensures the on&#8208;demand release of therapeutic agents at the afflicted regions. CellUs shows considerable promise in treating Staphylococcus aureus infections in mice with meningitis, particularly when combined with ultrasound treatments. It effectively penetrates BBB, significantly eliminates bacteria, reduces inflammation, and delivers oxygen to the affected brain tissue, resulting in a substantial improvement in survival rates. Consequently, CellUs harnesses the natural chemotactic properties of neutrophils and offers an innovative pathway to improve treatment effectiveness while minimizing adverse effects.

         <title>Programming Polarity Heterogeneity of Energy Storage Dielectrics by Bidirectional Intelligent Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional intelligent design with phase&#8208;field simulation and machine learning is performed to study the influence of local polarity heterogeneity on the energy storage performance in BiFeO3&#8208;based dielectrics. By reversely optimization, a maximal energy density of 188 J cm&#8722;3 with efficiency above 95% at 8 MV cm&#8722;1 is obtained in BiFeO3&#8208;Al2O3 systems with nanopillar&#8208;like polar regions. 








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors, characterized by ultra&#8208;high power densities, are considered as fundamental energy storage components in electronic and electrical systems. However, synergistically improving energy densities and efficiencies remains a daunting challenge. Understanding the role of polarity&#160;heterogeneity at the nanoscale in determining polarization response is crucial to the domain engineering of high&#8208;performance dielectrics. Here, a bidirectional design with phase&#8208;field simulation and machine learning is performed to forward reveal the structure&#8208;property relationship and reversely optimize polarity heterogeneity to improve energy storage performance. Taking BiFeO3&#8208;based dielectrics as typical systems, this work establishes the mapping diagrams of energy density and efficiency dependence on the volume fraction, size and configuration of polar regions. Assisted by CatBoost and Wolf Pack algorithms, this work analyzes the contributions of geometric factors and intrinsic features and find that nanopillar&#8208;like polar regions show great potential in achieving both high polarization intensity and fast dipole switching. Finally, a maximal energy density of 188 J cm&#8722;3 with efficiency above 95% at 8 MV cm&#8722;1 is obtained in BiFeO3&#8208;Al2O3 systems. This work provides a general method to study the influence of local polar heterogeneity on polarization behaviors and proposes effective strategies to enhance energy storage performance by tuning polarity heterogeneity.

         <title>Fluidic Ultrasound Generation for Non&#8208;Destructive Testing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;coupled ultrasound enables material characterization and fault detection for specimens that are very large or do not allow contact with other materials. This study presents a novel fluidic transducer that can withstand harsh environments and generates a high&#8208;amplitude ultrasonic signal without impedance mismatch to air. Its usability for time&#8208;of&#8208;flight measurements was&#160;verified and compared to piezoelectric transducers.








Abstract
Air&#8208;coupled ultrasonic testing (ACU) is a pioneering technique in non&#8208;destructive testing (NDT). While contact testing and fluid immersion testing are standard methods in many applications, the adoption of ACU is progressing slowly, especially in the low ultrasonic frequency range. A main reason for this development is the difficulty of generating high amplitude ultrasonic bursts with equipment that is robust enough to be applied outside a laboratory environment. This paper presents the fluidic ultrasonic transducer as a solution to this challenge. This novel aeroacoustic source uses the flow instability of a sonic jet in a bistable fluidic switch to generate ultrasonic bursts up to 60&#160;kHz with a mean peak pressure of 320&#160;Pa. The robust design allows operation in adverse environments, independent of the operating fluid. Non&#8208;contact through&#8208;transmission experiments are conducted on four materials and compared with the results of conventional transducers. For the first time, it is shown that the novel fluidic ultrasonic transducer provides a suitable acoustic signal for NDT tasks and has potential of furthering the implementation of ACU in industrial&#160;applications.

         <title>Infinite Self&#8208;Propulsion of Circularly On/Discharged Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the superhydrophobic surface printed with symmetrical waved alternating potential, the droplets can be circularly charged or discharged during the transport process. By deeply studying the motion mechanisms for neutral droplets and charged droplets, the circularly on/discharged droplets achieve the infinite self&#8208;propulsion (&gt;1000 mm) with an ultrahigh velocity of meters per second.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propulsion of droplets in a controlled and long path at a high&#8208;speed is crucial for organic synthesis, pathological diagnosis and programable lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip. To date, extensive efforts have been made to achieve droplet self&#8208;propulsion by asymmetric gradient, yet, existing structural, chemical, or charge density gradients can only last for a while (&lt;50&#160;mm). Here, this work designs a symmetrical waved alternating potential (WAP) on a superhydrophobic surface to charge or discharge the droplets during the transport process. By deeply studying the motion mechanisms for neutral droplets and charged droplets, the circularly on/discharged droplets achieve the infinite self&#8208;propulsion (&gt;1000&#160;mm) with an ultrahigh velocity of meters per second. In addition, after permutation and combination of two motion styles of the droplets, it can be competent for more interesting work, such as liquid diode and liquid logic gate. Being assembled into a microfluidic chip, the strategy would be applied in chemical synthesis, cell culture, and diagnostic kits.

         <title>Heterojunction&#8208;Induced Rapid Transformation of Ni3+/Ni2+ Sites which Mediates Urea Oxidation for Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ni3+/Ni2+&#8208;mediated urea oxidation pathway is achieved via constructing heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni2P4O12/NiTe), resulting in a record&#8208;high electrocatalytic urea oxidation performance. Furthermore, achieving excellent hydrogen evolution property in a urea electrolysis electrolyzer equipped with Ni2P4O12/NiTe as bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts (Ni2P4O12/NiTe || Ni2P4O12/NiTe), steadily delivering 100 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.475 V over 500 h.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is an environmentally&#8208;friendly strategy for hydrogen production but suffers from significant energy consumption. Substituting urea oxidation reaction (UOR) with lower theoretical voltage for water oxidation reaction adopting nickel&#8208;based electrocatalysts engenders reduced energy consumption for hydrogen production. The main obstacle remains strong interaction between accumulated Ni3+ and *COO in the conventional Ni3+&#8208;catalyzing pathway. Herein, a novel Ni3+/Ni2+ mediated pathway for UOR via constructing a heterojunction of nickel metaphosphate and nickel telluride (Ni2P4O12/NiTe), which efficiently lowers the energy barrier of UOR and avoids the accumulation of Ni3+ and excessive adsorption of *COO on the electrocatalysts, is developed. As a result, Ni2P4O12/NiTe demonstrates an exceptionally low potential of 1.313&#160;V to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 toward efficient urea oxidation reaction while simultaneously showcases an overpotential of merely 24&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution reaction. Constructing urea electrolysis electrolyzer using Ni2P4O12/NiTe at both sides attains 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.475&#160;V along with excellent stability over 500 h accompanied with nearly 100% Faradic efficiency.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature, Universal Synthetic Route for Mesoporous Metal Oxides by Exploiting Synergistic Effect of Thermal Activation and Plasma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of thermal activation and plasma enabled low&#8208;temperature synthesis (150&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C) of various mesoporous metal oxide (V2O5, V6O13, TiO2, WO3, Nb2O5, and MoO3), suitable for flexible polymeric substrates.

Mesoporous metal oxides exhibit excellent physicochemical properties and are widely used in various fields, including energy storage/conversion, catalysis, and sensors. Although several soft&#8208;template approaches are reported, high&#8208;temperature calcination for both metal oxide formation and template removal is necessary, which limits direct synthesis on a plastic substrate for flexible devices. Here, a universal synthetic approach that combines thermal activation and oxygen plasma to synthesize diverse mesoporous metal oxides (V2O5, V6O13, TiO2, Nb2O5, WO3, and MoO3) at low temperatures (150&#8211;200&#160;&#176;C), which can be applicable to a flexible polymeric substrate is introduced. As a demonstration, a flexible micro&#8208;supercapacitor is fabricated by directly synthesizing mesoporous V2O5 on an indium&#8208;tin oxide&#8208;coated colorless polyimide film. The energy storage performance is well maintained under severe bending conditions.

         <title>Current&#8208;Controllable and Reversible Multi&#8208;Resistance&#8208;State Based on Domain Wall Number Transition in 2D Ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multi&#8208;output state of the resistance is acquired by a pure current strategy based on the manipulation of domain wall number by pulse current under zero magnetic field in the 2D ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2. The multi&#8208;output properties can be utilized in the pattern recognition in the neuron computing trained by National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.








Abstract
Controlling the multi&#8208;state switching is significantly essential for the extensive utilization of 2D ferromagnet in magnetic racetrack memories, topological devices, and neuromorphic computing devices. The development of all&#8208;electric functional nanodevices with multi&#8208;state switching and a rapid reset remains challenging. Herein, to imitate the potentiation and depression process of biological synapses, a full&#8208;current strategy is unprecedently established by the controllable resistance&#8208;state switching originating from the spin configuration rearrangement by domain wall number modulation in Fe3GeTe2. In particular, a strong correlation is uncovered in the reduction of domain wall number with the corresponding resistance decreasing by in&#8208;situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Interestingly, the magnetic state is reversed instantly to the multi&#8208;domain wall state under a single pulse current with a higher amplitude, attributed to the rapid thermal demagnetization by simulation. Based on the neuromorphic computing system with full&#8208;current&#8208;driven artificial Fe3GeTe2 synapses with multi&#8208;state switching, a high accuracy of &#8776;91% is achieved in the handwriting image recognition pattern. The results identify 2D ferromagnet as an intriguing candidate for future advanced neuromorphic spintronics.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Chiral Hole Transport Enantiomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of hole transport enantiomers are applied in fabrication of circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes first time with achiral luminescent materials as emitters, where the chiral hole transport enantiomers act as the organic circularly polarizers in principle. All devices exhibit symmetric circularly polarized electroluminescent spectra with dissymmetry factors ranging from 8.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4 to 3.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3.








Abstract
The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) demonstrate promising application in 3D display due to the direct generation of circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL). But the chiral luminescence materials face challenges as intricated synthetic route, enantiomeric separation, etc. Herein, fresh CP&#8208;OLEDs are designed based on chiral hole transport material instead of chiral emitters. A pair of hole transport enantiomers (R/S&#8208;NPACZ) exhibit intense dissymmetry factors (|gPL|) about 5.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3. With R/S&#8208;NPACZ as hole transport layers, CP&#8208;OLEDs are fabricated employing six achiral phosphorescence and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials with different wavelengths, in consistence with the generated CPEL spectra. The CP&#8208;OLEDs based on achiral red, green, and blue iridium(III) complexes exhibit external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 14.9%, 30.7%, and 14.1% with |gEL| factors of 8.8 &#215; 10&#8722;4, 2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. Moreover, the devices using achiral blue, blueish&#8208;green, and green TADF materials display EQEs of 24.1%, 17.9%, and 25.4% with |gEL| factors of 1.0 &#215; 10&#8722;3, 3.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3, and 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. As far as known, it is the first example of CP&#8208;OLEDs based on chiral hole transport materials, which act as the organic circularly polarizers and have potential to generate CPEL from achiral luminescence materials.

         <title>The Unique Fe3Mo3N Structure Bestowed Efficient Fenton&#8208;Like Performance of the Iron&#8208;Based Catalysts: The Double Enhancement of Radicals and Nonradicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of the unique Fe3Mo3N structure not only ensures efficient Fe cycle in Fenton&#8208;like process, but also promotes the production of various reactive species, especially nonradical pathways (such as electron transport process and Fe(IV)). The system has made remarkable progress in catalytic activity, multireaction mechanism system, adaptability, and catalytic sustainability.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based catalysts are widely used in Fenton&#8208;like water pollution control technology due to their high efficiency, but their practical applications are limited by complex preparation conditions and strong blockage of Fe2+/Fe3+ cycle during the reaction. Here, a new iron&#8211;molybdenum bimetallic carbon&#8208;based catalyst is designed and synthesized using cellulose hydrogel for adsorption of Fe and Mo bimetals as a template, and the effective iron cycle in water treatment is realized. The integrated materials (Fe2.5Mo@CNs) with &#8220;catalytic/cocatalytic&#8221; performance have higher Fenton&#8208;like activation properties and universality than the equivalent quantity iron&#8211;carbon&#8208;based composite catalysts (Fe@CNs). Through the different characterization methods, experimental verifications and theoretical calculations show that the unique Fe3Mo3N structure promotes the adsorption of persulfate and reduces the energy barrier of the reaction, further completing the double enhancement of radicals (such as SO4&#183;&#8722;) and nonradicals (1O2 and electron transport process). The integrated &#8220;catalytic/cocatalytic&#8221; combined material is expected to provide a new promotion strategy for Fenton&#8208;like water pollution control.

         <title>Orderly Arranged Dipoles Regulate Anion&#8208;Derived Solid&#8211;Electrolyte Interphase for Stable Lithium Metal Chemistry</title>

After thermal reduction, BaTiO3 with surface oxygen vacancies (BTOV) exhibits stimulative adsorption and polarization for TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; due to enhanced dipoles. With the BTOV on the polypropylene separator, a locally anion&#8208;rich and Li+&#8208;rich region is formed at the electrolyte&#8211;anode interface, which will promote the transport of Li+. Moreover, polarized anions are reduced promotively to form an expected SEI film.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries are considered the most promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical energy storage devices of the next generation. However, the unstable solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) derived from electrolytes usually leads to high impedance, Li dendrites growth, and poor cyclability. Herein, the ferroelectric BaTiO3 with orderly arranged dipoles (BTOV) is integrated into the polypropylene separator as a functional layer. Detailed characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that surface oxygen vacancies drive the phase transition of BaTiO3 materials and promote the ordered arrangement of dipoles. The strong dipole moments in BTOV can adsorb TFSI&#8722; and NO3&#8722; anions selectively and promote their preferential reduction to form a SEI film enriched with inorganic LiF and LiNxOy species, thus facilitating the rapid transfer of Li+ and restraining the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, the Li&#8211;Li cell with the BTOV functional layer exhibits enhanced Li plating/stripping cycling with an ultra&#8208;long life of over 7000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/1.0&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The LiFePO4 || Li (50&#160;&#181;m) full cells display excellent cycling performance exceeding 1760 cycles and superior rate performance. This work provides a new perspective for regulating SEI chemistry by introducing ordered dipoles to control the distribution and reaction of anions.

         <title>3D Noble&#8208;Metal Nanostructures Approaching Atomic Efficiency and Atomic Density Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D amorphous noble metal&#8208;based oxides with simultaneous enhancement on atomic efficiency and density are synthesized by the assistance of atomic channels, where the atomic utilization increases from 18.2% to 59.4%. The mass activity and turnover frequency value of OER for Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than CuO/IrO2&#8208;C and Cu2IrOx&#8208;A. 








Abstract
Noble metals have been widely used in catalysis, however, the scarcity and high cost of noble metal motivate researchers to balance the atomic efficiency and atomic density, which is formidably challenging. This article proposes a robust strategy for fabricating 3D amorphous noble metal&#8208;based oxides with simultaneous enhancement on atomic efficiency and density with the assistance of atomic channels, where the atomic utilization increases from 18.2% to 59.4%. The unique properties of amorphous bimetallic oxides and formation of atomic channels have been evidenced by detailed experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations. Moreover, the universality of the current strategy is validated by other binary oxides. When Cu2IrOx with atomic channels (Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE) is used as catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the mass activity and turnover frequency value of Cu2IrOx&#8208;AE are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than CuO/IrO2 and Cu2IrOx without atomic channels, largely outperforming the reported OER catalysts. Theoretical calculations reveal that the formation of atomic channels leads to various Ir sites, on which the proton of adsorbed *OH can transfer to adjacent O atoms of [IrO6]. This work may attract immediate interest of researchers in material science, chemistry, catalysis, and beyond.

         <title>Steering CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products via Enhancing Localized *CO Coverage and Local Pressure in Conical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful construction of open and deep conical cavities (OD&#8208;CCs) imparts structural confinement to the catalysts, enabling concentrated carbon intermediates and facilitating smooth efflux of products along the curved sides. The nanosheet&#8208;stacked Cu2O sphere (NS&#8208;Cu2O) achieves an enhanced selectivity toward C2+ products with a maximum C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 81.7% at a partial current density of 286 mA cm&#8211;2.








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) involves a multistep proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process that generates a variety of intermediates, making it challenging to transform them into target products with high activity and selectivity. Here, a catalyst featuring a nanosheet&#8208;stacked sphere structure with numerous open and deep conical cavities (OD&#8208;CCs) is reported. Under the guidance of the finite&#8208;element method (FEM) simulations and theoretical analysis, it is shown that exerting control over the confinement space results in diffusion limitation of the carbon intermediates, thereby increasing local pressure and subsequently enhancing localized *CO coverage for dimerization. The nanocavities exhibit a structure&#8208;driven shift in selectivity of multicarbon (C2+) product from 41.8% to 81.7% during the CO2RR process.

An inverse&#8208;opal&#8208;structured cobalt sulfide@nitrogen&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon (Co9S8@NC) is developed as a catalytic host of the iodine electrode, specifically targeting improved reaction kinetics for the two&#8208;electron transfer cascade reaction. The inherent charge&#8208;deficient nature of Co9S8@NC effectively lowers the activation energy required for the conversion reaction and enhances the physicochemical adsorption of active iodine species, leading to superior electrochemical performance even at sub&#8208;zero temperatures.








Abstract
The iodine (I) electrode involving two&#8208;electron transfer chemistry by converting between I+ and I&#8722;, has the potential to deliver theoretically doubled capacity and higher working voltage platforms, thus achieving higher energy density. However, owing to the slow kinetics of the cascade two&#8208;electron transfer reactions, the system suffers from large overpotentials and low power density, especially at high working currents and low temperatures. Here, an inverse&#8208;opal&#8208;structured cobalt sulfide@nitrogen&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon (Co9S8@NC) catalyst with unique charge&#8208;deficient states is developed to promote the reaction kinetics of the I&#8722;/I+ electrode. The charge&#8208;deficient Co9S8@NC catalyst not only enables strong physicochemical adsorption with the iodine species but also significantly reduces the activation energy and interfacial charge transfer resistance of the cascade I+/I0/I&#8722; conversion reaction. Consequently, the prototypical Zn&#8214;I+/I0/I&#8722; battery equipped with the Co9S8@NC catalyst can deliver a high energy density of 554 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a stable cycle life of 5000 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, at a subzero temperature of &#8722;30 &#176;C, the battery can exhibit enhanced kinetics and a high power density of 1514 W kg&#8722;1, high energy density of 485 Wh kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Anchoring Charge Selective Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers for Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAMs) in perovskite solar cells has made the performance of p&#8211;i&#8211;n structure devices develop rapidly, while the relationship of function group, anchor groups, and spacers often is neglected. It is found that anchoring groups and spacers can affect the coordination between SAMs and perovskite. This work demonstrates different components of perovskites are selective to SAMs.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have displayed great potential for improving efficiency and stability in p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The anchoring of SAMs at the conductiv metal oxide substrates and their interaction with perovskite materials must be rationally tailored to ensure efficient charge carrier extraction and improved quality of the perovskite films. Herein, SAMs molecules with different anchoring groups and spacers to control the interaction with perovskite in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n mixed Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs are selected. It is found that the monolayer with the carboxylate group exhibits appropriate interaction and has a more favorable orientation and arrangement than that of the phosphate group. This results in reduced nonradiative recombination and enhanced crystallinity. In addition, the short chain length leads to an improved energy level alignment of SAMs with perovskite, improving hole extraction. As a result, the narrow bandgap (&#8776;1.25&#160;eV) Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs show efficiencies of up to 23.1% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of up to 0.89&#160;V. Unencapsulated devices retain 93% of their initial efficiency after storage in N2 atmosphere for over 2500 h. Overall, this work highlights the underexplored potential of SAMs for perovskite photovoltaics and provides essential findings on the influence of their structural modification.

         <title>Wearable Sensors for Breath Monitoring Based on Water&#8208;Based Hexagonal Boron Nitride Inks Made with Supramolecular Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable sensor able to monitor in real time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals, associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, is demonstrated. The device is based on hexagonal boron nitride inks made by non&#8208;covalent functionalization with pyrene derivatives, enabling to strongly enhance the sensitivity to water molecules, and device stability.








Abstract
Wearable humidity sensors are attracting strong attention as they allow for real&#8208;time and continuous monitoring of important physiological information by enabling activity tracking as well as air quality assessment. Amongst 2Dimensional (2D) materials, graphene oxide (GO) is very attractive for humidity sensing due to its tuneable surface chemistry, high surface area, processability in water, and easy integration onto flexible substrates. However, strong hysteresis, low sensitivity, and cross&#8208;sensitivity issues limit the use of GO in practical applications, where continuous monitoring is preferred. Herein, a wearable and wireless impedance&#8208;based humidity sensor made with pyrene&#8208;functionalized hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheets is demonstrated. The device shows enhanced sensitivity towards relative humidity (RH) (&gt;1010 Ohms/%RH in the range from 5% to 100% RH), fast response (0.1&#160;ms), no appreciable hysteresis, and no cross&#8208;sensitivity with temperature&#160;in the range of 25&#8211;60 &#176;C. The h&#8208;BN&#8208;based sensor is able to monitor the whole breathing cycle process of exhaling and inhaling, hence enabling to record in real&#8208;time the subtlest changes of respiratory signals associated with different daily activities as well as various symptoms of flu, without requiring any direct contact with the individual.

         <title>Mechanical Stimulation of Anti&#8208;Inflammatory and Antioxidant Hydrogels for Rapid Re&#8208;Epithelialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel with natural anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant properties is reported. The hydrogel possesses outstanding mechanical properties and can be further enhanced by water. In a long urethral injury model in vivo, and the hydrogels achieve effective functional replacement and ultimately accurate remodeling of the epithelium combining mechanical stimulation and immunoregulation.








Abstract
The epithelium, an essential barrier to protect organisms against infection, exists in many organs. However, rapid re&#8208;epithelialization to restore tissue integrity and function in an adverse environment is challenging. In this work, a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;inflammatory and antioxidant hydrogel with mechanical stimulation for rapid re&#8208;epithelialization, mainly composed of the small molecule thioctic acid, biocompatible glycine, and &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanoparticles is reported. Glycine&#8208;modified supramolecular thioctic acid is stable and possesses outstanding mechanical properties. The incorporating &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 providing the potential contrast function for magnetic resonance imaging observation, can propel hydrogel reconfiguration to enhance the mechanical properties of the hydrogel underwater due to water&#8208;initiated release of Fe3+. In vitro experiments show that the hydrogels effectively reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species, guided macrophages toward M2 polarization, and alleviated inflammation. The effect of rapid re&#8208;epithelialization is ultimately demonstrated in a long urethral injury model in vivo, and the mechanical stimulation of hydrogels achieves effective functional replacement and ultimately accurate remodeling of the epithelium. Notably, the proposed strategy provides an advanced alternative treatment for patients in need of large&#8208;area epithelial reconstruction.

         <title>Amorphous MnO2 Lamellae Encapsulated Covalent Triazine Polymer&#8208;Derived Multi&#8208;Heteroatoms&#8208;Doped Carbon for ORR/OER Bifunctional Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous MnO2 lamellae encapsulated N, S, P co&#8208;doped carbon sphere (A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC) is fabricated through a self&#8208;doping process coupled with in situ encapsulating strategy. Due to the predesigned amorphous MnO2 surface defects and the abundance of multi&#8208;heteroatom catalytic active sites, the as&#8208;developed A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC can readily work as an oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction dual&#8208;functional electrocatalyst for both liquid and solid rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery.








Abstract
The intelligent construction of non&#8208;noble metal materials that exhibit reversible oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with bifunctional electrocatalytic performance is greatly coveted in the realm of zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a crafted structure&#8208;amorphous MnO2 lamellae encapsulated covalent triazine polymer&#8208;derived N, S, P co&#8208;doped carbon sphere (A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC) is designed using a self&#8208;doped pyrolysis coupled with an in situ encapsulation strategy. The customized A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC&#8208;2 demonstrates a superior bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, confirmed by a small &#916;E index of 0.64&#160;V for ORR/OER. Experimental investigations, along with density functional theory calculations validate that predesigned amorphous MnO2 surface defects and abundant heteroatom catalytic active sites collectively enhance the oxygen electrocatalytic performance. Impressively, the A&#8208;MnO2/NSPC&#8208;based rechargeable liquid ZABs show a large open&#8208;circuit potential of 1.54&#160;V, an ultrahigh peak power density of 181&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, an enormous capacity of 816 mAh g&#8722;1, and a remarkable stability for more than 1720 discharging/charging cycles. Additionally, the assembled flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZABs also demonstrate outstanding cycle stability, surpassing 140 discharging/charging cycles. Therefore, this highly operable synthetic strategy offers substantial understanding in the development of magnificent bifunctional electrocatalysts for various sustainable energy conversions and beyond.

         <title>Multiple Cations Nanoconfinement in Ultrathin V2O5 Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Ion Diffusion Kinetics Toward High&#8208;performance Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general, supramolecular&#160;self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to intercalate unitary cation including NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Al3+ and multiple cations (NH4+ + Na+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+ + Mg2+) in ultrathin V2O5 nanosheets. The success on multiple cations nanoconfinement enables very fast zinc ion diffusion kinetics and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability. The optimized diffusion coefficient of zinc ion (7.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1) in this assembly series surpasses most of the V&#8208;based cathodes reported up to date.








Abstract
Nanoconfinement of cations in layered oxide cathode is an important approach to realize advanced zinc ion storage performance. However, thus far, the conventional hydrothermal/solvothermal route for this nanoconfinement has been restricted to its uncontrollable phase structure and the difficulty on the multiple cation co&#8208;confinement simultaneously. Herein, this work reports a general, supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of ultrathin V2O5 nanosheets using various unitary cations including Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Zn2+, Al3+, NH4+, and multiple cations (NH4+ + Na+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+, NH4+ + Na+ + Ca2+ +Mg2+). The unitary cation confinement results in a remarkable increase in the specific capacity and Zn&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics, and the multiple cation confinement gives rise to superior structural and cycling stability by multiple cation synergetic pillaring effect. The optimized diffusion coefficient of Zn&#8208;ion (7.5 &#215; 10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1) in this assembly series surpasses most of the V&#8208;based cathodes reported up to date. The work develops a novel multiple&#8208;cations nanoconfinement strategy toward high&#8208;performance cathode for aqueous battery. It also provides new insights into the guest cation regulation of zinc&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics through a general, supramolecular assembly pathway.

         <title>Microencapsulated Perovskite Crystals via In Situ Permeation Growth from Polymer Microencapsulation&#8208;Expansion&#8208;Contraction Strategy: Advancing a Record Long&#8208;Term Stability beyond 10&#160;000 h for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Microencapsulation of PbI2 and perovskite crystals with the in situ polymerized poly(4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) (poly(4&#8208;AcM)): this novel strategy modulates the PbI2&#8208;ammonium salt reaction through poly(4&#8208;AcM) microencapsulation&#8208;expansion&#8208;contraction behavior. The resultant decelerated crystallization rate fosters high&#8208;quality perovskite film formation, achieving a notable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 24.04%. Remarkably, after 13 008 h in dry storage, the PCE impressively retains 91% of its initial efficiency.








Abstract
Organic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) bearing both high efficiency and durability are predominantly challenged by inadequate crystallinity of perovskite. Herein, a polymer microencapsulation&#8208;expansion&#8208;contraction strategy is proposed for the first time to optimize the crystallization behavior of perovskite, typically by adeptly harnessing the swelling and deswelling characteristics of poly(4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine) (poly(4&#8208;AcM)) network on PbI2 surface. It can effectively retard the crystallization rate of perovskite, permitting meliorative crystallinity featured by increased grain size from 0.74 to 1.32&#160;&#181;m and reduced trap density from 1.12 &#215; 1016 to 2.56 &#215; 1015 cm&#8722;3. Moreover, profiting from the protection of poly(4&#8208;AcM) microencapsulation layer, the degradation of the perovskite is markedly suppressed. Resultant PSCs gain a robust power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.04%. Typically, they maintain 91% of their initial PCE for 13&#160;008 h in a desiccated ambient environment and retain 92% PCE after storage for 4000 h with a relative humidity of 50 &#177; 10%, which is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art long&#8208;term stability among the reported contributions.

         <title>Piezoionic Elastomers by Phase and Interface Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Energy&#8208;Harvesting Ionotronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study presents phase and interface engineering to design piezoionic elastomers with integrated microphase&#8208;separated structures and an intermediate phase. It addresses the significant challenges associated with harmonizing the structural requirements for voltage generation, current conduction, and mechanical adaptability in piezoionic and piezoelectric materials, which are crucial for energy&#8208;harvesting ionotronics and human&#8211;machine interaction.








Abstract
Piezoionic materials play a pivotal role in energy&#8208;harvesting ionotronics. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing the structural requirements for voltage generation, current conduction, and mechanical adaptability. The conventional approach of employing crystalline heterostructures for stress concentration and localized charge separation, while effective for voltage generation, often compromises the stretchability and long&#8208;range charge transport found in homogeneous quasisolid states. Herein, phase and interface engineering strategy is introduced to address this dilemma and a piezoionic elastomer is presented that seamlessly integrates ionic liquids and ionic plastic crystals, forming a finely tuned microphase&#8208;separated structure with an intermediate phase. This approach promotes charge separation via stress concentration among hard phases while leveraging the high ionic charge mobility in soft and intermediate phases. Impressively, the elastomer achieves an extraordinary piezoionic coefficient of about 6.0&#160;mV kPa&#8722;1, a more than threefold improvement over current hydrogels and ionogels. The resulting power density of 1.3 &#181;W cm&#8722;3 sets a new benchmark, exceeding that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezoionic gels. Notably, this elastomer combines outstanding stretchability, remarkable toughness, and rapid self&#8208;healing capability, underscoring its potential for real&#8208;world applications. This work may represent a stride toward mechanically robust energy harvesting systems and provide insights into ionotronic systems for human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Tunable Hydrogel Electronics for Diagnosis of Peripheral Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) are developed to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel realizes rapid, wide&#8208;range adhesion regulation, and enhanced mechanical performance. In clinical applications, the PDEH&#8208;SLM (silver&#8208;liquid metal) devices can establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal while achieving precise diagnoses of nerve injuries.








Abstract
Peripheral neuropathy characterized by rapidly increasing numbers of patients is commonly diagnosed via analyzing electromyography signals obtained from stimulation&#8208;recording devices. However, existing commercial electrodes have difficulty in implementing conformal contact with skin and gentle detachment, dramatically impairing stimulation/recording performances. Here, this work develops on&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel (PDEH) as stimulation/recording devices to capture electromyography signals for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel achieves rapid and wide&#8208;range regulation of adhesion and substantially strengthened mechanical performances. Moreover, hydrogel patches assembled with a silver&#8208;liquid metal (SLM) layer exhibit superior charge injection and low contact impedance, capable of capturing high&#8208;fidelity electromyography. This work further verifies the feasibility of hydrogel devices for accurate diagnoses of peripheral neuropathy in sensory, motor, and mixed nerves. For various body parts, such as fingers, the elderly's loose skin, hairy skin, and children's fragile skin, this work regulates the adhesion of PDEH&#8208;SLM devices to establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal. Noticeably, hydrogel patches achieve precise diagnoses of nerve injuries in these clinical cases while providing extra advantages of more effective stimulation/recording performances. These patches offer a promising alternative for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of neuropathy in future.

For various body parts, such as fingers, the elderly's loose skin, hairy skin, and children's fragile skin, this work regulates the adhesion of PDEH-SLM devices to establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal. Noticeably, hydrogel patches achieve precise diagnoses of nerve injuries in these clinical cases while providing extra advantages of more effective stimulation/recording performances. These patches offer a promising alternative for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of neuropathy in future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Control of Charge&#8208;Spin Interconversion in van der Waals Heterostructures with Chiral Charge Density Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented tunable charge&#8208;spin interconversion (CSI) is observed in graphene/1T&#8208;TaS2 van der Waals heterostructures by manipulating the charge density wave (CDW) phases in 1T&#8208;TaS2. The output of one of the CSI components switches off with the commensurability of the CDW phases. First&#8208;principles calculations support that chiral CDW multidomains in the heterostructure are at the origin of the switching of CSI.








Abstract
A charge density wave (CDW) represents an exotic state in which electrons are arranged in a long&#8208;range ordered pattern in low&#8208;dimensional materials. Although the understanding of the fundamental character of CDW is enriched after extensive studies, its practical application remains limited. Here, an unprecedented demonstration of a tunable charge&#8208;spin interconversion (CSI) in graphene/1T&#8208;TaS2 van der Waals heterostructures is shown by manipulating the distinct CDW phases in 1T&#8208;TaS2. Whereas CSI from spins polarized in all three directions is observed in the heterostructure when the CDW phase does not show commensurability, the output of one of the components disappears, and the other two are enhanced when the CDW phase becomes commensurate. The experimental observation is supported by first&#8208;principles calculations, which evidence that chiral CDW multidomains in the heterostructure are at the origin of the switching of CSI. The results uncover a new approach for on&#8208;demand CSI in low&#8208;dimensional systems, paving the way for advanced spin&#8208;orbitronic devices.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Carrier Cooling Regulation for Mixed Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tin(II) oxalate as a substitute for tin(II) fluoride is used to regulate the hot carrier cooling kinetics, increase the carrier diffusion length, and prolong the carrier lifetime. Based on this strategy, the champion efficiencies of mixed Sn&#8208;Pb and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells are 23.36% and 27.56%, accompanied by significantly improved long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
The rapid relaxation of hot carriers leads to energy loss in the form of heat and consequently restricts the theoretical efficiency of single&#8208;junction solar cells; However, this issue has not received much attention in tin&#8208;lead perovskites solar cells. Herein, tin(II) oxalate (SnC2O4) is introduced into tin&#8208;lead perovskite precursor solution to regulate hot&#8208;carrier cooling dynamics. The addition of SnC2O4 increases the length of carrier diffusion, extends the lifetime of carriers, and simultaneously slows down the cooling rate of carriers. Furthermore, SnC2O4 can bond with uncoordinated Sn2+ and Pb2+ ions to regulate the crystallization of perovskite and enable large grains. The strongly reducing properties of the C2O42&#8722; can inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ and minimize the formation of Sn vacancies in the resulting perovskite films. Additionally, as a substitute for tin(II) fluoride, the introduction of SnC2O4 avoids the carrier transport issues caused by the aggregation of F&#8211; ions at the interface. As a result, the SnC2O4&#8208;treated Sn&#8208;Pb cells show a champion efficiency of 23.36%, as well as 27.56% for the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Moreover, the SnC2O4&#8208;treated devices show excellent long&#8208;term stability. This finding is expected to pave the way toward stable and highly efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.

         <title>Impact of Electrostatic Interaction on Vertical Morphology and Energy Loss in Efficient Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A relationship between the molecular structure and the vertical phase separation (VPS) morphology of PPHJ OSCs by using molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a bridge is first established. A ternary PPHJ device with an appropriate &#8710;ESP is elaborately constructed to achieve better VPS morphology and lower &#916;E3, resulting in impressive efficiency of 19.09%.








Abstract
Although a suitable vertical phase separation (VPS) morphology is essential for improving charge transport efficiency, reducing charge recombination, and ultimately boosting the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs), there is a lack of theoretical guidance on how to achieve the ideal morphology. Herein, a relationship between the molecular structure and the VPS morphology of pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) OSCs is established by using molecular surface electrostatic potential (ESP) as a bridge. The morphological evolution mechanism is revealed by studying four binary systems with vary electrostatic potential difference (&#8710;ESP) between donors (Ds) and acceptors (As). The findings manifest that as &#8710;ESP increases, the active layer is more likely to form a well&#8208;mixed phase, while a smaller &#8710;ESP favors VPS morphology. Interestingly, it is also observed that a larger &#8710;ESP leads to enhanced miscibility between Ds and As, resulting in higher non&#8208;radiative energy losses (&#916;E3). Based on these discoveries, a ternary PPHJ device is meticulously designed with an appropriate &#8710;ESP to obtain better VPS morphology and lower &#916;E3, and an impressive efficiency of 19.09% is achieved. This work demonstrates that by optimizing the &#916;ESP, not only the formation of VPS morphology can be controlled, but also energy losses can be reduced, paving the way to further boost OSC performance.

CD93&#8208;Targeted Microbubbles
In article number 2310421, Qiuyang Li, Lijun Yuan, and co&#8208;workers develop a novel ultrasound contrast microbubble for evaluation of immune status through molecular imaging of endothelial CD93 expression. High levels of CD93 in tumor vasculature correlate well with immune cell infiltration deficiency, and ultrasound imaging of CD93 with MMRN2&#8208;modified microbubbles holds as a promising strategy to assess the anti&#8208;tumor immune response.

Mesoporous Metal Oxides
In article number 2311809 by Hong Chul Moon, Taesung Kim, Jin Kon Kim, and co&#8208;workers, a new synthetic approach for mesoporous metal oxides by exploiting synergistic effect of thermal activation and plasma is introduced. This synthetic method can be universally applied to various mesoporous metal oxides and can even be directly applied to the synthesis on a plastic substrate. This approach is expected to pave the way for a wide range of flexible electronics.

On&#8208;Skin Electronics
In article number 2308831, Hao Wu, Yutian Liu, and co&#8208;workers develop on&#8208;skin patches with polyaspartic acid&#8208;modified dopamine/ethyl&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel to capture electromyography signals. Triggered by a one&#8208;step electric field treatment, the hydrogel realizes rapid, wide&#8208;range adhesion regulation and enhanced mechanical performance. Hydrogel devices can establish intimate device/skin interfaces or ensure benign removal while achieving precise diagnoses of nerve injuries.

Microrobots
In article number 2310084, Salvador Pan&#233;, Minsoo Kim, Hao Ye, and co&#8208;workers introduce microrobotic superstructures comprising a magnetic gelatin composite chassis threaded with iron helical micromachines. Magnetic inputs can be used to navigate the superstructure (gradients) and also dissolve the chassis through magnetic hyperthermia, thereby releasing the micromachines to navigate through narrow channels. The capability of these micromachines to disassemble on&#8208;command to access narrower conduits enhances the microrobots' multifunctionality.

         <title>Advancing Intelligent Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip Systems with Comprehensive In Situ Bioanalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices have been extensively developed as potentially transformative in vitro models to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of human organs. The latest developments toward intelligent organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems where sensing, data processing, and modulating units are integrated and coordinated to fine&#8208;tune the in vitro models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications are reviewed.








Abstract
In vitro models are essential to a broad range of biomedical research, such as pathological studies,&#160;drug development, and personalized medicine. As a potentially transformative paradigm for 3D in vitro models, organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (OOC) technology has been extensively developed to recapitulate sophisticated architectures and dynamic microenvironments of human organs by applying the principles of life sciences and leveraging micro&#8208; and nanoscale engineering capabilities. A pivotal function of OOC devices is to support multifaceted and timely characterization&#160;of cultured cells&#160;and their microenvironments. However, in&#8208;depth analysis of OOC models&#160;typically requires biomedical assay procedures that are labor&#8208;intensive and interruptive. Herein,&#160;the latest advances toward intelligent OOC (iOOC) systems, where sensors integrated with OOC devices continuously report cellular and microenvironmental information for comprehensive in situ bioanalysis, are examined. It is proposed that the multimodal data in iOOC systems can support closed&#8208;loop control of the in vitro&#160;models and offer holistic biomedical insights for diverse applications. Essential techniques for establishing iOOC systems are surveyed, encompassing in situ sensing, data processing, and dynamic modulation. Eventually, the future development of iOOC systems featuring cross&#8208;disciplinary strategies is discussed.

         <title>Towards Negative Emissions: Hydrothermal Carbonization of Biomass for Sustainable Carbon Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon materials from hydrothermal carbonization of biomass have great potential for carbon emission reduction. This review covers the fundamental properties of biomass and the hydrothermal environment, the intrinsic mechanisms and regulation methods of biomass hydrothermal carbonization, the wide range of applications of derived carbon materials, and the sustainability potential of carbon materials.








Abstract
The contemporary production of carbon materials heavily relies on fossil fuels, contributing significantly to the greenhouse effect. Biomass is a carbon&#8208;neutral resource whose organic carbon is formed from atmospheric CO2. Employing biomass as a precursor for synthetic carbon materials can fix atmospheric CO2 into solid materials, achieving negative carbon emissions. Hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) presents an attractive method for converting biomass into carbon materials, by which biomass can be transformed into materials with favorable properties in a distinct hydrothermal environment, and these carbon materials have made extensive progress in many fields. However, the HTC of biomass is a complex and interdisciplinary problem, involving simultaneously the physical properties of the underlying biomass and sub/supercritical water, the chemical mechanisms of hydrothermal synthesis, diverse applications of resulting carbon materials, and the sustainability of the entire technological routes. This review starts with the analysis of biomass composition and distinctive characteristics of the hydrothermal environment. Then, the factors influencing the HTC of biomass, the reaction mechanism, and the properties of resulting carbon materials are discussed in depth, especially the different formation mechanisms of primary and secondary hydrochars. Furthermore, the application and sustainability of biomass&#8208;derived carbon materials are summarized, and some insights into future directions are provided.

         <title>Mechanically Strengthened Aerogels through Multiscale, Multicompositional, and Multidimensional Approaches: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It has already been &#8776;90 years since the first development of aerogels, and many researchers have devoted tremendous efforts to enhance&#160;their mechanical properties, which is yet completely achieved. This review presents multiscale, multicompositional and multidimensional strategies, resulting from flexible synthesis techniques for 0D&#8211;1D, 0D&#8211;2D, 1D&#8211;2D, and 0D&#8211;1D&#8211;2D combined aerogels.








Abstract
In recent decades, aerogels have attracted tremendous&#160;attention&#160;in academia and industry as a class of lightweight and porous multifunctional nanomaterial. Despite their wide application range, the low mechanical&#160;durability hinders their processing and handling, particularly in applications requiring complex physical structures. &#8220;Mechanically strengthened aerogels&#8221; have emerged as a potential solution to address this drawback. Since the first report on aerogels in 1931, various modified synthesis processes have been introduced in the last few decades to enhance the aerogel mechanical strength, further advancing their multifunctional scope. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments of mechanically strengthened aerogels through multicompositional and multidimensional approaches. Furthermore, new trends and future directions for&#160;as&#160;prevailed commercialization of aerogels as plastic materials are discussed.

         <title>Revitalizing Ancient Mitochondria with Nano&#8208;Strategies: Mitochondria&#8208;Remedying Nanodrugs Concentrate on Disease Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondrial quality decrease, oxidative stress, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, and inflammation are the major features of multiple types of diseases of mitochondrial damage. Mitochodnria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs with different characteristics and remarkable brilliance are committed to ameliorating various diseases by rescuing mitochondria via repairing mitochondrial quality, protecting mitochondria from oxidative stress, inhibiting mPTP and inflammation response and mitochondrial bionics.








Abstract
Mitochondria, widely known as the energy factories of eukaryotic cells, have a myriad of vital functions across diverse cellular processes. Dysfunctions within mitochondria serve as catalysts for various diseases, prompting widespread cellular demise. Mounting research on remedying damaged mitochondria indicates that mitochondria constitute a valuable target for therapeutic intervention against diseases. But the less clinical practice and lower recovery rate imply the limitation of traditional drugs, which need a further breakthrough. Nanotechnology has approached favorable regiospecific biodistribution and high efficacy by capitalizing on excellent nanomaterials and targeting drug delivery. Mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs have achieved ideal therapeutic effects. This review elucidates the significance of mitochondria in various cells and organs, while also compiling mortality data for related diseases. Correspondingly, nanodrug&#8208;mediate therapeutic strategies and applicable mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs in disease are detailed, with a full understanding of the roles of mitochondria dysfunction and the advantages of nanodrugs. In addition, the future challenges and directions are widely discussed. In conclusion, this review provides comprehensive insights into the design and development of mitochondria&#8208;remedying nanodrugs, aiming to help scientists who desire to extend their research fields and engage in this interdisciplinary subject.

         <title>A Holistic Review of C = C Crosslinkable Conjugated Molecules in Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Electronics: Insights into Stability, Processibility, and Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The C = C Cross&#8208;linking strategy is an effective tool to improve the chem&#8208;physic, optoelectronic, and soluton&#8208;processing capacities of organic conjugated molecules (OCMs) for optoelectronic applications. This review mainly describes the structural type, characterization method, and unique property of the C = C cross&#8208;linking OCMs system, and further summarizes their application in the field of organic optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable organic conjugated molecules (OCMs) consist of a series of aromatic units linked by &#963;&#8208;bonds, which present a relatively freedom intramolecular motion and intermolecular re&#8208;arrangement under external stimulation. The cross&#8208;linked strategy provides an effective platform to obtain OCMs network, which allows for outstanding optoelectronic, excellent physicochemical properties, and substantial improvement in device fabrication. An unsaturated double carbon&#8211;carbon bond (C = C) is universal segment to construct crosslinkable OCMs. In this review, the authors will set C = C cross&#8208;linkable units as an example to summarize the development of cross&#8208;linkable OCMs for solution&#8208;processable optoelectronic applications. First, this review provides a comprehensive overview of the distinctive chemical, physical, and optoelectronic properties arising from the cross&#8208;linking strategies employed in OCMs. Second, the methods for probing the C = C cross&#8208;linking reaction are also emphasized based on the perturbations of chemical structure and physicochemical property. Third, a series of model C = C cross&#8208;linkable units, including styrene, trifluoroethylene, and unsaturated acid ester, are further discussed to design and prepare novel OCMs. Furthermore, a concise overview of the optoelectronic applications associated with this approach is presented, including light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells (SCs), and field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). Lastly, the authors offer a concluding perspective and outlook for the improvement of OCMs and their optoelectronic application via the cross&#8208;linking strategy.

         <title>Interlayer Engineering of Layered Materials for Efficient Ion Separation and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational construction and microenvironment regulation of interlayer nanochannels are of vital importance for the realization of efficient ion separation and storage. This review systematically summarizes the interlayer engineering strategies of layered materials and discusses their effects on ion separation and storage, which provide guidance for designing high&#8208;performance separation membranes and battery electrodes.








Abstract
Layered materials are characterized by strong in&#8208;plane covalent chemical bonds within each atomic layer and weak out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions between adjacent layers. The non&#8208;bonding nature between neighboring layers naturally results in a vdW gap, which enables the insertion of guest species into the interlayer gap. Rational design and regulation of interlayer nanochannels are crucial for converting these layered materials and their 2D derivatives into ion separation membranes or battery electrodes. Herein, based on the latest progress in layered materials and their derivative nanosheets, various interlayer engineering methods are briefly introduced, along with the effects of intercalated species on the crystal structure and interlayer coupling of the host layered materials. Their applications in the ion separation and energy storage fields are then summarized, with a focus on interlayer engineering to improve selective ion transport and ion storage performance. Finally, future research opportunities and challenges in this emerging field are comprehensively discussed.

         <title>Versatile Nitrogen&#8208;Centered Organic Redox&#8208;Active Materials for Alkali Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active organic materials, including electrochemical performance and reaction mechanism, are discussed individually. The challenges, solutions, and perspectives are also proposed in this review.








Abstract
Versatile nitrogen&#8208;centered organic redox&#8208;active molecules have gained significant attention in alkali metal&#8208;ion batteries (AMIBs) due to their low cost, low toxicity, and ease of preparation. Specially, their multiple reaction categories (anion/cation insertion types of reaction) and higher operating voltage, when compared to traditional conjugated carbonyl materials, underscore their promising prospects. However, the high solubility of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox active materials in organic electrolyte and their low electronic conductivity contribute to inferior cycling performance, sluggish reaction kinetics, and limited rate capability. This review provides a detailed overview of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials, encompassing their redox chemistry, solutions to overcome shortcomings, characterization of charge storage mechanisms, and recent progress. Additionally, prospects and directions are proposed for future investigations. It is anticipated that this review will stimulate further exploration of underlying mechanisms and interface chemistry through in situ characterization techniques, thereby promoting the practical application of nitrogen&#8208;centered redox&#8208;active materials in AMIBs.

         <title>Enhancing Purely Organic Room Temperature Phosphorescence via Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of purely organic room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is presented. RTP can be achieved by small molecular self&#8208;assembly, cocrystal, the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic host and guest, and multi&#8208;stage supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. The constructions, RTP properties, and applications of supramolecular assembly systems are discussed in detail. This review lays the foundation for developing RTP supramolecular materials.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lived and highly efficient room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials are in high demand for practical applications in lighting and display, security signboards, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Achieving RTP in aqueous solutions, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence emission, and NIR&#8208;excited RTP are crucial for applications in bio&#8208;imaging, but these goals pose significant challenges. Supramolecular self&#8208;assembly provides an effective strategy to address the above problems. This review focuses on the recent advances in the enhancement of RTP via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, covering four key aspects: small molecular self&#8208;assembly, cocrystals, the self&#8208;assembly of macrocyclic hosts and guests, and multi&#8208;stage supramolecular self&#8208;assembly. This review not only highlights progress in these areas but also underscores the prominent challenges associated with developing supramolecular RTP materials. The resulting strategies for the development of high&#8208;performance supramolecular RTP materials are discussed, aiming to satisfy the practical applications of RTP materials in biomedical science.

This review explores recent advancements in enhancing the mechanical stability of F&#8208;PSCs, including soft perovskite optimization, crystal grain regulation, flexible electrodes, substrate selection, and other factors. Challenges and perspectives for F&#8208;PSCs are also discussed.








Abstract
The remarkable progress in perovskite solar cell (PSC) technology has witnessed a remarkable leap in efficiency within the past decade. As this technology continues to mature, flexible PSCs (F&#8208;PSCs) are emerging as pivotal components for a wide array of applications, spanning from powering portable electronics and wearable devices to integrating seamlessly into electronic textiles and large&#8208;scale industrial roofing. F&#8208;PSCs characterized by their lightweight, mechanical flexibility, and adaptability for cost&#8208;effective roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing, hold immense commercial potential. However, the persistent concerns regarding the overall stability and mechanical robustness of these devices loom large. This comprehensive review delves into recent strides made in enhancing the mechanical stability of F&#8208;PSCs. It covers a spectrum of crucial aspects, encompassing perovskite material optimization, precise crystal grain regulation, film quality enhancement, strategic interface engineering, innovational developed flexible transparent electrodes, judicious substrate selection, and the integration of various functional layers. By collating and analyzing these dedicated research endeavors, this review illuminates the current landscape of progress in addressing the challenges surrounding mechanical stability. Furthermore, it provides valuable insights into the persistent obstacles and bottlenecks that demand attention and innovative solutions in the field of F&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Expanding the Horizons of Machine Learning in Nanomaterials to Chiral Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 18, May 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review analyzes machine learning methods for studying achiral nanomaterials and offers guidance for adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. An overview of chiral nanomaterials in the context of synthesis&#8208;structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships is presented, offering insights on leveraging machine learning for these complex relationships. Key achievements, challenges, and outlook for machine learning in chiral nanomaterials research are discussed.








Abstract
Machine learning holds significant research potential in the field of nanotechnology, enabling nanomaterial structure and property predictions, facilitating materials design and discovery, and reducing the need for time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive experiments and simulations. In contrast to their achiral counterparts, the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials is still in its infancy, with a limited number of publications to date. This is despite the great potential of machine learning to advance the development of new sustainable chiral materials with high values of optical activity, circularly polarized luminescence, and enantioselectivity, as well as for the analysis of structural chirality by electron microscopy. In this review, an analysis of machine learning methods used for studying achiral nanomaterials is provided, subsequently offering guidance on adapting and extending this work to chiral nanomaterials. An overview of chiral nanomaterials within the framework of synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships is presented and insights on how to leverage machine learning for the study of these highly complex relationships are provided. Some key recent publications are reviewed and discussed on the application of machine learning for chiral nanomaterials. Finally, the review captures the key achievements, ongoing challenges, and the prospective outlook for this very important research field.

         <title>Efficient Large&#8208;Area (81 cm2) Ternary Copper Halides Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 13% via Host&#8208;Guest Strategy</title>

Abstract
Ternary copper (Cu) halides are promising candidates for replacing toxic lead halides in the field of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) toward practical applications. However, the electroluminescent performance of Cu halide&#8208;based LEDs remains a great challenge due to the presence of serious nonradiative recombination and inefficient charge transport in Cu halide emitters. Here, we report the rational design of host&#8208;guest [dppb]2Cu2I2 (dppb denotes 1,2&#8208;bis[diphenylphosphino]benzene) emitters and its utility in fabricating efficient Cu halide&#8208;based green LEDs that show a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.39%. The host&#8208;guest [dppb]2Cu2I2 emitters with mCP (1,3&#8208;Bis(N&#8208;carbazolyl)benzene) host demonstrate a significant improvement of carrier radiative recombination efficiency, with the photoluminescence quantum yield increased by nearly 10 times, which is rooted in the efficient energy transfer and type&#8208;I energy level alignment between [dppb]2Cu2I2 and mCP. Moreover, the charge&#8208;transporting mCP host can rise the carrier mobility of [dppb]2Cu2I2 films, thereby enhancing the charge transport and recombination. More importantly, this strategy enables a large&#8208;area prototype LED with a record&#8208;breaking area up to 81 cm2, along with a decent EQE of 10.02% and uniform luminance. We believe these results represent an encouraging stepping stone to bring Cu halide&#8208;based LEDs from the laboratory towards to commercial lighting and displays panels.

         <title>Enthalpy&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Healing in Thin Metallic Films on Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;healing microelectronics are needed for costly applications with limited or without access. They are needed in fields such as space exploration to increase lifetime and decrease both costs and the environmental impact. While advanced self&#8208;healing mechanisms for polymers are numerous, practical ways for self&#8208;healing in metal films have yet to be found. A concept for an autonomous intrinsic self&#8208;healing metallic film system was developed, allowing the healing of cracks in metallic films on flexible substrates. The concept relies on stabilizing metastable thin films with high mixing enthalpy via segregation barriers. This allows the films to possess autonomous intrinsic self&#8208;healing capabilities triggered by cracking at temperatures not detrimental to flexible microelectronics. The effect will be shown on metastable Mo1&#8208;xAgx thin films, stabilized via a Mo segregation barrier. Without a segregation barrier, the system is known to exhibit spontaneous Ag particle formation on the surface. This property was controlled and directed to heal cracks and partially restore the electro&#8208;mechanical properties of the multilayer system. This mechanism opens up the field of self&#8208;healing thin metallic films that could profoundly impact the design of future microelectronics.

         <title>Thermal Welding of Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep understanding of the assembly behavior of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) that are generated in situ at the oil&#8211;water interface through host&#8211;guest interactions is presented. Taking advantage of the temperature responsiveness of NPSs, thermal&#8208;controlled cargo release and welding of liquids can be achieved, opening a pathway to the construction of modular all&#8208;liquid fluidics.








Abstract
Welding of thermoplastics is a common practice in many industrial sectors, but it has yet to be realized with fluids. Here, the thermal welding of liquids by using the assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces is reported. By fine&#8208;tuning the dynamic interaction strength within NPSs, the interfacial activity of NPSs, as well as the binding energy of NPSs to the interface can be precisely controlled, leading to a dynamic exchange of NPSs, maximizing the reduction in the interfacial energy. With NPSs jammed at the interface, the structures of liquids can be manipulated to complex geometries by applying an external force and, due to the temperature responsiveness of NPSs, when bringing liquids into contact and heating the system, welding of liquids can be achieved. This work provides a straightforward strategy for the construction of modular all&#8208;liquid fluidics, opening up numerous opportunities in fields like biotechnology, healthcare, and materials science.

         <title>Symmetry Evolution Induced 2D Pt Single Atom Catalyst with High Density for Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uses salt&#8208;assisted methods to adjust the tetrahedral coordination in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks &#8208; 8 (ZIF&#8208;8) to planar tetragonal coordination without changing the ligand. In the carbonization process, to maintain the 2D morphology, the five&#8208;membered ring undergoes reconstruction to form a six&#8208;membered ring, introducing defects. These defects result in highly loaded Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with high hydrogen oxidation reaction activity after electrodeposition.








Abstract
The performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts is greatly influenced by the chemical environment surrounding the central atom. Here, a salt&#8208;assisted method is employed to transform the tetrahedral coordination structure of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks &#8208; 8 (ZIF&#8208;8)&#160;into a planar square coordination structure without altering the ligands. During the subsequent carbonization process, concurrent with the evaporation of zinc atoms, the structure of the nitrogen and carbon carriers (NC carriers) undergoes a transition from five&#8208;membered rings to six&#8208;membered rings to preserve the 2D structure. This transition results in the generation of additional defect sites on the 2D&#8208;NC substrates. Hence, the Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with planar square coordination symmetries can be precisely prepared via electrodeposition (denoted as 2D&#8208;Pt SAC). The Pt loading of 2D&#8208;Pt SAC is 0.49 &#177; 0.03 &#181;g cm&#8722;2, higher than that of 3D&#8208;Pt SAC (0.37 &#177; 0.04 &#181;g cm&#8722;2). In the context of the hydrogen oxidation reaction electrocatalysis, under an overpotential of 50 mV, these single&#8208;atom catalysts with 2D coordination exhibit mass activities of 2396 A gPt&#8722;1 (32 times higher than commercial Pt/C catalyst, 2 times higher than 3D&#8208;PtNC).

         <title>Precise Capture and Dynamic Release of Circulating Liver Cancer Cells with Dual&#8208;Histidine&#8208;Based Cell Imprinted Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the sialylated glycans present on circulating tumor cells&#8217; (CTCs) surface, an ultrastrong affinity ligand His&#8208;His is designed and integrated into a cell&#8208;imprinting copolymer based on polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate. Precise size matching, specific interactions, and satisfactory biocompatibility endow the material with excellent capabilities for precise capture of CTCs and intact release, significantly facilitating liver cancer early diagnosis and single&#8208;cell multiproteomics analysis.








Abstract
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection presents significant advantages in diagnosing liver cancer due to its noninvasiveness, real&#8208;time monitoring, and dynamic tracking. However, the clinical application of CTCs&#8208;based diagnosis is largely limited by the challenges of capturing low&#8208;abundance CTCs within a complex blood environment while ensuring them alive. Here, an ultrastrong ligand, l&#8208;histidine&#8211;l&#8208;histidine (HH), specifically targeting sialylated glycans on the surface of CTCs, is designed. Furthermore, HH is integrated into a cell&#8208;imprinted polymer, constructing a hydrogel with precise CTCs imprinting, high elasticity, satisfactory blood compatibility, and robust anti&#8208;interference capacities. These features endow the hydrogel with excellent capture efficiency (&gt;95%) for CTCs in peripheral blood, as well as the ability to release CTCs controllably and alive. Clinical tests substantiate the accurate differentiation between liver cancer, cirrhosis, and healthy groups using this method. The remarkable diagnostic accuracy (94%), lossless release of CTCs, material reversibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness ($6.68 per sample) make the HH&#8208;based hydrogel a potentially revolutionary technology for liver cancer diagnosis and single&#8208;cell analysis.

         <title>Boltzmann Switching MoS2 Metal&#8211;Semiconductor Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Enabled by Monolithic&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Gapped Metal Gates at the Schottky&#8211;Mott Limit</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, van der Waals Schottky&#8208;gated MoS2 metal&#8211;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors are developed, mitigating two primary sources of Fermi&#8208;level pinning&#8212;metal&#8208;induced gap states and disorder&#8208;induced gap states. Consequently, the devices exhibit ideal hysteresis&#8208;free transistor characteristics with a subthreshold swing of 60&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K, approaching to&#160;the fundamental Boltzmann switching limit.








Abstract
A gate stack that facilitates a high&#8208;quality interface and tight electrostatic control is crucial for realizing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, when constructing conventional metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor structures with two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide channels, achieving these requirements becomes challenging due to inherent difficulties in obtaining high&#8208;quality gate dielectrics through native oxidation or film deposition. Here, a gate&#8208;dielectric&#8208;less device architecture of van der Waals Schottky gated metal&#8211;semiconductor FETs (vdW&#8208;SG MESFETs) using a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) channel and surface&#8208;oxidized metal gates such as nickel and copper is reported. Benefiting from the strong SG coupling, these MESFETs operate at remarkably low gate voltages, &lt;0.5&#160;V. Notably, they also exhibit Boltzmann&#8208;limited switching behavior featured by a subthreshold swing of &#8776;60&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 and negligible hysteresis. These ideal FET characteristics are attributed to the formation of a Fermi&#8208;level (EF) pinning&#8208;free gate stack at the Schottky&#8211;Mott limit. Furthermore, authors experimentally and theoretically confirm that EF depinning can be achieved by suppressing both metal&#8208;induced and disorder&#8208;induced gap states at the interface between the monolithic&#8208;oxide&#8208;gapped metal gate and the MoS2 channel. This work paves a new route for designing high&#8208;performance and energy&#8208;efficient 2D electronics.

         <title>Intrahippocampal Supramolecular Assemblies Directed Bioorthogonal Liberation of Neurotransmitters to Suppress Seizures in Freely Moving Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imbalance between neuronal inhibition and excitation may lead to the onset of epilepsy. In this study, bioorthogonal decaging reactions and photolysis enable on&#8208;demand drug release to address the deficiency of an inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA) during seizure symptoms. Such a spatiotemporal&#8208;controlled drug delivery system is applicable for managing epileptic seizures with an unprovoked nature.








Abstract
The precise delivery of anti&#8208;seizure medications (ASM) to epileptic loci remains the major challenge to treat epilepsy without causing adverse drug reactions. The unprovoked nature of epileptic seizures raises the additional need to release ASMs in a spatiotemporal controlled manner. Targeting the oxidative stress in epileptic lesions, here the reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced in situ supramolecular assemblies that synergized bioorthogonal reactions to deliver inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA) on&#8208;demand, are developed. Tetrazine&#8208;bearing assembly precursors undergo oxidation and selectively self&#8208;assemble under pathological conditions inside primary neurons and mice brains. Assemblies induce local accumulation of tetrazine in the hippocampus CA3 region, which allows the subsequent bioorthogonal release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. For induced acute seizures, the sustained release of GABA extends the suppression than the direct supply of GABA. In the model of permanent damage of CA3, bioorthogonal ligation on assemblies provides a reservoir of GABA that behaves prompt release upon 365&#160;nm irradiation. Incorporated with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art microelectrode arrays, it is elucidated that the bioorthogonal release of GABA shifts the neuron spike waveforms to suppress seizures at the single&#8208;neuron precision. The strategy of in situ supramolecular assemblies&#8208;directed bioorthogonal prodrug activation shall be promising for the effective delivery of ASMs to treat epilepsy.

         <title>Advances in Cell&#8208;Rich Inks for Biofabricating Living Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biofabrication of biomimetic architectures leveraging on cell&#8208;rich living inks matching human tissue cellular densities can lead to unprecedented advances in generating architectures with life&#8208;like features and biofunctionalities, thus moving far beyond conventional biofabricated constructs where biomaterial&#8208;to&#8208;cell ratios remain nonphysiologic. This review showcases recent advances in the design of cell&#8208;rich inks and discusses key challenges toward translation to mainstream clinical applications.








Abstract
Advancing biofabrication toward manufacturing living constructs with well&#8208;defined architectures and increasingly biologically relevant cell densities is highly desired to mimic the biofunctionality of native human tissues.

&lt;p&gt;Biofabrication of biomimetic architectures leveraging on cell-rich living inks matching human tissue cellular densities can lead to unprecedented advances in generating architectures with life-like features and biofunctionalities, thus moving far beyond conventional biofabricated constructs where biomaterial-to-cell ratios remain nonphysiologic. This review showcases recent advances in the design of cell-rich inks and discusses key challenges toward translation to mainstream clinical applications.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advancing biofabrication toward manufacturing living constructs with well-defined architectures and increasingly biologically relevant cell densities is highly desired to mimic the biofunctionality of native human tissues. The formulation of tissue-like, cell-dense inks for biofabrication remains, however, challenging at various levels of the bioprinting process. Promising advances have been made toward this goal, achieving relatively high cell densities that surpass those found in conventional platforms, pushing the current boundaries closer to achieving tissue-like cell densities.

         <title>Harvesting Multicolor Photoluminescence in Nonaromatic Interpenetrated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanocrystals via Pressure&#8208;Modulated Carbonyls Aggregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonaromatic interpenetrated Zn4O(ADC)4(Et3N)6 IRMOF&#8208;0 nanocrystals (NCs)&#160;show a photoluminescence&#160;turn&#8208;on behavior via pressure&#8208;induced aggregation effect, where aggregation of carbonyls&#160;results in O&#9472;O distances smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04 &#197;). IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs exhibit an ultrabroad emission tunability, which mainly arises from the retention at varying degrees of through&#8208;space n&#8211;&#960;* interactions achieved by pressure&#8208;treated engineering.








Abstract
Interpenetrated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nonaromatic ligands provide a unique platform for adsorption, catalysis, and sensing applications. However, nonemission and the lack of optical property tailoring make it challenging to fabricate smart responsive devices with nonaromatic interpenetrated MOFs based on ligand&#8208;centered emission. In this paper, the pressure&#8208;induced aggregation effect is introduced in nonaromatic interpenetrated Zn4O(ADC)4(Et3N)6 (IRMOF&#8208;0) nanocrystals (NCs), where carbonyl groups aggregation results in O&#9472;O distances smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04 &#197;), triggering the photoluminescence turn&#8208;on behavior. It is noteworthy that the IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs display an ultrabroad emission tunability of 130&#160;nm from deep blue (440&#160;nm) to yellow (570&#160;nm) upon release to ambient conditions at different pressures. The eventual retention of through&#8208;space n&#8211;&#960;* interactions in different degrees via pressure treatment is primarily responsible for achieving a controllable multicolor emission behavior in initially nonemissive IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs. The fabricated multicolor phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the pressure&#8208;treated IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs exhibit excellent thermal, chromaticity, and fatigue stability. The proposed strategy not only imparts new vitality to nonaromatic interpenetrated MOFs but also offers new perspectives for advancements in the field of multicolor displays and daylight illumination.

         <title>Topological Quantum Switching Enabled Neuroelectronic Synaptic Modulators for Brain Computer Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work illustrating a developed synaptic neuroelectronic device using Bi2Se2Te quantum topological insulator marks a significant advancement in neuromorphic technology for rehabilitating neurological disorders through brain&#8211;computer interfaced neuroprosthetics. It demonstrates controlled brain synchronization and enhanced memory functions, offering a novel approach to mitigating the effects of aging and neurological disorders.








Abstract
Aging and genetic&#8208;related disorders in the human brain lead to impairment of daily cognitive functions. Due to their neural synaptic complexity and the current limits of knowledge, reversing these disorders remains a substantial challenge for brain&#8211;computer interfaces (BCI). In this work, a solution is provided to potentially override aging and neurological disorder&#8208;related cognitive function loss in the human brain through the application of the authors&#8217; quantum synaptic device. To illustrate this point, a quantum topological insulator (QTI) Bi2Se2Te&#8208;based synaptic neuroelectronic device, where the electric field&#8208;induced tunable topological surface edge states and quantum switching properties make them a premier option for establishing artificial synaptic neuromodulation approaches, is designed and developed. Leveraging these unique quantum synaptic properties, the developed synaptic device provides the capability to neuromodulate distorted neural signals, leading to the reversal of age&#8208;related disorders via BCI. With the synaptic neuroelectronic characteristics of this device, excellent efficacy in treating cognitive neural dysfunctions through modulated neuromorphic stimuli is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, real&#8208;time neuromodulation of electroencephalogram (EEG) deduced distorted event&#8208;related potentials (ERP) is demonstrated by modulation of the synaptic device array.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Tailored Ionizable Lipid Nanoparticles Facilitate IL&#8208;12 Circular RNA Delivery for Enhanced Lung Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a new lipid nanoparticle (LNP) that efficiently delivers circular RNA to lung tumors. The LNP shows better circRNA delivery efficiency than the benchmark. A single dose of this interleukin&#8208;12 circRNA&#8208;LNP induces robust anti&#8208;tumor immunity and tumor regression in two lung cancer models. This tailored LNP platform holds promise for advancing RNA immunotherapies against lung cancer.








Abstract
The advancement of message RNA (mRNA) &#8208;based immunotherapies for cancer is highly dependent on the effective delivery of RNA (Ribonucleic) payloads using ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). However, the clinical application of these therapies is hindered by variable mRNA expression among different cancer types and the risk of systemic toxicity. The transient expression profile of mRNA further complicates this issue, necessitating frequent dosing and thus increasing the potential for adverse effects. Addressing these challenges, a high&#8208;throughput combinatorial method is utilized to synthesize and screen LNPs that efficiently deliver circular RNA (circRNA) to lung tumors. The lead LNP, H1L1A1B3, demonstrates a fourfold increase in circRNA transfection efficiency in lung cancer cells over ALC&#8208;0315, the industry&#8208;standard LNPs, while providing potent immune activation. A single intratumoral injection of H1L1A1B3 LNPs, loaded with circRNA encoding interleukin&#8208;12 (IL&#8208;12), induces a robust immune response in a Lewis lung carcinoma model, leading to marked tumor regression. Immunological profiling of treated tumors reveals substantial increments in CD45+ leukocytes and enhances infiltration of CD8+ T cells, underscoring the ability of H1L1A1B3 LNPs to modulate the tumor microenvironment favorably. These results highlight the potential of tailored LNP platforms to advance RNA drug delivery for cancer therapy, broadening the prospects for RNA immunotherapeutics.

         <title>Knotted Artificial Muscles for Bio&#8208;Mimetic Actuation under Deepwater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of artificial muscles is proposed from intricately knotted liquid crystal elastomer fibers, capable of high stroke, and fast linear contractions. These muscles remain functional even when significantly damaged or submerged at depths of 3000 meters underwater, mirroring the remarkable robustness and adaptability of their natural counterparts.








Abstract
Muscles featuring high frequency and high stroke linear actuation are essential for animals to achieve superior maneuverability, agility, and environmental adaptability. Artificial muscles are yet to match their biological counterparts, due to inferior actuation speed, magnitude, mode, or adaptability. Inspired by the hierarchical structure of natural muscles, artificial muscles are created that are powerful, responsive, robust, and adaptable. The artificial muscles consist of knots braided from 3D printed liquid crystal elastomer fibers and thin heating threads. The unique hierarchical, braided knot structure offers amplified linear stroke, force rate, and damage&#8208;tolerance, as verified by both numerical simulations and experiments. In particular, the square knotted artificial muscle shows reliable cycles of actuation at 1Hz in 3000m depth underwater. Potential application is demonstrated by propelling a model boat. Looking ahead, the knotted artificial muscles can empower novel biomedical devices and soft robots to explore various environments, from inside human body to the mysterious deep&#160;sea.

         <title>Tailored Fabrication of Full&#8208;Color Ultrastable Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Carbon Dots Composites with Unexpected Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of carbon dots and urea that exhibit full&#8208;color, long&#8208;life, high&#8208;quantum yield, ultrastable, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, along with thermosensitive delayed fluorescence, are developed, and these are applied to higher&#8208;level information encryption and in vivo imaging. The precise control of the singlet&#8211;triplet splitting of carbon dots through precursor engineering introduces a new method to realize smart dual&#8208;channel afterglow materials.








Abstract
The development of single&#8208;system materials that exhibit both multicolor room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with tunable after glow colors and channels is challenging. In this study, four metal&#8208;free carbon dots (CDs) are developed through structural tailoring, and panchromatic high&#8208;brightness RTP is achieved via strong chemical encapsulation in urea. The maximum lifetime and quantum yield reaches 2141 ms and 56.55%, respectively. Moreover, CDs&#8208;IV@urea, prepared via coreshell interaction engineering, exhibits a dual afterglow of red RTP and green TADF. The degree of conjugation and functional groups of precursors affects the binding interactions of the nitrogen cladding on CDs, which in turn stabilizes triplet energy levels and affects the energy gap between S1 and T1 (&#916;EST) to induce multicolor RTP. The enhanced wrapping interaction lowers the &#916;EST, promoting reverse intersystem crossing, which leads to phosphorescence and TADF. This strong coreshell interaction fully stabilizes the triplet state, thus stabilizing the material in water, even in extreme environments such as strong acids and oxidants. These afterglow materials are tested in multicolor, time, and temperature multiencryption as well as in multicolor in vivo bioimaging. Hence, these materials have promising practical applications in information security as well as biomedical diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Reverse Atom Capture on Perovskite Surface Enabling Robust and Efficient Cathode for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced reverse atom capture technique is developed to capture surface segregated Ba and Sr cations from PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) perovskite, resulting in a unique (Ba/Sr)(Co/Fe/W)O3&#8722;&#948; (BSCFW)@PBSCF heterostructured cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells. The single cell using such heterostructured cathode delivers an excellent peak power density of 1.32&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and a robust durability for 240&#160;h.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) hold potential for sustainable energy conversion, yet their widespread application is hindered by the sluggish kinetics and inferior stability of cathode materials. Here, a facile and efficient reverse atom capture technique is developed to manipulate the surface chemistry of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) cathode for PCFCs. This method successfully captures segregated Ba and Sr cations on the PBSCF surface using W species, creating a (Ba/Sr)(Co/Fe/W)O3&#8722;&#948; (BSCFW)@PBSCF heterostructure. Benefiting from enhanced kinetics of proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction reaction and strengthened chemical stability, the single cell using the optimized 2W&#8208;PBSCF cathode demonstrates an exceptional peak power density of 1.32&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and maintains durable performance for 240&#160;h. Theoretical calculations unveil that the BSCFW perovskite delivers lower oxygen vacancy formation energy, hydration energy, and proton transfer energy compared to the PBSCF perovskite. This protocol offers new insights into advanced atom capture techniques for sustainable energy infrastructures.

         <title>Chlorination Design for Highly Stable Electrolyte toward High Mass Loading and Long Cycle Life Sodium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorination design strategy is proposed for sodium&#8208;based dual ion batteries, and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the chlorinated electrolyte based on chloromethyl ethyl carbonate displays notably enhanced oxidative stability and highly reversible anion intercalation into the graphite cathode; meanwhile, the uniform and efficient plating/stripping of Na+ ions on the anode is also achieved.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based dual ion batteries (SDIBs) have garnered significant attention as novel energy storage devices offering the advantages of high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;cost. Nonetheless, conventional electrolytes exhibit low resistance to oxidation and poor compatibility with electrode materials, resulting in rapid battery failure. In this study, for the first time, a chlorination design of electrolytes for SDIB, is proposed. Using ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) as a representative, chlorine (Cl)&#8208;substituted EMC not only demonstrates increased oxidative stability ascribed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics of chlorine atom, electrolyte compatibility with both the cathode and anode is also greatly improved by forming Cl&#8208;containing interface layers. Consequently, a discharge capacity of 104.6 mAh g&#8722;1 within a voltage range of 3.0&#8211;5.0&#160;V is achieved for Na||graphite SDIB that employs a high graphite cathode mass loading of 5.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, along with almost no capacity decay after 900 cycles. Notably, the Na||graphite SDIB can be revived for an additional 900 cycles through the replacement of a fresh Na anode. As the mass loading of graphite cathode increased to 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, Na||graphite SDIB is still capable of sustaining over 700 times with &#8776;100% capacity retention. These results mark the best outcome among reported SDIBs. This study corroborates the effectiveness of chlorination design in developing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes and attaining enduring cycle stability of Na&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Understanding and Weakening Photon Recycling in Solar Cells to Approach the Radiative Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photon recycling model is proposed by considering the relationship between photon recycling and radiation processes, as well as the corresponding open&#8208;circuit voltage losses of solar cells. This model reveals that weakening photon recycling is more effective to approach the radiative limit of solar cells than enhancing it, and helps to achieve higher device stability.








Abstract
Photon recycling plays an important role in the light outcoupling of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells and is considered a necessary condition to achieve the radiative limit of open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and efficiency. However, due to the impact of photon recycling on bulk and surface radiation of solar cells being overlooked, experimental demonstrations on the accuracy of existing photon recycling models are scarce and some contrary theoretical results also emerge. Here, the relationship between photon recycling and radiation processes, as well as the corresponding VOC losses of solar cells based on the principle of detailed balance is clarified. It is shown that weakening photon recycling is more effective to boost the device performance than enhancing it, promoting the theoretical efficiencies of solar cells, such as perovskite, Si, and GaAs, to 98.5%, 94.9%, and almost 100% of their radiative limit, respectively. Moreover, weakening photon recycling also helps to maintain higher efficiency when the internal radiative efficiency decreases, which benefits higher device stability. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the role of photon recycling in solar cells and helps to push efficiency to a new limit.

         <title>Spatially Precise Genetic Engineering at the Electrode&#8208;Tissue Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The interface between electrodes and neural tissues plays a pivotal role in determining the efficacy and fidelity of neural activity recording and modulation. While considerable efforts have been made to improve the electrode&#8208;tissue interface, the majority of studies have primarily concentrated on the development of biocompatible neural electrodes through abiotic materials and structural engineering. In this study, we present an approach that seamlessly integrates abiotic and biotic engineering principles into the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. Specifically, we combine ultraflexible neural electrodes with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) designed to silence the expression of endogenous genes within neural tissues. Our system facilitates shRNA&#8208;mediated knockdown of PTEN and PTBP1, two essential genes associated in neural survival/growth and neurogenesis, within specific cell populations located at the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. Additionally, we demonstrate that the downregulation of PTEN in neurons can result in an enlargement of neuronal cell bodies at the electrode&#8208;tissue interface. Furthermore, our system enables long&#8208;term monitoring of neuronal activities following PTEN knockdown in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease and traumatic brain injury. Our system provides a versatile approach for genetically engineering the electrode&#8208;tissue interface with unparalleled precision, paving the way for the development of regenerative electronics and next&#8208;generation brain&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Control of Liquid&#8208;Liquid Crystalline Phase Separation by Depletion Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning nucleation and growth of colloidal liquid crystalline (LC) droplets, also known as tactoids, is highly desirable in both fundamental science and technological applications. However, the tactoid structure results from the trade&#8208;off between thermodynamics and non&#8208;equilibrium kinetics effects, and controlling liquid&#8208;liquid crystalline phase separation (LLCPS) in these systems is still work in progress. Here we introduce a single&#8208;step strategy to obtain a rich palette of morphologies for tactoids formed via nucleation and growth within an initially isotropic phase exposed to a gradient of depletants. We show the simultaneous appearance of rich LC structures along the depleting potential gradient, where the position of each LC structure is correlated with the magnitude of the depleting potential. Changing the size (nanoparticles) or the nature (polymers) of the depleting agent provides additional, precise control over the resulting LC structures through a size&#8208;selective mechanism, where the depletant may be found both within and outside the LC droplets. The use of depletion gradients from depletants of varying size and nature offers a powerful toolbox to manipulation, templating, imaging and understanding heterogeneous colloidal LC structures.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Conversion of CO2 to C2 Products by the 3d Transition Metal Intercalates of Layered Lead Iodides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2+ products presents significant challenges, which is attributed to the slow kinetics of multi&#8208;e&#8722; CO2 photoreduction and the high thermodynamic barrier for C&#8722;C coupling. Incorporating redox&#8208;active Co2+/Ni2+ cations into lead halide photocatalysts has high potentials to improve carrier transport and introduce charge polarized bimetallic sites, addressing the kinetic and thermodynamic issues, respectively. In this study, we have developed a coordination&#8208;driven synthetic strategy to introduce 3d transition metals into the interlamellar region of layered organolead iodides with atomic precision. The resultant bimetallic halide hybrids exhibit selective photoreduction of CO2 to C2H5OH using H2O vapor at the evolution rates of 24.9&#8764;31.4&#160;&#956;mol g&#8211;1&#160;h&#8211;1 and high selectivity of 89.5&#8764;93.6%, while pristine layered lead iodide yields only C1 products. Band structure calculations and photoluminescence studies indicate that the interlayer Co2+/Ni2+ species greatly contribute to the frontier orbitals and enhance exciton dissociation into free carriers, facilitating carrier transport between adjacent lead iodide layers. In addition, Bader charge distribution calculations and in situ experimental spectroscopic studies reveal that the asymmetric Ni&#8722;O&#8722;Pb bimetallic catalytic sites exhibit intrinsic charge polarization, promoting C&#8722;C coupling and leading to the formation of the key *OC&#8722;CHO intermediate.

         <title>Manipulating Radiation&#8208;Sensitive Z&#8208;DNA Conformation for Enhanced Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double&#8208;strand breaks (DSBs) yield highly determines radiotherapy efficacy. However, improving the inherent radiosensitivity of tumour DNA to promote radiation&#8208;induced DSBs remains a challenge. Using theoretical and experimental models, we discover the underexplored impact of Z&#8208;DNA conformations on radiosensitivity, yielding higher DSBs than other DNA conformations. Thereout, we propose a radiosensitization strategy focused on inducing Z&#8208;DNA conformation, utilizing CBL@HfO2 nanocapsules loaded with a Z&#8208;DNA inducer CBL0137. A hollow mesoporous HfO2 (HM&#8208;HfO2) acts as a delivery and an energy depositor to promote Z&#8208;DNA breakage. The nanocapsule permits the smart DSBs accelerator that triggers its radiosensitization with irradiation stimulation. Impressively, the CBL@HfO2 facilitates the B&#8208;Z DNA conformational transition, augmenting DSBs about 4&#8208;fold stronger than irradiation alone, generating significant tumour suppression with a 30% cure rate. The approach enables DSBs augmentation by improving the inherent radiosensitivity of DNA. As such, it opens up an era of Z&#8208;DNA conformation manipulation in radiotherapy.

         <title>A General Molecular Structural Design for Highly Efficient Photopyroptosis that can be Activated within 10 s Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photopyroptosis is an emerging research branch of photodynamic therapy (PDT), whereas there remains a lack of molecular structural principles to fabricate photosensitivers for triggering a highly efficient pyroptosis. Herein, we propose a general and rational structural design principle to implement this hypothesis. The principle relies on the clamping of cationic moieties (e.g., pyridinium, imidazolium) onto one photosensitive core to facilitate a considerable mitochondrial targeting (both of the inner and the outer membranes) of the molecules, thus maximizing the photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the specific site to trigger the gasdermin E&#8208;mediated pyroptosis. Through this design, the pyroptotic trigger can be achieved in a minimum of 10 seconds of irradiation with a substantially low light dosage (0.4 J/cm2), compared to relevant work reported (up to 60 J/cm2). Moreover, immunotherapy with high tumor inhibition efficiency was realized by applying the synthetic molecules alone. This structural paradigm is valuable for deepening the understanding of PDT (especially the mitochondrial&#8208;targeted PDT) from the perspective of pyroptosis, towards the future development of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art form of PDT.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;driven High&#8208;performance Metabolic Assay for Diagnosis and Therapeutic Evaluation of Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses and is a well&#8208;known risk factor for suicide, characterized by low overall efficacy (&lt; 50%) and high relapse rate (40%). A rapid and objective approach for screening and prognosis of depression is highly desirable but still awaits further development. Herein, we present a high&#8208;performance metabolite&#8208;based assay to aid the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of depression by developing a vacancy&#8208;engineered cobalt oxide (Vo&#8208;Co3O4) assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometer platform. The nanoparticles with optimal vacancy achieve a signal enhancement (up to 20 folds than the commercialized products), characterized by favorable charge transfer and increased photothermal conversion. The optimized Vo&#8208;Co3O4 allows for a direct and robust record of plasma metabolic fingerprints (PMFs). Through machine learning of PMFs, high&#8208;performance depression diagnosis is achieved, with the areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.941&#8211;0.980 and an accuracy of over 92%. Further, a simplified diagnostic panel for depression is established, with a desirable AUC value of 0.933. Finally, we quantify proline levels in a follow&#8208;up cohort of depressive patients, highlighting the potential of metabolite quantification in the therapeutic evaluation of depression. Our work promotes the progression of advanced matrixes and brings insights into the management of depression.

         <title>A Polyplatin with Hands&#8208;Holding Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Fluophores and Prodrugs at a Precise Ratio for Tracking Drug Fate with Realtime Readout and Treatment Feedback</title>

Abstract
The in vivo fate of chemotherapeutic drugs plays a vital role in helping the understanding of the therapeutic outcome, side effects, and the mechanism of action. However, the lack of imaging abilities of most drugs, tedious labelling processes, and premature leakage of imaging agents currently result in loss of fidelity between the drugs and any imaging signals. Herein, an unique amphiphilic polymer was created by copolymerization of a NIR&#8208;II fluorophore drug tracer (T) and an anticancer Pt(IV) prodrug (D) of cisplatin in a hand&#8208;holding manner into one polymer chain for the first time.

PolyplatinDT could self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles, referred to as NanoplatinDT. Furthermore, a caspase&#8208;3 cleavable peptide with quenched FRET pairs that serves as an apoptosis protein reporter was attached to NanoplatinDT, resulting in NanoplatinDTR that were capable of simultaneously tracking platinum drugs with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and evaluating the therapeutic efficacy with the apoptosis reporters. The strong correlations between the fluorescence intensity of the NIR&#8208;II fluorophores and 5&#8242;&#8208;FAM, and the Pt levels were investigated both in vitro and in vivo with NanoplatinDTR, enabling a quantitative readout of the platinum levels and feasible evaluation of treatment efficacy. Overall, we reported here the design of the first theranostic polymer with anticancer drugs, drug tracers, and drug efficacy reporters that could work in concert to provide possible insight into the drug fate and mechanism of action in vitro and in vivo.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;in v&lt;/i&gt;ivo fate of chemotherapeutic drugs plays a vital role in helping the understanding of the therapeutic outcome, side effects, and the mechanism of action. However, the lack of imaging abilities of most drugs, tedious labelling processes, and premature leakage of imaging agents currently result in loss of fidelity between the drugs and any imaging signals. Herein, an unique amphiphilic polymer was created by copolymerization of a NIR-II fluorophore drug tracer (T) and an anticancer Pt(IV) prodrug (D) of cisplatin in a hand-holding manner into one polymer chain for the first time. The obtained Polyplatin&lt;sup&gt;DT&lt;/sup&gt; was capable of delivering the drugs and the fluorophores concomitantly at a precise D/T ratio, thereby resulting in tracking the platinum drugs and even readout of them in real-time via NIR-II fluorescence imaging both in vitro and in vivo. Polyplatin&lt;sup&gt;DT&lt;/sup&gt; could self-assemble into nanoparticles, referred to as Nanoplatin&lt;sup&gt;DT&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, a caspase-3 cleavable peptide with quenched FRET pairs that serves as an apoptosis protein reporter was attached to Nanoplatin&lt;sup&gt;DT&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in Nanoplatin&lt;sup&gt;DTR&lt;/sup&gt; that were capable of simultaneously tracking platinum drugs with NIR-II fluorescence and evaluating the therapeutic efficacy with the apoptosis reporters. The strong correlations between the fluorescence intensity of the NIR-II fluorophores and 5&#8242;-FAM, and the Pt levels were investigated both in vitro and in vivo with Nanoplatin&lt;sup&gt;DTR&lt;/sup&gt;, enabling a quantitative readout of the platinum levels and feasible evaluation of treatment efficacy. Overall, we reported here the design of the first theranostic polymer with anticancer drugs, drug tracers, and drug efficacy reporters that could work in concert to provide possible insight into the drug fate and mechanism of action in vitro and in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Membrane&#8208;Free Rechargeable Seawater Battery Unlocked by Lattice Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Seawater batteries that directly utilize natural seawater as electrolytes are ideal sustainable aqueous devices with high safety, exceedingly low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the present seawater batteries are either primary batteries or rechargeable half&#8208;seawater/half&#8208;nonaqueous batteries because of the lack of suitable anode working in seawater. Here, we demonstrate a unique lattice engineering to unlock the electrochemically inert anatase TiO2 anode to be highly active for the reversible uptake of multiple cations (Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) in aqueous electrolytes. Density functional theory calculations and in&#8208;situ Raman further reveal the origin of the unprecedented charge storage behaviors, which can be attributed to the significant reduction of the cations diffusion barrier within the lattice, i.e., from 1.5&#160;eV to 0.4&#160;eV. As a result, the capacities of anatase TiO2 with 2.4% lattice expansion are ca. 100 times higher than the routine one in natural seawater, and ca. 200 times higher in aqueous Na+ electrolyte. The finding should significantly advance aqueous seawater energy storage devices closer to practical applications.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional layered metallic graphite composites as promising electromagnetic wave absorption materials (EWAMs) for their combined properties of abundant interlayer free spaces, rich metallic polarized sites and high conductivity, but the controllable synthesis remains rather challenging. Herein, a dual&#8208;step Redox engineering strategy was developed by employing cobalt boron imidazolate framework (Co&#8208;BIF) to construct a two&#8208;dimensional CoNi&#8208;alloy embedded B, N&#8208;doped carbon layers (2D&#8208;CNC), as a promising EWAM. In the first step, a chemical etching oxidation process on Co&#8208;BIF was used to obtain an optimized 2D&#8208;CoNi&#8208;layered double hydroxide (2D&#8208;CoNi&#8208;LDH) intermediate and in the second, high&#8208;temperature calcination reduction was implemented to modify graphitization the degree of the 2D&#8208;CNC. The obtained sample delivers superior reflection loss (RLmin) of &#8208;60.1&#160;dB and wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 6.24&#160;GHz. The synergy mechanisms of interfacial/dipole polarization and magnetic coupling were in&#8208;depth evidenced by the hologram and Lorentz electron microscopy, revealing its significant contribution on multireflection and impedance matching. Further theoretical evaluation by COMSOL simulation in different fields based on the dynamic loss process towards the test ring reveals the in situ EW attenuation process. This work presents a strategy to develop multifunctional light&#8208;weight infrared stealthy aerogel with superior pressure&#8208;resistant, anti&#8208;corrosion and heat&#8208;insulating properties for future applications.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Channel Ca2+ Nanomodulator Induces Intracellular Ca2+ Disorders via Endogenous Ca2+ Redistribution for Tumor Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tumor cells harness Ca2+ to maintain cellular homeostasis and withstand external stresses from various treatments. Here, we construct a dual&#8208;channel Ca2+ nanomodulator (CAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO) that can induce irreversible intracellular Ca2+ disorders via the redistribution of tumor&#8208;inherent Ca2+ for disrupting cellular homeostasis and thus improving tumor radiosensitivity. Stimulated by tumor&#8208;overexpressed acid and glutathione, capsaicin and nitric oxide are successively escaped from CAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO to activate the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 and the ryanodine receptor for the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and the release of Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum, respectively. The overwhelming level of Ca2+ in tumor cells not only impairs the function of organelles but also induces widespread changes in the gene transcriptome, including the downregulation of a set of radioresistance&#8208;associated genes. Combining CAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO treatment with radiotherapy achieves a significant suppression against both pancreatic and patient&#8208;derived hepatic tumors with negligible side effects. Together, our study provides a feasible approach for inducing tumor&#8208;specific intracellular Ca2+ overload via endogenous Ca2+ redistribution and demonstrates the great potential of Ca2+ disorder therapy in enhancing the sensitivity for tumor radiotherapy.

         <title>Autonomous Artificial Olfactory Sensor Systems with Homeostasis Recovery via a Seamless Neuromorphic Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neuromorphic olfactory systems have been actively studied in recent years owing to their considerable potential in electronic noses, robotics, and neuromorphic data processing systems. However, conventional gas sensors typically have the ability to detect hazardous gas levels but lack synaptic functions such as memory and recognition of gas accumulation, which are essential for realizing human&#8208;like neuromorphic sensory system. In this study, we propose a seamless architecture for a neuromorphic olfactory system capable of detecting and memorizing the present level and accumulation status of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during continuous gas exposure, regulating a self&#8208;alarm implementation triggered after 147 and 85 s at a continuous gas exposure of 20 and 40&#160;ppm, respectively. Thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor type gas sensors utilizing carbon nanotube semiconductors detect NO2 gas molecules through carrier trapping and exhibit long&#8208;term retention properties, which are compatible with neuromorphic excitatory applications. Additionally, the neuromorphic inhibitory performance was also characterized via gas desorption with programmable ultraviolet light exposure, demonstrating homeostasis recovery. These results provide a promising strategy for developing a facile artificial olfactory system that demonstrates complicated biological synaptic functions with a seamless and simplified system architecture.

Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries are essential technologies for electronic products in our daily life. However, serious fire safety concerns that are closely associated with the flammable liquid electrolyte remains a key challenge. Tremendous effort has been devoted to designing non&#8208;flammable liquid electrolytes. It's critical to gain comprehensive insights into non&#8208;flammability design and inspire more efficient approaches for building safer Li&#8208;ion batteries. This review presents current mechanistic understanding of safety issues and discusses state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;flammable liquid electrolytes design for Li&#8208;ion batteries based on molecule, solvation, and battery compatibility level. Various safety test methods are discussed for reliable safety risk evaluation. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of the non&#8208;flammability design for Li&#8208;ion electrolyte are summarized.

         <title>Harnessing Nanochaperone&#8208;Mediated Autophagy for Selective Clearance of Pathogenic Tau Protein in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Accumulation of pathological tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which correlates more closely with cognitive impairment than does the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) burden. Autophagy is a powerful process for the clearance of toxic proteins including aberrant tau. However, compromised autophagy has been demonstrated in neurodegeneration including AD and current autophagy inducers remain enormously challenging due to inability of restoring autophagy pathway and lack of targeting specificity. Here, pathogenic tau&#8208;specific autophagy based on customized nanochaperone is developed for AD treatment. In this strategy, the nanochaperone can selectively bind to pathogenic tau and maintain tau homeostasis, thereby ensuring microtubule stability which is important for autophagy pathway. Meanwhile, the bound pathogenic tau can be sequestered in autophagosomes by in situ autophagy activation of nanochaperone. Consequently, autophagosomes wrapping with pathogenic tau are able to be trafficked along the stabilized microtubule to achieve successful fusion with lysosomes, resulting in the enhancement of autophagic flux and pathologic tau clearance. After treatment with this nanochaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy strategy, the tau burden, neuron damages and cognitive deficits of AD mice are significantly alleviated in the brain. Therefore, this work represents a promising candidate for AD&#8208;targeted therapy and provides new insights into future design of anti&#8208;neurodegeneration drugs.

         <title>Combination of Counterion Size and Doping Concentration Determine the Electronic and Thermoelectric Properties of Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In both chemical and electrochemical doping of organic semiconductors (OSCs), a counterion, either from the electrolyte or ionized dopant, balances the charge introduced to the OSC. Despite the large influence of this counterion on the OSC optical and electronic response, there remains substantial debate on how a fundamental parameter, ion size, impacts these properties. This work addresses this discrepancy by accounting for two doping regimes. In the low&#8208;doping regime the Coulomb binding energies between polarons on the &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers and the counterions are significant, and larger counterions lead to decreased Coulomb interactions, more delocalized polarons, and higher electrical conductivities. In the high&#8208;doping regime the Coulomb binding energies become negligible due to the increased dielectric constant of the films and a smoothing of the energy landscape; thereby, the electrical conductivities depend primarily on the extent of morphological disorder in the OSC. Moreover, in regioregular poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), rr&#8208;P3HT, smaller counterions lead to greater bipolaron concentrations in the low&#8208;doping regime due to the increased Coulomb interactions. Emphasizing the impact of the counterion size, we show that larger counterions can lead toincreased thermoelectric power factors for rr&#8208;P3HT.

         <title>Strong Interaction between Titanium Carbonitride Embedded in Mesoporous Carbon Nanofibers and Pt Enables Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Platinum supported on high surface area carbon has been the most widely used electrocatalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). However, conventional carbon supports are susceptible to corrosion at high potentials, leading to severe degradation of electrochemical performance. In this work, titanium carbonitride embedded in mesoporous carbon nanofibers (m&#8208;TiCN NFs) are reported as a promising alternative to address this issue. Benefiting from the interpenetrating conductive pathways inside the one&#8208;dimensional nanostructures and the embedded TiCN nanoparticles (NPs), m&#8208;TiCN NFs exhibit excellent stability at high potentials and interact strongly with Pt nanoparticles. Subsequently, m&#8208;TiCN NFs supported Pt NPs deliver remarkably enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability, with negligible activity decay and less than 5% loss of electrochemical surface area (ECSA) after 50,000 cycles. Moreover, the fuel cell assembled by this catalyst delivers a maximum power density of 1.22&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and merely 3% loss after 30,000 cycles of accelerated durability tests (ADT) under DOE protocols. The improved ORR activity and durability are attributed to the superior corrosion resistance of the m&#8208;TiCN NFs support and the strong interaction between Pt and m&#8208;TiCN NFs.

         <title>From Charge to Spin: An In&#8208;Depth Exploration of Electron Transfer in Energy Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive physical properties associated with charge and spin afford a novel paradigm for catalyst design, challenging conventional linear scaling relationships in the realm of energy conversion. This departure from traditional approaches not only holds the potential to revolutionize asymmetric synthesis but also offers a unique perspective on unraveling the elusive origins of homochirality.








Abstract
Catalytic materials play crucial roles in various energy&#8208;related processes, ranging from large&#8208;scale chemical production to advancements in renewable energy technologies. Despite a century of dedicated research, major enduring challenges associated with enhancing catalyst efficiency and durability, particularly in green energy&#8208;related electrochemical reactions, remain. Focusing only on either the crystal structure or electronic structure of a catalyst is deemed insufficient to break the linear scaling relationship (LSR), which is the golden rule for the design of advanced catalysts. The discourse in this review intricately outlines the essence of heterogeneous catalysis reactions by highlighting the vital roles played by electron properties. The physical and electrochemical properties of electron charge and spin that govern catalysis efficiencies are analyzed. Emphasis is placed on the pronounced influence of external fields in perturbing the LSR, underscoring the vital role that electron spin plays in advancing high&#8208;performance catalyst design. The review culminates by proffering insights into the potential applications of spin catalysis, concluding with a discussion of extant challenges and inherent limitations.

Abstract
Wearable epidermic electronics assembled from conductive hydrogels are attracting various research attention for their seamless integration with human body for conformally real&#8208;time health monitoring, clinical diagnostics and medical treatment, and human&#8208;interactive sensing. Nevertheless, it remains a tremendous challenge to simultaneously achieve conformally bioadhesive epidermic electronics with remarkable self&#8208;adhesiveness, reliable ultraviolet (UV) protection ability, and admirable sensing performance for high&#8208;fidelity epidermal electrophysiological signals monitoring, along with timely photothermal therapeutic performances after medical diagnostic sensing, as well as efficient antibacterial activity and reliable hemostatic effect for potential medical therapy. Herein, a conformally bioadhesive hydrogel&#8208;based epidermic sensor, featuring superior self&#8208;adhesiveness and excellent UV&#8208;protection performance, is developed by dexterously assembling conducting MXene nanosheets network with biological hydrogel polymer network for conformally stably attaching onto human skin for high&#8208;quality recording of various epidermal electrophysiological signals with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios (SNR) and low interfacial impedance for intelligent medical diagnosis and smart human&#8208;machine interface. Moreover, a smart sign language gesture recognition platform based on collected electromyogram (EMG) signals is designed for hassle&#8208;free communication with hearing&#8208;impaired people with the help of advanced machine learning algorithms. Meanwhile, the bioadhesive MXene hydrogel possesses reliable antibacterial capability, excellent biocompatibility, and effective hemostasis properties for promising bacterial&#8208;infected wound bleeding.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Pressure&#8208;Dependent Programmable Mechanical Metamaterial with Self&#8208;Sealing Ability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sealing is a fascinating function in living systems, essential for immediate response to damage. The self&#8208;sealing principle found in the plant model of Delosperma cooperi has inspired the design of mechanical metamaterial that can react autonomously to induced damage. By harnessing the internal pressure, the presented metamaterial is capable of closing cracks, facilitating favorable conditions for a potential subsequent self&#8208;healing process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sealing is one of the fascinating functions in nature that enables living material systems to respond immediately to damage. A prime plant model is Delosperma cooperi, which can rapidly self&#8208;seal damaged succulent leaves by systematically deforming until the wound closes. Inspired by this self&#8208;sealing principle, a novel programmable mechanical metamaterial has been developed to mimic the underlying damage management concept. This material is able to react autonomously to changes in its physical condition caused by an induced damage. To design this ability into the programmable metamaterial, a permeable unit cell design has been developed that can change size depending on the internal pressure. The parameter space and associated mechanical functionality of the unit cell design is simulated and analyzed under periodic boundary conditions and various pressures. The principles of self&#8208;sealing behavior in designed metamaterials are investigated, crack closure efficiency is identified for different crack lengths, the limitations of the proposed approach are discussed, and successful crack closure is experimentally demonstrated in the fabricated metamaterial. Although this study facilitates the first step on the way of integrating new bio&#8208;inspired principles in the metamaterials, the results show how programmable mechanical metamaterials might extend materials design space from pure properties to life&#8208;like&#160;abilities.

&lt;p&gt;Self-sealing is a fascinating function in living systems, essential for immediate response to damage. The self-sealing principle found in the plant model of &lt;i&gt;Delosperma cooperi&lt;/i&gt; has inspired the design of mechanical metamaterial that can react autonomously to induced damage. By harnessing the internal pressure, the presented metamaterial is capable of closing cracks, facilitating favorable conditions for a potential subsequent self-healing process.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-sealing is one of the fascinating functions in nature that enables living material systems to respond immediately to damage. A prime plant model is &lt;i&gt;Delosperma cooperi&lt;/i&gt;, which can rapidly self-seal damaged succulent leaves by systematically deforming until the wound closes. Inspired by this self-sealing principle, a novel programmable mechanical metamaterial has been developed to mimic the underlying damage management concept. This material is able to react autonomously to changes in its physical condition caused by an induced damage. To design this ability into the programmable metamaterial, a permeable unit cell design has been developed that can change size depending on the internal pressure. The parameter space and associated mechanical functionality of the unit cell design is simulated and analyzed under periodic boundary conditions and various pressures. The principles of self-sealing behavior in designed metamaterials are investigated, crack closure efficiency is identified for different crack lengths, the limitations of the proposed approach are discussed, and successful crack closure is experimentally demonstrated in the fabricated metamaterial. Although this study facilitates the first step on the way of integrating new bio-inspired principles in the metamaterials, the results show how programmable mechanical metamaterials might extend materials design space from pure properties to life-like&#160;abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Ligand&#8208;Directed Spatial Regulation to Structural and Functional Tunability in Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen&#8208;Functionalized Organic&#8211;Inorganic Nanoassemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a facile and general emulsion self&#8208;assembly tactic is proposed for synthesizing well&#8208;defined AIEgen&#8208;functionalized organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (OINPs) by coassembling alkane chain&#8208;functionalized inorganic nanoparticles with hydrophobic organic AIEgens. By varying the alkane ligand length and density on the surface of inorganic nanoparticles, the ligand&#8208;directed spatial regulation tailored structures, properties, and functionalities, thus championing the progressive development of AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs are successfully achieved.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;functionalized organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (OINPs) are an emerging category of multifunctional nanomaterials with vast potential applications. The spatial arrangement and positioning of AIEgens and inorganic compounds in AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs determine the structures, properties, and functionalities of the self&#8208;assembled nanomaterials. In this work, a facile and general emulsion self&#8208;assembly tactic for synthesizing well&#8208;defined AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs is proposed by coassembling alkane chain&#8208;functionalized inorganic nanoparticles with hydrophobic organic AIEgens. As a proof of concept, the self&#8208;assembly and structural evolution of plasmonic&#8208;fluorescent hybrid nanoparticles (PFNPs) from concentric circle to core shell and then to Janus structures is demonstrated by using alkane chain&#8208;modified AuNPs and AIEgens as building blocks. The spatial position of AuNPs in the signal nanocomposite is controlled by varying the alkane ligand length and density on the AuNP surface. The mechanism behind the formation of various PFNP nanostructures is also elucidated through experiments and theoretical simulation. The obtained PFNPs with diverse structures exhibit spatially tunable optical and photothermal properties for advanced applications in multicolor and multimode immunolabeling and photothermal sterilization. This work presents an innovative synthetic approach of constructing AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs with diverse structures, compositions, and functionalities, thereby championing the progressive development of these OINPs.

         <title>Ultrasmall Inorganic Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Preparation, Functionalization and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrasmall mesoporous nanoparticles (&lt; 50&#160;nm), a unique porous nanomaterial, have been widely studied in the last decade owing to the abundant advantages, involving rich mesopores, low density, high surface area, numerous reaction sites, large cavity space, ultrasmall size, etc. It has been widely used in a range of applications, involving absorption, catalysis, energy storage, fluorescence imaging, and drug delivery/therapy. This paper presents a review of recent advances in the preparation, functionalization and applications of ultrasmall inorganic mesoporous nanoparticles for the first time. The soft monomicelles&#8208;directed method, in contrast to the hard&#8208;template and template&#8208;free methods, is more flexible in the synthesis of mesoporous nanoparticles. This is because the amphiphilic micelle has tunable functional blocks, controlled molecule masses, and adjusted configurations and mesostructures. Focus on the soft micelle directing method, monomicelles could be classified into four types, i.e., the Pluronic&#8208;type block copolymer monomicelles, laboratory&#8208;synthesized amphiphilic block copolymers monomicelles, the single&#8208;molecule star&#8208;shaped block copolymer monomicelles, and the small&#8208;molecule anionic/cationic surfactant monomicelles. This paper also reviews the functionalization of the inner mesopores and the outer surfaces, which includes constructing the yolk&#8208;shell structures (encapsulated nanoparticles), anchoring the active components packed on the shell and building an asymmetric Janus architecture. Then, several representative applications, involving catalysis, energy storage, and biomedicines are presented. Finally, the prospects and challenges of controlled synthesis and large&#8208;scale applications of ultrasmall mesoporous nanoparticles in the future are foreseen.

Silver&#8208;copper&#8208;based semiconductors (AgCuQ, Q = S, Se, Te) demonstrate compelling&#160;attributes, such as ultralow thermal conductivity, tunable electronic properties, and ductility. This review summarizes their fundamentalfeatures and recent achievements, including crystal structures, electronic bands, mechanical features, and strategies for performance enhancement, as well as addressing challenges and prospects.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technology, which enables a direct and pollution&#8208;free conversion of heat into electricity, provides a promising path to address the current global energy crisis. Among the broad range of thermoelectric materials, silver copper chalcogenides (AgCuQ, Q = S, Se, Te) have garnered significant attention in thermoelectric community in light of inherently ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, controllable electronic transport properties, excellent thermoelectric performance across various temperature ranges, and a degree of ductility. This review epitomizes the recent progress in AgCuQ&#8208;based thermoelectric materials, from the optimization of thermoelectric performance to the rational design of devices, encompassing the fundamental understanding of crystal structures, electronic band structures, mechanical properties, and quasi&#8208;liquid behaviors. The correlation between chemical composition, mechanical properties, and thermoelectric performance in this material system is also highlighted. Finally, several key issues and prospects are proposed for further optimizing AgCuQ&#8208;based thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Boosting Contact Electrification by Amorphous Polyvinyl Alcohol Endowing Improved Contact Adhesion and Electrochemical Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stronger binding to water molecules, and the consequent higher water uptake, is shown to be responsible for the improved electrical output of triboelectric generators and sensors based on an amorphous polyvinyl alcohol compared to the more common homopolymer derivative. The specific role played by the increased material softness, adhesive contact, and ionic conductivity on devices performance is highlighted.








Abstract
Ion conductive hydrogels are relevant components in wearable, biocompatible, and biodegradable electronics. Polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol (PVA) homopolymer is often the favored choice for integration into supercapacitors and energy harvesters as in sustainable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, to further improve hydrogel&#8208;based TENGs, a deeper understanding of the impact of their composition and structure on devices performance is necessary.

&lt;p&gt;The stronger binding to water molecules, and the consequent higher water uptake, is shown to be responsible for the improved electrical output of triboelectric generators and sensors based on an amorphous polyvinyl alcohol compared to the more common homopolymer derivative. The specific role played by the increased material softness, adhesive contact, and ionic conductivity on devices performance is highlighted.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ion conductive hydrogels are relevant components in wearable, biocompatible, and biodegradable electronics. Polyvinyl-alcohol (PVA) homopolymer is often the favored choice for integration into supercapacitors and energy harvesters as in sustainable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, to further improve hydrogel-based TENGs, a deeper understanding of the impact of their composition and structure on devices performance is necessary. Here, it is shown how ionic hydrogels based on an amorphous-PVA (a-PVA) allow to fabricate TENGs that outperform the one based on the homopolymer. When used as tribomaterial, the Li-doped a-PVA allows to achieve a twofold higher pressure sensitivity compared to PVA, and to develop a conformable e-skin. When used as an ionic conductor encased in an elastomeric tribomaterial, 100&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; average power is obtained, providing 25% power increase compared to PVA. At the origin of such enhancement is the increased softness, stronger adhesive contact, higher ionic mobility (&amp;gt; 3,5-fold increase), and long-term stability achieved with Li-doped a-PVA. These improvements are attributed to the high density of hydroxyl groups and amorphous structure present in the a-PVA, enabling&#160;a strong binding to water molecules. This work discloses novel insights on those&#160;parameters allowing to&#160;develop&#160;easy-processable,&#160;stable, and highly conductive hydrogels for integration in conformable, soft, and biocompatible TENGs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling Paradoxical Effects of Large Current Density on Zn Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paradox between oriented Zn deposition and poor cell lifetime during large current operation is revealed to be relevant with the multiplied current density in the separator channels. Furthermore, this phenomenon is described as the separator permeation effect, which explains the rapid short circuit despite smooth Zn deposition.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBs) have been widely investigated owing to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and simple assembly. However, the actual behavior of Zn deposition under large current density is still a severe issue associated with obscure mechanism interpretation of ZBs under high loading. Here, differing from the conventional understanding that short circuit is induced by dendrite penetrating under large current density (10&#8211;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), the separator permeation effect is unraveled to illustrate the paradox between smooth deposition and short lifespan. Generally, a dense plating morphology is achieved under large current density because of intensive nuclei and boosted plane growth. Nevertheless, in the scenes applying separators, the multiplied local current density derived from narrow separator channels leads to rapid Zn2+ exhaustion, converting the Zn deposition mode from nucleation control to concentration control, which eventually results in separator permeation and short circuit. This effect is validated in other aqueous metal anodes (Cu, Sn, Fe) and receives similar results. Based on the understanding, a micro&#8208;pore (150&#160;&#181;m) sponge foam is proposed as separators for large&#8208;current anodes to provide broader Zn2+ path and mitigate the separator permeation effect. This work provides unique perspectives on coordinating fast&#8208;charging ability and anode stability of ZBs.

         <title>Engineering Large&#8208;Scale Self&#8208;Mineralizing Bone Organoids with Bone Matrix&#8208;Inspired Hydroxyapatite Hybrid Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This innovative study has introduced a new method for bone regeneration, employing hybrid bioinks inspired by the natural bone matrix to develop large&#8208;scale, self&#8208;mineralizing bone organoids with excellent mechanical properties, capable of extensive in vitro and in vivo cultivation, and multicellular differentiation. It has addressed limitations in mechanical support and extracellular matrix replication, advancing bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
Addressing large bone defects remains a significant challenge owing to the inherent limitations in self&#8208;healing capabilities, resulting in prolonged recovery and suboptimal regeneration. Although current clinical solutions are available, they have notable shortcomings, necessitating more efficacious approaches to bone regeneration. Organoids derived from stem cells show great potential in this field; however, the development of bone organoids has been hindered by specific demands, including the need for robust mechanical support provided by scaffolds and hybrid extracellular matrices (ECM). In this context, bioprinting technologies have emerged as powerful means of replicating the complex architecture of bone tissue. The research focused on the fabrication of a highly intricate bone ECM analog using a novel bioink composed of gelatin methacrylate/alginate methacrylate/hydroxyapatite (GelMA/AlgMA/HAP). Bioprinted scaffolds facilitate the long&#8208;term cultivation and progressive maturation of extensive bioprinted bone organoids, foster multicellular differentiation, and offer valuable insights into the initial stages of bone formation. The intrinsic self&#8208;mineralizing quality of the bioink closely emulates the properties of natural bone, empowering organoids with enhanced bone repair for both in vitro and in vivo applications. This trailblazing investigation propels the field of bone tissue engineering and holds significant promise for its translation into practical applications.

         <title>Simple Sol&#8208;Gel Protein Stabilization toward Rainbow and White Lighting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new synthetic method for the production of silica&#8208;encapsulated protein nanomaterials without the use of organic solvents or surfactants is reported. The new pathway simplifies the procedure, allowing for less stable proteins to be used. Single&#8208;layer coatings based on several fluorescent proteins for white/rainbow lighting applications are fabricated, with improved efficiencies and stabilities.








Abstract
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are heralded as a paradigm of sustainable materials for photonics/optoelectronics. However, their stabilization under non&#8208;physiological environments and/or harsh operation conditions is the major challenge. Among the FP&#8208;stabilization methods, classical sol&#8208;gel is the most effective, but less versatile, as most of the proteins/enzymes are easily degraded due to the need of multi&#8208;step processes, surfactants, and mixed water/organic solvents in extreme pH. Herein, sol&#8208;gel chemistry with archetypal FPs (mGreenLantern; mCherry) is revisited, simplifying the method by one&#8208;pot, surfactant&#8208;free, and aqueous media (phosphate buffer saline pH&#160;=&#160;7.4). The synthesis mechanism involves the direct reaction of the carboxylic groups at the FP surface with the silica precursor, generating a positively charged FP intermediate that acts as a seed for the formation of size&#8208;controlled mesoporous FP@SiO2 nanoparticles. Green&#8208;/red&#8208;emissive (single&#8208;FP component) and dual&#8208;emissive (multi&#8208;FPs component; kinetic studies not required) FP@SiO2 are prepared without affecting the FP photoluminescence and stabilities (&gt;6&#160;months) under dry storage and organic solvent suspensions. Finally, FP@SiO2 color filters are applied to rainbow and white bio&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes featuring up to 15&#8208;fold enhanced stabilities without reducing luminous efficacy compared to references with native FPs. Overall, an easy, versatile, and effective FP&#8208;stabilization method is demonstrated in FP@SiO2 toward sustainable protein lighting.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;level Engineered Cobalt Catalysts for Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions: Synergy of Single Atom Metal Sites and Nonmetal&#8208;bonded Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) are atomic&#8208;level&#8208;engineered materials with high intrinsic activity. Catalytic centers of SACs are typically the transition metal (TM)&#8208;nonmetal coordination sites, while the functions of co&#8208;existing non&#8208;TM&#8208;bonded functionalities are usually overlooked in catalysis. Herein, we reported the scalable preparation of carbon&#8208;supported cobalt&#8208;anchored SACs (CoCN) with controlled Co&#8722;N sites and free functional N species. We first systematically study the role of metal and nonmetal bonded functionalities in the SACs for peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;driven Fenton&#8208;like reactions, revealing their contribution to performance improvement and pathway steering. Experiments and computations demonstrate that the Co&#8722;N3C coordination plays a vital role in the formation of a surface&#8208;confined PMS* complex to trigger the electron transfer pathway and promote kinetics because of the optimized electronic state of Co centers, while the non&#8208;metal&#8208;coordinated graphitic N sites act as preferable pollutant adsorption sites and additional PMS activation sites to accelerate electron transfer. Synergistically, CoCN exhibits ultrahigh activity in PMS activation for p&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid oxidation, achieving complete degradation within 10&#160;min with an ultrahigh turnover frequency of 0.38&#160;min&#8211;1, surpassing most reported materials. These findings offer new insights into the versatile functions of N species in SACs and inspire rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts in complicated heterogeneous systems.

Abstract
Fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (FIG&#8208;PDT) holds promise for cancer treatment, yet challenges persist in poor imaging quality, phototoxicity, and insufficient anti&#8208;tumor effect. Herein, we report a novel nanoplatform, LipoHPM, designed to address these challenges. Our approach employs an acid&#8208;sensitive amine linker to connect a biotin&#8208;modified hydrophilic polymer (BiotinPEG) with a hydrophobic photosensitizer (MBA), forming OFF&#8208;state BiotinPEG&#8208;MBA (PM) micelles via an aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect. These micelles are then co&#8208;loaded with the tumor penetration enhancer hydralazine (HDZ) into pH&#8208;sensitive liposomes (LipoHPM). Leveraging the ACQ effect, LipoHPM is silent in both fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during blood circulation but restores both properties upon disassembly. Following intravenous injection in tumor&#8208;bearing mice, LipoHPM actively targets tumor cells overexpressing biotin&#8208;receptors, contributing to enhanced tumor accumulation. Upon cellular internalization, LipoHPM disassembles within lysosomes, releasing HDZ to enhance tumor penetration and inhibit tumor metastasis. Concurrently, the micelles activate fluorescence for tumor imaging and boost the production of both type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II ROS for tumor eradication. Therefore, the smart LipoHPM synergistically integrates near&#8208;infrared emission, activatable tumor imaging, robust ROS generation, efficient anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;metastasis activity, successfully overcoming limitations of conventional photosensitizers and establishing itself as a promising nanoplatform for potent FIG&#8208;PDT applications.

         <title>Tailoring the Coordination Micro&#8208;Environment in Nanotraps for Efficient Platinum/Palladium Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recovering platinum group metals from secondary resources is crucial to meet the growing demand for high&#8208;tech applications. Various techniques have been explored, and adsorption using porous materials has emerged as a promising technology due to its efficient performance and environmental beingness. However, the challenge lies in effectively recovering and separating individual PGMs given their similar chemical properties. Herein, we present a breakthrough approach by sophisticatedly tailoring the coordination micro&#8208;environment in a series of aminopyridine&#8208;based porous organic polymers, which enables the creation of platinum&#8208;specific nanotraps for efficient separation of binary PGMs (platinum/palladium). The newly synthesized POP&#8208;o2NH2&#8208;Py demonstrated record uptakes and selectivity towards platinum over palladium, with the amino groups adjacent to the pyridine moieties being vital in improving platinum binding performance. Further breakthrough experiments underlined its remarkable ability to separate platinum and palladium. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that POP&#8208;o2NH2&#8208;Py offers a more favorable coordination fashion to platinum ions compared to palladium ions owing to the greater interaction between N and Pt4+ and stronger intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the amino groups and four coordinating chlorines at platinum. These findings underscore the importance of fine&#8208;tuning the coordination micro&#8208;environment of nanotraps through subtle modifications that can greatly enhance the selectivity towards the desired metal ions.

         <title>Implanted Carbon Nanotubes Harvest Electrical Energy from Heartbeat for Medical Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Reliability of power supply for current implantable electronic devices is a critical issue for longevity and for reducing the risk of device failure. Energy harvesting is an emerging technology, representing a strategy for establishing autonomous power supply by utilizing biomechanical movements in our body. Here we present a novel &#8220;Twistron energy cell harvester&#8221; (TECH), consisting of coiled carbon nanotube yarn that converts mechanical energy of the beating heart into electrical energy. The performance of TECH was evaluated in an in vitro artificial heartbeat system which simulates the deformation pattern of the cardiac surface, reaching a maximum peak power of 1.42&#160;W/kg and average power of 0.39&#160;W/kg at 60 beats per minute. In vivo implantation of TECH onto the left ventricular surface in a porcine model continuously generated electrical energy from cardiac contraction. The generated electrical energy was used for direct pacing of the heart as documented by extensive electrophysiology mapping. Implanted modified carbon nanotubes are applicable as a source for harvesting biomechanical energy from cardiac motion for power supply or cardiac pacing.

         <title>Less is More: Asymmetric D&#8208;A Type Agent to Achieve Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembled Nanoaggregates for Long&#8208;Acting Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
To enhance the phototheranostic performance, agents with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good tumor&#8208;targeting ability, and prolonged retention are urgently needed. However, symmetric D&#8208;A type agents usually produce spherical nanoaggregates, leading to good tumor targeting but inferior retention. Rod&#8208;like nanoaggregates are desired to extend their retention in tumors; however, this remains a challenge. In particular, agents with dynamically changeable shapes that integrate merits of different morphologies were seldomly reported. Therefore, self&#8208;assembled organic nanoaggregates with smart shape tunability were designed here using an asymmetric D&#8208;A type TIBT. The photoluminescence quantum yield in solids was up to 52.24% for TIBT. TIBT also exhibited high ROS generation in corresponding nanoaggregates (TIBT&#8208;NCs). Moreover, dynamic self&#8208;assembly in shape changing from nanospheres to nanorods occurred in TIBT&#8208;NCs, contributing to the enhancement of ROS quantum yield from 0.55 to 0.72. In addition, dynamic self&#8208;assembly could be observed for both in vitro and in vivo, conferring TIBT&#8208;NCs with strong tumor targeting and prolonged retention. Finally, efficient photodynamic therapy to inhibit tumor growth was achieved in TIBT&#8208;NCs, with an inhibition rate of 90%. This work demonstrates that asymmetric D&#8208;A type agents can play significant roles in forming self&#8208;assembled organic nanoaggregates, thus showing great potential in long&#8208;acting cancer therapy.

         <title>Extraordinary Thermoelectric Properties of Topological Surface States in Quantum&#8208;Confined Cd3As2 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Topological insulators and semimetals have been shown to possess intriguing thermoelectric properties promising for energy harvesting and cooling applications. However, thermoelectric transport associated with the Fermi arc topological surface states on topological Dirac semimetals remains less explored. In this work, we&#160;systematically examine thermoelectric transport in a series of topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Surprisingly, we&#160;find significantly enhanced Seebeck effect and anomalous Nernst effect at cryogenic temperatures when the Cd3As2 layer is thin. In particular, we&#160;observe a peak Seebeck coefficient of nearly 500&#160;&#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 and a corresponding thermoelectric power factor over 30&#160;mW&#160;K&#8722;2&#160;m&#8722;1 at 5&#160;K in a 25&#8208;nm&#8208;thick sample. Combining angle&#8208;dependent quantum oscillation analysis, magnetothermoelectric measurement, transport modeling and first&#8208;principles simulation, we&#160;isolate the contributions from bulk and surface conducting channels and attribute the unusual thermoelectric properties to the topological surface states. Our&#160;analysis showcases the rich thermoelectric transport physics in quantum&#8208;confined topological Dirac semimetal thin films and suggests new routes to achieving high thermoelectric performance at cryogenic&#160;temperatures.

         <title>A Temperature Self&#8208;Adaptive Electrolyte for Wide&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The advancement of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is often hampered by the dendritic zinc growth and the parasitic side reactions between the zinc anode and the aqueous electrolyte, especially under extreme temperature conditions. This study unveils the performance decay mechanism of zinc anodes in harsh environments, characterized by &#8220;dead zinc&#8221; at low temperatures and aggravated hydrogen evolution and adverse by&#8208;products at elevated temperatures. To address these issues, a temperature self&#8208;adaptive electrolyte (TSAE), founded on the competitive coordination principle of co&#8208;solvent and anions, is introduced. This electrolyte exhibits a dynamic solvation capability, engendering an inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) at low temperatures while an organic alkyl ether&#8208; and alkyl carbonate&#8208;containing SEI at elevated temperatures. The self&#8208;adaptability of the electrolyte significantly enhances the performance of the zinc anode across a broad temperature range. A Zn//Zn symmetrical cell, based on the TSAE, showcases reversible plating/stripping exceeding 16,800 hours (&gt;700 days) at room temperature under 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, setting a record of lifespan.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advancement of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) is often hampered by the dendritic zinc growth and the parasitic side reactions between the zinc anode and the aqueous electrolyte, especially under extreme temperature conditions. This study unveils the performance decay mechanism of zinc anodes in harsh environments, characterized by &#8220;dead zinc&#8221; at low temperatures and aggravated hydrogen evolution and adverse by-products at elevated temperatures. To address these issues, a temperature self-adaptive electrolyte (TSAE), founded on the competitive coordination principle of co-solvent and anions, is introduced. This electrolyte exhibits a dynamic solvation capability, engendering an inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) at low temperatures while an organic alkyl ether- and alkyl carbonate-containing SEI at elevated temperatures. The self-adaptability of the electrolyte significantly enhances the performance of the zinc anode across a broad temperature range. A Zn//Zn symmetrical cell, based on the TSAE, showcases reversible plating/stripping exceeding 16,800 hours (&amp;gt;700 days) at room temperature under 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, setting a record of lifespan. Furthermore, the TSAE enables stable operation of the zinc full batteries across an ultra-wide temperature range of &#8722;35 to 75&#160;&#176;C. This work illuminates a pathway for optimizing AZIBs under extreme temperatures by fine-tuning the interfacial chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hidden Real Topology and Unusual Magnetoelectric Responses in Two&#8208;Dimensional Antiferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Recently, the real topology has been attracting widespread interest in two dimensions (2D). Here, based on first&#8208;principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we&#160;reveal the monolayer Cr2Se2O (ML&#8208;CrSeO) as the first material example of a 2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) real Chern insulator (RCI) with topologically protected corner states. Unlike previous RCIs, we&#160;find that the real topology of the ML&#8208;CrSeO is rooted in one certain mirror subsystem of the two spin channels, and can not be directly obtained from all the valence bands in each spin channel as commonly believed. In particular, due to antiferromagnetism, the corner modes in ML&#8208;CrSeO exhibit strong corner&#8208;contrasted spin polarization, leading to spin&#8208;corner coupling (SCC). This SCC enables a direct connection between spin space and real space. Consequently, large and switchable net magnetization can be induced in the ML&#8208;CrSeO nanodisk by electrostatic means, such as potential step and in&#8208;plane electric field, and the corresponding magnetoelectric responses behave like a sign function, distinguished from that of the conventional multiferroic materials. Our&#160;work considerably broadens the candidate range of RCI materials, and opens up a new direction for topo&#8208;spintronics and 2D AFM materials&#160;research.

         <title>Completely Inorganic Deep Eutectic Solvents for Efficient and Recyclable Liquid&#8208;Liquid Interface Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic acid&#8208;based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) as catalysts always suffer from weak stability and low recyclability due to the accumulation of organic oxidative products in the DES phase. Herein, we construct a completely inorganic deep eutectic solvent (IDES) ZnCl2/PA with zinc chloride (ZnCl2) and phosphoric acid (PA) as precursors to realize liquid&#8208;liquid interface catalysis for desulfurization of fuel and product self&#8208;separation for the first time. Owing to the inorganic nature, the organic oxidative products are accumulated at the interface between the IDES and fuel rather than the IDES phase. With this unique feature, the IDES can be reused for at least 15 times without any further treatment in oxidative desulfurization process, showing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cycle&#8208;regeneration stability of the IDES. Moreover, compared with the reported organic DESs, the IDES also reveals more attractive catalytic oxidative desulfurization performance. Experimental and theoretical studies indicate that the strong coordination Zn&#183;&#183;&#183;O = P and the strong adsorption energy between IDES and sulfides enhance the activation of H2O2 to reactive oxygen species, leading to the superior catalytic performance in oxidative desulfurization of fuel.

         <title>Self&#8208;reinforced MOF&#8208;based Nanogel Alleviates Osteoarthritis by Long&#8208;acting Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intra&#8208;articular injection of drugs is an effective strategy for osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. However, the complex microenvironment and limited joint space result in rapid clearance of drugs. Herein, a nanogel&#8208;based strategy was proposed for prolonged drug delivery and microenvironment remodeling. Nanogel was constructed through functionalization of hyaluronic acid (HA) by amide reaction on the surface of Kartogenin (KGN)&#8208;loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (denoted as KZIF@HA). Leveraging the inherent hydrophilicity of HA, KZIF@HA spontaneously forms nanogels, ensuring extended drug release in the OA microenvironment. KZIF@HA exhibits sustained drug release over one month, with low leakage risk from the joint cavity compared to KZIF, enhanced cartilage penetration, and reparative effects on chondrocytes. Notably, KGN released from KZIF@HA serves to promote extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion for hyaline cartilage regeneration. Zn2+ release reverses OA progression by promoting M2 macrophage polarization to establish an anti&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment. Ultimately, KZIF@HA facilitates cartilage regeneration and OA alleviation within three months. Transcriptome sequencing validates that KZIF@HA stimulates the polarization of M2 macrophages and secretes IL&#8208;10 to inhibit the JNK and ERK pathways, promoting chondrocytes recovery and enhancing ECM remodeling. This pioneering nanogel system offers new therapeutic opportunities for sustained drug release, presenting a significant stride in OA treatment strategies.

         <title>A Highly Deficient Medium&#8208;Entropy Perovskite Ceramic for Electromagnetic Interference Shielding under Harsh Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Materials that can provide reliable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in highly oxidative atmosphere at elevated temperature are indispensable in the fast&#8208;developing aerospace field. However, most of conductor&#8208;type EMI shielding materials such as metals can hardly withstand the high&#8208;temperature oxidation, while the conventional dielectric&#8208;type materials cannot offer sufficient shielding efficiency in gigahertz (GHz) frequencies. Here, we demonstrate a highly deficient medium&#8208;entropy (ME) perovskite ceramic as an efficient EMI shielding material in harsh environment. The synergistic effect of entropy stabilization and aliovalent substitution on A&#8208;site generate abnormally high concentration of Ti and O vacancies that is stable under high&#8208;temperature oxidation. Due to the clustering of vacancies, the highly deficient perovskite ceramic exhibits giant complex permittivity and polarization loss in GHz, leading to the specific EMI shielding effectiveness above 30&#160;dB/mm in X&#8208;band even after 100 hours of annealing at 1000&#160;&#176;C in air. Along with the low thermal conductivity, the aliovalent ME perovskite can serve as a bifunctional shielding material for applications in aircraft engines and reusable rockets.

         <title>A Lead&#8208;Free Ferroelectric 2D Dion&#8208;Jacobson Tin Iodide Perovskite</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic halide perovskites have emerged as a new class of 2D semiconductors with the potential to combine excellent optoelectronic properties with symmetry&#8208;enabled properties such as ferroelectricity. Although many lead&#8208;based ferroelectric 2D halide perovskites have been reported, there is yet to be a conclusive report of ferroelectricity in tin&#8208;based 2D perovskites. Here, we report the structures and properties of a new series of 2D Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) Sn perovskites: (4AMP)SnI4, (4AMP)(MA)Sn2I7, and (4AMP)(FA)Sn2I7 (4AMP = 4&#8208;(aminomethyl)piperidinium, MA = methylammonium, and FA = formamidinium). Structural characterization reveals that (4AMP)SnI4 is polar with in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarization whereas (4AMP)(MA)Sn2I7 and (4AMP)(FA)Sn2I7 are centrosymmetric. Furthermore, (4AMP)SnI4 displays second harmonic generation (SHG) and polarization&#8208;electric field hysteresis measurements confirm it is ferroelectric with a spontaneous polarization of 10.0 &#181;C cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. (4AMP)SnI4 transitions into a centrosymmetric structure above 367 K. As the first direct experimnetal observation of the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of a Sn&#8208;based 2D hybrid perovskite, this work opens up environmentally friendly 2D tin halide perovskites for ferroelectricity and other physical property studies.

         <title>Sterically Hindered Oleogel&#8208;Based Underwater Adhesive Enabled by Mesh&#8208;Tailoring Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Underwater adhesives hold significant relevance in daily life and numerous industrial applications. Despite considerable efforts, developing scalable, high&#8208;performance underwater adhesives through a simple and effective method remains a formidable challenge. This study presents a novel mesh&#8208;tailoring strategy for in situ, rapid, and ultrastrong oleogel&#8208;based underwater adhesives (OUA), which comprises a highly crosslinked polyurethane network with a matching mesh size (&#8764;2.22&#160;nm) that precisely entraps bio&#8208;based epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) molecules (&#8764;2.31&#160;nm) by steric hindrance effect. This oleogel exhibits unprecedented robust mechanical properties (&#8764;35&#160;MPa) and maintains stability under extreme conditions, including high temperatures (100&#160;&#176;C), high pressures (30&#160;MPa), and immersion in various solvents (water, ethanol, or ESO). In particular, this oleogel displays high hydrophobicity, rapid curing, and strong interface affinity, resulting in ultrahigh underwater adhesion strength (up to 2.13&#160;MPa) and exceptional substrate universality. Moreover, the remarkable environmental adaptability and stability of OUA enable its use in harsh aqueous environments, including acidic/alkaline, saline, and extreme temperature solutions. The comprehensive capabilities of the OUA underscore its potential for building underwater structures, repairing leaky containers, and sealing broken submarine pipelines. This research establishes the foundation for the designing of next&#8208;generation underwater adhesives and offers fresh perspectives for exploring oleogel&#8208;based materials.

         <title>8&#8208;inch Wafer&#8208;scale Epitaxial Monolayer MoS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;quality, and uniform monolayer MoS2 films are crucial for their applications in next&#8208;generation electronics and optoelectronics. Epitaxy is a mainstream technique for achieving high&#8208;quality MoS2 films and has been demonstrated at a wafer scale up to 4&#8208;inch. In this study, we report the epitaxial growth of 8&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale highly oriented monolayer MoS2 on sapphire with excellent spatial homogeneity, using a specially designed vertical chemical vapor deposition (VCVD) system. Field effect transistors (FETs) based on the as&#8208;grown 8&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale monolayer MoS2 film were fabricated and exhibited high performances, with an average mobility and an on/off ratio of 53.5 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 and 107, respectively. In addition, batch fabrication of logic devices and 11&#8208;stage ring oscillators were also demonstrated, showcasing excellent electrical functions. Our work may pave way of MoS2 in practical industry&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Photothermal CO2 Catalysis Towards the Synthesis of Solar fuel: from Material and Reactor Engineering to Techno&#8208;Economic Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon dioxide, a member of greenhouse gases, contributes significantly to maintaining a tolerable environment for all living species. However, with the development of modern society and the utilization of fossil fuels, the concentration of atmospheric CO2 has increased to 400&#160;ppm, resulting in a serious greenhouse effect. Thus, converting CO2 into valuable chemicals is highly desired, especially with renewable solar energy, which showed great potential with the manner of photothermal catalysis. In this review, recent advancements in photothermal CO2 conversion are discussed, including the design of catalysts, analysis of mechanisms, engineering of reactors, and the corresponding techno&#8208;economic analysis. A guideline for future investigation and the anthropogenic carbon cycle are provided.

         <title>Ultimately Adaptive Fluid Interfacial Phospholipid Membranes Unveiled Unanticipated High Cellular Mechanical Work</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ideally adaptive cellular scaffold is developed by decorating a fluid interface with phospholipid membranes. In contrast to conventional solid or hydrogel scaffolds, cell adhesion behaviors thereon follow an adaptive wetting regime with surprisingly high mechanical work, which highlights an analogy of cell adhesion behaviors and droplet wetting on surfaces with a low Young's modulus.








Abstract
Living cells actively interact biochemically and mechanically with the surrounding extracellular matrices (ECMs) and undergo dramatic morphological and dimensional transitions, concomitantly remodeling ECMs. However, there is no suitable method to quantitatively discuss the contribution of mechanical interactions in such mutually adaptive processes. Herein, a highly deformable &#8220;living&#8221; cellular scaffold is developed to evaluate overall mechanical energy transfer between cell and ECMs. It is based on the water&#8211;perfluorocarbon interface decorated with phospholipids bearing a cell&#8208;adhesive ligand and fluorescent tag. The bioinert nature of the phospholipid membranes prevents the formation of solid&#8208;like protein nanofilms at the fluid interface, enabling to visualize and quantify cellular mechanical work against the ultimately adaptive model ECM. A new cellular wetting regime is identified, wherein interface deformation proceeds to cell flattening, followed by its eventual restoration. The cellular mechanical work during this adaptive wetting process is one order of magnitude higher than those reported with&#160;conventional elastic platforms. The behavior of viscous liquid drops at the air&#8211;water interface can simulate cellular adaptive wetting, suggesting that overall viscoelasticity of the cell body predominates the emergent wetting regime and regulates mechanical output. Cellular&#8208;force&#8208;driven high&#8208;energy states on the adaptive platform can be useful for cell fate manipulation.

         <title>Work Function&#8208;Guided Electrocatalyst Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion reactions is crucial for advancing global energy sustainability. The design of catalysts based on their electronic properties (e.g., work function) has gained significant attention recently. Although numerous reviews on electrocatalysis have been provided, no such reports on work function&#8208;guided electrocatalyst design are available. Herein, we provide a comprehensive summary of the latest advancements in work function&#8208;guided electrocatalyst design for diverse electrochemical energy applications. This includes the development of work function&#8208;based catalytic activity descriptors, and the design of both monolithic and heterostructural catalysts. The measurement of work function is first discussed and the applications of work function&#8208;based catalytic activity descriptors for various reactions are fully analyzed. Subsequently, the work function&#8208;regulated material&#8208;electrolyte interfacial electron transfer (IET) is employed for monolithic catalyst design and methods for regulating the work function and optimizing the catalytic performance of catalysts are discussed. In addition, key strategies for tuning the work function&#8208;governed material&#8208;material IET in heterostructural catalyst design are examined. Finally, perspectives on work function determination, work function&#8208;based activity descriptors, and catalyst design are put forward to guide future research. This work paves the way to the work function&#8208;guided rational design of efficient electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.

         <title>Conjugated Polymer Heteroatom Engineering Enables High Detectivity Symmetric Ambipolar Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed high&#8208;performing ambipolar organic phototransistors (OPTs) can enable low&#8208;cost integrated circuits. Here, we demonstrate a heteroatom engineering approach to modify the electron affinity of a low band gap diketopyrrolopyrole (DPP) co&#8208;polymer, resulting in well&#8208;balanced charge transport, a more preferential edge&#8208;on orientation and higher crystallinity. Changing the comonomer heteroatom from sulfur (benzothiadiazole (BT)) to oxygen (benzooxadiazole (BO)) led to an increased electron affinity and introduced higher ambipolarity. Organic thin film transistors fabricated from the novel PDPP&#8208;BO exhibited charge carrier mobility of 0.6 and 0.3 cm2/Vs for electrons and holes, respectively. Due to the high sensitivity of the PDPP&#8208;based material and the balanced transport in PDPP&#8208;BO, we present its application as an NIR detector in the device architecture of organic phototransistors. By maintaining a high on/off ratio (9 &#215; 104), we show ambipolar OPTs with photoresponsivity of 69 and 99 A/W and specific detectivity of 8 &#215; 107 for the p&#8208;type operation and 4 &#215; 109 Jones for the n&#8208;type regime. The high symmetric NIR&#8208;ambipolar OPTs were also evaluated as ambipolar photo&#8208;inverters, and showed a 46% gain enhancement under illumination.

Organic thin film transistors fabricated from the novel PDPP-BO exhibited charge carrier mobility of 0.6 and 0.3 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/Vs for electrons and holes, respectively. Due to the high sensitivity of the PDPP-based material and the balanced transport in PDPP-BO, we present its application as an NIR detector in the device architecture of organic phototransistors. By maintaining a high on/off ratio (9 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), we show ambipolar OPTs with photoresponsivity of 69 and 99 A/W and specific detectivity of 8 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; for the p-type operation and 4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; Jones for the n-type regime. The high symmetric NIR-ambipolar OPTs were also evaluated as ambipolar photo-inverters, and showed a 46% gain enhancement under illumination.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Distinguishing Elements at the Sub&#8208;Nanometer Scale on the Surface of a High Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Materials in crystalline form possess translational symmetry (TS) when the unit cell is repeated in real space with long and short range orders. The periodic potential in the crystal regulates the electron wave function and results in unique band structures, which further define the physical properties of the materials. On the other hand, amorphous materials lack long range order TS due to the randomization of distances and arrangements between atoms, causing the electron wave function to lack a well&#8208;defined momentum. High entropy materials provide another way to break the TS by randomizing the potential strength at periodic atomic sites and provide unique physical and chemical properties. The configuration of the elemental distribution has a great impact on catalytic behavior and magnetic interactions in high entropy materials. Thus, it is critical to distinguish elements at the sub&#8208;nanometer scale to uncover the detailed correlations between the configuration of the elemental distribution and the material's properties. Here, we demonstrate the use of synchrotron X&#8208;ray scanning tunneling microscopy (SX&#8208;STM) with sub&#8208;nm scale resolution in identifying elements on the surface of a HEA. By examining the elemental fingerprints of X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) with a STM tip to enhance the spatial resolution, the elemental distribution on the surface of a HEA at a sub&#8208;nm scale was extracted. The results shown here open a pathway towards a quantitative understanding of high entropy materials and their correlated material properties.

Abstract
An ultra&#8208;thin quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte (QSE) with dendrite&#8208;inhibiting properties is a requirement for achieving high energy density quasi&#8208;solid lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, a 5.1&#160;&#956;m rigid QSE layer is directly designed on the cathode, in which Kevlar (poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalate)) nanofibres (KANFs) with negatively charged groups bridging metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) particles are served as a rigid skeleton and non&#8208;flammable deep eutectic solvent (DES) is selected to be encapsulated into the MOF channels, combined with in&#8208;situ polymerization to complete safe electrolyte system with high rigidness and stability. The constructed topology network demonstrates high rigidity (5.4&#160;GPa), high ionic conductivity (0.73 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), good ion&#8208;regulated properties, and improved structural stability, contributing to homogenized Li&#8208;ion flux, excellent dendrite suppression and prolong cyclic performance for LMB. Additionally, ion regulation influenced the Li deposition behavior, exhibiting a uniform morphology on the Li&#8208;metal surface after cycling. According to density&#8208;functional theory (DFT), KANFs bridging MOFs as hosts play a vital function in the free&#8208;state and fast diffusion dynamics of Li&#8208;ions. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing ultrathin robust electrolytes with a novel ionic conduction mode.

         <title>Dismantlable Coronated Nanoparticles for Coupling the Induction and Perception of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dismantlable coronated nanoparticles are fabricated as spatiotemporally controlled nanocarriers for coupling immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction to immune perception. The covalently cross&#8208;linked antibody corona shell disassembles in the tumor microenvironment, enables dual ICD modulations within tumor cells and on dendritic cell surfaces, promotes cytotoxic T cell recruitment, and sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint blockade in breast and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Therapy&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) can initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses for amplified anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. However, dying cell&#8208;released ICD signals are prone to being sequestered by the TIM&#8208;3 receptors on dendritic cell (DC) surfaces, preventing immune surveillance. Herein, dismantlable coronated nanoparticles (NPs) are fabricated as a type of spatiotemporally controlled nanocarriers for coupling tumor cell&#8208;mediated ICD induction to DC&#8208;mediated immune sensing. These NPs are loaded with an ICD inducer, mitoxantrone (MTO), and wrapped by a redox&#8208;labile anti&#8208;TIM&#8208;3 (&#945;TIM&#8208;3) antibody corona, forming a separable core&#8211;shell structure. The antibody corona disintegrates under high levels of extracellular reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment, exposing the MTO&#8208;loaded NP core for ICD induction and releasing functional &#945;TIM&#8208;3 molecules for DC sensitization. Systemic administration of the coronated NPs augments DC maturation, promotes cytotoxic T cell recruitment, enhances tumor susceptibility to immune checkpoint blockade, and prevents the side effects of MTO. This study develops a promising nanoplatform to unleash the potential of host immunity in cancer therapy.

         <title>Engineering Triple&#8208;Phase Interfaces around the Anode toward Practical Alkali Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali metal&#8211;air batteries promise ultrahigh gravimetric energy densities, while the inherent poor cycle stability hinders their practical application. In contrast to most previous efforts devoted to developing advanced air cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity, here the significance of addressing the challenge facing the complex triple&#8208;phase interface around the anodes from the perspective of materials system engineering is highlighted.








Abstract
Alkali metal&#8211;air batteries (AMABs) promise ultrahigh gravimetric energy densities, while the inherent poor cycle stability hinders their practical application. To address this challenge, most previous efforts are devoted to advancing the air cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity. Recent studies have underlined the solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas triple&#8208;phase interface around the anode can play far more significant roles than previously acknowledged by the scientific community. Besides the bottlenecks of uncontrollable dendrite growth and gas evolution in conventional alkali metal batteries, the corrosive gases, intermediate oxygen species, and redox mediators in AMABs cause more severe anode corrosion and structural collapse, posing greater challenges to the stabilization of the anode triple&#8208;phase interface. This work aims to provide a timely perspective on the anode interface engineering for durable AMABs. Taking the Li&#8211;air battery as a typical example, this critical review shows the latest developed anode stabilization strategies, including formulating electrolytes to build protective interphases, fabricating advanced anodes to improve their anti&#8208;corrosion capability, and designing functional separator to shield the corrosive species. Finally, the remaining scientific and technical issues from the prospects of anode interface engineering are highlighted, particularly materials system engineering, for the practical use of AMABs.

         <title>Room Temperature Polariton Condensation from Whispering Gallery Modes in CsPbBr3 Microplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The room temperature polariton condensate presents unprecedented prospects for the development of novel photonics devices. Using perovskite materials offers distinct advantages including ease of synthesis, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. Synthesizing CsPbBr3 microplatelets using low&#8208;cost capillary bridge methods enables not only the formation of whispering gallery modes, but also the onset of polariton condensation at low thresholds.








Abstract
Room temperature (RT) polariton condensate holds exceptional promise for revolutionizing various fields of science and technology, encompassing optoelectronics devices to quantum information processing. Using perovskite materials, like all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) single crystal, provides additional advantages, such as ease of synthesis, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. In this work, the formation of whispering gallery modes (WGM) in CsPbBr3 single crystals with controlled geometry is shown, synthesized using a low&#8208;cost and efficient capillary bridge method. Through the implementation of microplatelets geometry, enhanced optical properties and performance are achieved due to the presence of sharp edges and a uniform surface, effectively avoiding non&#8208;radiative scattering losses caused by defects. This allows not only to observe strong light matter coupling and formation of whispering gallery polaritons, but also to demonstrate the onset of polariton condensation at RT. This investigation not only contributes to the advancement of the knowledge concerning the exceptional optical properties of perovskite&#8208;based polariton systems, but also unveils prospects for the exploration of WGM polariton condensation within the framework of a 3D perovskite&#8208;based platform, working at RT. The unique characteristics of polariton condensate, including low excitation thresholds and ultrafast dynamics, open up unique opportunities for advancements in photonics and optoelectronics&#160;devices.

This investigation not only contributes to the advancement of the knowledge concerning the exceptional optical properties of perovskite-based polariton systems, but also unveils prospects for the exploration of WGM polariton condensation within the framework of a 3D perovskite-based platform, working at RT. The unique characteristics of polariton condensate, including low excitation thresholds and ultrafast dynamics, open up unique opportunities for advancements in photonics and optoelectronics&#160;devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Eliminating the Adverse Impact of Composition Modulation in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes toward Ultra&#8208;High Brightness and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The component modulation&#8208;induced ion doping of perovskite emitters and the underlying mechanism of the nature instability are revealed for FAPbI3&#8208;based NIR PeLEDs with excess organic halides. By eliminating adverse effects of the excessively incorporated organoammonium halides using a surface clean&#8208;assisted crosslinking strategy, a high efficiency of 23.6%, a high radiance of 964 W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, and an excellent half&#8208;lifetime of 106.1 h are achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
Excess ammonium halides as composition additives are widely employed in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), aiming to achieve high performance by controlling crystallinity and passivating defects. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of whether excess organoammonium components affect the film physical/electrical properties and the resultant device instability is still lacking. Here, the trade&#8208;off between the performance and stability in high&#8208;efficiency formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based PeLEDs with excess ammonium halides is pointed, and the underlying mechanism is explored. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies reveal that excess halide salt&#8208;induced ion&#8208;doping largely alters the PeLEDs properties (e.g., carrier injection, field&#8208;dependent ion&#8208;drifting, defect physics, and phase stability). A surface clean assisted cross&#8208;linking strategy is demonstrated to eliminate the adverse impact of composition modulation and boost the operational stability without sacrificing the efficiency, achieving a high efficiency of 23.6%, a high radiance of 964 W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 (The highest value for FAPbI3 based PeLEDs), and a prolong lifetime of 106.1 h at large direct current density (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), concurrently. The findings uncovered an important link between excess halide salts and the device performance, providing a guideline for rational design of stable, bright, and high efficiency PeLEDs.

         <title>In&#8208;Synthesis Se&#8208;Stabilization Enables Defect and Doping Engineering of HgTe Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;synthesis Se&#8208;stabilization strategy is developed for HgTe colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), enabling enhanced colloidal stability, doping tuning and improved passivation. This translated into greatly improved device performance and stability.








Abstract
Colloidal Quantum Dots (CQDs) of mercury telluride (HgTe) hold particular appeal for infrared photodetection due to their widely tunable infrared absorption and good compatibility with silicon electronics. While advances in surface chemistry have led to improved CQD solids, the chemical stability of HgTe material is not fully emphasized. In this study, it is aimed to address this issue and identifies a Se&#8208;stabilization strategy based on the surface coating of Se on HgTe CQDs via engineering in the precursor reactivity. The presence of Se&#8208;coating enables HgTe CQDs with improved colloidal stability, passivation, and enhanced degree of freedom in doping tuning. This enables the construction of optimized p&#8208;i&#8208;n HgTe CQD infrared photodetectors with an ultra&#8208;low dark current 3.26 &#215; 10&#8722;6 A&#160;cm&#8315;2 at &#8722;0.4&#160;V and room&#8208;temperature specific detectivity of 5.17 &#215; 1011 Jones at wavelength &#8776;2 um, approximately one order of magnitude improvement compared to that of the control device. The stabilizing effect of Se is well preserved in the thin film state, contributing to much improved device stability. The in&#8208;synthesis Se&#8208;stabilization strategy highlights the importance of the chemical stability of materials for the construction of semiconductor&#8208;grade CQD solids and may have important implications for other high&#8208;performance CQD optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Broadened Phase Boundary with Enhanced Amorphous Superconductivity in Pressurized In2Te5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to the Gibbs phase rule, the degree of freedom at conventional phase boundaries is 1 (F = 1). By introducing an intermediate amorphous phase, a rare crystalline&#8211;amorphous&#8211;crystalline transition is achieved and the sharp phase boundary is successfully expanded into a broad region (F = 2) in which the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is significantly enhanced.








Abstract
As an empirical tool in materials science and engineering, the iconic phase diagram owes its robustness and practicality to the topological characteristics rooted in the celebrated Gibbs phase law free variables (F) = components (C) &#8211; phases (P) + 2. When crossing the phase diagram boundary, the structure transition occurs abruptly, bringing about an instantaneous change in physical properties and limited controllability on the boundaries (F = 1). Here, the sharp phase boundary is expanded to an amorphous transition region (F = 2) by partially disrupting the long&#8208;range translational symmetry, leading to a sequential crystalline&#8211;amorphous&#8211;crystalline (CAC) transition in a pressurized In2Te5 single crystal. Through detailed in situ synchrotron diffraction, it is elucidated that the phase transition stems from the rotation of immobile blocks [In2Te2]2+, linked by hinge&#8208;like [Te3]2&#8722; trimers. Remarkably, within the amorphous region, the amorphous phase demonstrates a notable 25% increase of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), while the carrier concentration remains relatively constant. Furthermore, a theoretical framework is proposed revealing that the unconventional boost in amorphous superconductivity might be attributed to an intensified electron correlation, triggered by a disorder&#8208;augmented multifractal behavior. These findings underscore the potential of disorder and prompt further exploration of unforeseen phenomena on the phase boundaries.

         <title>A Glucose&#8208;Responsive Cannula for Automated and Electronics&#8208;Free Insulin Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a glucose&#8208;responsive cannula is presented for automated insulin delivery without the use of electronics. This cannula, composed of a resilient elastomer&#8208;hydrogel hybrid, changes its permeability in response to glucose levels. Tested in diabetic mice, it effectively maintains blood glucose levels within target ranges for &#8776;3&#160;d, offering a potential solution for user&#8208;centric insulin delivery.








Abstract
Automated delivery of insulin based on continuous glucose monitoring is revolutionizing the way insulin&#8208;dependent diabetes is treated. However, challenges remain for the widespread adoption of these systems, including the requirement of a separate glucose sensor, sophisticated electronics and algorithms, and the need for significant user input to operate these costly therapies. Herein, a user&#8208;centric glucose&#8208;responsive cannula is reported for electronics&#8208;free insulin delivery. The cannula&#8212;made from a tough, elastomer&#8208;hydrogel hybrid membrane formed through a one&#8208;pot solvent exchange method&#8212;changes permeability to release insulin rapidly upon physiologically relevant varying glucose levels, providing simple and automated insulin delivery with no additional hardware or software. Two prototypes of the cannula are evaluated in insulin&#8208;deficient diabetic mice. The first cannula&#8212;an ends&#8208;sealed, subcutaneously inserted prototype&#8212;normalizes blood glucose levels for 3&#160;d and controls postprandial glucose levels. The second, more translational version&#8212;a cannula with the distal end sealed and the proximal end connected to a transcutaneous injection port&#8212;likewise demonstrates tight, 3&#8208;d regulation of blood glucose levels when refilled twice daily. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study may aid in the development of &#8220;smart&#8221; cannulas and next&#8208;generation insulin therapies at a reduced burden&#8208;of&#8208;care toll and cost to end&#8208;users.

Abstract
This comprehensive review delves into the intricacies of the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting process, specifically focusing on the design, fabrication, and optimization of particle&#8208;based photoelectrodes for efficient green hydrogen production. These photoelectrodes, composed of semiconductor materials, potentially harness light energy and generate charge carriers, driving water oxidation and reduction reactions. The versatility of particle&#8208;based photoelectrodes as a platform for investigating and enhancing various semiconductor candidates is explored, particularly the emerging complex oxides with compelling charge transfer properties. However, the challenges presented by many factors influencing the performance and stability of these photoelectrodes, including particle size, shape, composition, morphology, surface modification, and electrode configuration, are highlighted. The review introduces the fundamental principles of semiconductor photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting, presents an exhaustive overview of different synthesis methods for semiconductor powders and their assembly into photoelectrodes, and discusses recent advances and challenges in photoelectrode material development. It concludes by offering promising strategies for improving photoelectrode performance and stability, such as the adoption of novel architectures and heterojunctions.

         <title>Robust Chemiresistive Behavior in Conductive Polymer/MOF Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described in this study is a hybridization strategy combining conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and polymers for improved gas sensing. Significant enhancements in sensor recovery kinetics, cycling stability, and dynamic range at room temperature are demonstrated. Mechanistic insights into energy band alignments and sorbate&#8211;analyte interactions reported here are promising toward future high&#8208;performance chemiresistors as well as novel electronic devices based on polymer/MOF composites.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for gas sensing but are often limited to single&#8208;use detection. A hybridization strategy is demonstrated synergistically deploying conductive MOFs (cMOFs) and conductive polymers (cPs) as two complementary mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors in high&#8208;performing stand&#8208;alone chemiresistors. This work presents significant improvement in i) sensor recovery kinetics, ii) cycling stability, and iii) dynamic range at room temperature. The effect of hybridization across well&#8208;studied cMOFs is demonstrated based on 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) and 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene (HITP) ligands with varied metal nodes (Co, Cu, Ni). A comprehensive mechanistic study is conducted to relate energy band alignments at the heterojunctions between the MOFs and the polymer with sensing thermodynamics and binding kinetics. The findings reveal that hole enrichment of the cMOF component upon hybridization leads to selective enhancement in desorption kinetics, enabling significantly improved sensor recovery at room temperature, and thus long&#8208;term response retention. This mechanism is further supported by density functional theory calculations on sorbate&#8211;analyte interactions. It is also found that alloying cPs and cMOFs enables facile thin film co&#8208;processing and device integration, potentially unlocking the use of these hybrid conductors in diverse electronic applications.

         <title>A Versatile Synthesis Platform Based on Polymer Cubosomes for a Library of Highly Ordered Nanoporous Metal Oxides Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of ordered nanoporous metal oxide particles with different compositions and periodicity is designed and synthesized via a general and flexible polymer cubosome templating strategy. Due to their favorable porosity and rich active sites, the obtained nanoporous metal oxides, for example, tungsten oxides exhibit excellent gas sensing performances to low&#8208;concentration H2S.








Abstract
Polymer cubosomes (PCs) have well&#8208;defined inverse bicontinuous cubic mesophases formed by amphiphilic block copolymer bilayers. The open hydrophilic channels, large periods, and robust physical properties of PCs are advantageous to many host&#8211;guest interactions and yet not fully exploited, especially in the fields of functional nanomaterials. Here, the self&#8208;assembly of poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene block copolymers is systematically investigated and a series of robust PCs is developed via a cosolvent method. Ordered nanoporous metal oxide particles are obtained by selectively filling the hydrophilic channels of PCs via an impregnation strategy, followed by a two&#8208;step thermal treatment. Based on this versatile PC platform, the general synthesis of a library of ordered porous particles with different pore structures 3&#175;$\bar{3}$ 3&#175;$\bar{3}$, tunable large pore size (18&#8211;78&#160;nm), high specific surface areas (up to 123.3&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 for WO3) and diverse framework compositions, such as transition and non&#8208;transition metal oxides, rare earth chloride oxides, perovskite, pyrochlore, and high&#8208;entropy metal oxides is demonstrated. As typical materials obtained via this method, ordered porous WO3 particles have the advantages of open continuous structure and semiconducting properties, thus showing superior gas sensing performances toward hydrogen sulfide.

         <title>Fluorinated Organic Polymers for Cancer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In the realm of cancer therapy, the spotlight is on nanoscale pharmaceutical delivery systems, especially polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles, for their enhanced drug dissolution, extended presence in the bloodstream, and precision targeting achieved via surface engineering. Leveraging the amplified permeation and retention phenomenon, these systems concentrate therapeutic agents within tumor tissues. Nonetheless, the hurdles of systemic toxicity, biological barriers, and compatibility with living systems persist. Fluorinated polymers, distinguished by their chemical idiosyncrasies, are poised for extensive biomedical applications, notably in stabilizing drug metabolism, augmenting lipophilicity, and optimizing bioavailability. Material science heralds the advent of fluorinated polymers that, by integrating fluorine atoms, unveil a suite of drug delivery merits: the hydrophobic traits of fluorinated alkyl chains ward off lipid or protein disruption, the carbon&#8208;fluorine bond's stability extends the drug's lifecycle in the system, and a lower alkalinity coupled with a diminished ionic charge bolsters the drug's ability to traverse cellular membranes. This comprehensive review delves into the utilization of fluorinated polymers for oncological pharmacotherapy, elucidating their molecular architecture, synthetic pathways, and functional attributes, alongside an exploration of their empirical strengths and the quandaries they encounter in both experimental and clinical settings.
