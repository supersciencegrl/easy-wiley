         <title>Carboxylating Elastomer via Thiol&#8208;Ene Click Reaction to Improve Miscibility with Conjugated Polymers for Mechanically Robust Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy to enhance the miscibility between the conjugated polymer PM6 and the insulating elastomer styrene&#8208;butadiene&#8208;styrene (SBS) has been developed by incorporating carboxyl groups into SBS (SBS&#8208;COOH), resulting in optimized mechanical properties and morphology of PM6. A remarkable power conversion efficiency of 19.04% is achieved for organic solar cells with 5% SBS&#8208;COOH (PM6:L8&#8208;BO system), outperforming devices of PM6:L8&#8208;BO without or with SBS.








Abstract
Incorporating flexible insulating polymers is a straightforward strategy to enhance the mechanical properties of rigid conjugated polymers, enabling their use in flexible electronic devices. However, maintaining electronic characteristics simultaneously is challenging due to the poor miscibility between insulating polymers and conjugated polymers. This study introduces the carboxylation of insulating polymers as an effective strategy to enhance miscibility with conjugated polymers via surface energy modulation and hydrogen bonding. The carboxylated elastomer, synthesized via a thiol&#8208;ene click reaction, closely matches the surface energy of the conjugated polymer. This significantly improves the mechanical properties, achieving a high crack&#8208;onset strain of 21.48%, surpassing that (5.93%) of the unmodified elastomer:conjugated polymer blend. Upon incorporating the carboxylated elastomer into PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based organic solar cells, an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.04% is attained, which top&#8208;performs among insulating polymer&#8208;incorporated devices and outperforms devices with unmodified elastomer or neat PM6:L8&#8208;BO. The superior efficiency is attributed to the optimized microstructures and enhanced crystallinity for efficient and balanced charge transport, and suppressed charge recombination. Furthermore, flexible devices with 5% carboxylated elastomer exhibit superior mechanical stability, retaining &#8776;88.9% of the initial efficiency after 40&#160;000 bending cycles at a 1&#160;mm radius, surpassing &#8776;83.5% for devices with 5% unmodified elastomer.

         <title>Paraffin&#8208;Enabled Superlattice Customization for a Photostimulated Gradient&#8208;Responsive Artificial Reflex Arc</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of photostimulated&#8208;motion artificial reflex arcs &#8212; a neural circuit inspired by light&#8208;driven motion reflexes &#8212; holds significant promises for advancements in robotic perception, navigation, and motion control. However, the fabrication of such systems, especially those that accommodate multiple actions and exhibit gradient responses, remains challenging. Here, we developed a gradient&#8208;responsive photostimulated&#8208;motion artificial reflex arc by integrating a programmable and tunable photoreceptor based on folded MoS2 at different twist angles. The twisted folded bilayer MoS2 used as photoreceptors could be customized via the transfer technique using patternable paraffin, where the twist angle and fold&#8208;line could be controlled. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity was 3.7 times higher at a twist angle of 29&#176; compared to that at 0&#176;, showing a monotonically decreasing indirect bandgap. Through tunable interlayer carrier transport, photoreceptors fabricated using folded bilayer MoS2 at different twist angles demonstrated gradient response time, enabling the photostimulated&#8208;motion artificial reflex arc for multi&#8208;action responses. They were transformed to digital command flow and studied via machine learning to control the gestures of a robotic hand, showing a prototype of photostimulated gradient&#8208;responsive artificial reflex arcs for the first time. Our work provides a unique idea for developing intelligent soft robots and next&#8208;generation human&#8208;computer interfaces.

         <title>Materiobiomodulated ROS Therapy for De Novo Hair Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hair loss is characterized by the inability of hair follicles to enter the telogen&#8208;anagen transition (TAT) and lack of de novo hair follicles (HFs). Current pharmaceutical therapies and surgical modalities have been largely limited to regulating hair regrowth efficiently without side effects and lacking treatment compliance. Here we propose a materiobiomodulation therapy (MBMT), wherein polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles with redox activity can be modulated to have a stoichiometric ROS (H2O2) donating ability. These nanoparticles can intracellularly deliver ROS with high&#8208;efficiency via the clathrin&#8208;dependent endocytosis process. Utilizing homozygote transgenic HyPerion (a genetically&#8208;encoded H2O2 biosensor) mice, we also achieve in vivo dynamic monitoring of intracellular H2O2 elevation induced by ROS donators. Subcutaneous administration with ROS donators results in rapid onset of TAT and subsequent hair regrowth with a specific ROS &#8220;hormesis effect&#8221;. Mechanistically, ROS activate &#946;&#8208;catenin&#8208;dependent Wnt signaling, upregulating hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) expression. We further developed a microneedles patch for transdermal ROS delivery, demonstrating long&#8208;term, low&#8208;dose ROS release. Unlike photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT), MBMT requires no external stimuli, providing a convenient and efficient approach for clinical hair loss treatment. This material&#8208;HF communication implicates new avenues in HF&#8208;related diseases, achieving targeted ROS delivery with minimal side effects.

         <title>Strategies to Modulate the Copper Oxidation State Toward Selective C2+ Production in the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to form value&#8208;added chemicals has received considerable attention in recent years. Copper (Cu) has been recognized as the only element capable of electro&#8208;reducing CO2 into hydrocarbons with two or more carbon atoms (C2+), but the low product selectivity of the Cu&#8208;based catalyst remains a major technological challenge to overcome. Therefore, identification of the structural features of Cu&#8208;based catalysts is of great importance for the highly selective production of C2+ products (ethylene, ethanol, n&#8208;propanol, etc.), and the oxidation state of Cu species in the catalysts has been found critical to the catalyst performance. This review introduces recent efforts to fine&#8208;tune the oxidation state of Cu to increase carbon capture and produce specific C2+ compounds, with the intention of greatly expediting the advance in the catalyst designs. It also points to the remaining challenges and fruitful research directions for the development of Cu&#8208;based catalysts that could shape the practical CO2 reduction technology.

         <title>High&#8208;Safety Electrolytes with an Anion&#8208;Rich Solvation Structure Tuned by Difluorinated Cations for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) must offer high safety, high&#8208;voltage resistance and a long lifespan. Electrolyte engineering is a facile yet effective strategy to tailor the interfacial chemistry of LMBs, In particular, the solvation structure and derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are crucial for a satisfactory battery performance. Herein, a novel middle&#8208;concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (MCILE) with an anion&#8208;rich solvation structure tuned by difluorinated cations is demonstrated to achieve ultra&#8208;high without thermal runaway, high&#8208;voltage stability, high&#8208;temperature stability and excellent ternary&#8208;cathode compatibility. Novel gem&#8208;difluorinated cations firstly synthesised for prestoring fluorine on positively charged species, not only preferentially adsorb in the inner&#8208;Helmholtz layers, but also participate in regulating the Li+ solvation structure, resulting in a robust interphase. Moreover, these weak interactions in the Li+ solvation structure including anions&#8208;solvents and ionic liquids (IL) cations&#8208;solvents pairs are firstly revealed via two&#8208;dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) in the bulk electrolyte, which are beneficial for promoting an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure and the desolvation process demonstrated by theoretical calculation. Benefiting from the unique anion&#8208;rich solvation structure, a stable hetero SEI structure with a fluorine&#8208;rich mixed outer layer and an inorganic inner layer is obtained. The designed MCILE exhibits compatibility with Li metal anode and the high&#8208;voltage ternary&#8208;cathode at high temperatures (60&#160;&#176;C) and high voltages (4.5&#160;V). This work provides a new approach for regulating the solvation structure and electrode interphase chemistry of LMBs via difluorinated IL cations.

         <title>Blood&#8208;Brain Barrier&#8208;Penetrating and Lesion&#8208;Targeting Nanoplatforms Inspired by the Pathophysiological Features for Synergistic Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>

Abstract
Ischemic stroke is a dreadful vascular disorder that poses enormous threats to the public health. Due to its complicated pathophysiological features, current treatment options after ischemic stroke attack remains unsatisfactory. Insufficient drug delivery to ischemic lesions impeded by the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) largely limits the therapeutic efficacy of most anti&#8208;stroke agents. Herein, inspired by the rapid BBB penetrability of 4T1 tumor cells upon their brain metastasis and natural roles of platelet in targeting injured vasculatures, a bio&#8208;derived nanojacket was developed by fusing 4T1 tumor cell membrane with platelet membrane, which further clothed on the surface of paeonol and polymetformin&#8208;loaded liposome to obtain biomimetic nanoplatforms (PP@PCL) for ischemic stroke treatment. The designed PP@PCL could remarkably alleviate ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury by efficiently targeting ischemic lesion, preventing neuroinflammation, scavenging excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), reprogramming microglia phenotypes, and promoting angiogenesis due to the synergistic therapeutic mechanisms that anchor the pathophysiological characteristics of ischemic stroke. As a result, PP@PCL exerted desirable therapeutic efficacy in injured PC12 neuronal cells and rat model of ischemic stroke, which significantly attenuated neuronal apoptosis, reduced infarct volume, and recovered neurological functions, bringing new insights into exploiting promising treatment strategies for cerebral ischemic stroke management.

         <title>Tempospatially Confined Catalytic Membranes for Advanced Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The application of homogeneous catalysts in water remediation is limited by factors such as their excessive chemical and energy input, weak regenerability, and potential leaching. Heterogeneous catalytic membranes (CMs) offer a new approach to facilitating efficient, selective, and continuous pollutant degradation. Thus, integrating membranes and continuous filtration with heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes can promote thermodynamic and kinetic mass transfers in spatially confined intrapores and facilitate diffusion&#8208;reaction processes. Despite the remarkable advantages of heterogeneous CMs, their engineering application has been practically restricted due to the fuzzy design criteria for specific applications. Herein, we critically review the recent advances in CMs for advanced water remediation and propose the design flow for tempospatially confined CMs. Further, we review state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CM materials and their catalytic mechanisms, after which we emphasize the tempospatial confinement mechanisms comprising the nanoconfinement effect, interface effect, and kinetic mass transfer, thus clarifying their roles in the construction and performance optimization of CMs. Additionally, we summarize the fabrication methods for CMs based on their catalysts and pore sizes and present an overview of their application and performance evaluations. Finally, we present future directions for CMs in materials research and water treatment.

         <title>Dilute Nanocomposites: Tuning Polymer Chain Local Nanostructures To Enhance Dielectric Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dielectric polymers possessing high energy, power density and low losses over a broad temperature range are of great interest for many electronic and electric devices and systems. Nanocomposites in which high electric constant (high K) nanofillers at high volume loading (&gt; 10 volume percent, 10 vol%) are admixed with polymer matrix have been investigated for many decades, aiming at enhancing the dielectric performance, but with limited success. In 2017, it was discovered that reducing nanofiller loading to less than 0.5 vol% in high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers can lead to marked enhancement in dielectric performance. Here, we review the discoveries and advances of this unconventional approach to enhance dielectric performance of polymers. The experimental studies uncovered that nanofillers can lead to polymer nanostructure changes over distances larger than 100&#160;nm from nanofiller surfaces. Experimental and modeling results showed that introducing free&#8208;volume locally in high temperature dielectric polymers can reduce the constraints of glass matrix on dipoles in polymers, leading to enhanced dielectric constant K without affecting dielectric breakdown. In addition, low&#8208;K inorganic nanofillers at low&#8208;volume loading can also serve as deep traps for mobile charges, lowering the conduction losses and increasing the breakdown strength. The dilute nanocomposites provide a new avenue for designing dielectric polymers with high dielectric constant, minimal conduction and dielectric losses, and robust breakdown fields, thus achieving high energy and power density and low loss for operation over a broad temperature regime.

         <title>Quantifying Dielectric Material Charge Trapping and De&#8208;Trapping Ability Via Ultra&#8208;Fast Charge Self&#8208;Injection Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an ultra&#8208;fast charge self&#8208;injection technique based on the air breakdown effect and introduces a general standard method to quantify traditional triboelectric materials' charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping effects.








Abstract
Recently, utilizing the air breakdown effect in the charge excitation strategy proves as an efficient charge injection technique to increase the surface charge density of dielectric polymers for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, quantitative characterization of the ability of dielectric polymers to trap reverse charges and the effect on the startup time of secondary self&#8208;charge excitation (SSCE) are essential for extensive applications. Here, an ultra&#8208;fast charge self&#8208;injection technique based on a self&#8208;charge excitation strategy is proposed, and a standard method to quantify the charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping abilities of 23 traditional tribo&#8208;materials is introduced. Further, the relationship among the distribution of dielectric intrinsic deep, shallow trap states, and transportation of trapped charges is systematically analyzed in this article. It shows that the de&#8208;trapping rate of charges directly determines the reactivation and failure of SSCE. Last, independent of TENG contact efficiency, an ultra&#8208;high charge density of 2.67 mC m&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;fast startup time of SSCE are obtained using a 15&#160;&#181;m poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) film, breaking the historical record for material modification. As a standard for material selection, this work quantifies the charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping ability of the triboelectric dielectric series and provides insights for understanding the charge transport in dielectrics.

         <title>Tailoring Built&#8208;In Electric Field in a Self&#8208;Assembled Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework/MXene Nanocomposites for Microwave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study shows that self&#8208;assembled zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8211;MXene nanocomposites, featuring tunable built&#8208;in electric field, exhibit outstanding microwave absorption performance (reflection loss (RLmin) = &#8722;47.35 dB and effective absorption bandwidth (fE) = 6.32 GHz). This innovative model system provides insights into interfacial polarization mechanisms and introduces a pioneering approach to developing electromagnetic functional materials through spatial charge heterointerface engineering.








Abstract
Heterointerface engineering, which plays a pivotal role in developing advanced microwave&#8208;absorbing materials, is employed to design zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)&#8211;MXene nanocomposites. The ZIF&#8211;MXene composites are prepared by electrostatic self&#8208;assembly of negatively charged titanium carbide MXene flakes and positively charged Co&#8208;containing ZIF nanomaterials. This approach effectively creates abundant Mott&#8211;Schottky heterointerfaces exhibiting a robust built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) effect, as evidenced by experimental and theoretical analyses, leading to a notable attenuation of electromagnetic energy. Systematic manipulation of the BIEF&#8208;exhibiting heterointerface, achieved through topological modulation of the ZIF, proficiently alters charge separation, facilitates electron migration, and ultimately enhances polarization relaxation loss, resulting in exceptional electromagnetic wave absorption performance (reflection loss RLmin = &#8722;47.35 dB and effective absorption bandwidth fE = 6.32 GHz). The present study demonstrates an innovative model system for elucidating the interfacial polarization mechanisms and pioneers a novel approach to developing functional materials with electromagnetic characteristics through spatial charge engineering.

         <title>Multimodal Soft Robotic Actuation and Locomotion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft robots are a promising direction to create machines capable of complex motion observed in living creatures. Designing soft actuators that perform a combination of multiple actuation modalities allows them to perform intricate tasks. Then, applying multimodal actuators into soft robotics is conducive toward developing robots with multimodal gaits of locomotion that adapt to various environments for real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Diverse and adaptable modes of complex motion observed at different scales in living creatures are challenging to reproduce in robotic systems. Achieving dexterous movement in conventional robots can be difficult due to the many limitations of applying rigid materials. Robots based on soft materials are inherently deformable, compliant, adaptable, and adjustable, making soft robotics conducive to creating machines with complicated actuation and motion gaits. This review examines the mechanisms and modalities of actuation deformation in materials that respond to various stimuli. Then, strategies based on composite materials are considered to build toward actuators that combine multiple actuation modes for sophisticated movements. Examples across literature illustrate the development of soft actuators as free&#8208;moving, entirely soft&#8208;bodied robots with multiple locomotion gaits via careful manipulation of external stimuli. The review further highlights how the application of soft functional materials into robots with rigid components further enhances their locomotive abilities. Finally, taking advantage of the shape&#8208;morphing properties of soft materials, reconfigurable soft robots have shown the capacity for adaptive gaits that enable transition across environments with different locomotive modes for optimal efficiency. Overall, soft materials enable varied multimodal motion in actuators and robots, positioning soft robotics to make real&#8208;world applications for intricate and challenging tasks.

         <title>A Hybrid Pulsed Laser Deposition Approach to Grow Thin Films of Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epitaxial growth of vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials is challenging due to differences in the reactivity, and surface adatom sticking and mobility. A novel approach &#8212;hybrid pulsed laser deposition&#8212;wherein an organosulfur precursor delivery is combined with pulsed laser deposition is used to grow several sulfides as epitaxial or textured thin films with superior crystallinity compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. 








Abstract
Vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials such as transition metal chalcogenides have emerged as electronic, photonic, and quantum materials with scientific and technological importance. However, epitaxial growth of vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched materials are challenging due to differences in the reactivity, sticking coefficient, and surface adatom mobility of the mismatched species constituting the material, especially sulfur containing compounds. Here, a novel approach is reported to grow chalcogenides&#8212;hybrid pulsed laser deposition&#8212;wherein an organosulfur precursor is used as a sulfur source in conjunction with pulsed laser deposition to regulate the stoichiometry of the deposited films. Epitaxial or textured thin films of sulfides with variety of structure and chemistry such as alkaline metal chalcogenides, main group chalcogenides, transition metal chalcogenides, and chalcogenide perovskites are demonstrated, and structural characterization reveal improvement in thin film crystallinity, and surface and interface roughness compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The growth method can be broadened to other vapor&#8208;pressure mismatched chalcogenides such as selenides and tellurides. This work opens up opportunities for broader epitaxial growth of chalcogenides, especially sulfide&#8208;based thin film technological applications.

         <title>Isomerization of Benzothiadiazole Yields a Promising Polymer Donor and Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency of 19.0%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomerization of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole to 1,2,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (iBT) in polymers can concurrently improve photon harvest, suppress nonradiative energy loss, and increase charge mobility. Consequently, the organic solar cells (OSCs) made with polymer PiBT donor and Y6 acceptor achieve efficiency of 19.0%, which is one of the highest efficiencies in binary OSCs. Polymer PiBT does broaden the family of efficient polymer donors.








Abstract
The exploration of high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donors remains critical to achieve high&#8208;efficiency nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) beyond current thresholds. Herein, the 1,2,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (iBT), which is an isomer of 2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole (BT), is used to design wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor PiBT. The PiBT&#8208;based solar cells reach efficiency of 19.0%, which is one of the highest efficiencies in binary OSCs. Systemic studies show that isomerization of BT to iBT can finely regulate the polymers&#8217; photoelectric properties including i) increasing the extinction coefficient and photon harvest, ii) downshifting the highest occupied molecular orbital energy levels, iii) improving the coplanarity of polymer backbones, iv) offering good thermodynamic miscibility with acceptors. Consequently, the PiBT:Y6 bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device simultaneously reaches advantageous nanoscale morphology, efficient exciton generation and dissociation, fast charge transportation, and suppressed charge recombination, leading to larger VOC of 0.87&#160;V, higher JSC of 28.2 mA cm&#8722;2, greater fill factor of 77.3%, and thus higher efficiency of 19.0%, while the analog&#8208;PBT&#8208;based OSCs reach efficiency of only 12.9%. Moreover, the key intermediate iBT can be easily afforded from industry chemicals via two&#8208;step procedure. Overall, this contribution highlights that iBT is a promising motif for designing high&#8208;performance polymer donors.

         <title>Ferredoxin&#8208;Inspired Design of S&#8208;Synergized Fe&#8208;Fe Dual&#8208;Metal Center Catalysts for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal center catalysts (DMCs) have shown the ability to enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) owing to their distinctive structural configurations. However, the precise modulation of electronic structure and the in&#8208;depth understanding of synergistic mechanisms between dual metal sites of DMCs at the atomic level remain challenging. Herein, mimicking the ferredoxin, we strategically design and fabricate an Fe&#8208;based DMCs (Fe2N6&#8208;S), in which additional Fe and S sites were synchronously installed near the Fe sites and serve as &#8220;dual modulators&#8221; for coarse&#8208; and fine&#8208;tuning of the electronic modulation, respectively. The as&#8208;prepared Fe2N6&#8208;S catalyst exhibits enhanced ORR activity and outstanding Zn&#8208;air battery performance compared to the conventional single Fe site catalysts. The theoretical and experimental results reveal that introducing the second metal Fe creates a dual adsorption site that alters the O2 adsorption configuration and effectively activates the O&#8208;O bond, while the synergistic effect of dual Fe sites results in the downward shift of the d&#8208;band center, facilitating the release of OH*. Additionally, local electronic engineering of heteroatom S for Fe sites further facilitates the formation of the rate&#8208;determining step OOH*, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.

         <title>Triboelectric Energy Harvesting from Highly Conjugated Fused Aromatic Ladder Structure Under Extreme Environmental Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;fused aromatic ladder (FAL) structure is developed as a tribo&#8208;positive material for triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). The 3D&#8208;FAL offers high specific surface area and porosity, good physicochemical stability, and tunable electronic properties. As a result, the 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG demonstrates high performance and stability under harsh operating conditions.








Abstract
Practical application of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) has been challenging, particularly, under harsh environmental conditions. This work proposes a novel 3D&#8208;fused aromatic ladder (FAL) structure as a tribo&#8208;positive material for TENGs, to address these challenges. The 3D&#8208;FAL offers a unique materials engineering platform for tailored properties, such as high specific surface area and porosity, good thermal and mechanical stability, and tunable electronic properties. The fabricated 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG reaches a maximum peak power density of 451.2 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at 5 Hz frequency. More importantly, the 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG maintains stable output performance under harsh operating environments, over wide temperature (&#8722;45&#8211;100&#160;&#176;C) and humidity ranges (8.3&#8211;96.7% RH), representing the development of novel FAL for sustainable energy generation under challenging environmental conditions. Furthermore, the 3D&#8208;FAL&#8208;based TENG proves to be a promising device for a speed monitoring system engaging reconstruction in virtual reality in a snowy environment.

Self&#8208;healing hydrogels (SHHs) can endow soft bioelectronics with skin&#8208;mimic function, i.e. repairing their physical, electrical and chemical&#160;properties after damage, which improves the&#160;device durability, reliability, and longevity. This review discusses recent advances in SHHs, from the self&#8208;healing mechanisms to a summary of various SHH&#8208;based bioelectronics, and proposes the challenges and prospects. It is expected to expedite the research and applications of SHHs for various self&#8208;healing bioelectronics.

Abstract
Hydrogels have emerged as powerful building blocks to develop various soft bioelectronics because of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, superior bio&#8208;compatibility, the ability to conduct both electrons and ions, and multiple stimuli&#8208;responsiveness. However, hydrogels are vulnerable to mechanical damage, which limits their usage in developing durable hydrogel&#8208;based bioelectronics. Self&#8208;healing hydrogels aim to endow bioelectronics with the property of repairing specific functions after mechanical failure, thus improving their durability, reliability, and longevity. This review discusses recent advances in self&#8208;healing hydrogels, from the self&#8208;healing mechanisms, material chemistry, and strategies for multiple properties improvement of hydrogel materials, to the design, fabrication, and applications of various hydrogel&#8208;based bioelectronics, including wearable physical and biochemical sensors, supercapacitors, flexible display devices, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), implantable bioelectronics, etc. Furthermore, the persisting challenges hampering the development of self&#8208;healing hydrogel bioelectronics and their prospects are proposed. This review is expected to expedite the research and applications of self&#8208;healing hydrogels for various self&#8208;healing bioelectronics.

         <title>Topological Analysis and Structural Determination of 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure of covalent organic frameworks can be seen as periodic nets. First, some basic concepts about periodic nets and topology are introduced, and then the topological rules of reported 3D COFs are analyzed and summarized. Furthermore, the structural determination methods of 3D COFs is described, and finally, some prospects toward the structural problem of 3D COFs are proposed.








Abstract
3D covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) constitute a new type of crystalline materials that consist of a range of porous structures with numerous applications in the fields of adsorption, separation, and catalysis. However, because of the complexity of the three&#8208;periodic net structure, it is desirable to develop a thorough structural comprehension, along with a means to precisely determine the actual structure. Indeed, such advancements would considerably contribute to the rational design and application of 3D COFs. In this review, the reported topologies of 3D COFs are introduced and categorized according to the configurations of their building blocks, and a comprehensive overview of diffraction&#8208;based structural determination methods is provided. The current challenges and future prospects for these materials will also be discussed.

         <title>Stretchable Device for Simultaneous Measurements of Contractility and Electrophysiology of Neuromuscular Tissue in the Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable electrode made from poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is demonstrated for simultaneous monitoring of electrical and mechanical responses in dynamic neuromuscular gastrointestinal tissues. The devices are fabricated using shadow masks and solution&#8208;processing techniques, providing a faster and simpler process than traditional lithography.








Abstract
Devices interfacing with biological tissues can provide valuable insights into function, disease, and metabolism through electrical and mechanical signals. However, certain neuromuscular tissues, like those in the gastrointestinal tract, undergo significant strains of up to 40%. Conventional inextensible devices cannot capture the dynamic responses in these tissues. This study introduces electrodes made from poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that enable simultaneous monitoring of electrical and mechanical responses of gut tissue. The soft PDMS layers conform to tissue surfaces during gastrointestinal movement. Dopants, including Capstone FS&#8208;30 and polyethylene glycol, are explored to enhance the conductivity, electrical sensitivity to strain, and stability of the PEDOT:PSS. The devices are fabricated using shadow masks and solution&#8208;processing techniques, providing a faster and simpler process than traditional clean&#8208;room&#8208;based lithography. Tested on ex vivo mouse colon and human stomach, the device recorded voltage changes of up to 300 &#181;V during contraction and distension consistent with muscle activity, while simultaneously recording resistance changes of up to 150% due to mechanical strain. These devices detect and respond to chemical stimulants and blockers, and can induce contractions through electrical stimulation. They hold great potential for studying and treating complex disorders like irritable bowel syndrome and gastroparesis.

         <title>Probing the Strain Direction&#8208;Dependent Nonmonotonic Optical Bandgap Modulation of Layered Violet Phosphorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonmonotonic optical bandgap modulation is proven to exist in violet phosphorus nanosheets by photoluminescence, and the modulation rates enter a good agreement with the theoretical values. The underlying mechanism is clarified by first&#8208;principle calculations that the strain&#8208;induced asymmetric distribution of conduction band minimum wavefunctions plays a crucial role in the nonmonotonic modulation. 








Abstract
Recent theoretical investigations have well&#8208;predicted strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical band gap variations in low&#8208;dimensional materials. However, few two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are experimentally confirmed to exhibit nonmonotonic optical band gap variation under varying strain. Here, a strain&#8208;induced nonmonotonic optical bandgap variation in violet phosphorus (VP) nanosheets is observed, as evidenced by photoluminescence spectroscopy, which is reported in a few other 2D materials in knowledge. The optical bandgap variations are characterized to show the modulation rates of 41 and &#8722;24 meV/% with compression and tensile strains, respectively. Remarkably, first&#8208;principle calculations predict and clarify the nonmonotonic modulation accurately, highlighting its relationship with the strain direction&#8208;dependent asymmetric distribution of conduction band minimum wavefunctions, demonstrating that this unique nonmonotonic optical bandgap modulation is determined by the distinctive crystal structure of VP. This work provides a deep insight into the design of 2D materials toward optoelectronic and photoelectrochemical applications via strain engineering.

         <title>Highly Stable Organic Molecular Porous Solid Electrolyte with One&#8208;Dimensional Ion Migration Channel for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8722;Oxygen Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic molecular porous solid cucurbit[7]uril as the solid&#8208;state electrolyte for stable and efficient solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. The 1D ion migration channel achieves the Li+ fast conduction and the noncovalent interactions facilitate the immobilization of anions, realizing Li+ uniform distribution, as well as endowing the solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries with superior rate capability and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8722;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) batteries have been widely recognized as one of the candidates for the next&#8208;generation of energy storage batteries. However, the development of solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries has been hindered by the lack of solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) with high ionic conductivity at room temperature, high Li+ transference number, and the high stability to air. Herein, the organic molecular porous solid cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) with one&#8208;dimensional (1D)&#160;ion migration channels is developed as the SSE for solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Taking advantage of the 1D ion migration channel for Li+ conduction, CB[7] SSE achieves high ionic conductivity (2.45&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the noncovalent interactions facilitated the immobilization of anions, realizing a high Li+ transference number (tLi+ = 0.81) and Li+ uniform distribution. The CB[7] SSE also shows a wide electrochemical stability window of 0&#8211;4.65&#160;V and high thermal stability and chemical stability, as well as realizes stable Li+ plating/stripping (more than 1000&#160;h at 0.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). As a result, the CB[7] SSE endows solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries with superior rate capability and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (up to 500&#160;h). This design strategy of CB[7] SSE paves the way for stable and efficient solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries toward practical applications.

Abstract
Age&#8208;related macular degeneration (AMD) disease has become a worldwide senile disease, and frequent intravitreal injection of anti&#8208;VEGF is the mainstream treatment in the clinic, which is associated with sight&#8208;threatening complications. Herein, nintedanib, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, and lutein, a potent antioxidant, could co&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles through multiple noncovalent interactions. Interestingly, the co&#8208;assembled lutein/nintedanib nanoparticles (L/N NPs) exhibited significantly improved stability and achieved long&#8208;term sustained release of two drugs for at least two months in mice. Interestingly, in rabbit eyeball with a more complete barrier system, the L/N NPs still successfully distributed in the retina and choroid for a month. In the laser&#8208;induced mouse choroidal neovascularization (CNV) model, the L/N NPs after a minimally invasive subconjunctival administration could successfully inhibit angiogenesis, chronic inflammation and scavenge oxidative stress, achieved comparable and even better therapeutic results to that of standard intravitreal injection of anti&#8208;VEGF. Therefore, the subconjunctival injection of L/N NPs with long&#8208;term sustained drug release behavior represents a promising and innovative strategy for AMD treatment. Such minimally invasive administration together with the ability to effectively inhibit angiogenesis, reduce inflammation, and counteract oxidative stress, holds great potential for improving patient outcomes and quality of life in those suffering from this debilitating eye condition.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Diffraction Correlation of Quantum Emitters and Local Strain Fields in Strain&#8208;Engineered WSe2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Strain&#8208;engineering in atomically thin metal dichalcogenides is a useful method for realizing single&#8208;photon emitters (SPEs) for quantum technologies. Correlating SPE position with local strain topography is challenging due to localization inaccuracies from the diffraction limit. Currently, SPEs are assumed to be positioned at the highest strained location and are typically identified by randomly screening narrow&#8208;linewidth emitters, of which only a few are spectrally pure. In this work, hyperspectral quantum emitter localization microscopy is used to locate 33 SPEs in nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers with sub&#8208;diffraction&#8208;limit resolution (&#8764;30&#160;nm) and correlate their positions with the underlying strain field via image registration. In this system, spectrally pure emitters are not concentrated at the highest strain location due to spectral contamination; instead, isolable SPEs are distributed away from points of peak strain with an average displacement of 240&#160;nm. These observations point toward a need for a change in the design rules for strain&#8208;engineered SPEs and constitute a key step toward realizing next&#8208;generation quantum optical architectures.

         <title>External Field&#8208;Responsive Ternary Non&#8208;Noble Metal Oxygen Electrocatalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of photothermal assistance principle presents significant opportunities for exploring the relationship between the photothermal effect of catalyst and their as&#8208;tuned comprehensive zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) properties at both normal and extreme working conditions (e.g., low temperature and deformation), and bridging the long&#8208;existing gap between the underlying mechanism of photothermal effect and advanced light&#8208;heat&#8208;electric&#8208;chemical energy conversion.








Abstract
Despite the increasing effort in advancing oxygen electrocatalysts for zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs), the performance development gradually reaches a plateau via only ameliorating the electrocatalyst materials. Herein, a new class of external field&#8208;responsive electrocatalyst comprising Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4 stably dispersed on N&#8208;doped Ketjenblack (Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4/N&#8208;KB) is developed via polymer&#8208;assisted strategy for practical ZABs. Briefly, the activity indicator &#916;E is significantly decreased to 0.618&#160;V upon photothermal assistance, far exceeding most reported electrocatalysts (generally &gt;0.680&#160;V). As a result, the photothermal electrocatalyst possesses comprehensive merits of excellent power density (319&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), ultralong lifespan (5163 cycles at 25&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), and outstanding rate performance (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) for liquid ZABs, and superb temperature and deformation adaptability for flexible ZABs. Such improvement is attributed to the photothermal&#8208;heating&#8208;enabled synergy of promoted electrical conductivity, reactant&#8208;molecule motion, active area, and surface reconstruction, as revealed by operando Raman and simulation. The findings open vast possibilities toward more&#8208;energy&#8208;efficient energy applications.

         <title>Programming Polarity Heterogeneity of Energy Storage Dielectrics by Bidirectional Intelligent Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bidirectional intelligent design with phase&#8208;field simulation and machine learning is performed to study the influence of local polarity heterogeneity on the energy storage performance in BiFeO3&#8208;based dielectrics. By reversely optimization, a maximal energy density of 188 J cm&#8722;3 with efficiency above 95% at 8 MV cm&#8722;1 is obtained in BiFeO3&#8208;Al2O3 systems with nanopillar&#8208;like polar regions. 








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors, characterized by ultra&#8208;high power densities, are considered as fundamental energy storage components in electronic and electrical systems. However, synergistically improving energy densities and efficiencies remains a daunting challenge. Understanding the role of polarity&#160;heterogeneity at the nanoscale in determining polarization response is crucial to the domain engineering of high&#8208;performance dielectrics. Here, a bidirectional design with phase&#8208;field simulation and machine learning is performed to forward reveal the structure&#8208;property relationship and reversely optimize polarity heterogeneity to improve energy storage performance. Taking BiFeO3&#8208;based dielectrics as typical systems, this work establishes the mapping diagrams of energy density and efficiency dependence on the volume fraction, size and configuration of polar regions. Assisted by CatBoost and Wolf Pack algorithms, this work analyzes the contributions of geometric factors and intrinsic features and find that nanopillar&#8208;like polar regions show great potential in achieving both high polarization intensity and fast dipole switching. Finally, a maximal energy density of 188 J cm&#8722;3 with efficiency above 95% at 8 MV cm&#8722;1 is obtained in BiFeO3&#8208;Al2O3 systems. This work provides a general method to study the influence of local polar heterogeneity on polarization behaviors and proposes effective strategies to enhance energy storage performance by tuning polarity heterogeneity.

         <title>Targeted Macrophage CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 mRNA Editing in Immunotherapy for Tendon Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conventional delivery methods of CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 fall short in addressing the heightened inflammatory response orchestrated by macrophages during the acute stages of tendon injury. This work furnishes a swift RNA editing strategy for macrophages in the inflammatory phase, triggered by ROS in tendon injury, along with a pioneering macrophage&#8208;targeted carrier proficient in delivering Cas13 into macrophages efficiently to alleviate inflammation.








Abstract
CRISPR&#8208;Cas13 holds substantial promise for tissue repair through its RNA editing capabilities and swift catabolism. However, conventional delivery methods fall short in addressing the heightened inflammatory response orchestrated by macrophages during the acute stages of tendon injury. In this investigation, macrophage&#8208;targeting cationic polymers are systematically screened to facilitate the entry of Cas13 ribonucleic&#8208;protein complex (Cas13 RNP) into macrophages. Notably, SPP1 (OPN encoding)&#8208;producing macrophages are recognized as a profibrotic subtype that emerges during the inflammatory stage. By employing ROS&#8208;responsive release mechanisms tailored for macrophage&#8208;targeted Cas13 RNP editing systems, the overactivation of SPP1 is curbed in the face of an acute immune microenvironment. Upon encapsulating this composite membrane around the tendon injury site, the macrophage&#8208;targeted Cas13 RNP effectively curtails the emergence of injury&#8208;induced SPP1&#8208;producing macrophages in the acute phase, leading to diminished fibroblast activation and mitigated peritendinous adhesion. Consequently, this study furnishes a swift RNA editing strategy for macrophages in the inflammatory phase triggered by ROS in tendon injury, along with a pioneering macrophage&#8208;targeted carrier proficient in delivering Cas13 into macrophages efficiently.

Upon encapsulating this composite membrane around the tendon injury site, the macrophage-targeted Cas13 RNP effectively curtails the emergence of injury-induced SPP1-producing macrophages in the acute phase, leading to diminished fibroblast activation and mitigated peritendinous adhesion. Consequently, this study furnishes a swift RNA editing strategy for macrophages in the inflammatory phase triggered by ROS in tendon injury, along with a pioneering macrophage-targeted carrier proficient in delivering Cas13 into macrophages efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extracellular Matrix Scaffold&#8208;Assisted Tumor Vaccines Induce Tumor Regression and Long&#8208;Term Immune Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Injectable decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds enhance the efficacy of therapeutic cancer vaccines using tumor protein antigen and an immune&#8208;stimulating STING agonist. ECM scaffolds prolong antigen release and recruit antigen&#8208;presenting cells to help generate heightened cytotoxic T cell responses leading to effective tumor killing.








Abstract
Injectable scaffold delivery is a strategy to enhance the efficacy of cancer vaccine immunotherapy. The choice of scaffold biomaterial is crucial, impacting both vaccine release kinetics and immune stimulation via the host response. Extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds prepared from decellularized tissues facilitate a pro&#8208;healing inflammatory response that promotes local cancer immune surveillance. Here, an ECM scaffold&#8208;assisted therapeutic cancer vaccine that maintains an immune microenvironment consistent with tissue reconstruction is engineered. Several immune&#8208;stimulating adjuvants are screened to develop a cancer vaccine formulated with decellularized small intestinal submucosa (SIS) ECM scaffold co&#8208;delivery. It is found that the STING pathway agonist cyclic di&#8208;AMP most effectively induces cytotoxic immunity in an ECM scaffold vaccine, without compromising key interleukin 4 (IL&#8208;4) mediated immune pathways associated with healing. ECM scaffold delivery enhances therapeutic vaccine efficacy, curing 50&#8211;75% of established E.G&#8208;7OVA lymphoma tumors in mice, while none are cured with soluble vaccine. SIS&#8208;ECM scaffold&#8208;assisted vaccination prolonged antigen exposure is dependent on CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and generates long&#8208;term antigen&#8208;specific immune memory for at least 10 months post&#8208;vaccination. This study shows that an ECM scaffold is a promising delivery vehicle to enhance cancer vaccine efficacy while being orthogonal to characteristics of pro&#8208;healing immune hallmarks.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy Tellurium Redox&#8208;Amphoteric Conversion Cathode Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tellurium redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion cathode chemistry is demonstrated for aqueous zinc batteries with a highly concentrated ZnCl2 electrolyte, achieving a specific capacity of 1223.9 mAh gTe&#8722;1 and an outstanding energy density of 1028.0&#160;Wh kgTe&#8722;1. The reversible six&#8208;electron Te2&#8722;/Te0/Te4+ conversion is disclosed with TeCl4 as the fully charged product and ZnTe as the fully discharged product.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc batteries are potential candidates for sustainable energy storage systems at a grid scale, owing to their high safety and low cost. However, the existing cathode chemistries exhibit restricted energy density, which hinders their extensive applications. Here, a tellurium redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion cathode chemistry is presented for aqueous zinc batteries, which delivers a specific capacity of 1223.9 mAh gTe&#8722;1 and a high energy density of 1028.0&#160;Wh kgTe&#8722;1. A highly concentrated electrolyte (30&#160;mol kg&#8722;1 ZnCl2) is revealed crucial for initiating the Te redox&#8208;amphoteric conversion as it suppresses the H2O reactivity and inhibits undesirable hydrolysis of the Te4+ product. By carrying out multiple operando/ex situ characterizations, the reversible six&#8208;electron Te2&#8722;/Te0/Te4+ conversion with TeCl4 is identified as the fully charged product and ZnTe as the fully discharged product. This finding not only enriches the conversion&#8208;type battery chemistries but also establishes a critical step in exploring redox&#8208;amphoteric materials for aqueous zinc batteries and beyond.

         <title>Interlayer Engineering of Layered Materials for Efficient Ion Separation and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational construction and microenvironment regulation of interlayer nanochannels are of vital importance for the realization of efficient ion separation and storage. This review systematically summarizes the interlayer engineering strategies of layered materials and discusses their effects on ion separation and storage, which provide guidance for designing high&#8208;performance separation membranes and battery electrodes.








Abstract
Layered materials are characterized by strong in&#8208;plane covalent chemical bonds within each atomic layer and weak out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions between adjacent layers. The non&#8208;bonding nature between neighboring layers naturally results in a vdW gap, which enables the insertion of guest species into the interlayer gap. Rational design and regulation of interlayer nanochannels are crucial for converting these layered materials and their 2D derivatives into ion separation membranes or battery electrodes. Herein, based on the latest progress in layered materials and their derivative nanosheets, various interlayer engineering methods are briefly introduced, along with the effects of intercalated species on the crystal structure and interlayer coupling of the host layered materials. Their applications in the ion separation and energy storage fields are then summarized, with a focus on interlayer engineering to improve selective ion transport and ion storage performance. Finally, future research opportunities and challenges in this emerging field are comprehensively discussed.

         <title>Rapid Generation of hPSC&#8208;Derived High Endothelial Venule Organoids with In Vivo Ectopic Lymphoid Tissue Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods to control, enhance, or restrain the immune reactivity of T cells are desirable for immune disorders and anti&#8208;tumor therapies. This study presents a fast method for the generation of synthetic lymph nodes (named HEVOs) from human pluripotent stem cells, which can be implanted to control the activity of T cells locally, for example, against tumors.








Abstract
Bioengineering strategies for the fabrication of implantable lymphoid structures mimicking lymph nodes (LNs) and tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) could amplify the adaptive immune response for therapeutic applications such as cancer immunotherapy. No method to date has resulted in the consistent formation of high endothelial venules (HEVs), which is the specialized vasculature responsible for na&#239;ve T cell recruitment and education in both LNs and TLS. Here orthogonal induced differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells carrying a regulatable ETV2 allele is used to rapidly and efficiently induce endothelial differentiation. Assembly of embryoid bodies combining primitive inducible endothelial cells and primary human LN fibroblastic reticular cells results in the formation of HEV&#8208;like structures that can aggregate into 3D organoids (HEVOs). Upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice, HEVOs successfully engraft and form lymphatic structures that recruit both antigen&#8208;presenting cells and adoptively&#8208;transferred lymphocytes, therefore displaying basic TLS capabilities. The results further show that functionally, HEVOs can organize an immune response and promote anti&#8208;tumor activity by adoptively&#8208;transferred T lymphocytes. Collectively, the experimental approaches represent an innovative and scalable proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept strategy for the fabrication of bioengineered TLS that can be deployed in vivo to enhance adaptive immune responses.

         <title>A Fluoride&#8208;Rich Solid&#8208;Like Electrolyte Stabilizing Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;like electrolyte is presented to enhance the overall performance of rechargeable Li&#8211;metal batteries. The triflate groups in its channels facilitate the formation of a functional inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase that effectively stabilizes Li metal anodes. Besides, these triflate groups contribute to the decoupling of Li+ and provide hopping sites for rapid Li+ transport.








Abstract
To address the problems associated with Li metal anodes, a fluoride&#8208;rich solid&#8208;like electrolyte (SLE) that combines the benefits of solid&#8208;state and liquid electrolytes is presented. Its unique triflate&#8208;group&#8208;enhanced frame channels facilitate the formation of a functional inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which not only improves the reversibility and interfacial charge transfer of Li anodes but also ensures uniform and compact Li deposition. Furthermore, these triflate groups contribute to the decoupling of Li+ and provide hopping sites for rapid Li+ transport, enabling a high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS cm&#8722;1 and a low activation energy of 0.17&#160;eV, making it comparable to conventional liquid electrolytes. Consequently, Li symmetric cells using such SLE achieve extremely stable plating/stripping cycling over 3500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and support a high critical current up to 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled Li||LiFePO4 solid&#8208;like batteries exhibit exceptional cyclability for over 1 year and a half, even outperforming liquid cells. Additionally, high&#8208;voltage cylindrical cells and high&#8208;capacity pouch cells are demonstrated, corroborating much simpler processibility in battery assembly compared to all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

     alt="A Fluoride-Rich Solid-Like Electrolyte Stabilizing Lithium Metal Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solid-like electrolyte is presented to enhance the overall performance of rechargeable Li&#8211;metal batteries. The triflate groups in its channels facilitate the formation of a functional inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interphase that effectively stabilizes Li metal anodes. Besides, these triflate groups contribute to the decoupling of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and provide hopping sites for rapid Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address the problems associated with Li metal anodes, a fluoride-rich solid-like electrolyte (SLE) that combines the benefits of solid-state and liquid electrolytes is presented. Its unique triflate-group-enhanced frame channels facilitate the formation of a functional inorganic-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), which not only improves the reversibility and interfacial charge transfer of Li anodes but also ensures uniform and compact Li deposition. Furthermore, these triflate groups contribute to the decoupling of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and provide hopping sites for rapid Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, enabling a high room-temperature ionic conductivity of 1.1 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a low activation energy of 0.17&#160;eV, making it comparable to conventional liquid electrolytes. Consequently, Li symmetric cells using such SLE achieve extremely stable plating/stripping cycling over 3500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and support a high critical current up to 2&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The assembled Li||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; solid-like batteries exhibit exceptional cyclability for over 1 year and a half, even outperforming liquid cells. Additionally, high-voltage cylindrical cells and high-capacity pouch cells are demonstrated, corroborating much simpler processibility in battery assembly compared to all-solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Motor&#8208;Driven Light&#8208;Controlled Logic&#8208;Gated K+ Channel for Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deeply understanding the subtle dynamic behaviors of natural channel proteins based on artificial ion transport systems remains challenging. In this study, a molecular motor&#8208;derived photo&#8208;controlled logic&#8208;gated K+ channel resembling a multi&#8208;core processor is developed. The channel can step&#8208;wise control ion transport and anticancer treatments via executing logic gate instructions. Dramatic K+ efflux in the &#8220;ON&#8221; state significantly induces cancer cell apoptosis.








Abstract
Developing artificial ion transport systems, which process complicated information and step&#8208;wise regulate properties, is essential for deeply comprehending the subtle dynamic behaviors of natural channel proteins (NCPs). Here a photo&#8208;controlled logic&#8208;gated K+ channel based on single&#8208;chain random heteropolymers containing molecular motors, exhibiting multi&#8208;core processor&#8208;like properties to step&#8208;wise control ion transport is reported. Designed with oxygen, deoxygenation, and different wavelengths of light as input signals, complicated logical circuits comprising &#8220;YES&#8221;, &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;OR&#8221; and &#8220;NOT&#8221; gate components are established. Implementing these logical circuits with K+ transport efficiencies as output signals, multiple state transitions including &#8220;ON&#8221;, &#8220;Partially OFF&#8221; and &#8220;Totally OFF&#8221; in liposomes and cancer cells are realized, further causing step&#8208;wise anticancer treatments. Dramatic K+ efflux in the &#8220;ON&#8221; state (decrease by 50% within 7&#160;min) significantly induces cancer cell apoptosis. This integrated logic&#8208;gated strategy will be expanded toward understanding the delicate mechanism underlying NCPs and treating cancer or other diseases is expected.

         <title>Kinetically Controlled Synthesis of Metallic Glass Nanoparticles with Expanded Composition Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kinetically controlled flash carbothermic reaction featuring ultrafast heating and cooling is developed for the general synthesis of Pd&#8208; and Pt&#8208;based metallic glass nanoparticles (MGNPs) with good control over their composition, particle size, dispersity, and supporting substrates. The nanoscale MG has an expanded composition space than its bulk counterpart, revealing that the nanosize effect enhances glass forming ability.








Abstract
Nanoscale metallic glasses offer opportunities for investigating fundamental properties of amorphous solids and technological applications in biomedicine, microengineering, and catalysis. However, their top&#8208;down fabrication is limited by bulk counterpart availability, and bottom&#8208;up synthesis remains underexplored due to strict formation conditions. Here, a kinetically controlled flash carbothermic reaction is developed, featuring ultrafast heating (&gt;105 K s&#8722;1) and cooling rates (&gt;104 K s&#8722;1), for synthesizing metallic glass nanoparticles within milliseconds. Nine compositional permutations of noble metals, base metals, and metalloid (M1&#9472;M2&#9472;P, M1 = Pt/Pd, M2 = Cu/Ni/Fe/Co/Sn) are synthesized with widely tunable particle sizes and substrates. Through combinatorial development, a substantially expanded composition space for nanoscale metallic glass is discovered compared to bulk counterpart, revealing that the nanosize effect enhances glass forming ability. Leveraging this, several nanoscale metallic glasses are synthesized with composition that have never, to the knowledge, been synthesized in bulk. The metallic glass nanoparticles exhibit high activity in heterogeneous catalysis, outperforming crystalline metal alloy nanoparticles.

         <title>Supramolecular Hydrogel with Ultra&#8208;Rapid Cell&#8208;Mediated Network Adaptation for Enhancing Cellular Metabolic Energetics and Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors successfully fabricate an HA&#8208;ADA hydrogel based on CD&#8208;ADA crosslinks. This hydrogel has more dynamic properties, facilitating spreading and cell&#8211;cell interactions of encapsulated cells and promoting fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation, TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). The enhanced ATP generation promotes human mesenchymal stem cell differentiation and further accelerates bone regeneration.









Abstract
Cellular energetics plays an important role in tissue regeneration, and the enhanced metabolic activity of delivered stem cells can accelerate tissue repair and regeneration. However, conventional hydrogels with limited network cell adaptability restrict cell&#8211;cell interactions and cell metabolic activities. In this work, it is shown that a cell&#8208;adaptable hydrogel with high network dynamics enhances the glucose uptake and fatty acid &#946;&#8208;oxidation of encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) compared with a hydrogel with low network dynamics. It is further shown that the hMSCs encapsulated in the high dynamic hydrogels exhibit increased tricarboxylic acid (TCA)&#160;cycle activity, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) biosynthesis via an E&#8208;cadherin&#8208; and AMP&#8208;activated protein kinase (AMPK)&#8208;dependent mechanism. The in vivo evaluation further showed that the delivery of MSCs by the dynamic hydrogel enhanced in situ bone regeneration in an animal model. It is believed that the findings provide critical insights into the impact of stem cell&#8211;biomaterial interactions on cellular metabolic energetics and the underlying mechanisms.

         <title>Improving Charge Storage of Biaxially&#8208;Oriented Polypropylene under Extreme Electric Fields by Excimer UV Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft, interface&#8208;free, and ready&#8208;to&#8208;use method by excimer UV irradiation, eliminating any chemical agents or toxic byproduct, is engaged to enhancing the withstanding electric&#8208;field extreme and discharged energy density of biaxially&#8208;oriented polypropylene (BOPP). Highly&#8208;resolved space charge profile is first in situ revealed with identical BOPP samples, illustrating the suppress of space charge injection and electric&#8208;field distortion promote the dielectric performance.








Abstract
Biaxially&#8208;oriented polypropylene (BOPP) is one of the most commonly used materials for film&#8208;based capacitors for power electronics and pulsed power systems. To address the pressing issue of performance&#8208;limiting loss under extreme electric&#8208;fields, here a one&#8208;step, high&#8208;throughput, and environment&#8208;friendly process based on very low&#8208;dose ultra&#8208;violet irradiation from KrCl (222&#160;nm) and Xe2 (172&#160;nm) excimer is demonstrated. The performance of commercial BOPP is boosted in terms of withstanding electric&#8208;field extremes (Weibull breakdown strength 694 to 811&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1 by 17% at 25&#160;&#176;C and 428 to 651&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1 by 52% at 120&#160;&#176;C), discharged energy density, and conduction losses. Importantly, the depth profile of space charge is precisely measured in situ with a high resolution of 500&#160;nm by laser induced pressure pulse. Consequently, the space charge effect and electric&#8208;field distortion are reduced and related to the improved polymer films. It is demonstrated that energetic UV photons act as scissors for BOPP chains and dissociate oxygen molecules leading to the more thermally stable oxygen&#8208;containing structures, as deep traps to impede charge migration. This work provides a promising approach to produce polymers with customized microscopic characteristics that is compatible with the assembly lines of polymer&#8208;based capacitors.

         <title>Ultrathin, Transferred Layers of Silicon Oxynitrides as Tunable Biofluid Barriers for Bioresorbable Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a class of inorganic material (silicon oxynitride) that can be formed in thin films as stable barriers to surrounding ground water or biofluids, yet ultimately dissolve completely to biologically and environmentally benign end products. These ultrathin, transferred inorganic layers enable the stable operation of partially biodegradable wireless light&#8208;emitting diodes over extended periods in aqueous environments.








Abstract
Bio/ecoresorbable electronic systems create unique opportunities in implantable medical devices that serve a need over a finite time period and then disappear naturally to eliminate the need for extraction surgeries. A critical challenge in the development of this type of technology is in materials that can serve as thin, stable barriers to surrounding ground water or biofluids, yet ultimately dissolve completely to benign end products. This paper describes a class of inorganic material (silicon oxynitride, SiON) that can be formed in thin films by plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition for this purpose. In vitro studies suggest that SiON and its dissolution products are biocompatible, indicating the potential for its use in implantable devices. A facile process to fabricate flexible, wafer&#8208;scale multilayer films bypasses limitations associated with the mechanical fragility of inorganic thin films. Systematic computational, analytical, and experimental studies highlight the essential materials aspects. Demonstrations in wireless light&#8208;emitting diodes both in vitro and in vivo illustrate the practical use of these materials strategies. The ability to select degradation rates and water permeability through fine tuning of chemical compositions and thicknesses provides the opportunity to obtain a range of functional lifetimes to meet different application requirements.

         <title>4D Multimaterial Printing of Soft Actuators with Spatial and Temporal Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the double&#8208;layer printed circuit board structure, a 4D printed multimaterial soft actuator that integrates a hydrophilic pH&#8208;responsive hydrogel and a hydrophobic shape&#8208;memory polymer with an adhesive layer to overcome poor interface compatibility, is designed. This integration enables active spatiotemporal control of actuation, while 4D printing facilitates a diverse range of configurations. 








Abstract
Soft actuators (SAs) are devices which can interact with delicate objects in a manner not achievable with traditional robotics. While it is possible to design a SA whose actuation is triggered via an external stimulus, the use of a single stimulus creates challenges in the spatial and temporal control of the actuation. Herein, a 4D printed multimaterial soft actuator design (MMSA) whose actuation is only initiated by a combination of triggers (i.e., pH and temperature) is presented. Using 3D printing, a multilayered soft actuator with a hydrophilic pH&#8208;sensitive layer, and a hydrophobic magnetic and temperature&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer layer, is designed. The hydrogel responds to environmental pH conditions by swelling or shrinking, while the shape&#8208;memory polymer can resist the shape deformation of the hydrogel until triggered by temperature or light. The combination of these stimuli&#8208;responsive layers allows for a high level of spatiotemporal control of the actuation. The utility of the 4D MMSA is demonstrated via a series of cargo capture and release experiments, validating its ability to demonstrate active spatiotemporal control. The MMSA concept provides a promising research direction to develop multifunctional soft devices with potential applications in biomedical engineering and environmental engineering.

         <title>Observation of Topological Hall Effect in a Chemically Complex Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pronounced topological Hall effect (up to 1.92 &#181;&#937; cm) is observed in a Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Mn chemically complex alloy film across a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. Distinct from that observed in the skyrmion systems and geometrically frustrated magnets, this effect is attributed to the nonvanishing spin chirality created by spin frustration under the magnetic field.








Abstract
The topological Hall effect (THE) is the transport response of chiral spin textures and thus can serve as a powerful probe for detecting and understanding these unconventional magnetic orders. So far, the THE is only observed in either noncentrosymmetric systems where spin chirality is stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions, or triangular&#8208;lattice magnets with Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida&#8208;type interactions. Here, a pronounced THE is observed in a Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Mn chemically complex alloy with a simple face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) structure across a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. The alloy is shown to have a strong magnetic frustration owing to the random occupation of magnetic atoms on the close&#8208;packed fcc lattice and the direct Heisenberg exchange interaction among atoms, as evidenced by the appearance of a reentrant spin glass state in the low&#8208;temperature regime and the first principles calculations. Consequently, THE is attributed to the nonvanishing spin chirality created by strong spin frustration under the external magnetic field, which is distinct from the mechanism responsible for the skyrmion systems, as well as geometrically frustrated magnets.

         <title>Advancing Mycotoxin Detection in Food and Feed: Novel Insights from Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of nanomaterial fabrication techniques including, the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of metallic, core&#8211;shell and magnetic nanoparticles and top&#8208;down approaches including, lithographic, nonlithographic, and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials: MXenes and graphene are presented for the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS)&#8208;based detection of mycotoxins in food and feed, with an emphasis on current challenges and future prospects.








Abstract
The implementation of low&#8208;cost and rapid technologies for the on&#8208;site detection of mycotoxin&#8208;contaminated crops is a promising solution to address the growing concerns of the agri&#8208;food industry. Recently, there have been significant developments in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) for the direct detection of mycotoxins in food and feed. This review provides an overview of the most recent advancements in the utilization of SERS through the successful fabrication of novel nanostructured materials. Various bottom&#8208;up and top&#8208;down approaches have demonstrated their potential in improving sensitivity, while many applications exploit the immobilization of recognition elements and molecular imprinted polymers (MIPs) to enhance specificity and reproducibility in complex matrices. Therefore, the design and fabrication of nanomaterials is of utmost importance and are presented herein. This paper uncovers that limited studies establish detection limits&#160;or conduct validation using naturally contaminated samples. One decade on, SERS is still lacking significant progress and there is a disconnect between the technology, the European regulatory limits, and the intended end&#8208;user. Ongoing challenges and potential solutions are discussed including nanofabrication, molecular binders, and data analytics. Recommendations to assay design, portability, and substrate stability are made to help improve the potential and feasibility of SERS for future on&#8208;site agri&#8208;food applications.

         <title>Collagen Mineralization Decreases NK Cell&#8208;Mediated Cytotoxicity of Breast Cancer Cells via Increased Glycocalyx Thickness</title>

         <dc:description>
Skeletal metastasis in advanced breast cancer involves immune evasion by disseminated tumor cells. Using synthetic bone models with controlled mineral content and advanced imaging techniques, it is revealed that collagen type I mineralization in the bone matrix upregulates mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation and sialylation in tumor cells, thickening their glycocalyx and enhancing resistance to natural killer cells.








Abstract
Skeletal metastasis is common in patients with advanced breast cancer and often caused by immune evasion of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). In the skeleton, tumor cells not only disseminate to the bone marrow but also to osteogenic niches in which they interact with newly mineralizing bone extracellular matrix (ECM). However, it remains unclear how mineralization of collagen type I, the primary component of bone ECM, regulates tumor&#8208;immune cell interactions. Here, a combination of synthetic bone matrix models with controlled mineral content, nanoscale optical imaging, and flow cytometry are utilized to evaluate how collagen type I mineralization affects the biochemical and biophysical properties of the tumor cell glycocalyx, a dense layer of glycosylated proteins and lipids decorating their cell surface. These results suggest that collagen mineralization upregulates mucin&#8208;type O&#8208;glycosylation and sialylation by tumor cells, which increases their glycocalyx thickness while enhancing resistance to attack by natural killer (NK) cells. These changes are functionally linked as treatment with a sialylation inhibitor decreased mineralization&#8208;dependent glycocalyx thickness and made tumor cells more susceptible to NK cell attack. Together, these results suggest that interference with glycocalyx sialylation may represent a therapeutic strategy to enhance cancer immunotherapies targeting bone&#8208;metastatic breast cancer.

         <title>Self&#8208;Enhancement of Perfluorinated Sulfonic Acid Proton Exchange Membrane with Its Own Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High performance perfluorosulfonic acid proton exchange membranes (PEM) &#8220;self&#8208;enhanced&#8221; with its own nanofibers are prepared, thereby the interfacial compatibility issue of traditional composite materials is perfectly addressed, as a result of orientation of molecular and ion clusters, ultrahigh proton conductivity exceeding 1&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, high strength and low swelling are achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance proton exchange membrane (PEM) is crucial for the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Herein, a novel &#8220;self&#8208;enhanced&#8221; PEM is fabricated for the first time, which is composed of perfluorinated sulfonic acid (PFSA) resin and its own nanofibers as reinforcement. With this strategy, the interfacial compatibility issue of conventional fiber&#8208;reinforced membranes is fully addressed and up to 80 wt% loading of PFSA nanofibers can be incorporated. Furthermore, on account of chain orientation within the PFSA nanofiber, single fiber exhibits super&#8208;high conductivity of 1.45 S cm&#8722;1, leading to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art proton conductivity (1.1 S cm&#8722;1) of the as&#8208;prepared &#8220;self&#8208;enhanced&#8221; PEM so far, which is an order of magnitude increase compared with the bulk PFSA membrane (0.29 S cm&#8722;1). It surpasses any commercial PEM including the popular GORE&#8208;SELECT and Nafion HP membranes and is the only PEM with conductivity at 100 S cm&#8722;1 level. In addition, the mechanical strength and swelling ratio of membranes are both substantially improved simultaneously. Based on the high&#8208;performance &#8220;self&#8208;enhanced&#8221; PEM, high peak power densities of up to 3.6&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and 1.7&#160;W cm&#8722;2 are achieved in H2&#8208;O2 and H2&#8208;Air fuel cells, respectively. This strategy can be applied in any polymeric electrolyte membrane.

         <title>Achieving Clearance of Drug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Infection and Rapid Cutaneous Wound Regeneration Using an ROS&#8208;Balancing&#8208;Engineered Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent nanocatalytic membrane composed of electrospun PLGA scaffolds and 2D2&#8208;bioHJs is developed and synthesized for the remediation of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria&#8208;infested cutaneous regeneration via an ROS levering tactic: the intelligent nanocatalytic membrane exhibits a dual capability of sequential generating and scavenging ROS, achieving programmed antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory effects.








Abstract
Intractable infected microenvironments caused by drug&#8208;resistant bacteria stalls the normal course of wound healing. Sono&#8208;piezodynamic therapy (SPT) is harnessed to combat pathogenic bacteria, but the superabundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during SPT inevitably provoke severe inflammatory response, hindering tissue regeneration. Consequently, an intelligent nanocatalytic membrane composed of poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) and black phosphorus /V2C MXene bio&#8208;heterojunctions (2D2&#8208;bioHJs) is devised. Under ultrasonication, 2D2&#8208;bioHJs effectively eliminate drug&#8208;resistant bacteria by disrupting metabolism and electron transport chain (ETC). When ultrasonication ceases, they enable the elimination of SPT&#8208;generated ROS. The 2D2&#8208;bioHJs act as a &#8220;lever&#8221; that effectively achieves a balance between ROS generation and annihilation, delivering both antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties to the engineered membrane. More importantly, in vivo assays corroborate that the nanocatalytic membranes transform the stalled chronic wound environment into a regenerative one by eradicating the bacterial population, dampening the NF&#8208;&#954;B inflammatory pathway and promoting angiogenesis. As envisaged, this work demonstrates a novel tactic to arm membranes with programmed antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory effects to remedy refractory infected wounds from drug&#8208;fast bacteria.

         <title>Semimetallic Bismuthene with Edge&#8208;Rich Dangling Bonds: Broad&#8208;Spectrum&#8208;Driven and Edge&#8208;Confined Electron Enhancement Boosting CO2 Hydrogenation Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under broad&#8208;spectrum (UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR) excitation, photogenerated electrons in semimetallic bismuthene migrate from the partially electronically occupied intermediate band to the lowest fully unoccupied empty band. The edge dangling bonds of bismuthene as the active sites for CO2 adsorption/activation significantly reduce the catalytic reaction energy barrier and promote the formation of C&#9472;H bonds until the generation of CH4.








Abstract
Broad&#8208;spectrum&#8208;driven high&#8208;performance artificial photosynthesis is quite challenging. Herein, atomically ultrathin bismuthene with semimetallic properties is designed and demonstrated for broad&#8208;spectrum (ultraviolet&#8208;visible&#8208;near infrared light) (UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR)&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The trap states in the bandgap produced by edge dangling bonds prolong the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons from 90&#160;ps in bulk Bi to 1650&#160;ps in bismuthine, and excited&#8208;state electrons are enriched at the edge of bismuthine. The edge dangling bonds of bismuthene as the active sites for adsorption/activation of CO2 increase the hybridization ability of the Bi 6p orbital and O 2p orbital to significantly reduce the catalytic reaction energy barrier and promote the formation of C&#9472;H bonds until the generation of CH4. Under &#955;&#160;&#8805;&#160;400&#160;nm and &#955;&#160;&#8805;&#160;550&#160;nm irradiation, the utilization ratios of photogenerated electron reduction CO2 hydrogenation to CO and CH4 for bismuthene are 58.24 and 300.50 times higher than those of bulk Bi, respectively. Moreover, bismuthene can extend the CO2 hydrogenation reaction to the near&#8208;infrared region (&#955;&#160;&#8805;&#160;700&#160;nm). This pioneering work employs the single semimetal element as an artificial photosynthetic catalyst to produce a broad spectral response.

         <title>Activating CD8+ T Cells by Pt(IV) Prodrug&#8208;Based Nanomedicine and aPD&#8208;L1 Antibody for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in cancer immunotherapy, specifically T cell&#8208;based therapies. However, the application of T cell therapies has been primarily limited to hematologic malignancies, with limited success in the treatment of solid tumors. The main challenge in treating solid tumor is immune escape, which is characterized by reduced antigenicity, diminished immunogenicity, and the development of suppressive tumor immune microenvironments. To address these obstacles and restore T cell&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;tumor responses, we have developed a novel nanoparticle formulation known as PRA@Oxa&#8208;c16. This innovative approach combines retinoic acid and Pt(IV) to specifically target and overcome immune escape. Notably, the therapeutic efficacy of PRA@Oxa&#8208;c16 primarily relies on its ability to induce anti&#8208;tumor T cell responses, in contrast to the cytotoxicity associated with conventional chemotherapeutic agents. When combined with an immune checkpoint blockade, anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody, PRA@Oxa&#8208;c16 effectively eliminates solid tumors and induces immune memory responses, which prevent tumor metastasis and recurrence. This promising approach holds great potential for enhancing the treatment of solid tumors with T cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

         <title>Engineering Dual CO2&#8208; and Photothermal&#8208;responsive Membranes for switchable Double Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive membranes demonstrate promising applications in switchable oil/water emulsion separations. However, they are unsuitable for the treatment of double emulsions like oil&#8208;in&#8208;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (O/W/O) and water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water (W/O/W) emulsions. For efficient separation of these complicated emulsions, fine control over the wettability, response time, and aperture structure of the membrane is required. Herein, dual&#8208;coated fibers consisting of primary photothermal&#8208;responsive and secondary CO2&#8208;responsive coatings were prepared by two steps. Automated weaving of these fibers produced membranes with photothermal&#8208; and CO2&#8208;responsive characteristics and narrow pore size distributions. These membranes exhibited fast switching wettability between superhydrophilicity (under CO2 stimulation) and high hydrophobicity (under near&#8208;infrared stimulation), achieving on&#8208;demand separation of various O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions with separation efficiencies exceeding 99.6%. Two&#8208;dimensional low&#8208;field nuclear magnetic resonance and correlated spectra technique were employed to clarify the underlying mechanism of switchable double emulsion separation. Our approach can effectively address the challenges associated with the use of stimulus&#8208;responsive membranes for double emulsion separation and facilitate the industrial application of these membranes.

         <title>Frontiers in Photoelectrochemical Catalysis: A Focus on Valuable Product Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis provides the most promising avenue for producing value&#8208;added chemicals and consumables from renewable precursors. Over the last decades, PEC catalysis, including reduction of renewable feedstock, oxidation of organics, and activation and functionalization of C&#8208;C and C&#8208;H bonds, are extensively investigated, opening new opportunities for employing the technology in upgrading readily available resources. However, several challenges still remain unsolved, hindering the commercialization of the process. This review offers an overview of PEC catalysis targeted at the synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals from sustainable precursors. First, we recall the fundamentals of evaluating PEC reactions in the context of value&#8208;added product synthesis at both anode and cathode. Then, we highlight the common photoelectrode fabrication methods that have been employed to produce thin&#8208;film photoelectrodes. Next, we systematically review and discuss the advancements in the PEC conversion of various feedstocks to produce highly valued chemicals. Finally, we present the challenges and prospects in the field. This review aims at facilitating further development of PEC technology for upgrading several renewable precursors to value&#8208;added products and other pharmaceuticals.

         <title>A Metal Coordination Number Determined Catalytic Performance in Manganese Borides for Ambient Electrolysis of Nitrogen to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A new strategy that can effectively increase the NRR performance of catalysts has been proposed and verified by tuning the coordination number of metal atoms. It is found that the intrinsic activity of Mn atoms in the manganese borides (MnBx) increases in tandem with their coordination number with B atoms. Electron&#8208;deficient boron atoms are capable of accepting electrons from Mn atoms, which enhances the adsorption of N2 on the Mn catalytic sites (*) and the hydrogenation of N2 to form *NNH intermediates. Furthermore, the increase in coordination number reduces the charge density of Mn atoms at the Fermi level, which facilitates the desorption of NH3 from the catalyst surface. Notably, the MnB4 compound with a Mn coordination number of up to 12 exhibited a high ammonia yield rate (74.9 &#177; 2.1&#160;&#956;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (38.5 &#177; 2.7%) at &#8722;0.3&#160;V versus RHE in a 0.1 &#1084; Li2SO4 electrolyte, exceeding those reported for other boron&#8208;related catalysts.

         <title>Reversible Optical Control of Polarization in Epitaxial Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Light is an effective tool to probe the polarization and domain distribution in ferroelectric materials passively, that is, non&#8208;invasively, for example via optical second harmonic generation (SHG). With the emergence of oxide electronics, there is now a strong demand to expand the role of light toward active control of the polarization. In this work, we demonstrate optical control of the ferroelectric polarization in prototypical epitaxial PbZrxTi1&#8208;xO3 (PZT)&#8208;based heterostructures. we accomplish this in three steps, using above&#8208;bandgap UV light, while tracking the response of the polarization with optical SHG. First, we find that UV&#8208;light exposure induces a transient enhancement or suppression of the ferroelectric polarization in films with an upward&#8208; or downward&#8208;oriented polarization, respectively. we attribute this behavior to a modified charge screening driven by the separation of photoexcited charge carriers at the Schottky interface of the ferroelectric thin film. Second, we take advantage of this optical handle on electrostatics and accomplish remanent optical poling from a pristine multi&#8208;domain into a single&#8208;domain configuration. Third, via thermal annealing or engineered electrostatic boundary conditions, we further achieve a complete reversibility of the optical poling. Hence, our work paves the way for the all&#8208;optical control of the spontaneous polarization in ferroelectric thin&#160;films.

         <title>Green Printing for Scalable Organic Photovoltaic Modules by Controlling the Gradient Marangoni Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the rapid development in the performances of organic solar cells (OSCs), high&#8208;performance OSC modules based on green printing are still limited. The severe Coffee&#8208;ring effect (CRE) is considered to be the primary reason for the non&#8208;uniform distribution of active layer films. To solve this key printing problem, the co&#8208;solvent strategy is presented to deposit the active layer films. The guest solvent Mesitylene with a higher boiling point and a lower surface tension is incorporated into the host solvent o&#8208;XY to optimize the rheological properties such as surface tension and viscosity of the active layer solutions. And the synergistic effect of inward Marangoni flow generation and solution thickening caused by the co&#8208;solvent strategy can effectively restrain CRE, resulting in highly homogeneous large&#8208;area active layer films. In addition, the optimized crystallization and phase separation of active layer films effectively accelerate the charge transport and exciton dissociation of devices. Consequently, based on PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 system, the device prepared with the co&#8208;solvent strategy shows the a PCE of 17.80%. Moreover, as the effective area scales to 1 cm2 and 16.94 cm2, the recorded performances are altered to 16.71% and 14.58%. This study provides a universal pathway for the development of green&#8208;printed high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Crown Ether Covalent Organic Framework as Interphase Layer toward High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
The practical application of lithium (Li) metal batteries is inhibited by accumulative Li dendrites and continuous active Li consumption during cycling, which results in a low Coulombic efficiency and short lifetime. Constructing artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer in Li anode, such as two&#8208;dimensional covalent organic frameworks (COFs), is an effective strategy to restrain the formation of Li dendrites and improve cycling performance. However, the exploration of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) COFs as protecting layers is rarely reported, because of the preconception that the interconnect pores in 3D COFs eventually cause Li dendrites in disordered direction. We demonstrate 3D crown ether based COF with ffc topology as interphase layer, in which the crown ether units are arranged in parallel and vertical orientation along the electrode. The strong coupling effect between the crown ether and Li+ accelerates Li+ diffusion kinetics and enables homogeneous Li+ flux, resulting in a high Li+ transference number of 0.85 and smooth Li deposition in 3D direction. Li/COF&#8208;Cu cells display a lower Li&#8208;nucleation overpotential (17.4&#160;mV) and high average Coulombic efficiency of &#8764;98.6% during 340 cycles with COF incorporation. This work gives us a new insight into designing COFs for energy storage systems.

         <title>Monolithic Strong Coupling of Topological Surface Acoustic Wave Resonators on Lithium Niobate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Coherent phonon transfer via high&#8208;quality factor (Q) mechanical resonator strong coupling has garnered significant interest. Yet, the practical applications of these strongly coupled resonator devices are largely constrained by their vulnerability to fabrication defects. In this study, we achieve topological strong coupling of gigahertz frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonators with lithium niobate. The nanoscale grooves are etched onto the lithium niobate surface to establish robust SAW topological interface states (TISs). By constructing phononic crystal (PnC) heterostructures, we realize a strong coupling of two SAW TISs, achieving a maximum Rabi splitting of 22&#160;MHz and frequency quality factor product fQm of &#8764; 1.2 &#215; 1013&#160;Hz. This coupling can be tuned by adjusting geometric parameters and a distinct spectral anti&#8208;crossing is experimentally observed. Furthermore, we demonstrate a dense wavelength division multiplexing device based on the coupling of multiple TISs. These findings open new avenues for the development of practical topological acoustic devices for on&#8208;chip sensing, filtering, phonon entanglement, and beyond.

         <title>TiO2 Nano&#8208;Biopatterning Reveals Optimal Ligand Presentation for Cell&#8208;Matrix Adhesion Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanoscale organization of transmembrane receptors is becoming recognized as critical for cellular functions, enabled by the nanoscale engineering of bioligand presentation. Previously, a spatial threshold of &#8804;60&#160;nm for integrin binding ligands in cell&#8208;matrix adhesion was demonstrated using mono&#8208;ligand gold nanoparticles. However, the ligand geometric arrangement was limited to hexagonal arrays of mono&#8208;ligands, while plasmonic quenching by gold limited further investigation by fluorescence&#8208;based high&#8208;resolution imaging. Here, these limitations were overcome with dielectric TiO2 nanopatterns, which allows fine&#8208;tuning ligand cluster size, eliminating fluorescence quenching, thus enabling super&#8208;resolution fluorescence microscopy on nanopatterns. By dual&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution imaging, high precision and consistency among nanopatterns, bioligands, and integrin nanoclusters was observed validating the high quality and integrity of both nanopattern functionalization and passivation. By screening TiO2 nanodiscs with various diameters, an increase in fibroblast cell adhesion, spreading area, and YAP nuclear localization on 100nm&#8208;diameter compared with smaller diameters was observed, and Focal Adhesion Kinase was identified as the regulatory signal. These findings explore the optimal ligand presentation when the minimal requirements are sufficiently fulfilled in the heterogenous ECM network of isolated binding regions with abundant ligands. Integration of high&#8208;fidelity nano&#8208;biopatterning with super&#8208;resolution imaging will allow precise quantitative studies to address early signaling events in response to receptor clustering and their nanoscale organization.

         <title>Advancing Catalysts by Stacking Fault Defects for Enhanced Hydrogen Production: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Green hydrogen, derived from water splitting powered by renewable energy such as solar and wind energy, provides a zero&#8208;emission solution crucial for revolutionizing hydrogen production and decarbonizing industries. Catalysts, particularly those utilizing defect engineering involving the strategical introduction of atomic&#8208;level imperfections, play a vital role in reducing energy requirements and enabling a more sustainable transition towards a hydrogen&#8208;based economy. Stacking fault (SF) defects play an important role in enhancing the electrocatalytic processes by reshaping surface reactivity, increasing active sites, improving reactants/product diffusion, and regulating electronic structure due to their dense generation ability and profound impact on catalyst properties. This review explores SF in metal&#8208;based materials, covering synthetic methods for the intentional introduction of SF and their applications in hydrogen production, including oxygen evolution reaction, photo&#8208; and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, and various other electrocatalytic processes such as oxygen reduction reaction, nitrate reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Finally, this review addresses the challenges associated with SF&#8208;based catalysts, emphasizing the importance of a detailed understanding of the properties of SF&#8208;based catalysts to optimize their electrocatalytic performance. It provides a comprehensive overview of their various applications in electrocatalytic processes, providing valuable insights for advancing sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Bioresorbable Multilayer Organic&#8208;Inorganic Films for Bioelectronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bioresorbable electronic devices as temporary biomedical implants represent an emerging class of technology relevant to a range of patient conditions currently addressed with technologies that require surgical explantation after a desired period of use. Obtaining reliable performance and favorable degradation behavior demands materials that can serve as biofluid barriers in encapsulating structures that avoid premature degradation of active electronic components. Here, we present a materials design that addresses this need, with properties in water impermeability, mechanical flexibility and processability that are superior to alternatives. The approach uses multilayer assemblies of alternating films of polyanhydride and silicon oxynitride formed by spin&#8208;coating and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition, respectively. Experimental and theoretical studies investigate the effects of material composition and multilayer structure on water barrier performance, water distribution, and degradation behavior. Demonstrations with inductor&#8208;capacitor circuits, wireless power transfer systems, and wireless optoelectronic devices illustrate the performance of this materials system as a bioresorbable encapsulating structure.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Protection Inorganic&#8208;Protein Coating on Mg&#8208;Based Biomaterials through Tooth&#8208;Enamel&#8208;Inspired Biomineralization</title>

Abstract
Biocompatible magnesium alloys represent revolutionary implantable materials in dentistry and orthopedics but face challenges due to rapid bio&#8208;corrosion, necessitating protective coatings to mitigate dysfunction. Directly integrating durable protective coatings onto Mg surfaces is challenging because of intrinsic low coating compactness. Herein, inspired by tooth enamel, a novel highly compact dual&#8208;protection inorganic&#8208;protein (inorganicPro) coating is in&#8208;situ constructed on Mg surfaces through bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein&#8208;boosted reaction between sodium fluoride (NaF) and Mg substrates. The association of Mg ions and BSA establishes a local hydrophobic domain that lowers the formation enthalpy of NaMgF3 nanoparticles. This process generates finer nanoparticles that function as &#8220;bricks&#8221;, facilitating denser packing, consequently reducing voidage inside coatings by over 50% and reinforcing mechanical durability. Moreover, the incorporation of BSA in and on the coatings plays two synergistic roles: (1) acting as &#8220;mortar&#8221; to seal residual cracks within coatings, thereby promoting coating compactness and tripling anticorrosion performance, and (2) mitigating fouling&#8208;accelerated bio&#8208;corrosion in complex biosystems via tenfold resistance against bio&#8208;foulant attachments, including biofluids, proteins, and metabolites. This innovative strategy, leveraging proteins to alter inorganic reactions, benefits the future coating design for Mg&#8208;based and other metallic materials with tailored anticorrosion and antifouling performances.

Moreover, the incorporation of BSA in and on the coatings plays two synergistic roles: (1) acting as &#8220;mortar&#8221; to seal residual cracks within coatings, thereby promoting coating compactness and tripling anticorrosion performance, and (2) mitigating fouling-accelerated bio-corrosion in complex biosystems via tenfold resistance against bio-foulant attachments, including biofluids, proteins, and metabolites. This innovative strategy, leveraging proteins to alter inorganic reactions, benefits the future coating design for Mg-based and other metallic materials with tailored anticorrosion and antifouling performances.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Transformable Supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembled Peptides for Cascade Self&#8208;Enhanced Ferroptosis Primed Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Immunotherapy has received widespread attention for its effective and long&#8208;term tumor&#8208;eliminating ability. However, for immunogenic &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors, such as prostate cancer (PCa), the low immunogenicity of the tumor itself is a serious obstacle to efficacy. Here, we report a strategy to enhance PCa immunogenicity by triggering cascade self&#8208;enhanced ferroptosis in tumor cells, turning the tumor from &#8220;cold&#8221; to &#8220;hot&#8221;. We developed a transformable self&#8208;assembled peptide TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY with alkaline phosphatase (ALP) responsiveness and GPX4 protein targeting. TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY self&#8208;assembles into nanoparticles under aqueous conditions and transforms into nanofibers in response to ALP during endosome/lysosome uptake into tumor cells, promoting lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP). On the one hand, the released TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRAY nanofibers targeted GPX4 and selectively degraded the GPX4 protein under the light irradiation, inducing ferroptosis; on the other hand, the large amount of leaked Fe2+ further cascaded to amplify the ferroptosis through the Fenton reaction. TEP&#8208;FFG&#8208;CRApY&#8208;induced immunogenic ferroptosis improved tumor cell immunogenicity by promoting the maturation of DC cells and increasing intra&#8208;tumor T cell infiltration. More importantly, recovered T cells further enhanced ferroptosis by secreting large amounts of IFN&#8208;&#947;. This work provides a novel strategy for the molecular design of synergistic molecularly targeted therapy for immunogenic &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Construction of Articular Cartilage&#8208;Like Hydrogel Coating for Durable Aqueous Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Articular cartilage has an appropriate multilayer structure and superior tribological properties and provides a structural paradigm for design of lubricating materials. However, mimicking articular cartilage traits on prosthetic materials with durable lubrication remains a huge challenge. Herein, we develop an ingenious three&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy for constructing an articular cartilage&#8208;like hydrogel coating on the surface of ultra&#8208;high molecular weight polyethylene (UPE), a common bearing material used in disc and joint prostheses, which makes full use of conceptions of interfacial interpenetration, high&#8208;entanglement crosslinking, and interface modulated polymerization. The hydrogel coating is tightly combined with UPE substrate through hydrogel&#8208;polymer interpenetrating networks. The hydrogel chains are highly entangled with each other to form a dense tough layer with negligible hysteresis for load&#8208;bearing by reducing the amounts of crosslinker and initiator to p.p.m. level. Meanwhile, the polymerization of monomers in the top surface region is suppressed via interface modulated polymerization, thus introducing a porous surface for effective aqueous lubrication. As a result, the articular cartilage&#8208;like bilayer hydrogel coating exhibits an ultralow friction coefficient of 0.0048 during 10,000 cycles under a load of 0.9&#160;MPa. This work may provide a new way to build stable bilayer coatings and have important implications for development of biological lubricating materials.

         <title>Dynamic Optical Encryption Fueled via Tunable Mechanical Composite Micrograting Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a dynamic optical encryption strategy using tunable mechanical composite wrinkle micrograting encryption systems (MCWGES). By generating dynamic keys with large space capacity for encrypted diffraction patterns, MCWGES effectively prevents eavesdropping, damage, and tampering. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential applications of micro/nanostructured functional surfaces in information security.








Abstract
Optical grating devices based on micro/nanostructured functional surfaces are widely employed to precisely manipulate light propagation, which is significant for information technologies, optical data storage, and light sensors. However, the parameters of rigid periodic structures are difficult to tune after manufacturing, which seriously limits their capacity for in situ light manipulation. Here, a novel anti&#8208;eavesdropping, anti&#8208;damage, and anti&#8208;tamper dynamic optical encryption strategy are reported via tunable mechanical composite wrinkle micrograting encryption systems (MCWGES). By mechanically composing multiple in&#8208;situ tunable ordered wrinkle gratings, the dynamic keys with large space capacity are generated to obtain encrypted diffraction patterns, which can provide a higher level of security for the encrypted systems. Furthermore, a multiple grating cone diffraction model is proposed to reveal the dynamic optical encryption principle of MCWGES. Optical encryption communication using dynamic keys has the effect of preventing eavesdropping, damage, and tampering. This dynamic encryption method based on optical manipulation of wrinkle grating demonstrates the potential applications of micro/nanostructured functional surfaces in the field of information security.

         <title>Locally Strained 2D Materials: Preparation, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials are promising for strain engineering due to their atomic thickness and exceptional mechanical properties. In particular, non&#8208;uniform and localized strain can be induced in 2D materials by generating out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformations, resulting in novel phenomena and properties as witnessed in recent years. Therefore, the locally strained 2D materials are of great value for both fundamental studies and practical applications. This review discusses techniques for introducing local strains to 2D materials and their feasibility, advantages, and challenges. We then explore the unique effects and properties that arise from local strain. The representative applications based on locally strained 2D materials are illustrated, including memristor, single photon emitter, photodetector, etc. Finally, we provide concluding remarks on the challenges and opportunities in the emerging field of locally strained 2D materials.

         <title>Toward a Brain&#8208;Neuromorphics Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Brain&#8208;computer interfaces (BCIs) that enable human&#8208;machine interaction have immense potential in restoring or augmenting human capabilities. Traditional BCIs are realized based on complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technologies with complex, bulky, and low biocompatible circuits, and suffer with the low energy efficiency of the von Neumann architecture. The brain&#8208;neuromorphics interface (BNI) would offer a promising solution to advance the BCI technologies and shape our interactions with machineries. Neuromorphic devices and systems are able to provide substantial computation power with extremely high energy&#8208;efficiency by implementing in&#8208;materia computing such as in situ vector&#8208;matrix multiplication (VMM) and physical reservoir computing. Recent progresses on integrating neuromorphic components with sensing and/or actuating modules, give birth to the neuromorphic afferent nerve, efferent nerve, sensorimotor loop, and so on, which has advanced the technologies for future neurorobotics by achieving sophisticated sensorimotor capabilities as the biological system. With the development on the compact artificial spiking neuron and bioelectronic interfaces, the seamless communication between a BNI and a bioentity is reasonably expectable. In this review, the upcoming BNIs are profiled by introducing the brief history of neuromorphics, reviewing the recent progresses on related areas, and discussing the future advances and challenges that lie ahead.

         <title>Capillary Manganese Halide Needle&#8208;Like Array Scintillator with Isolated Light&#8208;Crosstalk for Micro&#8208;X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>

Abstract
The exacerbation of inherent light scattering with increasing scintillator thickness poses a major challenge for balancing the thickness&#8208;dependent spatial resolution and scintillation brightness in X&#8208;ray imaging scintillators. Herein, we fabricated a thick pixelated needle&#8208;like array scintillator capable of micrometer resolution via waveguide structure engineering. Specifically, this involves integrating a straightforward low&#8208;temperature melting process of manganese halide with an aluminum&#8208;clad capillary template. In this waveguide structure, the oriented scintillation photons propagated along the well&#8208;aligned scintillator and were confined within individual pixels by the aluminum reflective cladding, as substantiated from the comprehensive analysis including laser diffraction experiments. Consequently, thanks to isolated light&#8208;crosstalk channels and robust light output due to increased thickness, ultra&#8208;high spatial resolutions of 60.8 lp mm&#8722;1 and 51.7 lp mm&#8722;1 at an MTF of 0.2 were achieved on 0.5&#160;mm and even 1&#160;mm thick scintillators, respectively, which both exceed the pore diameter of the capillary arrays template (&#934; = 10&#160;&#956;m). To the best of our knowledge, these micrometer resolutions are among the highest reported for metal halide scintillators and have never been demonstrated on such thick scintillators. This work presents an avenue to the demand for thick scintillators in high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging across diverse scientific and practical fields.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exacerbation of inherent light scattering with increasing scintillator thickness poses a major challenge for balancing the thickness-dependent spatial resolution and scintillation brightness in X-ray imaging scintillators. Herein, we fabricated a thick pixelated needle-like array scintillator capable of micrometer resolution via waveguide structure engineering. Specifically, this involves integrating a straightforward low-temperature melting process of manganese halide with an aluminum-clad capillary template. In this waveguide structure, the oriented scintillation photons propagated along the well-aligned scintillator and were confined within individual pixels by the aluminum reflective cladding, as substantiated from the comprehensive analysis including laser diffraction experiments. Consequently, thanks to isolated light-crosstalk channels and robust light output due to increased thickness, ultra-high spatial resolutions of 60.8 lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 51.7 lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at an MTF of 0.2 were achieved on 0.5&#160;mm and even 1&#160;mm thick scintillators, respectively, which both exceed the pore diameter of the capillary arrays template (&#934; = 10&#160;&#956;m). To the best of our knowledge, these micrometer resolutions are among the highest reported for metal halide scintillators and have never been demonstrated on such thick scintillators.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvating Ionic Liquid Electrolytes Enabling Stable High&#8208;Nickel Cathode in Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) are promising to develop high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, ILEs normally face the challenge of sluggish Li+ transport due to increased ions clustering caused by Coulombic interactions. Here we discover a type of anion&#8208;reinforced solvating ionic liquid electrolytes (ASILEs) that reduce ions clustering by enhancing the anion&#8208;cation coordination and promoting more anions to enter the internal solvation sheath of Li+ to address this concern. Our designed ASILEs, incorporating chlorinated hydrocarbons and two anions, bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI&#8722;) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (TFSI&#8722;), aim to enhance Li+ transport ability, stabilize the interface of the high&#8208;nickel cathode material (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811), and retain fire&#8208;retardant properties. With this ASILEs, the Li/NCM811 cell exhibits a high initial specific capacity (203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C), outstanding capacity retention (81.6% over 500 cycles at 1.0 C), and an excellent average Coulombic efficiency (99.9% over 500 cycles at 1.0 C). Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;level Li/NCM811 pouch cell achieves a notable energy density of 386&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, indicating the practical feasibility of this electrolyte. This research offers a practical solution and fundamental guidance for the rational design of advanced ILEs, enabling the development of high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>Mechanically Robust Self&#8208;organized Crack&#8208;free Nanocellular Graphene.with Outstanding Electrochemical Properties in Sodium ion Battery</title>

Abstract
Crack&#8208;free nanocellular graphenes are attractive materials with extraordinary mechanical and electrochemical properties, but their homogeneous synthesis on the centimeter scale is challenging. Here, we report a strong nanocellular graphene film achieved by the self&#8208;organization of carbon atoms using liquid metal dealloying and employing a defect&#8208;free amorphous precursor. This study demonstrates that a Bi melt strongly catalyzes the self&#8208;structuring of graphene layers at low processing temperatures. The robust nanoarchitectured graphene displays a high&#8208;genus seamless framework and exhibits remarkable tensile strength (34.8&#160;MPa) and high electrical conductivity (1.6 &#215; 104 S/m). This unique material has excellent potential for flexible and high&#8208;rate sodium&#8208;ion battery applications.

         <title>Emerging&#8239;Strategies for the Synthesis of Correlated Single Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
People have been looking for an energy&#8208;efficient and sustainable method to produce future chemicals for decades. Heterogeneous single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with atomic dispersion of robust, well&#8208;characterized active centers are highly desirable. In particular, correlated SACs with cooperative interaction between adjacent single atoms allow the switching of the single&#8208;site pathway to the dual or multi&#8208;site pathway, thus promoting bimolecular or more complex reactions for the synthesis of fine chemicals. Herein, we will feature the structural uniqueness of correlated SACs, including the inter&#8208;metal distance and electronic interaction in homo/heteronuclear metal sites. We will summarize recent advances in the production methods of correlated SACs, showcasing the research status and challenges in traditional methods (such as pyrolysis, wet impregnation, and confined synthesis) for building a comprehensive multi&#8208;metallic SAC library. Emerging strategies such as process automation and continuous&#8208;flow synthesis are highlighted, minimizing the inconsistency in laboratory batch production and allowing high throughput screening and up&#8208;scaling toward the next&#8208;stage chemical production by correlated SACs.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Touch Sensor for Simultaneous Tactile and Slip Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Touch is a general term to describe mechanical stimuli. It is extremely difficult to develop touch sensors that can detect different modes of contact forces due to their low sensitivity and data decoupling. Simultaneously conducting tactile and slip sensing presents significant challenges for the design, structure, and performance of sensors. In this work, we have achieved a highly sensitive sandwich&#8208;structured sensor by exploiting the porosity and compressive modulus of the sensor's functional layer materials. The sensor shows an ultra&#8208;high sensitivity of 1167 kPa&#8722;1 and a low&#8208;pressure detection limit of 1.34&#160;Pa due to its considerably low compression modulus of 23.8&#160;Pa. Due to this ultra&#8208;high sensitivity, coupled with spectral analysis, it allows for dual&#8208;mode detection of both tactile and slip sensations simultaneously. This novel fabrication strategy and signal analysis method provides a new direction for the development of tactile/slip sensors.

         <title>Targeting Compact and Ordered Emitters by Supramolecular Dynamic Interactions for High&#8208;performance Organic Ambient Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have received intense attention due to their fascinating optical properties and advanced optoelectronic applications. The promotion of intersystem crossing (ISC) and minimalization of nonradiative dissipation under ambient conditions are key prerequisites for realizing high&#8208;performance organic RTP. However, the ISC process is generally inefficient for organic fluorogens and the populated triplet excitons are always too susceptible to be well stabilized by conventional means. Particularly, organizing organic fluorophores into compact and ordered entities by supramolecular dynamic interactions has proven to be a newly&#8208;emerged strategy to greatly boost the ISC process and immensely suppress the non&#8208;radiative relaxations, facilitating the population and stabilization of triplet excitons to access high&#8208;performance organic RTP. Consequently, well&#8208;defined organic emitters enabled robust RTP emission even in the solution state, thus greatly extending the applications. Here, this review is focused on a timely and brief introduction to recent progress in tailoring ordered high&#8208;performance RTP emitters by supramolecular dynamic interactions. Their typical preparation strategies, optoelectronic properties and applications are thoroughly summarized. In the summary section, key challenges and perspectives of this field are highlighted to suggest potential directions for future study.

         <dc:description>
Downsized particles of a porphyrin covalent organic framework are synthesized using a tritylated amine as a protected precursor. The downsized particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction because of the larger contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals the importance of particle size and its control strategy in covalent organic framework catalysts.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising electrocatalyst platforms owing to their designability, porosity, and stability. Recently, COFs with various chemical structures are developed as efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction catalysts. However, controlling the morphology of COF catalysts remains a challenge, which can limit their electrocatalytic performance. Especially, while porphyrin COFs show promising catalytic properties, their particle size is mostly large and uncontrolled because of the severe aggregation of crystallites. In this work, a new synthetic methodology for rationally downsized COF catalyst particles is reported, where a tritylated amine is employed as a novel protected precursor for COF synthesis. Trityl protection provides high solubility to a porphyrin precursor, while its deprotection proceeds in situ under typical COF synthesis conditions. Subsequent homogeneous nucleation and colloidal growth yield smaller COF particles than a conventional synthesis, owing to suppressed crystallite aggregation. The downsized COF particles exhibit superior catalytic performance in electrochemical CO2 reduction, with higher CO production rate and faradaic efficiency compared to conventional COF particles. The improved performance is attributed to the higher contact area with a conductive agent. This study reveals particle size as an important factor for the evaluation of COF electrocatalysts and provides a strategy to control it.

         <title>A Catalyst&#8208;like System Enables Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;quality perovskite films are essential for achieving the high performance of optoelectronic devices. However, solution&#8208;processed perovskite films are known to suffer from compositional and structural inhomogeneity due to lack of systematic control over the kinetics during the formation. Here, we successfully enhanced the microscopic homogeneity of perovskite films by modulating the conversion reaction kinetics using a catalyst&#8208;like system generated by a foaming agent. The chemical and structural evolution during this catalytic conversion was revealed by a multimodal synchrotron toolkit with spatial resolutions spanning many length scales. Combining these insights with computational investigations, a cyclic conversion pathway model was developed that yielded exceptional perovskite homogeneity due to enhanced conversion, having a power conversion efficiency of 24.51% for photovoltaic devices. Our work establishes a systematic link between processing of precursor and homogeneity of the perovskite films.

         <title>Giant Blue Energy Harvesting in Two&#8208;Dimensional Polymer Membranes with Spatially Aligned Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel ion transporting membranes enhance power density during osmotic energy conversion. In this study, positively charged propidium&#8208;based 2D polymer membranes are synthesized with both skeleton and intrinsic space charges. When mixing artificial seawater and river water, a great power density of 48 W m&#8722;2 is achieved, surpassing the performance of most nanofluidic membranes.








Abstract
Blue energy between seawater and river water is attracting increasing interest, as one of the sustainable and renewable energy resources that can be harvested from water. Within the reverse electrodialysis applied in blue energy conversion, novel membranes with nanoscale confinement that function as selective ion transport mediums are currently in high demand for realizing higher power density. The primary challenge lies in constructing well&#8208;defined nanochannels that allow for low&#8208;energy barrier transport. This work proposes a concept for nanofluidic channels with a simultaneous dual electrostatic effect that can enhance both ion selectivity and flux. To actualize this, this work has synthesized propidium iodide&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional polymer (PI&#8208;2DP) membranes possessing both skeleton charge and intrinsic space charge, which are spatially aligned along the ion transport pathway. The dual charge design of PI&#8208;2DP significantly enhances the electrostatic interaction between the translocating anions and the cationic polymer framework, and a high anion selectivity coefficient (&#8776;0.8) is reached. When mixing standard artificial seawater and river water, this work achieves a considerable power density of 48.4&#160;W m&#8722;2, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art nanofluidic membranes. Moreover, when applied between the Mediterranean Sea and the Elbe River, an output power density of 42.2&#160;W m&#8722;2 is achieved by the PI&#8208;2DP. This nanofluidic membrane design with dual&#8208;layer charges will inspire more innovative development of ion&#8208;selective channels for blue energy conversion that will contribute to global energy consumption.

         <title>Reconfigurable Growth of Engineered Living Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered living materials made from hydrogels with living yeast and magnetic particles can grow repeatedly into user&#8208;defined geometries. This process relies on the growth of living cells, magnetic forces, and elastic recovery of the hydrogel. This manufacturing strategy combining mechanical confinements and biological growth contributes to a future where objects are grown and not merely processed.








Abstract
The growth of multicellular organisms is a process akin to additive manufacturing where cellular proliferation and mechanical boundary conditions, among other factors, drive morphogenesis. Engineers have limited ability to engineer morphogenesis to manufacture goods or to reconfigure materials comprised of biomass. Herein, a method that uses biological processes to grow and regrow magnetic engineered living materials (mELMs) into desired geometries is reported. These composites contain Saccharomyces cerevisiae and magnetic particles within a hydrogel matrix. The reconfigurable manufacturing process relies on the growth of living cells, magnetic forces, and elastic recovery of the hydrogel. The mELM then adopts a form in an external magnetic field. Yeast within the material proliferates, resulting in 259 &#177; 14% volume expansion. Yeast proliferation fixes the magnetic deformation, even when the magnetic field is removed. The shape fixity can be up to 99.3 &#177; 0.3%. The grown mELM can recover up to 73.9 &#177; 1.9% of the original form by removing yeast cell walls. The directed growth and recovery process can be repeated at least five times. This work enables ELMs to be processed and reprocessed into user&#8208;defined geometries without external material deposition.

         <title>Stabilizing Top Interface by Molecular Locking Strategy with Polydentate Chelating Biomaterials toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells in Ambient Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular locking strategy is proposed to stabilize top interface by adopting polydentate ligand green biomaterial 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;d&#8208;erythro&#8208;pentafuranous&#8208;1&#8208;ulose&#8208;3,5&#8208;dibenzoate (DDPUD) to manipulate the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films. The ingenious polydentate ligand chelating is translated into reduced interfacial defects, released interfacial stress, and enhanced moisture resistance. The DDPUD&#8208;modified device achieves an enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 23.17% to 24.47%.








Abstract
The instability of top interface induced by interfacial defects and residual tensile strain hinders the realization of long&#8208;term stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p regular perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, one molecular locking strategy is reported to stabilize top interface by adopting polydentate ligand green biomaterial 2&#8208;deoxy&#8208;2,2&#8208;difluoro&#8208;d&#8208;erythro&#8208;pentafuranous&#8208;1&#8208;ulose&#8208;3,5&#8208;dibenzoate (DDPUD) to manipulate the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films. Both experimental and theoretical evidence collectively uncover that the uncoordinated Pb2+ ions, halide vacancy, and/or I&#9472;Pb antisite defects can be effectively healed and locked by firm chemical anchoring on the surface of perovskite films. The ingenious polydentate ligand chelating is translated into reduced interfacial defects, increased carrier lifetimes, released interfacial stress, and enhanced moisture resistance, which should be liable for strengthened top interface stability and inhibited interfacial nonradiative recombination. The universality of the molecular locking strategy is certified by employing different perovskite compositions. The DDPUD modification achieves an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.17&#8211;24.47%, which is one of the highest PCEs ever reported for the devices prepared in ambient air. The unsealed DDPUD&#8208;modified devices maintain 98.18% and 88.10% of their initial PCEs after more than 3000&#160;h under a relative humidity of 10&#8211;20% and after 1728&#160;h at 65 &#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Intergrating Hollow Multishelled Structure and High Entropy Engineering toward Enhanced Mechano&#8208;Electrochemical Properties in Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high entropy oxide (LiFeZnNiCoMn)3O4 hollow multishelled sphere (HEO&#8208;HoMS) with multiple electroactive elements is successfully developed. Benefiting from the delicate cocontrol from molecule to microstructure, HEO&#8208;HoMS provides impressively high specific capacity and long life span for lithium storage. This work may inspire more thoughts on rational multiscale design of conversion&#8208;type electrodes.








Abstract
Hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) are attracting great interest in lithium&#8208;ion batteries as the conversion anodes, owing to their superior buffering effect and mechanical stability. Given the synthetic challenges, especially elemental diffusion barrier in the multimetal combinations, this complex structure design has been realized in low&#8208; and medium&#8208;entropy compounds so far. It means that poor reaction reversibility and low intrinsic conductivity remain largely unresolved. Here, a hollow multishelled (LiFeZnNiCoMn)3O4 high entropy oxide (HEO) is developed through integrating molecule and microstructure engineering. As expected, the HoMS design exhibits significant targeting functionality, yielding satisfactory structure and cycling stability. Meanwhile, the abundant oxygen defects and optimized electronic structure of HEO accelerate the lithiation kinetics, while the retention of the parent lattice matrix enables reversible lithium storage, which is validated by rigorous in situ tests and theoretical simulations. Benefiting from these combined properties, such hollow multishelled HEO anode can deliver a specific capacity of 967 mAh g&#8722;1 (89% capacity retention) after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. The synergistic lattice and volume stability showcased in this work holds great promise in guiding the material innovations for the next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

Abstract
The diagnosis and treatment of solid tumors have under gone significant advancements marked by a trend towards increased specificity and integration of imaging and therapeutic functions. The multifaceted nature of inorganic oxide nanomaterials (IONs) which boast optical, magnetic, ultrasonic, and biochemical modulatory properties, makes them ideal building blocks for developing multifunctional nanoplatforms. A promising class of materials that have emerged in this context is peptide&#8208;functionalized inorganic oxide nanomaterials (PFIONs) which have demonstrated excellent performance in multifunctional imaging and therapy, making them potential candidates for advancing solid tumor diagnosis and treatment. Owing to the functionalities of peptides in tumor targeting, penetration, responsiveness, and therapy, well&#8208;designed PFIONs can specifically accumulate and release therapeutic or imaging agents at the solid tumor sites, enabling precise imaging and effective treatment. This review provides an overview of the recent advances in the use of PFIONs for the imaging and treatment of solid tumors, highlighting the superiority of imaging and therapeutic integration as well as synergistic treatment. Moreover, the review discusses the challenges and prospects of PFIONs in depth, aiming to promote the intersection of the interdisciplinary to facilitate their clinical translation and the development of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic systems by optimizing the material systems.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Second Long Lifetime Triplet Exciton Reservoir for Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), achieving high efficiency requires effective triplet exciton confinement by carrier&#8208;transporting materials, which typically have higher triplet energy (ET) than the emitter, leading to poor stability. Here we report an electron&#8208;transporting material (ETM), whose ET is 0.32&#176;eV lower than that of the emitter. In devices, it surprisingly exhibits strong confinement effect and generates excellent efficiency. Additionally, the device operational lifetime is 4.9 times longer than the device with a standard ETM, TPBi (whose ET 0.36&#176;eV higher than the emitter). This anomalous finding is ascribed to the exceptionally long triplet state lifetime (&#8764;0.2&#176;s) of the ETM. We name it as long&#8208;lifetime triplet exciton reservoir (LTER) effect. The systematic analysis revealed that the long triplet lifetime of ETM can compensate the requirement for high ET with the help of endothermic energy transfer. Such combination of low ET and long lifetime provide equivalent exciton confinement effect and high molecular stability simultaneously. It offers a novel molecular design paradigm for breaking the dilemma between high efficiency and prolonged operational lifetime in OLEDs.

         <title>An Anti&#8208;Oxidative and Active Shrinkage Hydrogel Integratedly Promotes Re&#8208;Epithelization and Skin Constriction for Enhancing Wound Closure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Delayed re&#8208;epithelization and weakened skin contractions are the two primary factors that hinder wound closure in large&#8208;scale acute or chronic wounds. However, effective strategies for targeting these two aspects concurrently are still lacking. Herein, we constructed an antioxidative active&#8208;shrinkage hydrogel (AHF@AS Gel) that could integratedly promote re&#8208;epithelization and skin constriction to accelerate large&#8208;scale acute and diabetic chronic wound closure. The AHF@AS Gel is encapsulated by antioxidative amino&#8208; and hydroxyl&#8208;modified C70 fullerene (AHF) and a thermosensitive active shrinkage hydrogel (AS Gel). Specifically, AHF relieves overactivated inflammation, prevents cellular apoptosis, and promotes fibroblast migration in vitro by reducing excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). Notably, the AHF@AS Gel achieved &#8764;2.7&#8208;fold and &#8764;1.7&#8208;fold better re&#8208;epithelization in acute wounds and chronic diabetic wounds, respectively, significantly contributing to the promotion of wound closure. Using proteomic profiling and mechanistic studies, we identified that the AHF@AS Gel efficiently promoted the transition of the inflammatory and proliferative phases to the remodeling phase. Notably, we demonstrated that AS Gel alone activates the mechanosensitive epidermal growth factor receptor/Akt (EGFR/Akt) pathway and promotes cell proliferation. Our anti&#8208;oxidative active shrinkage hydrogel offers a comprehensive strategy for acute wound and diabetic chronic wound closure via biochemistry regulation integrating with mechanical forces stimulation.

         <title>Strontium&#8208;Containing Piezoelectric Biofilm Promotes Dentin Tissue Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It remains an obstacle to induce the regeneration of hard dentin tissue in clinical settings. To overcome this, a P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) piezoelectric film with 2wt% SrCl2 addition is designed. The biofilm shows a high flexibility, a harmonious biocompatibility, and a large piezoelectric d33 coefficient of 14 pC N&#8722;1, all contributing to building an electric microenvironment that favor the recruitment of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and their differentiation into odontoblasts during normal chewing, speaking, etc. On the other hand, the strontium ions can be gradually released from the film, thus promoting DPSC odonto&#8208;differentiation. In vivo experiments also demonstrate that the film induces the release of dentin minerals and regeneration of dentin tissue. In the large animal dentin defect models, this piezoelectric film induces in situ dentin tissue formation effectively over a period of three months. This study illustrates a therapeutic potential of the piezoelectric film to improve dentin tissue repair in clinical settings.

         <title>Selective Induction of Molecular Assembly to Tissue&#8208;level Anisotropy on Peptide&#8208;based Optoelectronic Cardiac Biointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The conduction efficiency of ions in excitable tissues and of charged species in organic conjugated materials both benefit from having ordered domains and anisotropic pathways. In this study, we present a photocurrent&#8208;generating cardiac biointerface that investigates the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to geometrically comply to biomacromolecular cues differentially assembled on a conductive nanogrooved substrate. Through a polymeric surface&#8208;templated approach, photoconductive substrates with symmetric peptide&#8208;quaterthiophene (4T)&#8208;peptide units assembled as 1D nanostructures on nanoimprinted polyalkylthiophene (P3HT) surface are developed. The 4T&#8208;based peptides studied here form 1D nanostructures on prepatterned polyalkylthiophene substrates, as directed by hydrogen bonding, aromatic interactions between 4T and P3HT, and physical confinement on the nanogrooves. We observed that smaller 4T&#8208;peptide units that can achieve a higher degree of assembly order within the polymeric templates serve as a more efficient driver of cardiac cytoskeletal anisotropy than merely presenting aligned &#8208;RGD bioadhesive epitopes on a nanotopographic surface. These results unravel some insights on how cardiomyocytes perceive sub&#8208;micron dimensionality, local molecular order, and characteristics of surface cues in their immediate environment. Overall, our work offers a cardiac patterning platform that presents the possibility of a gene modification&#8208;free cardiac photostimulation approach while controlling the conduction directionality of the biotic and abiotic components.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conduction efficiency of ions in excitable tissues and of charged species in organic conjugated materials both benefit from having ordered domains and anisotropic pathways. In this study, we present a photocurrent-generating cardiac biointerface that investigates the sensitivity of cardiomyocytes to geometrically comply to biomacromolecular cues differentially assembled on a conductive nanogrooved substrate. Through a polymeric surface-templated approach, photoconductive substrates with symmetric peptide-quaterthiophene (4T)-peptide units assembled as 1D nanostructures on nanoimprinted polyalkylthiophene (P3HT) surface are developed. The 4T-based peptides studied here form 1D nanostructures on prepatterned polyalkylthiophene substrates, as directed by hydrogen bonding, aromatic interactions between 4T and P3HT, and physical confinement on the nanogrooves. We observed that smaller 4T-peptide units that can achieve a higher degree of assembly order within the polymeric templates serve as a more efficient driver of cardiac cytoskeletal anisotropy than merely presenting aligned -RGD bioadhesive epitopes on a nanotopographic surface. These results unravel some insights on how cardiomyocytes perceive sub-micron dimensionality, local molecular order, and characteristics of surface cues in their immediate environment. Overall, our work offers a cardiac patterning platform that presents the possibility of a gene modification-free cardiac photostimulation approach while controlling the conduction directionality of the biotic and abiotic components.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Phenothiazine Derivatives as Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Cathodes with Adjustable Dropout Voltage and Cycle Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Compared with conventional inorganic materials, organic electrodes are competitive candidates for secondary battery cathodes due to their resourcefulness, environmental friendliness, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Much effort has been devoted at the level of chemical structure, while ignoring the impact of molecular aggregation on battery behavior. Herein, we design a series of organic molecules with two electrochemically active phenothiazine groups linked by different lengths of alkyl chain to regulate molecular symmetry and crystallinity. The results emphasize the equally important role of molecular aggregation and chemical structure for battery performance. Among them, 2PTZ&#8208;C7H14|Li cell exhibits the most impressive cycle and rate performance. At the high rate of 50 C, it can still deliver a capacity of 63.4 mA h g&#8722;1 and 74.5% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles. Besides, the dropout voltage of 2PTZ&#8208;C9H18|Li cell is only 52 mV, which is among the lowest reported for lithium&#8208;organic batteries to the best of our knowledge.

         <title>Efficient Dual Mechanisms Boost the Efficiency of Ternary Solar Cells with Two Compatible Polymer Donors to Exceed 19%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ternary strategy, introducing a third component into binary blend, opens a simple and promising avenue to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). It is worth noting that the introduction of wide bandgap polymer donors (PDs) as the third component can not only better utilize sunlight but also has the potential to improve the mechanical and thermal stability of the active layer. However, efficient ternary OSCs (TOSCs) with two PDs are rarely reported due to the inferior compatibility of polymers and shortage of efficient PDs to match with non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. Herein, two PDs with different end&#8208;group elements (PBB&#8208;F and PBB&#8208;Cl) are adopted in the dual&#8208;PDs ternary systems to explore the underlying mechanisms and improve their photovoltaic performance. The findings demonstrate that the third components exhibit excellent miscibility with PM6 and are embedded in the host donor to form alloy&#8208;like phase, which plays a crucial role in optimizing film morphology. A more profound mechanism for enhancing efficiency through dual mechanisms, that are the guest energy transfer to PM6 and charge transport at the donor/acceptor interface, has been proposed. Consequently, the PM6:PBB&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 TOSCs achieve impressive PCE of over 19%. Furthermore, the TOSCs exhibit better thermal stability than that of binary OSCs due to the reduction in spatial site resistance resulting from a more tightly entangled long&#8208;chain structure. This work not only provides an effective approach to fabricate high&#8208;performance TOSCs, but also demonstrates the importance of developing dual compatible PD materials.

         <title>Secondary Amines Functionalized Organocatalytic Iodine Redox for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs) based on the cooperative redox of cations and iodine anions at the anode and cathode respectively, are attracting increasing interest because of high capacity and safety. However, the full&#8208;cell performance is limited by the sluggish iodine redox kinetics between iodide and polyiodide involving multiple electron transfer steps, and the undesirable shuttling effect of polyiodides. Here we report a versatile conjugated microporous polymer functionalized with secondary amine groups as an organocatalytic cathode for ADIB, which can be positively charged and electrostatically adsorb iodide, and organocatalyze iodine redox reactions through the amine groups. Both theoretical calculations and controlled experiments confirm that the secondary amine groups confine (poly)iodide species via hydrogen bonding, which is essential for accelerating iodine redox kinetics and reducing the polyiodide shuttling effect. The ADIB achieves an ultra&#8208;high capacity of 730 mAh g&#8722;1 with an ultra&#8208;small overpotential of 47&#160;mV at 1 A g&#8722;1, which also exhibits excellent rate performance and long cycling stability with a capacity retention of 74% after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5&#8201;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the promise of developing organocatalysts for accelerating electrochemical processes, which remains a virtually unexplored area in electrocatalyst design for clean energy applications.

         <title>Underpotential Deposition of 3d Transition Metals: Versatile Electrosynthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts on Oxidized Carbon Supports</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) has become a popular strategy for tuning activity and selectivity towards specific pathways. However, conventional SAC synthesis methods require high temperatures and pressures, complicated procedures, and expensive equipment. Recently, underpotential deposition (UPD) has been investigated as a promising alternative, yielding high&#8208;loading SAC electrodes under ambient conditions and within minutes. Yet only few studies have employed UPD to synthesize SACs, and all have been limited to UPD of Cu. In this work, we report a flexible UPD approach for synthesis of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni SACs directly on oxidized, commercially available carbon electrodes. We investigate the UPD mechanism using in&#8208;situ x&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and, finally, assess the catalytic performance of a UPD&#8208;synthesized Co SAC for electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia. Our findings expand upon the usefulness and versatility of UPD for SAC synthesis, with hopes of enabling future research towards realization of fast, reliable, and fully electrified SAC synthesis processes.

         <title>Mitocytosis Mediated by an Enzyme&#8208;Activable Mitochondrion&#8208;Disturbing Polymer&#8208;Drug Conjugate Enhances Active Penetration in Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;activable mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine assembled from an amphiphilic block polymer&#8208;drug conjugate is developed for achieving efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) crossing and deep glioblastoma (GBM) penetration. This nanomedicine interferes mitochondrial homeostasis, which mediates the process of mitocytosis for mitochondrial quality control, facilitating mitosome&#8208;mediated active transcellular transport in GBM tissues.








Abstract
The application of nanomedicines for glioblastoma (GBM) therapy is hampered by the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the dense glioblastoma tissue. To achieve efficient BBB crossing and deep GBM penetration, this work demonstrates a strategy of active transcellular transport of a mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine, pGBEMA22&#8208;b&#8208;pSSPPT9 (GBEPPT), in the GBM tissue through mitocytosis. GBEPPT is computer&#8208;aided designed and prepared by self&#8208;assembling a conjugate of an amphiphilic block polymer and a drug podophyllotoxin (PPT). When GBEPPT is delivered to the tumor site, overexpressed &#947;&#8208;glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) on the brain&#8211;blood endothelial cell, or the GBM cell triggered enzymatic hydrolysis of &#947;&#8208;glutamylamide on GBEPPT to reverse its negative charge to positive. Positively charged GBEPPT rapidly enter into the cell and target the mitochondria. These GBEPPT disturb the homeostasis of mitochondria, inducing mitocytosis&#8208;mediated extracellular transport of GBEPPT to the neighboring cells via mitosomes. This intracellular&#8208;to&#8208;intercellular delivery cycle allows GBEPPT to penetrate deeply into the GBM parenchyma, and exert sustainable action of PPT released from GBEPPT on the tumor cells along its penetration path at the tumor site, thus improving the anti&#8208;GBM effect. The process of mitocytosis mediated by the mitochondrion&#8208;disturbing nanomedicine may offer great potential in enhancing drug penetration through malignant tissues, especially poorly permeable solid tumors.

         <title>Interfacial Rivet to Fill Structural Defects: A Spacer Engineering Gift for 3D Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a strategy on the management of grain boundaries in pristine 3D perovskite films based on seed solutions of 2D (HA)2(MA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 perovskites, and precisely anchored to the grain boundaries of the 3D perovskite. This effective defect management results in an impressive PCE of 25.07%, which has far&#8208;reaching implications for promoting the substantial development of PSCs.








Abstract
The combination of 2D and 3D perovskites to passivate surfaces or interfaces with a high concentration of defects shows great promise for improving the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Constructing high&#8208;quality perovskite film systems by precisely modulating 2D perovskites with good morphologies and growth sites on 3D perovskite films remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of spacer&#8208;engineered surface reactions. In this study, phase&#8208;pure 2D (HA)2(MA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 perovskites with a controlled number of layers (n) are separated on a large scale and exploited as interface rivets to optimize 3D perovskite films, resulting in tunable film structural defects and grain boundaries. The optimized PSCs system benefits from a reduction in non&#8208;radiative recombination, resulting in improved optical performance, higher mobility, and lower trap density. The corresponding device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 25%, especially for voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). The quality and uniformity of the perovskite films are further confirmed using large&#8208;area devices with an active area of 14 cm2, which exhibits a PCE of more than 21.24%. The high&#8208;quality thin&#8208;film system based on the 2D perovskites presented herein provides a new perspective for improving the efficiency and stability of PSCs.

         <title>Dynamically Reconstructed Triple&#8208;Copper&#8208;Vacancy Associates Confined in Cu Nanowires Enabling High&#8208;Rate and Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrochemically reconstructed Cu&#8208;based catalysts always exhibit enhanced CO2&#160;electroreduction performance; however, it still remains ambiguous whether the reconstructed Cu vacancies have a substantial impact on CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ reactivity. Herein, we first construct Cu vacancies through electrochemical reduction of Cu&#8208;based nanowires, in which high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy image manifests the formation of triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates with different concentrations, confirmed by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy discloses the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates favor *CO adsorption and fast *CO dimerization. Moreover, density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations unravel the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates endow the nearby Cu sites with enriched and disparate local charge density, which enhances the *CO adsorption and reduces the CO&#8211;CO coupling barrier, affirmed by the decreased *CO dimerization energy barrier by 0.4&#160;eV. As a result, the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates confined in Cu nanowires achieve a high Faradaic efficiency of over 80% for C2+ products in a wide current density range of 400&#8211;800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming most reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Black Arsenic Phosphorus Mid&#8208;Wave Infrared Barrier Detector with High Detectivity at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The barrier structure has been designed to enhance the operating temperature of the infrared detector, thereby improving the efficiency of collecting photogenerated carriers and reducing dark current generation, without suppressing the photocurrent. However, the development of barrier detectors using conventional materials is limited due to the strict requirements for lattice and band matching. In this study, we have designed a high&#8208;performance unipolar barrier detector utilizing a black arsenic phosphorus/molybdenum disulfide/black phosphorus van der Waals heterojunction. Our device exhibits a broad response bandwidth ranging from visible light to mid&#8208;wave infrared (520&#160;nm to 4.6 &#956;m), with a blackbody detectivity of 2.7&#160;&#215; 1010 cmHz&#8722;1/2W&#8722;1 in the mid&#8208;wave infrared range at room temperature. Moreover, the optical absorption anisotropy of black arsenic phosphorus enables polarization resolution detection, achieving a polarization extinction ratio of 35.5 at 4.6 &#956;m. We have successfully demonstrated mid&#8208;wave infrared imaging of the device at room temperature, highlighting the significant potential of barrier devices based on van der Waals heterojunctions in mid&#8208;wave infrared detection.

         <title>Actuating Liquid Crystals Rapidly and Reversibly by using Chemical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microtubules and catalytic motor proteins underlie the microscale actuation of living materials, and they have been used in reconstituted systems to harness chemical energy to drive new states of organization of soft matter (e.g., liquid crystals (LCs)). Such materials, however, are fragile and challenging to translate to technological contexts. We report rapid (sub&#8208;second) and reversible changes in orientation of LCs at room temperature using reactions between gaseous hydrogen and oxygen that are catalyzed by Pd/Au surfaces. Surface chemical analysis and computational chemistry studies confirm that dissociative adsorption of H2 on the Pd/Au films reduces pre&#8208;adsorbed O and generates 1 ML of adsorbed H, driving nitrile&#8208;containing LCs from a perpendicular to planar orientation. Subsequent exposure to O2 leads to oxidation of the adsorbed H, reformation of adsorbed O on the Pd/Au surface, and a return of the LC to its initial orientation. The role of surface composition and reaction kinetics in determining the LC dynamics are described along with a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of microactuation of beads. These results provide fresh ideas for utilizing chemical energy and catalysis to reversibly actuate functional LCs on the microscale.

Abstract
While layered metal oxides remain the dominant cathode materials for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8208;ion batteries, conversion&#8208;type cathodes such as sulfur present unique opportunities in developing cheaper, safer and more energy&#8208;dense next&#8208;generation battery technologies. There has been remarkable progress in advancing the laboratory scale lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) coin cells to a high level of performance. However, the relevant strategies cannot be readily translated to practical cell formats such as pouch cells and even battery pack. Here we address these key technical challenges by molecular engineering of the Li metal for hydrophobicization, fluorination and thus favorable anode chemistry. The introduced tris(2,4&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenyl) phosphite (TBP) and tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBA+F&#8722;) as well as cellulose membrane by rolling enables the formation of a functional thin layer that eliminates the vulnerability of Li metal towards the already demanding environment required (1.55% relative humidity) for cell production and gives rise to LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to suppress dendrite growth. As a result, Li&#8208;S pouch cells assembled at a pilot production line survive 400 full charge/discharge cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.55% and impressive rate performance of 1.5 C. A cell&#8208;level energy density of 417&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and power density of 2766&#160;W kg&#8722;1 are also delivered via multilayer Li&#8208;S pouch cell. The Li&#8208;S battery pack can even power an unmanned aerial vehicle of 3&#160;kg for a fairly long flight time. Our work represents a big step forward acceleration in Li&#8208;S battery marketization for future energy storage featuring improved safety, sustainability, higher energy density as well as reduced cost.

&lt;p&gt;While layered metal oxides remain the dominant cathode materials for the state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries, conversion-type cathodes such as sulfur present unique opportunities in developing cheaper, safer and more energy-dense next-generation battery technologies. There has been remarkable progress in advancing the laboratory scale lithium-sulfur (Li-S) coin cells to a high level of performance. However, the relevant strategies cannot be readily translated to practical cell formats such as pouch cells and even battery pack. Here we address these key technical challenges by molecular engineering of the Li metal for hydrophobicization, fluorination and thus favorable anode chemistry.

         <title>Biomimetic Multimodal Receptors for Comprehensive Artificial Human Somatosensory System</title>

Abstract
Electronic skin (e&#8208;skin) capable of acquiring environmental and physiological information have attracted interest for healthcare, robotics, and human&#8208;machine interaction. However, traditional 2D e&#8208;skin only allows for in&#8208;plane force sensing, which limits access to comprehensive stimulus feedback due to the lack of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane signal detection caused by its 3D structure. Here, a dimension&#8208;switchable bioinspired receptor is reported to achieve multimodal perception by exploiting film kirigami. It offers the detection of in&#8208;plane (pressure and bending) and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (force and airflow) signals by dynamically inducing the opening and reclosing of sensing unit. The receptor's hygroscopic and thermoelectric properties enable the sensing of humidity and temperature. Meanwhile, the thermoelectric receptor can differentiate mechanical stimuli from temperature by the voltage. The development enables a wide range of sensory capabilities of traditional e&#8208;skin and expands the applications in real life.

         <title>Drug&#8208;Loaded Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin Bacteria for Immuno&#8208;Chemo Combo Therapy in Bladder Cancer</title>

Abstract
Intravesical Bacillus Calmette&#8211;Gu&#233;rin (BCG) is a well&#8208;established strategy for managing high&#8208;risk non&#8208;muscle&#8208;invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC); however, over half of patients still experience disease recurrence or progression. Although the combined intravesical instillation of various chemotherapeutic drugs has been implemented in clinical trials to enhance the BCG therapy, the outcome is far from satisfying due to severe irritative effects and treatment intolerance at high doses. Therefore, we adopted the &#8220;biotin&#8211;streptavidin strategy&#8221; to doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;encapsulated nanoparticles within live BCG bacteria (DOX@BCG) to improve treatment outcomes. Adherence of BCG to the bladder epithelium helped precisely target DOX@BCG to the local tumor cells and simultaneously increased intratumoral transport of therapeutic drugs. DOX@BCG effectively inhibited cancer progression and prolonged the survival of rats/mice with orthotopic bladder cancer owing to synergism between BCG&#8208;immunotherapy, DOX&#8208;chemotherapy, and DOX&#8208;induced immunogenic tumor cell death; furthermore, it exhibited improved tolerance and biosafety, and established anti&#8208;tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, our drug&#8208;loaded live BCG bacterial delivery system holds considerable potential for clinical translation in the intravesical treatment of bladder cancer.

         <title>In Situ&#8208;sprayed Bioinspired Adhesive Conductive Hydrogels for Cavernous Nerve Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cavernous nerve injury (CNI), resulting in erectile dysfunction (ED), poses a significant threat to the quality of life for men. Strategies utilizing conductive hydrogels have demonstrated promising results for the treatment of peripheral nerves with a large diameter (&gt; 2&#160;mm). However, integrating convenient minimally invasive operation, anti&#8208;swelling and immunomodulatory conductive hydrogels for treating small&#8208;diameter injured cavernous nerves remains a great challenge. Here, we developed a sprayable adhesive conductive hydrogel (GACM) composed of gelatin, adenine, carbon nanotubes, and mesaconate designed for cavernous nerve repair. Multiple hydrogen bonds provided GACM with excellent adhesive and antiswelling properties, enabling it to establish a conformal electrical bridge with the damaged nerve and aiding in the regeneration process. Additionally, mesaconate&#8208;loaded GACM suppressed the release of inflammatory factors by macrophages and promoted the migration and proliferation of Schwann cells. In vivo tests demonstrated that the GACM hydrogel repaired the cavernous nerve and restored erectile function and fertility. Furthermore, we validated the feasibility of sprayable GACM in minimally invasive robotic surgery in beagles. Given the benefits of therapeutic effectiveness and clinical convenience, our research suggests a promising future for sprayable GACM materials as advanced solutions for minimally invasive nerve repair.

         <title>Near&#8208;Zero Energy Consumption Capacitors by Controlling Inhomogeneous Polarization Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Taking into account the need for energy conservation, achieving near&#8208;zero energy loss, namely ultrahigh efficiency (&#951;), in energy storage capacitors with large recoverable energy storage density (Wrec) plays an important role in applications, which is one of the major challenges in dielectric energy storage field. Here, guided by phase&#8208;field simulation, we control inhomogeneous polarization configuration with multiple symmetries and polarization magnitudes through aliovalent strongly polar double ions design to establish a strongly disordered state. A record&#8208;high &#951; of &#8764;97.4% is realized in lead&#8208;free relaxors with a large Wrec of &#8764;8.6 J cm&#8722;3, which also give a giant Wrec of &#8764;11.6 J cm&#8722;3 with an ultrahigh &#951; of &#8764;96.1% through high&#8208;energy ball milling, showing a breakthrough progress in ceramic capacitors with a maximum figure of merit of 330. This work demonstrates that controlling inhomogeneous polarization configuration is an effective avenue to develop new high&#8208;performance near&#8208;zero energy loss energy storage capacitors.

         <title>Tunable 2D Electron&#8208; and 2D Hole States Observed at Fe/SrTiO3 Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key to tuning the carrier character of a Fe/SrTiO3 interface is the oxidation state of the Fe overlayer. For Fe and FeO, hole bands emerge in the empty bandgap region of STO due to hybridization of Ti&#8208; and Fe&#8208;derived states across the interface, while for Fe3O4 overlayers, a 2D electron system is formed.








Abstract
Oxide electronics provide the key concepts and materials for enhancing silicon&#8208;based semiconductor technologies with novel functionalities. However, a basic but key property of semiconductor devices still needs to be unveiled in its oxidic counterparts: the ability to set or even switch between two types of carriers&#8212;either negatively (n) charged electrons or positively (p) charged holes. Here, direct evidence for individually emerging n&#8208; or p&#8208;type 2D band dispersions in STO&#8208;based heterostructures is provided using resonant photoelectron spectroscopy. The key to tuning the carrier character is the oxidation state of an adjacent Fe&#8208;based interface layer: For Fe and FeO, hole bands emerge in the empty bandgap region of STO due to hybridization of Ti&#8208; and Fe&#8208; derived states across the interface, while for Fe3O4 overlayers, an 2D electron system is formed. Unexpected oxygen vacancy characteristics arise for the hole&#8208;type interfaces, which as of yet had&#160;been exclusively assigned to the emergence of 2DESs. In general, this finding opens up the possibility to straightforwardly switch the type of conductivity at STO interfaces by the oxidation state of a redox overlayer.

&lt;p&gt;The key to tuning the carrier character of a Fe/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interface is the oxidation state of the Fe overlayer. For Fe and FeO, hole bands emerge in the empty bandgap region of STO due to hybridization of Ti- and Fe-derived states across the interface, while for Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers, a 2D electron system is formed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxide electronics provide the key concepts and materials for enhancing silicon-based semiconductor technologies with novel functionalities. However, a basic but key property of semiconductor devices still needs to be unveiled in its oxidic counterparts: the ability to set or even switch between two types of carriers&#8212;either negatively (n) charged electrons or positively (p) charged holes. Here, direct evidence for individually emerging n- or p-type 2D band dispersions in STO-based heterostructures is provided using resonant photoelectron spectroscopy. The key to tuning the carrier character is the oxidation state of an adjacent Fe-based interface layer: For Fe and FeO, hole bands emerge in the empty bandgap region of STO due to hybridization of Ti- and Fe- derived states across the interface, while for Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; overlayers, an 2D electron system is formed. Unexpected oxygen vacancy characteristics arise for the hole-type interfaces, which as of yet had&#160;been exclusively assigned to the emergence of 2DESs. In general, this finding opens up the possibility to straightforwardly switch the type of conductivity at STO interfaces by the oxidation state of a redox overlayer. This will extend the spectrum of phenomena in oxide electronics, including the realization of combined n/p-type all-oxide transistors or logic&#160;gates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chlorella&#8208;Loaded Antibacterial Microneedles for Microacupuncture Oxygen Therapy of Diabetic Bacterial Infected Wounds</title>

         <dc:description>
Living Chlorella&#8208;loaded poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;based microneedles (PILMN&#8208;Chl) are constructed. The PILMN&#8208;Chl combines the continuous and sufficient oxygen supply of Chlorella, the sterilization activities of PIL, and the barrier penetration capabilities of microneedles to effectively accelerate bacteria infected diabetic chronic wounds healing in vivo by topical targeted sterilization and hypoxia relief of the wounds in a two&#8208;pronged manner.








Abstract
Hypoxia and infection are urgent clinical problems in chronic diabetic wounds. Herein, living Chlorella&#8208;loaded poly(ionic liquid)&#8208;based microneedles (PILMN&#8208;Chl) are constructed for microacupuncture oxygen and antibacterial therapy against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)&#8208;infected chronic diabetic wounds. The PILMN&#8208;Chl can stably and continuously produce oxygen for more than 30&#160;h due to the photosynthesis of the loaded self&#8208;supported Chlorella. By combining the barrier penetration capabilities of microneedles, the continuous and sufficient oxygen supply of Chlorella, and the sterilization activities of PIL, the PILMN&#8208;Chl can accelerate chronic diabetic wounds in vivo by topical targeted sterilization and hypoxia relief in deep parts of wounds. Thus, the self&#8208;oxygen produced microneedles modality may provide a promising and facile therapeutic strategy for treating chronic, hypoxic, and infected diabetic wounds.

         <title>A Nanoscale Trans&#8208;Platinum(II)&#8208;Based Supramolecular Coordination Self&#8208;Assembly with a Distinct Anticancer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale trans&#8208;platinum(II)&#8208;based supramolecular coordination self&#8208;assembly Pt&#8211;tetracarboxylporphyrin (TCPP)&#8211;benzoic acid (BA) is synthesized. In presence of H2O2, Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA undergoes decomposition and generates bioactive trans&#8208;Pt(II) and TCPP&#8211;Pt species, which can induce unconventional interstrand cross&#8208;links and groove binding with DNA, respectively. These different mechanisms of action from cisplatin make Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA kill Pt&#8208;resistant cancer cells efficiently.








Abstract
Drug resistance significantly hampers the clinical application of existing platinum&#8208;based anticancer drugs. New platinum medications that possess distinct mechanisms of action are highly desired for the treatment of Pt&#8208;resistant cancers. Herein, a nanoscale trans&#8208;platinum(II)&#8208;based supramolecular coordination self&#8208;assembly (Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA) is prepared via using trans&#8208;[PtCl2(pyridine)(NH3)] (transpyroplatin), tetracarboxylporphyrin (TCPP), and benzoic acid (BA) as building blocks to combat drug resistance in platinum&#8208;based chemotherapy. Mechanistic studies indicate that Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA shows a hydrogen&#8208;peroxide&#8208;responsive dissociation behavior along with the generation of bioactive trans&#8208;Pt(II) and TCPP&#8211;Pt species. Different from cisplatin, these degradation products interact with DNA via interstrand cross&#8208;links and small groove binding, and induce significant upregulation of cell&#8208;death&#8208;related proteins such as p53, cleaved caspase 3, p21, and phosphorylated H2A histone family member X in cisplatin&#8208;resistant cancer cells. As a result, Pt&#8211;TCPP&#8211;BA exhibits potent killing effects against Pt&#8208;resistant tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this work not only provides a new platinum drug for combating drug&#8208;resistant cancer but also offers a new paradigm for the development of platinum&#8208;based supramolecular anticancer drugs.

         <title>Configurational Disorder, Strong Anharmonicity, and Coupled Host Dynamics Lead to Superionic Transport in Li3YCl6 (LYC)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Configurational disorder, lattice anharmonicity, and coupled host&#8208;mobile ion vibrational dynamics together induce the superionic transition in Li3YCl6. Establishing statistical correlations between ion hops and activation of specific vibrational modes, this work demonstrates that anharmonic modes, crucial for diffusion, persist across the superionic transition unlike many other superionic conductors and strongly couple with the close&#8208;packed anion lattice to enable ionic hops.








Abstract
In superionic crystals, liquid&#8208;like ionic diffusivities often come hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity and soft vibrational dynamics. However, generalized relationships between ion transport and vibrational dynamics remain elusive due to the diversity of superionic materials and complex underlying mechanisms. Here, the links between vibrational dynamics and ion transport in close&#8208;packed lithium halide ion conductor Li3YCl6 (LYC) are examined using a suite of atomistic first&#8208;principles methods. It is shown that configurational disorder, lattice anharmonicity, and coupled host&#8208;mobile ion vibrational dynamics together induce a transition to the superionic state. Statistical correlations between ionic hops and activation of the distribution of vibrational modes are found. However, typical phenomena associated with superionic conductors such as selective breakdown of zone&#8208;boundary soft phonons, or long wavelength transverse acoustic modes as in the &#8216;phonon&#8208;liquid&#8208;electron crystal&#8217; concept, are not present. Instead, anharmonic zone&#8208;boundary modes aiding Li diffusion are found to broaden and soften selectively but persist across the superionic transition. These anharmonic modes couple Li ion motion with the vibrations of the flexible close&#8208;packed anion framework, which remains stable and facilitates ionic hopping. The results provide insights into how configurational disorder and soft&#8208;yet&#8208;resilient vibrational modes enable ionic hopping, particularly in 3D close&#8208;packed&#160;crystals.

         <title>Catalytic Nanodots&#8208;Driven Pyroptosis Suppression in Nucleus Pulposus for Antioxidant Intervention of Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Considering that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are the primary instigators of pyroptosis and lack pharmacological intervention, advanced carbonized Mn&#8208;containing nanodots (MCDs) are developed as ROS&#8208;scavenging biomaterials to efficiently suppress pyroptosis in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and maintain NP tissue homeostasis for potential intervention in intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD).








Abstract
Low back pain resulting from intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is a prevalent global concern; however, its underlying mechanism remains elusive. Single&#8208;cell sequencing analyses revealed the critical involvement of pyroptosis in IVDD. Considering the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as the primary instigator of pyroptosis and the lack of an efficient intervention approach, this study developed carbonized Mn&#8208;containing nanodots (MCDs) as ROS&#8208;scavenging catalytic biomaterials to suppress pyroptosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells to efficiently alleviate IVDD. Catalytic MCDs have superior efficacy in scavenging intracellular ROS and rescuing homeostasis in the NP microenvironment compared with N&#8208;acetylcysteine, a classical antioxidant. The data validates that pyroptosis plays a vital role in mediating the protective effects of catalytic MCDs against oxidative stress. Systematic in vivo assessments substantiate the effectiveness of MCDs in rescuing a puncture&#8208;induced IVDD rat model, further demonstrating their ability to suppress pyroptosis. This study highlights the potential of antioxidant catalytic nanomedicine as a pyroptosis inhibitor and mechanistically unveils an efficient strategy for the treatment of IVDD.

         <title>In Situ Piezoelectric&#8208;Catalytic Anti&#8208;Inflammation Promotes the Rehabilitation of Acute Spinal Cord Injury in Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an effective and controllable H2&#8208;based nanocatalytic treatment strategy in which biocompatible Au@BT NPs are constructed to catalyze H2 generation in response to ultrasound exposure to achieve anti&#8208;inflammatory effect through scavenging ROS; thus, achieving a notable therapeutic improvement in their motor function.








Abstract
Relieving inflammation via scavenging toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) during the acute phase of spinal cord injury (SCI) proves to be an effective strategy to mitigate secondary spinal cord injury and improve recovery of motor function. However, commonly used corticosteroid anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs show adverse side effects which may induce increased risk of wound infection. Fortunately, hydrogen (H2), featuring selective antioxidant performance, easy penetrability, and excellent biosafety, is being extensively investigated as a potential anti&#8208;inflammatory therapeutic gas for the treatment of SCI. In this work, by a facile in situ growth approach of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on the piezoelectric BaTiO3, a particulate nanocomposite with Schottky heterojunction (Au@BT) is synthesized, which can generate H2 continuously by catalyzing H+ reduction through piezoelectric catalysis. Further, theoretical calculations are employed to reveal the piezoelectric catalytic mechanism of Au@BT. Transcriptomics analysis and nontargeted large&#8208;scale metabolomic analysis reveal the deeper mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of H2 therapy. The as&#8208;prepared Au@BT nanoparticle is first explored as a flexible hydrogen gas generator for efficient SCI therapy. This study highlights a promising prospect of nanocatalytic medicine for disease treatments by catalyzing H2 generation; thus, offering a significant alternative to conventional approaches against refractory spinal cord injury.

         <title>CVD Synthesis of Twisted Bilayer WS2 with Tunable Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The introduction of rotational freedom by twist angles in twisted bilayer (TB) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) can tailor the inherent properties of the TMDCs, which provides a promising platform to investigate the exotic physical properties. However, direct synthesis of high&#8208;quality TB&#8208;TMDCs with full twist angles is significantly challenging due to the substantial energy barriers during crystal growth. Here, we propose a modified chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy to synthesize TB&#8208;WS2 with a wide twist angle range from 0 to 120&#176;. Utilizing a tilted SiO2/Si substrate, a gas flow disturbance is generated in the furnace tube to create a heterogeneous concentration gradient of the metal precursor, which provides an extra driving force for the growth of TB&#8208;WS2. The Raman and photoluminescence (PL) results confirm a weak interlayer coupling of the TB&#8208;WS2. High&#8208;quality periodic Moir&#233; patterns are observed in the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images. Moreover, owing to the strong correlation between the nonlinear optical response and the twisted crystal structure, tunable second harmonic generation (SHG) behaviors are realized in the TB&#8208;WS2. This approach opens up a new avenue for the direct growth of high&#8208;crystalline&#8208;quality and pristine TB&#8208;TMDCs and their potential applications in nonlinear optical devices.

         <title>Construction of Ag&#8208;Co(OH)2 Tandem Heterogeneous Electrocatalyst Induced Aldehyde Oxidation and the Co&#8208;Activation of Reactants for Biomass Effective and Multi&#8208;Selective Upgrading</title>

Abstract
The electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides a feasible way for high value utilization of biomass resources. However, how to regulate the selective synthesis of multiple value&#8208;added products is still a great challenge. Cobalt&#8208;based compound is a promising catalyst due to its direct and indirect oxidation properties, but its weak adsorption capacity restricts its further development. Herein, by constructing Ag&#8208;Co(OH)2 heterogeneous catalyst, we realize the efficient and selective synthesis of 5&#8208;hydroxymethyl&#8208;2&#8208;furanoic acid (HMFCA) and 2, 5&#8208;furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA) value&#8208;added products at different potential ranges. Based on in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, quasi&#8208;operando X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, zeta potential, electrochemical measurements and density functional theory calculations, it is proved that the addition of Ag can effectively promote the oxidation of aldehyde group to carboxyl group, and then generate HMFCA at low potential. Moreover, the introduction of Ag can activate cobalt&#8208;based compound, thus strengthening the adsorption of organic molecules and OH&#8722; species, and promoting the formation of FDCA. This work achieves the selective synthesis of two value&#8208;added chemicals by one tandem catalyst and deeply analyzes the adsorption enhancement mechanism of the catalyst, which provides a powerful reference and guidance for the design and development of efficient multi&#8208;component heterogeneous catalysts.

         <title>Enabling Proregenerative Medical Devices via Citrate&#8208;Based Biomaterials: Transitioning from Inert to Regenerative Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective reviews the history and applications of biodegradable polymers used in medical devices marketed in the United States of America, highlights the need and requirements for regenerative biomaterials, and discusses the path behind the recent successful introduction of citrate&#8208;based biomaterials for the manufacture of innovative medical products aimed at improving the outcome of musculoskeletal surgeries.








Abstract
Regenerative medicine aims to restore tissue and organ function without the use of prosthetics and permanent implants. However, achieving this goal has been elusive, and the field remains mostly an academic discipline with few products widely used in clinical practice. From a materials science perspective, barriers include the lack of proregenerative biomaterials, a complex regulatory process to demonstrate safety and efficacy, and user adoption challenges. Although biomaterials, particularly biodegradable polymers, can play a major role in regenerative medicine, their suboptimal mechanical and degradation properties often limit their use, and they do not support inherent biological processes that facilitate tissue regeneration. As of 2020, nine synthetic biodegradable polymers used in medical devices are cleared or approved for use in the United States of America. Despite the limitations in the design, production, and marketing of these devices, this small number of biodegradable polymers has dominated the resorbable medical device market for the past 50 years. This perspective will review the history and applications of biodegradable polymers used in medical devices, highlight the need and requirements for regenerative biomaterials, and discuss the path behind the recent successful introduction of citrate&#8208;based biomaterials for manufacturing innovative medical products aimed at improving the outcome of musculoskeletal surgeries.

         <title>Deep Learning for Size&#8208;Agnostic Inverse Design of Random&#8208;Network 3D Printed Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical metamaterials are architected engineered materials whose unprecedented properties originate from their designs at the microscale. Here, deep&#8208;learning techniques are utilized to develop a modular approach titled &#8220;Deep&#8208;DRAM&#8221; that generates numerous microstructures for mechanical metamaterials with predefined elastic properties and dimensions for various applications in high&#8208;tech industries, such as soft robotics and biomedical engineering.








Abstract
Practical applications of mechanical metamaterials often involve solving inverse problems aimed at finding microarchitectures that give rise to certain properties. The limited resolution of additive manufacturing techniques often requires solving such inverse problems for specific specimen sizes. Moreover, the candidate microarchitectures should be resistant to fatigue and fracture. Such a multi&#8208;objective inverse design problem is formidably difficult to solve but its solution is the key to real&#8208;world applications of mechanical metamaterials. Here, a modular approach titled &#8220;Deep&#8208;DRAM&#8221; that combines four decoupled models is proposed, including two deep learning (DL) models, a deep generative model based on conditional variational autoencoders, and direct finite element (FE) simulations. Deep&#8208;DRAM integrates these models into a framework capable of finding many solutions to the posed multi&#8208;objective inverse design problem based on random&#8208;network unit cells. Using an extensive set of simulations as well as experiments performed on 3D printed specimens, it is demonstrate that: 1) the predictions of the DL models are in agreement with FE simulations and experimental observations, 2) an enlarged envelope of achievable elastic properties (e.g., rare combinations of double auxeticity and high stiffness) is realized using the proposed approach, and 3) Deep&#8208;DRAM can provide many solutions to the considered multi&#8208;objective inverse design problem.

         <title>A Nanozyme&#8208;Based Electrode for High&#8208;Performance Neural Recording</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neural electrodes are indispensable diagnostic and therapeutic tools for neurological disorders. However, their detection sensitivity and biocompatibility remain unsolved challenges. Here, nanozyme electrodes that can simultaneously overcome the limitations associated with recording sensitivity, long&#8208;term acquisition stability, and peripheral nerve tissue necrosis through interfacial quantum transport and inhibition of neuroinflammation are developed, which are promising for brain science and engineering.








Abstract
Implanted neural electrodes have been widely used to treat brain diseases that require high sensitivity and biocompatibility at the tissue&#8211;electrode interface. However, currently used clinical electrodes cannot meet both these requirements simultaneously, which hinders the effective recording of electronic signals. Herein, nanozyme&#8208;based neural electrodes incorporating bioinspired atomically precise clusters are developed as a general strategy with a heterogeneous design for multiscale and ultrasensitive neural recording via quantum transport and biocatalytic processes. Owing to the dual high&#8208;speed electronic and ionic currents at the electrode&#8211;tissue interface, the impedance of nanozyme electrodes is 26 times lower than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal electrodes, and the acquisition sensitivity for the local field potential is &#8776;10 times higher than that of clinical PtIr electrodes, enabling a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of up to 14.7&#160;dB for single&#8208;neuron recordings in rats. The electrodes provide more than 100&#8208;fold higher antioxidant and multi&#8208;enzyme&#8208;like activities, which effectively decrease 67% of the neuronal injury area by inhibiting glial proliferation and allowing sensitive and stable neural recording. Moreover, nanozyme electrodes can considerably improve the SNR of seizures in acute epileptic rats and are expected to achieve precise localization of seizure foci in clinical settings.

         <title>Unmasking Chemokine&#8208;Inducing Specificity in Oligosaccharide Biomaterial to Promote Hair Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oligosaccharide biomaterial (OG6), discovered through enzymatic degradation of a glucomannan polysaccharide, stimulates specific expression of chemokine CCL5 in primary macrophages, without inducing pro&#8208;/anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization that is often excessively triggered by polysaccharides. Tests in a Foxp3&#8208;reporter mouse model and depilated mouse skin reveal its activity in promoting de novo hair regeneration involving regulatory T cells.








Abstract
Hair loss affects over 50 million people worldwide with limited therapeutic options. Despite evidence highlighting the vital role of local immune cells in regulating the life cycle of hair follicles (HFs), accurate regulation of immunocytes to directly promote hair growth remains unachieved. Here, inspired by the physiological feedback in the skin immunity to suppress microbe&#8208;triggered inflammation, an oligosaccharide biomaterial with &#8220;unmasked&#8221; specific activity is developed to recruit regulatory T (Treg) cells around HFs, leading to accelerated hair growth in mice. By processing the glucomannan polysaccharide via controllable enzymatic cleavage, a series of oligosaccharide fractions with more specific chemokine&#8208;inducing functions is obtained. Notably, a hexasaccharide&#8208;based fraction (OG6) stimulates macrophages to selectively express Treg&#8208;chemoattractant C&#8208;C Motif Chemokine Ligand 5 (CCL5) through a mannose receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and NOD1/2&#8208;dependent signaling, as evidenced by molecular docking, inhibition assays, and a Foxp3&#8208;reporter mouse model. Intradermal delivery of OG6 to the depilated mouse skin promotes Treg mobilization around HFs and stimulates de novo regeneration of robust hairs. This study demonstrates that unmasking precise immunomodulatory functions in oligosaccharides from their parental polysaccharide can potentially solve the long&#8208;lasting dilemma with polysaccharide biomaterials that are widely renowned for versatile activities yet high heterogeneity, opening new avenues to designing glycan&#8208;based therapeutic tools with improved specificity and safety.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticles Amplifying STING Signaling Pathway for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive nanoparticles are constructed to achieve spatiotemporal orchestration of innate immune stimulation by harnessing STING and TLR4 pathways. MPLA&#8208;mediated activation of nuclear factor kappa B amplifies STING signaling to promote the secretion of IFN&#8208;&#946; and other inflammatory cytokines, relieving the immunosuppression of tumor microenvironment and thus effectively inhibiting primary tumor growth as well as tumor recurrence and metastasis.








Abstract
Insufficient activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway and profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment largely limits the effect of cancer immunotherapy. Herein, tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (PMM NPs) are exploited that simultaneously harness STING and Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) to augment STING activation via TLR4&#8208;mediated nuclear factor&#8208;kappa B signaling pathway stimulation, leading to the increased secretion of type I interferons (i.e., 4.0&#8208;fold enhancement of IFN&#8208;&#946;) and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines to promote a specific T cell immune response. Moreover, PMM NPs relieve the immunosuppression of the TME by decreasing the percentage of regulatory T cells, and polarizing M2 macrophages to the M1 type, thus creating an immune&#8208;supportive TME to unleash a cascade adaptive immune response. Combined with an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, synergistic efficacy is achieved in both inflamed colorectal cancer and noninflamed metastatic breast tumor models. Moreover, rechallenging tumor&#8208;free animals with homotypic cells induced complete tumor rejection, indicating the generation of systemic antitumor memory. These TME&#8208;responsive nanoparticles may open a new avenue to achieve the spatiotemporal orchestration of STING activation, providing a promising clinical candidate for next&#8208;generation cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineering&#8208;Mediated Long&#8208;Lived Charge&#8208;Transfer Excited&#8208;State in Fe&#8211;Gallate Complex Improves Iron Cycle and Enables Sustainable Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling of a long&#8208;lived ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer excited&#8208;state and single electron transfer promotes the Fe cycle in the Fenton&#8208;like process and achieves efficient and sustainable Fenton chemistry. The system achieves comprehensive improvements in reaction kinetics, catalyst&#8208;specific activity, &#8226;OH productivity, and catalytic sustainability.








Abstract
Fenton reactions are inefficient because the Fe(II) catalyst cannot be recycled in time due to the lack of a rapid electron transport pathway. This results in huge H2O2 wastage in industrial applications. Here, it is shown that a sustainable heterogeneous Fenton system is attainable by enhancing the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;transfer (LMCT) excited&#8208;state lifetime in Fe&#8211;gallate complex. By engineering oxygen defects in the complex, the lifetime is improved from 10&#8211;90 ps. The lengthened lifetime ensures sufficient concentrations of excited&#8208;states for an efficient Fe cycle, realizing previously unattainable H2O2 activation kinetics and hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) productivity. Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies show the cyclic reaction mechanism involves in situ Fe(II) regeneration and synchronous supply of oxygen atoms from water to recover dissociated Fe&#9472;O bonds. Trace amounts of this catalyst effectively destroy two drug&#8208;resistant bacteria even after eight reaction cycles. This work reveals the link among LMCT excited&#8208;state lifetime, Fe cycle, and catalytic activity and stability, with implications for de novo design of efficient and sustainable Fenton&#8208;like processes.

         <title>Control of Mechanical and Fracture Properties in Two&#8208;Phase Materials Reinforced by Continuous, Irregular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By controlling the local architecture of irregular materials, the mechanisms that cause their fracture and design materials that dissipate up to 120% more energy can be influenced. By carefully designing multi&#8208;architecture assemblies, composed of soft and stiff domains, the trajectories of growing cracks, and control their deflection and nucleation can be influenced.

Composites with high strength and high fracture resistance are desirable for structural and protective applications. Most composites, however, suffer from poor damage tolerance and are prone to unpredictable fractures. Understanding the behavior of materials with an irregular reinforcement phase offers fundamental guidelines for tailoring their performance. Here, the fracture nucleation and propagation in two phase composites, as a function of the topology of their irregular microstructures is studied. A stochastic algorithm is used to design the polymeric reinforcing network, achieving independent control of topology and geometry of the microstructure. By tuning the local connectivity of isodense tiles and their assembly into larger structures, the mechanical and fracture properties of the architected composites are tailored&#160;at the local and global scale. Finally, combining different reinforcing networks into a spatially determined meso&#8208;scale assembly, it is demonstrated how the spatial propagation of fracture in architected composite materials can be designed and controlled a priori.

&lt;p&gt;By controlling the local architecture of irregular materials, the mechanisms that cause their fracture and design materials that dissipate up to 120% more energy can be influenced. By carefully designing multi-architecture assemblies, composed of soft and stiff domains, the trajectories of growing cracks, and control their deflection and nucleation can be influenced.

         <title>Fully Conjugated 2D sp2 Carbon&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated sp2 carbon&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) is successfully developed for photocatalytic overall water splitting. The cyanovinylene linkage is essential in modulating the electronic structure and promoting charge separation, thereby enabling overall water splitting. The crystallinity of COFs is further shown to substantially impact their photocatalytic performances.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) hold great promise for solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production. However, metal&#8208;free COFs for photocatalytic overall water splitting remain elusive, primarily due to challenges in simultaneously regulating their band structures and catalytic sites to enable concurrent half&#8208;reactions. Herein, two types of &#960;&#8208;conjugated COFs containing the same donor&#8211;acceptor structure are constructed via Knoevenagel condensation and Schiff base reaction to afford cyanovinylene&#8208; and imine&#8208;bridged COFs, respectively. The difference in the linkage leads to a remarkable difference in their photocatalytic activity toward water splitting. The 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COF exhibits notable activity for photocatalytic overall water splitting, which can reach an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.53% at 420&#160;nm. In contrast, the 2D imine&#8208;linked COF cannot catalyze the overall water&#8208;splitting reaction. Mechanistic investigations reveal that the cyanovinylene linkage is essential in modulating the band structure and promoting charge separation in COFs, thereby enabling overall water splitting. Moreover, it is further shown that crystallinity substantially impacts the photocatalytic performance of COFs. This study represents the first successful example of developing metal&#8208;free COFs with high crystallinity for photocatalytic overall water splitting.

         <title>Bacteria&#8208;Based Backpacks to Enhance Adoptive Macrophage Transfer against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of attaching bacteria to macrophages (M&#248;@bac) is reported by means of encapsulating bacterial surface with an adhesive nanocoating. M&#248;@bac can sustainably stimulate the polarization of macrophages toward antitumor phenotypes in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In the 4T1 murine models, M&#248;@bac can remodel the immune microenvironment, induce a robust immune response, and thus enable a potent therapeutic efficacy.








Abstract
Adoptive cell therapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment. However, the transfer of macrophages exhibits limited efficacy against solid tumors due to the dynamic cellular phenotypic shift from antitumor to protumor states within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In this study, a strategy of attaching bacteria to macrophages (M&#248;@bac) is reported that endows adoptively infused macrophages with durable stimulation by leveraging the intrinsic immunogenicity of bacteria. These attached bacteria, referred to as backpacks, are encapsulated with adhesive nanocoatings and can sustainably control the cellular phenotypes in vivo. Moreover, M&#248;@bac can repolarize endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, leading to a more robust immune response and thus reducing the tumor progression in a murine 4T1 cancer model without any side effects. This study utilizing bacteria as cellular backpacks opens a new avenue for the development of cell therapies.

This study demonstrates the first case of applying hexaazanonaphthalene (HATNH)&#8208;based 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (Cu&#8208;HATNH) integrated with carbon nanotubes via an in situ polymerization strategy to achieve stable long cycle stability and excellent rate performance with conjugated HATNH and unsaturated [CuO4] units as multiple redox active sites.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are gradually gaining attention owing to their natural abundance, excellent security, and high energy density. However, developing excellent organic cathode materials for PIBs to overcome the poor cycling stability and slow kinetics caused by the large radii of K+ ions is challenging. This study demonstrates for the first time the application of a hexaazanonaphthalene (HATN)&#8208;based 2D &#960;&#8208;d conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) with dual&#8208;active centers (Cu&#8208;HATNH) and integrates Cu&#8208;HATNH with carbon nanotubes (Cu&#8208;HATNH@CNT) as the cathode material for PIBs. Owing to this systematic module integration and more exposed active sites with high utilization, Cu&#8208;HATNH@CNT exhibits a high initial capacity (317.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability (capacity retention of 96.8% at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 2200 cycles), and outstanding rate capacity (147.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1). The reaction mechanism and performance are determined by combining experimental characterization and density functional theory calculations. This contribution provides new opportunities for designing high&#8208;performance 2D c&#8208;MOF cathodes with multiple active sites for PIBs.

         <title>Reducing Gases Triggered Cathode Surface Reconstruction for Stable Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface in Practical All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the significant influence of surface chemistry of oxide cathode on interfacial compatibility in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). The interface between cathode and solid&#8208;state electrolyte is primarily responsible for the prevailing capacity fading and impedance buildup. Therefore, a surface reconstruction strategy based on a gas&#8211;solid interface reduction reaction is introduced as a promising avenue for designing enhanced ASSLBs.








Abstract
The interfacial compatibility between cathodes and sulfide solid&#8208;electrolytes (SEs) is a critical limiting factor of electrochemical performance in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLBs). This work presents a gas&#8211;solid interface reduction reaction (GSIRR), aiming to mitigate the reactivity of surface oxygen by inducing a surface reconstruction layer (SRL) . The application of a SRL, CoO/Li2CO3, onto LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode results in impressive outcomes, including high capacity (149.7 mAh g&#8722;1), remarkable cyclability (retention of 84.63% over 400 cycles at 0.2 C), outstanding rate capability (86.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 C), and exceptional stability in high&#8208;loading cathode (28.97 and 23.45&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) within ASSLBs. Furthermore, the SRL CoO/Li2CO3 enhances the interfacial stability between LCO and Li10GeP2S12 as well as Li3PS4 SEs. Significantly, the experiments suggest that the GSIRR mechanism can be broadly applied, not only to LCO cathodes but also to LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes and other reducing gases such as H2S and CO, indicating its practical universality. This study highlights the significant influence of the surface chemistry of the oxide cathode on interfacial compatibility, and introduces a surface reconstruction strategy based on the GSIRR process as a promising avenue for designing enhanced ASSLBs.

Significantly, the experiments suggest that the GSIRR mechanism can be broadly applied, not only to LCO cathodes but also to LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes and other reducing gases such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and CO, indicating its practical universality. This study highlights the significant influence of the surface chemistry of the oxide cathode on interfacial compatibility, and introduces a surface reconstruction strategy based on the GSIRR process as a promising avenue for designing enhanced ASSLBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reconfigurable Cascaded Thermal Neuristors for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient thermal neural network, a novel class of spiking oscillators termed &#8220;thermal neuristors&#8221; is engineered based on the insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition (IMT) in vanadium dioxide. Solely through thermal interactions, a wide variety of reconfigurable functionalities mirroring biological neurons are demonstrated, including cascaded information flow, as well as excitatory and inhibitory interactions, without relying on traditional CMOS&#8208;based circuits.








Abstract
While the complementary metal&#8208;oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology is the mainstream for the hardware implementation of neural networks, an alternative route is explored based on a new class of spiking oscillators called &#8220;thermal neuristors&#8221;, which operate and interact solely via thermal processes. Utilizing the insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition (IMT) in vanadium dioxide, a wide variety of reconfigurable electrical dynamics mirroring biological neurons is demonstrated. Notably, inhibitory functionality is achieved just in a single oxide device, and cascaded information flow is realized exclusively through thermal interactions. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the neuristors, a detailed theoretical model is developed, which accurately reflects the experimental results. This study establishes the foundation for scalable and energy&#8208;efficient thermal neural networks, fostering progress in brain&#8208;inspired computing.

         <title>High Thermoelectric Performance in Phonon&#8208;Glass Electron&#8208;Crystal Like AgSbTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different length scales of the mean free path of charge carriers and phonons direct twofold enhancement in hole mobility with simultaneous realization of glass&#8208;like thermal conductivity, leading to an ultra&#8208;high thermoelectric performance in Yb&#8208;doped AgSbTe2.








Abstract
Achieving glass&#8208;like ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity in crystalline solids with high electrical conductivity, a crucial requirement for high&#8208;performance thermoelectrics , continues to be a formidable challenge. A careful balance between electrical and thermal transport is essential for optimizing the thermoelectric performance. Despite this inherent trade&#8208;off, the experimental realization of an ideal thermoelectric material with a phonon&#8208;glass electron&#8208;crystal (PGEC) nature has rarely been achieved. Here, PGEC&#8208;like AgSbTe2 is demonstrated by tuning the atomic disorder upon Yb doping, which results in an outstanding thermoelectric performance with figure of merit, zT &#8776; 2.4 at 573 K. Yb&#8208;doping&#8208;induced enhanced atomic ordering decreases the overlap between the hole and phonon mean free paths and consequently leads to a PGEC&#8208;like transport behavior in AgSbTe2. A twofold increase in electrical mobility is observed while keeping the position of the Fermi level (EF) nearly unchanged and corroborates the enhanced crystalline nature of the AgSbTe2 lattice upon Yb doping for electrical transport. The cation&#8208;ordered domains, lead to the formation of nanoscale superstructures (&#8776;2 to 4&#160;nm) that strongly scatter heat&#8208;carrying phonons, resulting in a temperature&#8208;independent glass&#8208;like thermal conductivity. The strategy paves the way for realizing high thermoelectric performance in various disordered crystals by making them amorphous to phonons while favoring crystal&#8208;like electrical transport.

         <title>Hydronium Intercalation Enables High Rate in Hexagonal Molybdate Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism of hydronium (H+(H2O)n) intercalation is demonstrated in a new host of hexagonal molybdates by experiments. Thanks to hydronium intercalation, fast&#8208;rate and long lifespan are achieved in electrodes of monocrystals with sizes even over 200&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
Rapid proton transport in solid&#8208;hosts promotes a new chemistry in achieving high&#8208;rate Faradaic electrodes. Exploring the possibility of hydronium intercalation is essential for advancing proton&#8208;based charge storage. Nevertheless, this is yet to be revealed. Herein, a new host is reported of hexagonal molybdates, (A2O)x&#183;MoO3&#183;(H2O)y (A = Na+, NH4+), and hydronium (de)intercalation is demonstrated with experiments. Hexagonal molybdates show a battery&#8208;type initial reduction followed by intercalation pseudocapacitance. Fast rate of 200 C (40 A g&#8722;1) and long lifespan of 30&#160;000 cycles are achieved in electrodes of monocrystals even over 200&#160;&#181;m. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance confirms hydronium intercalations, and operando measurements using electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction disclose distinct intercalation behaviours in different electrolyte concentrations. Remarkably, characterizations of the cycled electrodes show nearly identical structures and suggest equilibrium products are minimally influenced by the extent of proton solvation. These results offer new insights into proton electrochemistry and will advance correlated high&#8208;power batteries and beyond.

Abstract
Developing inorganic&#8211;organic composite polymers necessitates a new strategy for effectively controlling shape and optical properties while accommodating guest materials, as conventional polymers primarily act as &#160;carriers that transport&#160;inorganic substances. Here, a universal approach is introduced utilizing mesoporous liquid crystal polymer particles (MLPs) to fabricate inorganic&#8211;organic composites. By leveraging the liquid crystal phase, morphology and optical properties are precisely controlled through the molecular&#8208;level arrangement of the host, here monomers. The controlled host material allows the synthesis of inorganic particles within the matrix or accommodation of presynthesized nano&#8208;inorganic particles, all while preserving the intrinsic properties of the host material. This composite material surpasses the functional capabilities of the polymer alone by sequentially integrating one or more inorganic materials, allowing for the incorporation of multiple functionalities within a single polymer particle. Furthermore, this approach effectively mitigates the drawbacks associated with guest materials resulting in a substantial enhancement of composite performance. The presented approach is anticipated to hold immense potential for various applications in optoelectronics, catalysis, and biosensing, addressing the evolving demands of the society.

         <title>Bulk Electrosynthesis of Patchy Particles with Highly Controlled Asymmetric Features</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolar electrochemistry is used as a versatile tool to modify the surface of particles with various metal patches, located at predefined positions. The complexity of the modification can be fine&#8208;tuned, leading for the extreme case of multi&#8208;Janus particles to chiral features.








Abstract
Asymmetric modification of particles with various patches of different composition and size at predefined positions is an important challenge in contemporary surface chemistry, as such particles have numerous potential applications, ranging from materials science and (photo)catalysis to self&#8208;assembly and drug delivery. However, approaches allowing the synthesis of this kind of complex objects in the bulk of a solution in a straightforward way are currently lacking. In this context, bipolar electrochemistry (BE) is a powerful technique for the asymmetric modification of conducting objects. Herein, this approach is used for the highly controlled modification of particles with different metal patches, generated at specific locations of isotropic objects. The synthesis is carried out in the bulk of the solution and leads to predefined patterns of increasing complexity, including even a specific chiral arrangement of the patches.

         <title>Dispersion Engineering by Hybridizing the Back&#8208;Folded Soft Mode of Monomode Elastic Metamaterials with Stiff Acoustic Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong coupling between ordinary phonon modes and a back&#8208;folded soft phonon mode of a monomode metamaterial is suggested as a means to engineer the metamaterial dispersion relation of the lowest bands. The back&#8208;folding is accomplished by a superlattice or a set of separated beams. Unusual roton&#8208;like phonon bands serve as an example. Calculations and experiments are in excellent agreement. 








Abstract
In many cases, the hybridization of two or more excitation modes in solids has led to new and useful dispersion relations of waves. Well&#8208;studied examples are phonon polaritons, plasmon polaritons, particle&#8208;plasmon polaritons, cavity polaritons, and magnetic resonances at optical frequencies. In all of these cases, the lowest propagating mode couples to a finite&#8208;frequency localized resonance. Herein, the unusual metamaterial phonon dispersion relations arising from the hybridization of an ordinary acoustical phonon mode with a back&#8208;folded soft or easy phonon mode of a monomode elastic metamaterial are discussed. Conceptually, the single easy mode can have strictly zero wave velocity. In reality, its wave velocity is very much smaller than that of all other modes. Considering polymeric three&#8208;dimensional printed elastic monomode metamaterials at ultrasound frequencies, it is shown theoretically and experimentally that the resulting pronounced avoided crossing, with a frequency splitting comparable to the mid&#8208;frequency, leads to backward&#8208;wave behavior for the lowest band over a broad frequency range, conceptually at zero loss.

         <title>Antibacterial and Angiogenic (2A) Bio&#8208;Heterojunctions Facilitate Infectious Ischemic Wound Regeneration via an Endogenous&#8211;Exogenous Bistimulatory Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibacterial and angiogenic (2A) bio&#8208;heterojunctions (bio&#8208;HJs) consisting of CuS/MXene and a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#8208;mimicking peptide (VMP) are devised for infectious wound regeneration via an endogenous&#8211;exogenous bistimulatory angiogenic strategy. Copper ions elevate VEGF secretion, which provokes VEGF receptors activation by endogenous pathway, whereas VMP promotes the exogenous pathway directly.








Abstract
In infectious ischemic wounds, a lack of blood perfusion significantly worsens microbe&#8208;associated infection symptoms and frequently complicates healing. To overcome this daunting issue, antibacterial and angiogenic (2A) bio&#8208;heterojunctions (bio&#8208;HJs) consisting of CuS/MXene heterojunctions and a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#8208;mimicking peptide (VMP) are devised and developed to accelerate infectious cutaneous regeneration by boosting angiogenesis via an endogenous&#8211;exogenous bistimulatory (EEB) strategy. Assisted by near&#8208;infrared irradiation, the bio&#8208;HJ platform exhibits versatile synergistic photothermal, photodynamic, and chemodynamic effects for robust antibacterial efficacy. In addition, copper ions liberated from 2A bio&#8208;HJs elevate VEGF secretion from fibroblasts, which provokes VEGF receptors (VEGFR) activation through an endogenous pathway, whereas VMP itself promotes an exogenous pathway to facilitate endothelial cell multiplication and tube formation by directly activating the VEGFR signaling pathway. Moreover, employing an in vivo model of infectious ischemic wounds, it is confirmed that the EEB strategy can considerably boost cutaneous regeneration through pathogen elimination, angiogenesis promotion, and collagen deposition. As envisaged, this work leads to the development of a powerful 2A bio&#8208;HJ platform that can serve as an effective remedy for bacterial invasion&#8208;induced ischemic wounds through the EEB strategy.

         <title>A Multifunctional Scaffold for Bone Infection Treatment by Delivery of microRNA Therapeutics Combined With Antimicrobial Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a novel multifunctional collagen&#8208;based scaffold for treating bone infections. The work demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of integrating antimicrobial, antibiotic&#8208;free nanoparticles and microRNA&#8208;based gene therapy for musculoskeletal applications. This multifaceted solution offers significant potential in modern orthopaedics, paving the way for applications beyond bone repair.








Abstract
Treating bone infections and ensuring bone repair is one of the greatest global challenges of modern orthopedics, made complex by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) risks due to long&#8208;term antibiotic treatment and debilitating large bone defects following infected tissue removal. An ideal multi&#8208;faceted solution would will eradicate bacterial infection without long&#8208;term antibiotic use, simultaneously stimulating osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Here, a multifunctional collagen&#8208;based scaffold that addresses these needs by leveraging the potential of antibiotic&#8208;free antimicrobial nanoparticles (copper&#8208;doped bioactive glass, CuBG) to combat infection without contributing to AMR in conjunction with microRNA&#8208;based gene therapy (utilizing an inhibitor of microRNA&#8208;138) to stimulate both osteogenesis and angiogenesis, is developed. CuBG scaffolds reduce the attachment of gram&#8208;positive bacteria by over 80%, showcasing antimicrobial functionality. The antagomiR&#8208;138 nanoparticles induce osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells in vitro and heal a large load&#8208;bearing defect in a rat femur when delivered on the scaffold. Combining both promising technologies results in a multifunctional antagomiR&#8208;138&#8208;activated CuBG scaffold inducing hMSC&#8208;mediated osteogenesis and stimulating vasculogenesis in an in vivo chick chorioallantoic membrane model. Overall, this multifunctional scaffold catalyzes killing mechanisms in bacteria while inducing bone repair through osteogenic and angiogenic coupling, making this platform a promising multi&#8208;functional strategy for treating and repairing complex bone infections.

         <title>Engineering Antimicrobial Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network Nanoparticles with High Biocompatibility for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antimicrobial, highly biocompatible metal&#8208;phenolic network nanoparticles (am&#8208;MPN NPs) are engineered and applied across different models (cells, blood, zebrafish, and mice). The NPs perform efficiently against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria owing to their antimicrobial properties, which are related to 1) cell wall damage, 2) reactive oxygen species (ROS), and 3) quinoprotein production. Moreover, they inhibit and eradicate bacterial biofilms and promote the healing of bacterial&#8208;infected skin wounds.








Abstract
Antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria pose a global health threat by causing persistent and recurrent microbial infections. To address this issue, antimicrobial nanoparticles (NPs) with low drug resistance but potent bactericidal effects have been developed. However, many of the developed NPs display poor biosafety and their synthesis often involves complex procedures and the antimicrobial modes of action are unclear. Herein, a simple strategy is reported for designing antimicrobial metal&#8210;phenolic network (am&#8208;MPN) NPs through the one&#8208;step assembly of a seeding agent (diethyldithiocarbamate), natural polyphenols, and metal ions (e.g., Cu2+) in aqueous solution. The Cu2+&#8208;based am&#8208;MPN NPs display lower Cu2+ antimicrobial concentrations (by 10&#8211;1000 times) lower than most reported nanomaterials and negligible toxicity across various models, including, cells, blood, zebrafish, and mice. Multiple antimicrobial modes of the NPs have been identified, including bacterial wall disruption, reactive oxygen species production, and quinoprotein formation, with the latter being a distinct pathway identified for the antimicrobial activity of the polyphenol&#8208;based am&#8208;MPN NPs. The NPs exhibit excellent performance against multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria (e.g., methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)), efficiently inhibit and destroy bacterial biofilms, and promote the healing of MRSA&#8208;infected skin wounds. This study provides insights on the antimicrobial properties of metal&#8210;phenolic materials and the rational design of antimicrobial metal&#8210;organic materials.

Herein, a simple strategy is reported for designing antimicrobial metal&#8210;phenolic network (am-MPN) NPs through the one-step assembly of a seeding agent (diethyldithiocarbamate), natural polyphenols, and metal ions (e.g., Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) in aqueous solution. The Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-based am-MPN NPs display lower Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; antimicrobial concentrations (by 10&#8211;1000 times) lower than most reported nanomaterials and negligible toxicity across various models, including, cells, blood, zebrafish, and mice. Multiple antimicrobial modes of the NPs have been identified, including bacterial wall disruption, reactive oxygen species production, and quinoprotein formation, with the latter being a distinct pathway identified for the antimicrobial activity of the polyphenol-based am-MPN NPs. The NPs exhibit excellent performance against multidrug-resistant bacteria (e.g., methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA)), efficiently inhibit and destroy bacterial biofilms, and promote the healing of MRSA-infected skin wounds. This study provides insights on the antimicrobial properties of metal&#8210;phenolic materials and the rational design of antimicrobial metal&#8210;organic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailored Succinic Acid&#8208;Derived Molecular Structures toward 25.41%&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Succinic acid derivative with multiple active sites and optimal spatial positions maximizes the defect binding energy, improves the film quality, and depresses the non&#8208;radiative recombination of the perovskite, giving a record efficiency of 25.41% for RbCsFAMA&#8208;based quadruple&#8208;cation perovskite devices.








Abstract
Minimizing interfacial charged traps in perovskite films is crucial for reducing the non&#8208;radiative recombination and improving device performance. In this study, succinic acid (SA) derivatives varying active sites and spatial configurations are designed to modulate defects and crystallization in perovskite film. The SA derivative with two symmetric Br atoms, dibromosuccinic acid (DBSA), exhibits the optimal spatial arrangement for defect passivation. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the carboxyl group and atomic Br in DBSA synergistically interact with the under&#8208;coordinated Pb2+. Moreover, the strong electronegativity of Br efficiently stabilizes the formamidinium cation via electrostatic interaction. Consequently, film quality is significantly improved and non&#8208;radiative recombination is markedly depressed, resulting in a photoluminesence lifetime of exceeding 4&#160;&#181;s of and a carrier diffusion length of 3&#160;&#181;m. An exceptional efficiency of 25.41% (certified at 25.00%) along with a high fill factor of 84.39% and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability have been achieved finally.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Stabilized Fiber Sensor for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Amniotic Fluid During Pregnancy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface&#8208;stabilized electrochemical fiber sensor is designed for real&#8208;time monitoring of biochemical dynamics in amniotic fluid during pregnancy. The sensor seamlessly integrates into the amnion through tissue adhesion, amniotic regeneration, and uniform stress distribution. The sensor demonstrates response performance with fluctuation of less than 0.3% under complex dynamic conditions and accuracy of more than 98% in pregnant rats.








Abstract
Diseases in pregnancy endanger millions of fetuses worldwide every year. The onset of these diseases can be early warned by the dynamic abnormalities of biochemicals in amniotic fluid, thus requiring real&#8208;time monitoring. However, when continuously penetrated by detection devices, the amnion is prone to loss of robustness and rupture, which is difficult to regenerate. Here, an interface&#8208;stabilized fiber sensor is presented for real&#8208;time monitoring of biochemical dynamics in amniotic fluid during pregnancy. The sensor is seamlessly integrated into the amnion through tissue adhesion, amniotic regeneration, and uniform stress distribution, posing no risk to the amniotic fluid environment. The sensor demonstrates a response performance of less than 0.3% fluctuation under complex dynamic conditions and an accuracy of more than 98% from the second to the third trimester. By applying it to early warning of diseases such as intrauterine hypoxia, intrauterine infection, and fetal growth restriction, fetal survival increases to 95% with timely intervention.

         <title>A Tailored Interface Design for Anode&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial engineering strategy that contains a lithiated graphite ion&#8208;conducting layer to homogenize the lithium flux, a ductile lithiated polyacrylic acid polymer layer to ensure the stability of the interface, and an silver&#8208;modified copper foil to regulate lithium deposition is designed for anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state batteries. The collaborative interfacial design enables stable interface and low interface resistance.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state batteries (AFSSBs) are considered to be one of the most promising high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy storage systems. However, low Coulombic efficiency stemming from severe deterioration on solid electrolyte/current collector (Cu foil) interface and undesirable Li dendrite growth impede their practical application, especially when rigid garnet electrolyte is used. Here, an interfacial engineering strategy between garnet electrolyte and Cu foil is introduced for stable and highly efficient AFSSBs. By utilizing the high Li ion conductivity of LiC6 layer, interfacial self&#8208;adaption ability arising from ductile lithiated polyacrylic acid polymer layer and regulated Li deposition via Li&#8208;Ag alloying reaction, the garnet&#8208;based AFSSB delivers a stable long&#8208;term operation. Additionally, when combined with a commercial LiCoO2 cathode (3.1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2), the cell also exhibits an outstanding capacity retention due to the tailored interface design. The strategies for novel AFSSBs architecture thus offer an alternative route to design next&#8208;generation batteries with high safety and high density.

         <title>Minimizing Interfacial Recombination in 1.8&#160;eV&#160;Triple&#8208;Halide Perovskites for 27.5% Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>

W e present a new 1.80&#160;eV wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite treated with piperazinium iodide (PI) for all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. This treatment eliminates non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and reduces defect density resulting in an open circuit voltage of 1.36&#160;V and enhanced photostability. Combined with a narrow bandgap (NBG) perovskite, this enables a tandem cell with a certified scan efficiency of 27.5%.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells show great potential to enable the highest performance at reasonable costs for a viable market entry in the near future. In particular, wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) are essential to further improve the tandem solar cells&#8217; performance. Here, a new 1.8&#160;eV bandgap triple&#8208;halide perovskite composition in conjunction with a piperazinium iodide (PI) surface treatment is developed. With structural analysis, it is found that the PI modifies the surface through a reduction of excess lead iodide in the perovskite and additionally penetrates the bulk. Constant light&#8208;induced magneto&#8208;transport measurements are applied to separately resolve charge carrier properties of electrons and holes. These measurements reveal a reduced deep trap state density, and improved steady&#8208;state carrier lifetime (factor 2.6) and diffusion lengths (factor 1.6). As a result, WBG PSCs achieve 1.36&#160;V VOC, reaching 90% of the radiative limit. Combined with a 1.26&#160;eV narrow bandgap (NBG) perovskite with a rubidium iodide additive, this enables a tandem cell with a certified scan efficiency of 27.5%.

         <title>An &#8220;AND&#8221; Logic&#8208;Gated Prodrug Micelle Locally Stimulates Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a novel AND logic&#8208;controlled release prodrug micelle that integrates both external and internal stimuli is developed for codelivering chemotherapeutic agents, camptothecin (CPT), and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonists DMXAA, enabling precise combinatorial therapy. DMXAA is successfully encapsulated into prodrug micelles through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions, allowing for tumor&#8208;targeted delivery and significantly enhanced immune activation and antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Materials that can respond to multiple biomarkers simultaneously, acting as an &#8220;AND&#8221; gate, have the potential to enhance tumor&#8208;targeting for drug delivery. In this study, an &#8220;AND&#8221; logic&#8208;controlled release prodrug micelle is developed for codelivering the chemotherapeutic and the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist, enabling precise combinatorial therapy. The drug release is programmed by tumor&#8208;enriched boramino acids (BAA) in the tumor microenvironment and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in enhanced tumor targeting. STING agonist is successfully encapsulated into prodrug micelles through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and hydrophobic interactions. These AND logic&#8208;gated prodrug micelles can achieve tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of STING agonist, leading to significantly enhanced immune activation and antitumor efficacy in vivo. It is expected that this clinically relevant nanoplatform will provide a rational design of an effective immunotherapy combination regimen to convert immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors to immunogenic &#8220;hot&#8221; tumors, addressing the major challenges faced by immunotherapies.

         <title>In Situ Dual&#8208;Interface Passivation Strategy Enables The Efficiency of Formamidinium Perovskite Solar Cells Over 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the preparation of formamidinium perovskite solar cells, use of the 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium methanesulfonate (MS) precursor additive results in the spontaneous aggregation of MS molecules at both sides of the interface following perovskite crystallization. This process significantly mitigates the defect density at the interface and curbs the VOC loss. The optimal device prepared using the MS strategy attains a noteworthy power conversion efficiency of 25.12%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics owing to their unparalleled power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Currently, approaches to further improve device efficiencies tend to focus on the passivation of interfacial defects. Although various strategies have been developed to mitigate these defects, many involve complex and time&#8208;consuming post&#8208;treatment processes, thereby hindering their widespread adoption in commercial applications. In this work, a concise but efficient in situ dual&#8208;interface passivation strategy is developed wherein 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium methanesulfonate (MS) is employed as a precursor additive. During perovskite crystallization, MS can either be enriched downward through precipitation with SnO2, or can be aggregated upward through lattice extrusion. These self&#8208;assembled MS species play a significant role in passivating the defect interfaces, thereby reducing nonradiative recombination losses, and promoting more efficient charge extraction. As a result, a PCE &gt;25% (certified PCE of 24.84%) is achieved with substantially improved long&#8208;term storage and photothermal stabilities. This strategy provides valuable insights into interfacial passivation and holds promise for the industrialization of PSCs.

         <title>Ni Single&#8208;Atoms Based Memristors with Ultrafast Speed and Ultralong Data Retention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, a novel Ni single&#8208;atoms (NiSAs/N&#8208;C) based non&#8208;volatile memristor to address the contradictory issue of improving both switching speed and retention capability is designed. The device exhibits an ultrafast switching speed of 100 ns and ultralong data retention capability (106 s). After fitting the Arrhenius equation to achieve a data retention lifetime over 10 years.








Abstract
Memristor with low&#8208;power, high density, and scalability fulfills the requirements of the applications of the new computing system beyond Moore's law. However, there are still nonideal device characteristics observed in the memristor to be solved. The important observation is that retention and speed are correlated parameters of memristor with trade off against each other. The delicately modulating distribution and trapping level of defects in electron migration&#8208;based memristor is expected to provide a compromise method to address the contradictory issue of improving both switching speed and retention capability. Here, high&#8208;performance memristor based on the structure of ITO/Ni single&#8208;atoms (NiSAs/N&#8208;C)/Polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP)/Au is reported. By utilizing well&#8208;distributed trapping sites , small tunneling barriers/distance and high charging energy, the memristor with an ultrafast switching speed of 100&#160;ns, ultralong retention capability of 106&#160;s, a low set voltage (Vset) of &#8776;0.7&#160;V, a substantial ON/OFF ration of 103, and low spatial variation in cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle (500 cycles) and device&#8208;to&#8208;device characteristics (128 devices) is demonstrated. On the premise of preserving the strengths of a fast switching speed, this memristor exhibits ultralong retention capability comparable to the commercialized flash memory. Finally, a memristor ratioed logic&#8208;based combinational memristor array to realize the one&#8208;bit full adder is further implemented.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Eutectic Electrolyte with Weak Hydrogen Bonds for High&#8208;Rate and Ultra&#8208;Stable Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Hydrogen bonds dominate the solvation interaction of NH4+. Weakening the interactions between NH4+ and solvent molecules can significantly improve the rate capability and long&#8208;term cycling performance of NH4&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
As the need for sustainable battery chemistry grows, non&#8208;metallic ammonium ion (NH4+) batteries are receiving considerable attention because of their unique properties, such as low cost, nontoxicity, and environmental sustainability. In this study, the solvation interactions between NH4+ and solvents are elucidated and design principles for NH4+ weakly solvated electrolytes are proposed. Given that hydrogen bond interactions dominate the solvation of NH4+ and solvents, the strength of the solvent's electrostatic potential directly determines the strength of its solvating power. As a proof of concept, succinonitrile with relatively weak electronegativity is selected to construct a metal&#8208;free eutectic electrolyte (MEE). As expected, this MEE is able to significantly broaden the electrochemical stability window and reduce the solvent binding energy in the solvation shell, which leads to a lower desolvation energy barrier and a fast charge transfer process. As a result, the as&#8208;constructed NH4&#8208;ion batteries exhibit superior reversible rate capability (energy density of 65&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8211;1total active mass at 600&#160;W&#160;kg&#8211;1) and unprecedent long&#8208;term cycling performance (retention of 90.2% after 1000 cycles at 1.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8211;1). The proposed methodology for constructing weakly hydrogen bonded electrolytes will provide guidelines for implementing high&#8208;rate and ultra&#8208;stable NH4+&#8208;based energy storage systems.

         <title>Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Liquid Metal Composite Architecture for Solar Thermoelectric Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of liquid gallium nanoparticles and a metal&#8208;phenolic ink creates a unique architecture that can act as a highly efficient broad&#8208;spectrum solar light absorber. The resulting composite applied on a thermoelectric device can generate clean energy with a record power density of 870.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 under 2&#160;Sun illumination.








Abstract
The development of advanced solar energy technologies, which efficiently convert solar energy to heat and then to electricity, remains a significant challenge in the pursuit of clean energy production. Here, this challenge is addressed by designing a photothermal absorber composed of liquid gallium particles and a natural polyphenol&#8208;based coordination ink. The design of this composite takes advantage of the tuneable light absorption properties of the polyphenol inks and can also be applied onto flexible substrates. While the ink utilizes two types of coordination complexes to absorb light at different wavelengths, the liquid gallium particles with high thermal and electrical properties provide enhanced thermoelectric effect. As such, the photothermal composite exhibits a broad&#8208;spectrum light absorption and highly efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion. A thermoelectric generator coated with the photothermal composite exhibits an impressive voltage output of &#8776;185.3&#160;mV when exposed to 1&#160;Sun illumination, without requiring any optical concentration, which sets a new record for a power density at 345.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work showcases the synergistic combination of natural compound&#8208;based light&#8208;absorbing coordination complexes with liquid metals to achieve a strong photothermal effect and their integration into thermoelectric devices with powerful light harvesting capabilities.

         <title>Alkoxythiophene&#8208;Directed Fibrillization of Polymer Donor for Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkoxythiophene additives are developed to induce the fibrillization of a series of BDT&#8208;type polymer donors for organic solar cells, demonstrating generally increased efficiency, with the PM6/L8&#8208;BO binary device reaching 19.2%.








Abstract
Realizing fibrillar molecular framework is highly encouraged in organic solar cells (OSCs) due to the merit of efficient charge carrier transport. This is however mainly achieved via the chemical structural design of photovoltaic semiconductors. In this work, through the utilization of three alkoxythiophene additives, T&#8208;2OMe, T&#8208;OEH, and T&#8208;2OEH, the intermolecular interactions among a series of BDT&#8208;type polymer donors, i.e., PM6, D18, PBDB&#8208;T, and PTB7&#8208;Th, are tuned to self&#8208;assemble into nanofibrils during solution casting. X&#8208;ray technique and molecular dynamics simulation reveal that the alkoxythiophene with (2&#8208;ethylhexyl)oxy (&#9472;OEH) chains can attach on the 2&#8208;ethylhexyl (EH) chains of these polymer donors and promote their self&#8208;assembly into 1D nanofibrils, in their neat films as well as photovoltaic blends with L8&#8208;BO. By adapting these fibrillar polymer donors to construct pseudo&#8208;bulk heterojunction (P&#8208;BHJ) OSCs via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition, generally improved device performance is seen, with power conversion efficiencies enhanced from 18.2% to 19.2% (certified 18.96%) and from 17.9% to 18.7% for the PM6/L8&#8208;BO and D18/L8&#8208;BO devices, respectively. This work provides a physical approach to promote the fibrillar charge transport channels for efficient photovoltaics.

         <title>Gradient Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Enables Selective and Fast Ion Transport for Robust Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gradient polymetric networks (GHNs) are fixed directly on zinc anode via the interface&#8208;initiated epitaxial polymerization strategy. The GHNs not only favor the Zn2+ shuttle but lock the interfacial free water, alleviating the dendrite and corrosion on zinc anode. This work demonstrates the asymmetric design concept in quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes to improve the energy density, power density, and cycling stability of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs).








Abstract
The quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes (QSEs) attract extensive attention due to their improved ion transport properties and high stability, which is synergistically based on tunable functional groups and confined solvent molecules among the polymetric networks. However, the trade&#8208;off effect between the polymer content and ionic conductivity exists in QSEs, limiting their rate performance. In this work, the epitaxial polymerization strategy is used to build the gradient hydrogel networks (GHNs) covalently fixed on zinc anode. Then, it is revealed that the asymmetric distribution of negative charges benefits GHNs with fast and selective ionic transport properties, realizing a higher Zn2+ transference number of 0.65 than that (0.52) for homogeneous hydrogel networks (HHNs) with the same polymer content. Meanwhile, the high&#8208;density networks formed at Zn/GHNs interface can efficiently immobilize free water molecules and homogenize the Zn2+ flux, greatly inhibiting the water&#8208;involved parasitic reactions and dendrite&#160;growth. Thus, the GHNs enable dendrite&#8208;free stripping/plating over 1000&#160;h at 8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a Zn||Zn symmetric cell, as well as the evidently prolonged cycles in various full cells. This work will shed light on asymmetric engineering of ion transport channels in advanced quasi&#8208;solid battery systems to achieve high energy and safety.

         <title>Molecular Design of Layered Hybrid Silver Bismuth Bromine Single Crystal for Ultra&#8208;Stable X&#8208;Ray Detection With Record Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work emphasizes the huge impact of interlayer interaction and charge transfer direction on LH&#8208;AgBiBr X&#8208;ray detectors. A high&#8208;stable X&#8208;ray detector with record sensitivity (2638 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and ultra&#8208;low detection limit (7.4 nGyair s&#8722;1) is achieved through an appropriate divalent amine design. Finally, high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging is realized on linear detector arrays under benign operation conditions.








Abstract
Nowadays, weak interlayer coupling and unclear mechanism in layered hybrid silver bismuth bromine (LH&#8208;AgBiBr) are the main reasons for limiting its further enhanced X&#8208;ray detection sensitivity and stability. Herein, the design rules for LH&#8208;AgBiBr and its influence on X&#8208;ray detection performance are reported for the first time. Although shortening amine size can enhance interlayer coupling, its detection performance is severely hampered by its easier defect formation caused by enlarged micro strain. In contrast, an appropriate divalent amine design endows the material with improved interlayer coupling and released micro strain, which benefits crystal stability and mechanical hardness. Another contribution is to increase material density and dielectric constant; thus, enhancing X&#8208;ray absorption and carrier transport. Consequently, the optimized parallel device based on BDA2AgBiBr8 achieves a record sensitivity of 2638 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and an ultra&#8208;low detection limit of 7.4 nGyair s&#8722;1, outperforming other reported LH&#8208;AgBiBr X&#8208;ray detectors. Moreover, the unencapsulated device displays remarkable anti&#8208;moisture, anti&#8208;thermal (&gt;150 &#176;C), and anti&#8208;radiation (&gt;1000 Gyair) endurance. Eventually, high&#8208;resolution hard X&#8208;ray imaging is demonstrated by linear detector arrays under a benign dose rate (1.63 &#181;Gyair s&#8722;1) and low external bias (5&#160;V). Hence, these findings provide guidelines for future materials design and device optimization.

         <title>Experimental Realization of Monolayer &#945;&#8208;Tellurene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on a novel bottom&#8211;up approach, using three atom&#8208;long tellurium chains, derived from the dynamic non&#8208;equilibrium growth of an a&#8208;Si:Te alloy, as building blocks for the self&#8208;assembly of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene on a Sb2Te3 substrate. Atomic&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy demonstrates the hexagonal lattice of &#945;&#8208;tellurene.








Abstract
2D materials emerge as a versatile platform for developing next&#8208;generation devices. The experimental realization of novel artificial 2D atomic crystals, which does not have bulk counterparts in nature, is still challenging and always requires new physical or chemical processes. Monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene is predicted to be a stable 2D allotrope of tellurium (Te), which has great potential for applications in high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors. However, the synthesis of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene remains elusive because of its complex lattice configuration, in which the Te atoms are stacked in tri&#8208;layers in an octahedral fashion. Here, a self&#8208;assemble approach, using three atom&#8208;long Te chains derived from the dynamic non&#8208;equilibrium growth of an a&#8208;Si:Te alloy as building blocks, is reported for the epitaxial growth of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene on a Sb2Te3 substrate. By combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, the surface morphology and electronic structure of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene are revealed and the underlying growth mechanism is determined. The successful synthesis of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene opens up the possibility for the application of this new single&#8208;element 2D material in advanced electronic devices.

         <title>A PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting Regulator for Metabolic Reprogramming to Enhance Glutamine Inhibition&#8208;Mediated Synergistic Antitumor Metabolic and Immune Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>

A PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting metabolism and immune regulator (PMIR) is constructed for metabolic reprogramming. PMIR inhibits glutamine metabolism of tumor cells, while solves compensatory&#160;glycolysis and utilizes upregulated PD&#8208;L1 for self&#8208;amplifying accumulation. Cooperating with the immunogenic cell death through&#160;the disruption of the redox homeostasis, PMIR can evoke robust immune responses to suppress bilateral tumor progression and metastasis.








Abstract
Inhibition of glutamine metabolism in tumor cells can cause metabolic compensation&#8208;mediated glycolysis enhancement and PD&#8208;L1 upregulation&#8208;induced immune evasion, significantly limiting the therapeutic efficacy of glutamine inhibitors. Here, inspired by the specific binding of receptor and ligand, a PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting metabolism and immune regulator (PMIR) are constructed by decorating the glutaminase inhibitor (BPTES)&#8208;loading zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) with PD&#8208;L1&#8208;targeting peptides for regulating the metabolism within the tumor microenvironment (TME) to improve immunotherapy. At tumor sites, PMIR inhibits glutamine metabolism of tumor cells for elevating glutamine levels within the TME to improve the function of immune cells. Ingeniously, the accompanying PD&#8208;L1 upregulation on tumor cells causes self&#8208;amplifying accumulation of PMIR through PD&#8208;L1 targeting, while also blocking PD&#8208;L1, which has the effects of converting enemies into friends. Meanwhile, PMIR exactly offsets the compensatory glycolysis, while disrupting the redox homeostasis in tumor cells via the cooperation of components of the ZIF and BPTES. These together cause immunogenic cell death of tumor cells and relieve PD&#8208;L1&#8208;mediated immune evasion, further reshaping the immunosuppressive TME and evoking robust immune responses to effectively suppress bilateral tumor progression and metastasis. This work proposes a rational strategy to surmount the obstacles in glutamine inhibition for boosting existing clinical treatments.

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at a Well&#8208;Matched Heterointerface for Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Solar Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A released distortion of 2D perovskite ((NAM)2PbI4) with large Pb&#8208;I&#8208;Pb angle is realized via weakening the hydrogen bonding between organic spacer and [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedron. It leads to the formation of well&#8208;matched heterointerface between (002) facet of (NAM)2PbI4 and (100) plane of FAPbI3, which lowers the crystal formation energy and triggers the epitaxial growth &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. An impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.4% (certified 25.2%) is achieved by the target perovskite solar cells, along with enhanced stability.








Abstract
Although the FAPbI3 perovskite system exhibits an impressive optoelectronic characteristic and thermal stability because of its energetically unstable black phase at room temperature, it is considerably challenging to attain a controllable and oriented nucleation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. To overcome this challenge, a 2D perovskite with a released inorganic octahedral distortion designed by weakening the hydrogen interactions between the organic interlayer and [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedron is presented in this study. A highly matched heterointerface can be formed between the (002) facet of the 2D structure and the (100) crystal plane of the cubic &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, thereby lowering the crystallization energy and inducing a heterogeneous nucleation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This &#8220;epitaxial growth&#8221; mechanism results form the highly preferred crystallographic orientation of the (100) facets, improved crystal quality and film uniformity, substantially increased charge transporting characteristics, and suppressed nonradiative recombination losses. An impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.4% (certified 25.2%) is achieved using target PSCs, which demonstrates outstanding ambient and operational stability. The feasibility of this strategy is proved for the scalable deposition of homogeneous and high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films by demonstrating the remarkably increased PCE of the large&#8208;area perovskite solar module, from 18.2% to 20.1%.

         <title>Selenium&#8208;Anchored Chlorine Redox Chemistry in Aqueous Zinc Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>

A selenium&#8208;based organic molecule, diphenyl diselenide, is developed as the chlorine anchoring agent and realizes an atomic level&#8208;chlorine fixation through chalcogen&#8211;halogen coordinating chemistry. Benefiting from the highly reversible Cl0/&#8722; redox reaction with extra low Cl2 emission, the resulted battery delivers remarkable electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Chlorine&#8208;based batteries with Cl0 to Cl&#8722; redox reaction (ClRR) are promising for high&#8208;performance energystorage due to their high redox potential and large theoretical capacity. However, the inherent gas&#8211;liquid conversion feature of ClRR together with poor Cl fixation can cause Cl2 leakage, reducing battery reversibility. Herein, we utilize a Se&#8208;based organic molecule, diphenyl diselenide (di&#8208;Ph&#8208;Se), as the Cl anchoring agent and realize an atomic level&#8208;Cl fixation through chalcogen&#8208;halogencoordinating chemistry. The promoted Cl fixation, with two oxidized Cl0 anchoring on a single Ph&#8208;Se, and the multivalence conversion of Se contributeto a six&#8208;electron conversion process with up to 507&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and an average voltage of 1.51&#160;V, as well as a high energy density of 665&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1. Based on the superior reversibility of thedeveloped di&#8208;Ph&#8208;Se electrode with ClRR, a remarkable rate performance (205 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and cycling performance (capacity retention of 77.3 % after 500cycles) are achieved. Significantly, the pouch cell delivers a record arealcapacity of up to 6.87&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and extraordinary self&#8208;discharge performance. This chalcogen&#8208;halogen coordination chemistry between the Se electrode and Cl provides a new insight for developing reversible and efficientbatteries with halogen redox reactions.

         <title>Chemical Zymogens and Transmembrane Activation of Transcription in Synthetic Cells</title>

An artificial signaling pathway is engineered herein such that a synthetic cell responds to an external biochemical stimulus by the production of adenosine triphosphate and transcription. The importance of cellularity is highlighted and encapsulation enables production of RNA in biochemical mixtures that otherwise inhibit transcription.








Abstract
In this work, synthetic cells equipped with an artificial signaling pathway that connects an extracellular trigger event to the activation of intracellular transcription are engineered. Learning from nature, this is done via an engineering of responsive enzymes, such that activation of enzymatic activity can be triggered by an external biochemical stimulus. Reversibly deactivated creatine kinase to achieve triggered production of adenosine triphosphate, and a reversibly deactivated nucleic acid polymerase for on&#8208;demand synthesis of RNA are engineered. An extracellular, enzyme&#8208;activated production of a diffusible zymogen activator is also designed. The key achievement of this work is that the importance of cellularity is illustrated whereby the separation of biochemical partners is essential to resolve their incompatibility, to enable transcription within the confines of a synthetic cell. The herein designed biochemical pathway and the engineered synthetic cells are arguably primitive compared to their natural counterpart. Nevertheless, the results present a significant step toward the design of synthetic cells with responsive behavior, en route from abiotic to life&#8208;like cell mimics.

         <title>Manipulating Coherent Exciton Dynamics in CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dots Using Magnetic Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fine&#8208;structure&#8208;splitting bright excitons in lead halide perovskite quantum dots represent an emerging platform for quantum information technologies. Herein a magnetic field is applied to modulate the exciton splitting and polarization in CsPbI3 QDs, to &#8220;synthesize&#8221; coherent superpositions of excitons, and to control coherent evolution of such superposition states under near&#8208;ambient temperature.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a promising material platform for quantum information processing owing to their strong light&#8211;matter interaction and relatively long&#8208;lived optical and spin coherences. In particular, the coherence of the fine&#8208;structure bright excitons is sustainable up to room temperature and can be observed even at an ensemble level. Here modulation of the polarization of these excitons in CsPbI3 QDs and manipulation of their time&#8208;domain coherent dynamics using a longitudinal magnetic field are demonstrated. The manipulation is realized using femtosecond quantum beat spectroscopy performed with both circularly&#8208; and linearly&#8208;polarized pulses. The results are well captured by the density of matrix simulation and are picturized using a Bloch sphere. This study forms the basis for preparing arbitrary coherent superpositions of excitons in perovskite QDs for an array of quantum technologies under near&#8208;ambient conditions.

         <title>Heterogenized Molecular Electrocatalyst Based on a Hydroxo&#8208;Bridged Binuclear Copper(II) Phenanthroline Compound for Selective Reduction of CO2 to Ethylene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous studies have shown that copper&#8208;based materials are promising catalysts for electroreductive coupling of CO2. However, a frequent problem is the generation of large amounts of hydrogen as a byproduct. In this context, a binuclear copper phenanthroline complex is presented which, in heterogenized form, generates ethylene and other C2 products in an aqueous electrolyte with minimal H2 formation.








Molecular copper catalysts have emerged as promising candidates for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Notable features of such systems include the ability of Cu to generate C2+&#160;products and the well&#8208;defined active sites that allow for targeted structural tuning. However, the frequently observed in situ formation of Cu nanoclusters has undermined the advantages of the molecular frameworks. It is therefore desirable to develop Cu&#8208;based catalysts that retain their molecular structures during electrolysis. In this context, a heterogenized binuclear hydroxo&#8208;bridged phenanthroline Cu(II) compound with a short Cu&#183;&#183;&#183;Cu distance is reported as a simple yet efficient catalyst for electrogeneration of ethylene and other C2 products. In an aqueous electrolyte, the catalyst demonstrates remarkable performance, with excellent Faradaic efficiency for C2 products (62%) and minimal H2 evolution (8%). Furthermore, it exhibits high stability, manifested by no observable degradation during 15 h of continuous electrolysis. The preservation of the atomic distribution of the active sites throughout electrolysis is substantiated through comprehensive characterizations, including X&#8208;ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, as well as control experiments. These findings establish a solid foundation for further investigations into targeted structural tuning, opening new avenues for enhancing the catalytic performance of Cu&#8208;based molecular electrocatalysts.

         <title>Evolutionary Reinforcement of Polymer Networks: A Stepwise&#8208;Enhanced Strategy for Ultrarobust Eutectogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stepwise&#8208;enhanced strategy is devised through complementary annealing and solvent exchange processes for the evolutionary reinforcement of gel networks crosslinked by crystalline domains. The resultant ultrarobust eutectogel exhibits record&#8208;breaking strength (31.8 MPa), Young's modulus (25.6 MPa), and toughness (76.0 MJ m&#8208;3), together with exceptional resistance ability to tear and crack propagation.








Abstract
Gel materials are appealing due to their diverse applications in biomedicine, soft electronics, sensors, and actuators. Nevertheless, the existing synthetic gels are often plagued by feeble network structures and inherent defects associated with solvents, which compromise their mechanical load&#8208;bearing capacity and cast persistent doubts about their reliability. Herein, combined with attractive deep eutectic solvent (DES), a stepwise&#8208;enhanced strategy is presented to fabricate ultrarobust eutectogels. It focuses on the continuous modulation and optimization of polymer networks through complementary annealing and solvent exchange processes, which drives a progressive increase in both quantity and mass of the interconnected polymer chains at microscopic scale, hence contributing to the evolutionary enhancement of network structure. The resultant eutectogel exhibits superb mechanical properties, including record&#8208;breaking strength (31.8&#160;MPa), toughness (76.0&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), and Young's modulus (25.6&#160;MPa), together with exceptional resistance ability to tear and crack propagation. Moreover, this eutectogel is able to be further programmed through photolithography to in situ create patterned eutectogel for imparting specific functionalities. Enhanced by its broad applicability to various DES combinations, this stepwise&#8208;enhanced strategy is poised to serve as a crucial template and methodology for the future development of robust gels.

         <title>1D Insertion Chains Induced Small&#8208;Polaron Collapse in MoS2 2D Layers Toward Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polaron collapse strategy is proposed by introducing 1D [MoS] chains into 2D MoS2 layers to gain intrinsic fast charge transfer. The as&#8208;obtained thermodynamically stable Mo2S3 exhibits high&#8208;rate capability (up to 60 C) and long&#8208;term cycling stability (over 15&#160;000 cycles) in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The study is expected to supplement a new idea for electrode design toward fast&#8208;charging batteries.








Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with high theoretical capacity is viewed as a promising anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries but suffers from inferior rate capability owing to the polaron&#8208;induced slow charge transfer. Herein, a polaron collapse strategy induced by electron&#8208;rich insertions is proposed to effectively solve the above issue. Specifically, 1D [MoS] chains are inserted into MoS2 to break the symmetry states of 2D layers and induce small&#8208;polaron collapse to gain fast charge transfer so that the as&#8208;obtained thermodynamically stable Mo2S3 shows metallic behavior with 107 times larger electrical conductivity than that of MoS2. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that Mo2S3 owns highly delocalized anions, which substantially reduce the interactions of Na&#8722;S to efficiently accelerate Na+ diffusion, endowing Mo2S3 lower energy barrier (0.38&#160;vs 0.65&#160;eV of MoS2). The novel Mo2S3 anode exhibits a high capacity of 510 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C and a superior high&#8208;rate stability of 217 mAh g&#8722;1 at 40 C over 15&#160;000 cycles. Further in situ and ex situ characterizations reveal the in&#8208;depth reversible redox chemistry in Mo2S3. The proposed polaron collapse strategy for intrinsically facilitating charge transfer can be conducive to electrode design for fast&#8208;charging batteries.

The as-obtained thermodynamically stable Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits high-rate capability (up to 60 C) and long-term cycling stability (over 15&#160;000 cycles) in sodium-ion batteries. The study is expected to supplement a new idea for electrode design toward fast-charging batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molybdenum disulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with high theoretical capacity is viewed as a promising anode for sodium-ion batteries but suffers from inferior rate capability owing to the polaron-induced slow charge transfer. Herein, a polaron collapse strategy induced by electron-rich insertions is proposed to effectively solve the above issue. Specifically, 1D [MoS] chains are inserted into MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to break the symmetry states of 2D layers and induce small-polaron collapse to gain fast charge transfer so that the as-obtained thermodynamically stable Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shows metallic behavior with 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; times larger electrical conductivity than that of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; owns highly delocalized anions, which substantially reduce the interactions of Na&#8722;S to efficiently accelerate Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion, endowing Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; lower energy barrier (0.38&#160;vs 0.65&#160;eV of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). The novel Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; anode exhibits a high capacity of 510 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 C and a superior high-rate stability of 217 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 40 C over 15&#160;000 cycles. Further in situ and ex situ characterizations reveal the in-depth reversible redox chemistry in Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The proposed polaron collapse strategy for intrinsically facilitating charge transfer can be conducive to electrode design for fast-charging batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong p&#8208;d Orbital Hybridization on Bismuth Nanosheets for High Performing CO2 Electroreduction</title>

The in situ confinement of metal atoms on bismuth nanosheet enables the d&#8208;p orbital hybridization to enhance electrocatalytic performance for carbon dioxide reduction.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) show great potential for a variety of electrocatalytic reactions. However, the atomic orbital hybridization effect of SAAs on the electrochemical reactions is unclear yet. Herein, the in situ confinement of vanadium/molybdenum/tungsten&#160;atoms on bismuth nanosheet is shown to create SAAs with rich grain boundaries, respectively. With the detailed analysis of microstructure and composition, the strong p&#8208;d orbital hybridization between bismuth and vanadium enables the exceptional electrocatalytic performance for carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction with the Faradaic efficiency nearly 100% for C1 products in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.4&#160;V, and a long&#8208;term electrolysis stability for 90&#160;h. In&#8208;depth in situ investigations with theoretical computations reveal that the electron delocalization toward vanadium atoms via the p&#8208;d orbital hybridization evokes the bismuth active centers for efficient CO2 activation via the &#963;&#8208;donation of O&#8208;to&#8208;Bi, thus reduces protonation energy barriers for formate production. With such fundamental understanding, SAA electrocatalyst is employed to fabricated the solar&#8208;driven electrolytic cell of CO2 reduction and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation, achieving an outstanding 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield of 90.5%. This study demonstrates a feasible strategy to rationally design advanced SAA electrocatalysts via the basic principles of p&#8208;d orbital hybridization.

         <title>A Machine Learning Study on High Thermal Conductivity Assisted to Discover Chalcogenides with Balanced Infrared Nonlinear Optical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput screening pipeline combining first&#8208;principle calculation and machine learning is proposed, using lattice thermal conductivity predicted by machine learning for the first time as primary screening criteria to discover mid&#8208;IR nonlinear optical (NLO) chalcogenides. Structural chemistry knowledge to balance thermal conducting and NLO&#8208;related properties is extracted during the procedure. For application, two potential mid&#8208;IR NLO materials with promising performances are identified.








Abstract
Exploration of novel nonlinear optical (NLO) chalcogenides with high laser&#8208;induced damage thresholds (LIDT) is critical for mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) solid&#8208;state laser applications. High lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;L) is crucial to increasing LIDT yet often neglected in the search for NLO crystals due to lack of accurate &#954;L data. A machine learning (ML) approach to predict &#954;L for over 6000 chalcogenides is hereby proposed. Combining ML&#8208;generated &#954;L data and first&#8208;principles calculation, a high&#8208;throughput screening route is initiated, and ten new potential mid&#8208;IR NLO chalcogenides with optimal bandgap, NLO coefficients, and thermal conductivity are discovered, in which Li2SiS3 and AlZnGaS4 are highlighted. Big&#8208;data analysis on structural chemistry proves that the chalcogenides having dense and simple lattice structures with low anisotropy, light atoms, and strong covalent bonds are likely to possess higher &#954;L. The four&#8208;coordinated motifs in which central cations show the bond valence sum of +2 to +3 and are from IIIA, IVA, VA, and IIB groups, such as those in diamond&#8208;like defect&#8208;chalcopyrite chalcogenides, are preferred to fulfill the desired structural chemistry conditions for balanced NLO and thermal properties. This work provides not only an efficient strategy but also interpretable research directions in the search for NLO crystals with high thermal conductivity.

         <title>Microfluidic&#8208;Assisted 3D Printing Zinc Powder Anode with 2D Conductive MOF/MXene Heterostructures for High&#8208;Stable Zinc&#8722;Organic Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative microfluidic&#8208;assisted 3D printing strategy is proposed to successfully realize 3D hierarchical porous Zn powder aerogel anode with 2D conductive MOF/MXene heterostructure. More importantly, a zinc&#8208;organic full battery matched with 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl organic cathode riveted on graphene delivers a high reversible discharge capacity and maintains a long cycle life of 1200 cycles with a capacity retention of 96.8%.








Abstract
Zinc powder (Zn&#8208;P) anodes have significant advantages in terms of universality and machinability compared with Zn foil anodes. However, their rough surface, which has a high surface area, intensifies the uncontrollable growth of Zn dendrites and parasitic side reactions. In this study, an anti&#8208;corrosive Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anode with a functional layer formed from a MXene and Cu&#8208;THBQ (MXene/Cu&#8208;THBQ) heterostructure is successfully fabricated via microfluidic&#8208;assisted 3D printing. The unusual anti&#8208;corrosive and strong adsorption of Zn ions using the MXene/Cu&#8208;THBQ functional layer can effectively homogenize the Zn ion flux and inhibit the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) during the repeated process of Zn plating/stripping, thus achieving stable Zn cycling. Consequently, a symmetric cell based on Zn&#8208;P with the MXene/Cu&#8208;THBQ anode exhibits a highly reversible cycling of 1800&#160;h at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a Zn&#8208;organic full battery matched with a 4&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidine&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl organic cathode riveted on graphene delivers a high reversible capacity and maintains a long cycle life.

         <title>Precipitated Iodine Cathode Enabled by Trifluoromethanesulfonate Oxidation for Cathode/Electrolyte Mutualistic Aqueous Zn&#8211;I Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel cathode/electrolyte mutualistic aqueous (CEMA) Zn&#8211;I battery by leveraging the inherent oxidation ability of trifluoromethanesulfonate in aqueous electrolyte toward triiodide species, which facilitates the creation of iodine sediment nanoparticles, is presented. An iodine host cathode is further realized via an in situ absorption technology. Through precisely tuning the I redox process, the CEMA Zn&#8211;I batteries demonstrate remarkable electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8211;I batteries hold great potential for high&#8208;safety and sustainable energy storage. However, the iodide shuttling effect and the hydrogen evolution reaction that occur in the aqueous electrolyte remain the main obstacles for their further development. Herein, the design of a cathode/electrolyte mutualistic aqueous (CEMA) Zn&#8211;I battery based on the inherent oxidation ability of aqueous trifluoromethanesulfonate ((OTf)&#8722;) electrolyte toward triiodide species is presented. This results in the formation of iodine sediment particles assembled by fine iodine nanocrystals (&#8776;10 nm). An iodine host cathode with high areal iodine loading is realized via a spontaneous absorption process that enriched redox&#8208;active iodine and iodide species from aqueous electrolyte onto nanoporous carbon based current collector. By tuning iodide redox process and suppressing competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, the assembled CEMA Zn&#8211;I batteries demonstrate a remarkable capacity retention of 76.9% over 1000 cycles at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, they exhibit a notable rate capability, with a capacity retention of 74.6% when the current density is increased from 0.5 to 5.0 mA cm&#8722;2. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the oxidation effect to repel redox&#8208;active species from the electrolyte to the cathode, paving a new avenue for high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn&#8211;I batteries.

     alt="Precipitated Iodine Cathode Enabled by Trifluoromethanesulfonate Oxidation for Cathode/Electrolyte Mutualistic Aqueous Zn&#8211;I Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a novel cathode/electrolyte mutualistic aqueous (CEMA) Zn&#8211;I battery by leveraging the inherent oxidation ability of trifluoromethanesulfonate in aqueous electrolyte toward triiodide species, which facilitates the creation of iodine sediment nanoparticles, is presented. An iodine host cathode is further realized via an in situ absorption technology. Through precisely tuning the I redox process, the CEMA Zn&#8211;I batteries demonstrate remarkable electrochemical performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn&#8211;I batteries hold great potential for high-safety and sustainable energy storage. However, the iodide shuttling effect and the hydrogen evolution reaction that occur in the aqueous electrolyte remain the main obstacles for their further development. Herein, the design of a cathode/electrolyte mutualistic aqueous (CEMA) Zn&#8211;I battery based on the inherent oxidation ability of aqueous trifluoromethanesulfonate ((OTf)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) electrolyte toward triiodide species is presented. This results in the formation of iodine sediment particles assembled by fine iodine nanocrystals (&#8776;10 nm). An iodine host cathode with high areal iodine loading is realized via a spontaneous absorption process that enriched redox-active iodine and iodide species from aqueous electrolyte onto nanoporous carbon based current collector. By tuning iodide redox process and suppressing competitive hydrogen evolution reaction, the assembled CEMA Zn&#8211;I batteries demonstrate a remarkable capacity retention of 76.9% over 1000 cycles at 0.5 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, they exhibit a notable rate capability, with a capacity retention of 74.6% when the current density is increased from 0.5 to 5.0 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the oxidation effect to repel redox-active species from the electrolyte to the cathode, paving a new avenue for high-performance aqueous Zn&#8211;I batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Surface Reconstruction toward Planar Heterojunction for Efficient and Stable FAPbI3 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple post&#8208;treatment using methylamine thiocyanate (MASCN) is developed to reconstruct the formamidinium lead iodide perovskite quantum dot (FAPbI3 QD) film surface. The MASCN post&#8208;treatment not only passivates the surface defects but also achieves in situ construction of planar heterojunctions. The obtained FAPbI3 QD solar cells exhibit a high power conversion efficiency of 16.23%, outperforming other reported FAPbI3 QD cells.








Abstract
Pure&#8208;phase &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 quantum dots (QDs) are the focus of an increasing interest in photovoltaics due to their superior ambient stability, large absorption coefficient, and long charge&#8208;carrier lifetime. However, the trap states induced by the ligand&#8208;exchange process limit the photovoltaic performances. Here, a simple post treatment using methylamine thiocyanate is developed to reconstruct the FAPbI3&#8208;QD film surface, in which a MAPbI3 capping layer with a thickness of 6.2 nm is formed on the film top. This planar perovskite heterojunction leads to a reduced density of trap&#8208;states, a decreased band gap, and a facilitated charge carrier transport. As a result, a record high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.23% with negligible hysteresis is achieved for the FAPbI3 QD solar cell, and it retains over 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in ambient environment for 1000 h.

         <title>Single&#8208;Molecule Graphene Liquid Cell Electron Microscopy for Instability of Intermediate Amyloid Fibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (GLC&#8208;TEM) is a novel single&#8208;molecule technique offering valuable insights into molecular processes. GLC&#8208;TEM provides an extension of the observable limit for biomolecules and demonstrates molecular structural variations. Using GLC&#8208;TEM, stochastic and time&#8208;resolved investigations of single amyloid fibril reveal structural perturbations during the initial fibrillar stage.








Abstract
Single&#8208;molecule techniques are powerful microscopy methods that provide new insights into biological processes. Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;TEM) is an ideal single&#8208;molecule technique for overcoming the poor spatiotemporal resolution of optical approaches. However, single&#8208;molecule LP&#8208;TEM is limited by several challenges such as electron&#8208;beam&#8208;induced molecular damage, difficulty in identifying biomolecular species, and a lack of analytical approaches for conformational dynamics. Herein, a single&#8208;molecule graphene liquid&#8208;cell TEM (GLC&#8208;TEM) technique that enables the investigation of real&#8208;time structural perturbations of intact amyloid fibrils is presented. It is demonstrated that graphene membranes significantly extend the observation period of native amyloid beta proteins without causing oxidative damage owing to electron beams, which is necessary for imaging. Stochastic and time&#8208;resolved investigations of single fibrils reveal that structural perturbations in the early fibrillar stage are responsible for the formation of various amyloid polymorphs. The advantage of observing structural behavior in real time with unprecedented resolution will potentially make GLC&#8208;TEM a complementary approach to other single&#8208;molecule techniques.

         <title>Robust and Flame&#8208;Retardant Zylon Aerogel Fibers for Wearable Thermal Insulation and Sensing in Harsh Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;organic aerogel fibers stable up to 650&#160;&#176;C derived from Zylon are synthesized by controlled proton absorption gelation spinning and heat&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking strategy. The aerogel fibers exhibit high flexibility, high mechanical strength (8.6&#160;MPa), good flame retardancy (LOI = 54.2%), and textiles woven from these aerogel fibers exhibit outstanding thermal insulation and sensing properties.








Abstract
The exceptional lightweight, highly porous, and insulating properties of aerogel fibers make them ideal for thermal insulation. However, current aerogel fibers face limitations due to their low resistance to harsh environments and a lack of intelligent responses. Herein, a universal strategy for creating polymer aerogel fibers using crosslinked nanofiber building blocks is proposed. This approach combines controlled proton absorption gelation spinning with a heat&#8208;induced crosslinking process. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, Zylon aerogel fibers that exhibited robust thermal stability (up to 650&#160;&#176;C), high flame retardancy (limiting oxygen index of 54.2%), and extreme chemical resistance are designed and synthesized. These fibers possess high porosity (98.6%), high breaking strength (8.6&#160;MPa), and low thermal conductivity (0.036 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). These aerogel fibers can be knotted or woven into textiles, utilized in harsh environments (&#8722;196&#8211;400&#160;&#176;C), and demonstrate sensitive self&#8208;powered sensing capabilities. This method of developing aerogel fibers expands the applications of high&#8208;performance polymer fibers and holds great potential for future applications in wearable smart protective fabrics.

         <title>An Ultrahigh Power Density and Ultralow Wear GaN&#8208;Based Tribovoltaic Nanogenerator for Sliding Ball Bearing as Self&#8208;Powered Wireless Sensor Node</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A GaN&#8208;based ball&#8208;on&#8208;disk structure tribovoltaic nanogenerator is invented, which exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage exceeding 130 V and an ultrahigh normalized average power density of 24.6 kW m&#8208;2 Hz&#8208;1 (282&#8208;fold improvement compared to previous works). It also achieves frictional energy harvesting for industrial bearings, demonstrating great potential for intelligent components and self&#8208;powered sensor nodes in the industrial Internet of Things.








Abstract
The tribovoltaic effect is regarded as a newly discovered semiconductor effect for mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion. However, tribovoltaic nanogenerators (TVNGs) are widely limited by low output power and poor wear resistance for device integration and application. Here, this work invents a TVNG using a ball&#8208;on&#8208;disk structure composed of gallium nitride (GaN) and steel ball. It exhibits an open&#8208;circuit voltage exceeding 130&#160;V and an ultrahigh normalized average power density of 24.6&#160;kW m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1, which is a 282&#8208;fold improvement compared to previous works. Meanwhile, this TVNG reaches an ultralow wear rate of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;7 mm3 N&#8722;1 m&#8722;1 at a maximum contact pressure of 906.6&#160;MPa, surpassing the TVNG composed of Si by three orders of magnitude due to the local concentrated injection of frictional energy. Based on the TVNG, this work constructs the first tribovoltaic bearing and achieves sensing signal transmission within 16 s (300 rpm) by integrating a management circuit, a transmission module, a relay, and receiving terminals, which enables the monitoring of ambient pressure and temperature. This work realizes a GaN&#8208;based TVNG with high&#8208;performance and low wear simultaneously, demonstrating great potential for intelligent components and self&#8208;powered sensor nodes in the industrial Internet of Things.

         <title>Highly Crystalized MAPbX3 Perovskite Triangular Nanowire Arrays for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystalline MAPbX3 triangular nanowire (TNW) arrays are prepared using a simple and effective method. The poly(dimethylsiloxane) TNW arrays serve as templates to induce the growth of perovskite molecules with adjustable size and periodicity via space&#8208;confined effect. Finally, the large&#8208;scale MAPbI3 TNW&#8208;based photodetector arrays present potentials for scaling&#8208;up applications as high&#8208;resolution image sensors.








Abstract
Here, a facile fabrication approach for the high&#8208;quality 1D perovskite triangular nanowire (TNW) array synthesis through space&#8208;confined effect is reported. A soft stamp containing 1D triangular linear array pattern is used to confine the MAPbX3 solution and to guide the growth of the nanowires along the prescribed direction with good crystallinity. The further constructed photodetectors based on the obtained MAPbI3 TNWs exhibit superior photoresponse properties with a responsivity of (125.2 &#177; 2.5) A W&#8722;1 and detectivity of (2.8 &#177; 0.8) &#215; 1013 Jones at the wavelength of 650 nm. This excellent performance is attributed to the highly crystalline TNW with optical anisotropy and a small asymptotic height, which reduces the probability of the photon reflection and promotes the carrier transport. More interestingly, the increased surface area of the triangular device can present superior flexibility after a couple of thousands of bending cycles. Furthermore, by fabricating 7 &#215; 7 photodetector arrays, the potential image sensor application is demonstrated. The perovskite nanowire fabrication approach is scalable and compatible with current semiconductor manufacturing, which indicates their great potential in broad applications.

         <title>Revealing the Mutually Enhanced Mechanism of Necroptosis and Immunotherapy Induced by Defect Engineering and Piezoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin CaBi2Nb2O9 nanosheets with oxygen vacancies show a high piezocatalytic effect. Reactive oxygen species and overloaded Ca2+ upregulate the expression of RIPK3 and MIKL proteins, inducing the onset of necroptosis. Necroptosis induces a robust immune response by inducing DC maturation and macrophage M1 polarization. The secreted cytokine TNF&#8208;&#945; again enhances necroptosis. A mutual enhancement is thereby achieved.








Abstract
Owing to low immunogenicity&#8208;induced immune escape and short&#8208;term circulating immune responses, the efficiency of immunotherapy is unsatisfactory. Therefore, triggering immunogenic cell death and establishing a long&#8208;term, mutually reinforced treatment modality are urgent challenges. In this study, ultrathin CaBi2Nb2O9 nanosheets with tunable oxygen vacancies (abbreviated as CBNO&#8208;OV1) are prepared for synergistic necroptosis and immunotherapy. The optimized vacancy concentration significantly improves the piezoelectric effect under ultrasound irradiation, thereby considerably improving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Density functional theory shows that oxygen vacancies can improve the efficiency of electron hole separation by suppressing their recombination, thus resulting in enhanced piezocatalytic activity. Moreover, the piezoelectric effect improves the permeability of tumor cell membranes, thus resulting in Ca2+ influx. Additionally, CBNO&#8208;OV1 also releases a portion of Ca2+, which induces necroptosis assisted by explosive ROS. Ribonucleic acid transcription tests suggest the mechanisms associated with immune response activation and necroptosis. More importantly, necroptosis can trigger a significant immune response in vivo, thus activating macrophage M1 polarization through the NF&#8208;kappa B pathway and promoting T&#8208;cell differentiation.Tumor Necrosis Factor&#8208;&#945; differentiated from macrophages conversely promotes necroptosis, thus realizing a mutually enhanced effect. This study demonstrates the feasibility of mutually reinforced necroptosis and immunotherapy for amplifying tumor efficacy.

         <title>Decoupling Activation and Transport by Electron&#8208;Regulated Atomic&#8208;Bi Harnessed Surface&#8208;to&#8208;Pore Interface for Vanadium Redox Flow Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;regulated atomic&#8208;Bi harnessed surface&#8208;to&#8208;pore interfaces are successfully designed and prepared for enhancing the power density and round&#8208;trip efficiency of vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) through decoupling activation and mass transport. VRFB energy storage systems with such a catalytic interface efficiently enable the conversion and transmission of energy from renewable sources.








Abstract
Vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) promises a route to low&#8208;cost and grid&#8208;scale electricity storage using renewable energy resources. However, the interplay of mass transport and activation processes of high&#8208;loading catalysts makes it challenging to drive high&#8208;performance density VRFB. Herein, a surface&#8208;to&#8208;pore interface design that unlocks the potential of atomic&#8208;Bi&#8208;exposed catalytic surface via decoupling activation and transport is reported. The functional interface accommodates electron&#8208;regulated atomic&#8208;Bi catalyst in an asymmetric Bi&#9472;O&#9472;Mn structure that expedites the V3+/V2+ conversion, and a mesoporous Mn3O4 sub&#8208;scaffold for rapid shuttling of redox&#8208;active species, whereby the site accessibility is maximized, contrary to conventional transport&#8208;limited catalysts. By in situ grafting this interface onto micron&#8208;porous carbon felt (Bi1&#8208;sMn3O4&#8208;CF), a high&#8208;performance flow battery is achieved, yielding a record high energy efficiency of 76.72% even at a high current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a peak power density of 1.503&#160;W cm&#8722;2, outdoing the battery with sMn3O4&#8208;CF (62.60%, 0.978&#160;W cm&#8722;2) without Bi catalyst. Moreover, this battery renders extraordinary durability of over 1500 cycles, bespeaking a crucial breakthrough toward sustainable redox flow batteries (RFBs).

         <title>Ultrahigh Capacity from Complexation&#8208;Enabled Aluminum&#8208;Ion Batteries with C70 as the Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel complexation mechanism is reported for energy storage in RABs by utilizing 0D fullerene C70 as the cathode. This mechanism enables remarkable discharge voltage (&#8776;1.65&#160;V) and especially a record&#8208;high reversible specific capacity (750&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) of RABs. This work provides a new route to realize high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life batteries following the complexation mechanism.








Abstract
Restricted by the available energy storage modes, currently rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (RABs) can only provide a very limited experimental capacity, regardless of the very high gravimetric capacity of Al (2980&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). Here, a novel complexation mechanism is reported for energy storage in RABs by utilizing 0D fullerene C70 as the cathode. This mechanism enables remarkable discharge voltage (&#8776;1.65&#160;V) and especially a record&#8208;high reversible specific capacity (750&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1) of RABs. By means of in situ Raman monitoring, mass spectrometry, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is found that this elevated capacity is attributed to the direct complexation of one C70 molecule with 23.5 (super)halogen moieties (superhalogen AlCl4 and/or halogen Cl) in average, forming (super)halogenated C70&#183;(AlCl4)mCln&#8208;m complexes. Upon discharging, decomplexation of C70&#183;(AlCl4)mCln&#8208;m releases AlCl4&#8722;/Cl&#8722; ions while preserving the intact fullerene cage. This work provides a new route to realize high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life batteries following the complexation mechanism.

By means of in situ Raman monitoring, mass spectrometry, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is found that this elevated capacity is attributed to the direct complexation of one C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; molecule with 23.5 (super)halogen moieties (superhalogen AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and/or halogen Cl) in average, forming (super)halogenated C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;(AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n-m&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; complexes. Upon discharging, decomplexation of C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;(AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cl&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;n-m&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; releases AlCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ions while preserving the intact fullerene cage. This work provides a new route to realize high-capacity and long-life batteries following the complexation mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarization&#8208; and Gate&#8208;Tunable Optoelectronic Reverse in 2D Semimetal/Semiconductor Photovoltaic Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D semimetal/semiconductor photovoltaic heterostructures are developed to achieve a high polarization ratio (PR) value and unique optoelectronic reverse with bidirectional rectifying and photoresponse. Furthermore, the device exhibits a polarization induced reverse in photocurrent, resulting in a possibility of PR value reaching infinity, paving the way for integration of the multiple functional modules into a single module toward &#8220;All&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; system.








Abstract
Polarimetric photodetector can acquire higher resolution and more surface information of imaging targets in complex environments due to the identification of light polarization. To date, the existing technologies yet sustain the poor polarization sensitivity (&lt;10), far from market application requirement. Here, the photovoltaic detectors with polarization&#8208; and gate&#8208;tunable optoelectronic reverse phenomenon are developed based on semimetal 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2 and ambipolar WSe2. The device exhibits gate&#8208;tunable reverse in rectifying and photovoltaic characters due to the directional inversion of energy band, yielding a wide range of current rectification ratio from 10&#8722;2 to 103 and a clear object imaging with 100 &#215; 100 pixels. Acting as a polarimetric photodetector, the polarization ratio (PR) value can reach a steady state value of &#8776;30, which is compelling among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D&#8208;based polarized detectors. The sign reversal of polarization&#8208;sensitive photocurrent by varying the light polarization angles is also observed, that can enable the PR value with a potential to cover possible numbers (1&#8594;+&#8734;/&#8208;&#8734;&#8594;&#8722;1). This work develops a photovoltaic detector with polarization&#8208; and gate&#8208;tunable optoelectronic reverse phenomenon, making a significant progress in polarimetric imaging and multifunction integration applications.

         <title>Rapid Surface Reconstruction in Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells by Blade Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
N,N&#8208;diphenylguanidine monohydrobromide (DPGABr) dissolved in acetonitrile is blade&#8208;coated on the perovskite layer in air to reconstruct the perovskite surface by forming amorphous DPGABr&#8211;PbI2 complex in hundreds of milliseconds. The resultant devices show a relative enhancement of 15% in the average power conversion efficiency (PCE). More importantly, the device performance undergoes negligible degradation even after 1&#8208;year storage in air.








Abstract
Blade coating has been developed to be an essential technique for large&#8208;area fabrication of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, effective surface treatment of the perovskite layer, which is a critical step for improving PSC performance, remains challenges during blade coating due to the short interaction time between the modification solution and the perovskite layer, as well as the limited selection of available organic solvents. In this study, a novel modifier N,N&#8208;diphenylguanidine monohydrobromide (DPGABr) dissolved in acetonitrile (ACN) is blade coated on the MA0.7FA0.3PbI3 surface in air to reconstruct the perovskite surface in hundreds of milliseconds. This work finds that the solvent ACN rapidly dissolves organic iodide of the perovskite layer and leads to a PbI2&#8208;rich surface, providing reactive sites for DPGABr to form a thin DPGABr/PbI2 complex layer. This surface reconstruction can effectively passivate defects and induce n&#8208;type doping on the perovskite surface to facilitate electron transfer. The resultant devices show a 15% improvement in average power conversion efficiency. More importantly, the devices with the surface reconstruction show outstanding long&#8208;term stability, with negligible performance degradation even after 1&#8208;year storage in air. This study presents a convenient and effective approach for improving the performance of blade&#8208;coated PSCs prepared in air.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Lipid&#8208;Based Nanoparticles: Selective Behavior at the Nano&#8208;Bio Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthetic diacylglycerol analogue lipid DOaG induces phase separation in lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles, generating distinct lipid droplets. In liposomes, DOaG&#8208;induced lipid packing defects&#160;facilitate recognition and recruitment of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), with subsequent selective hydrolysis of the DOaG&#8208;rich lipid droplet. In mRNA&#8208;LNPs DOaG induces phase separation, leading to selective cell targeting, mRNA delivery, and concomitant protein expression in vivo.








Abstract
The membrane&#8208;protein interface on lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles influences their in vivo behavior. Better understanding may evolve current drug delivery methods toward effective targeted nanomedicine. Previously, the cell&#8208;selective accumulation of a liposome formulation in vivo is demonstrated, through the recognition of lipid phase&#8208;separation by triglyceride lipases. This exemplified how liposome morphology and composition can determine nanoparticle&#8208;protein interactions. Here, the lipase&#8208;induced compositional and morphological changes of phase&#8208;separated liposomes&#8212;which bear a lipid droplet in their bilayer&#8212; are investigated, and the mechanism upon which&#160;lipases recognize and bind to the particles is unravelled. The selective lipolytic degradation of the phase&#8208;separated lipid droplet is observed, while nanoparticle integrity remains intact. Next, the Tryptophan&#8208;rich loop of the lipase is identified as the region with which the enzymes bind to the particles. This preferential binding is due to lipid packing defects induced on the liposome surface by phase separation. In parallel, the existing knowledge that phase separation leads to in vivo selectivity, is utilized to generate phase&#8208;separated mRNA&#8208;LNPs that target cell&#8208;subsets in zebrafish embryos, with subsequent mRNA delivery and protein expression. Together, these findings can expand the current knowledge on selective nanoparticle&#8208;protein communications and in vivo behavior, aspects that will assist to gain control of lipid&#8208;based nanoparticles.

In article number 2304655, Jian Xiao, Lei Dong, Chunming Wang, and co&#8208;workers report the first&#8208;ever oligosaccharide called OG6 (it is a string of six sugar rings in the structure) that can promote hair growth. The authors discovered it by &#8216;unmasking&#8217; its hidden activity from a longer molecule. Therefore, in this image, they illustrate OG6 as a winning &#8216;lottery&#8217; comprising six sugar balls. When the curtain ascends (&#8216;unmasking&#8217;) , the OG6 balls roll out and light up the golden coins below. These coins represent hair follicles &#8208; shining, floating, and entering the hair growth phase (&#8216;anagen&#8217;), as a consequence of OG6's magic power!

Polarimetric Photodetectors
Due to the directional inversion of energy band, the photovoltaic detectors based on 2D anisotropic semimetal and ambipolar semiconductor exhibit an optoelectronic reverse phenomenon. In this image, the transport direction of photocurrent is readily reversed by tuning the gate voltage and incident light polarization, yielding a reversible rectifying and photovoltaic characteristic as well as exceptional polarimetric photodetection performance. More details can be found in article number 2309371 by Zhongming Wei, Jingbo Li, Nengjie Huo, and co&#8208;workers.

Monolayer&#945;&#8208;Tellurene
Monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene, which has a 1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;like lattice structure, has been predicted to be a novel two&#8208;dimensional semiconductor. The article number 2309023 by Xiaochun Huang, Baisheng Sa, Roland Wiesendanger, and co&#8208;workers reports on a novel bottom&#8208;up approach, using three atom&#8208;long Te chains, derived from the dynamic non&#8208;equilibrium growth of an &#945; &#8208;Si:Te alloy, as building blocks for the self&#8208;assembly of monolayer &#945;&#8208;tellurene on a Sb2Te3 substrate.

         <dc:description>
Biological vision is an exciting source of inspiration for the development of artificial vision systems. Using neuromorphic devices to simulate the functions of different parts in the biological vision pathway is beneficial to realize ultra&#8208;low power consumption and high&#8208;speed machine vision. Meanwhile, the development of photoelectric materials and the novelty of device structure accelerate the realization of this goal.








Abstract
The development of artificial intelligence has posed a challenge to machine vision based on conventional complementary metal&#8208;oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits owing to its high latency and inefficient power consumption originating from the data shuffling between memory and computation units. Gaining more insights into the function of every part of the visual pathway for visual perception can bring the capabilities of machine vision in terms of robustness and generality. Hardware acceleration of more energy&#8208;efficient and biorealistic artificial vision highly necessitates neuromorphic devices and circuits that are able to mimic the function of each part of the visual pathway. In this paper, we&#160;review the structure and function of the entire class of visual neurons from the retina to the primate visual cortex within reach (Chapter 2) are reviewed. Based on the extraction of biological principles, the recent hardware&#8208;implemented visual neurons located in different parts of the visual pathway are discussed in detail in Chapters 3 and 4. Furthermore, valuable applications of inspired artificial vision in different scenarios (Chapter 5) are provided. The functional description of the visual pathway and its inspired neuromorphic devices/circuits are expected to provide valuable insights for the design of next&#8208;generation artificial visual perception systems.

         <title>Oral Nanomedicine: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the impact of biological barriers (the gastric acid and intestinal mucosal barrier) on the bioavailability of oral medicine in the delivery process. Notably, nanotechnology sheds light on oral medical therapy in diverse diseases by endowing organic and inorganic nanomaterials with more possibility to enhance oral bioavailability.








Abstract
Compared to injection administration, oral administration is free of discomfort, wound infection, and complications and has a higher compliance rate for patients with diverse diseases. However, oral administration reduces the bioavailability of medicines, especially biologics (e.g., peptides, proteins, and antibodies), due to harsh gastrointestinal biological barriers. In this context, the development and prosperity of nanotechnology have helped improve the bioactivity and oral availability of oral medicines. On this basis, first, the biological barriers to oral administration are discussed, and then oral nanomedicine based on organic and inorganic nanomaterials and their biomedical applications in diverse diseases are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities in the future development of oral nanomedicine, which may provide a vital reference for the eventual clinical transformation and standardized production of oral nanomedicine, are put forward.

The continuous innovation of artificial intelligence impacts the cognitive laws and scientific methods, and reconstructs the knowledge and wisdom system in materials science. This article provides the thinking of materials informatics in the future, from the data, descriptor, generative model, directed design model, cotraining model, to experimental automation, to achieve a more digital, intelligent, and automated construction of materials informatics.








Abstract
Combining materials science, artificial intelligence (AI), physical chemistry, and other disciplines, materials informatics is continuously accelerating the vigorous development of new materials. The emergence of &#8220;GPT (Generative Pre&#8208;trained Transformer) AI&#8221; shows that the scientific research field has entered the era of intelligent civilization with &#8220;data&#8221; as the basic factor and &#8220;algorithm + computing power&#8221; as the core productivity. The continuous innovation of AI will impact the cognitive laws and scientific methods, and reconstruct the knowledge and wisdom system. This leads to think more about materials informatics. Here, a comprehensive discussion of AI models and materials infrastructures is provided, and the advances in the discovery and design of new materials are reviewed. With the rise of new research paradigms triggered by &#8220;AI for Science&#8221;, the vane of materials informatics: &#8220;MatGPT&#8221;, is proposed and the technical path planning from the aspects of data, descriptors, generative models, pretraining models, directed design models, collaborative training, experimental robots, as well as the efforts and preparations needed to develop a new generation of materials informatics, is carried out. Finally, the challenges and constraints faced by materials informatics are discussed, in order to achieve a more digital, intelligent, and automated construction of materials informatics with the joint efforts of more interdisciplinary scientists.

         <title>Microfluidic Platforms for Real&#8208;Time In Situ Monitoring of Biomarkers for Cellular Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidic platforms based on fluorescence, electrochemistry, mass spectrometry, colorimetry are used for the real&#8208;time in situ monitoring of biomarkers for cellular processes of cell, virus, and bacteria. This review will draw a picture of this research area, highlight the advantages and disadvantages of existing methodologies for real&#8208;time in situ monitoring of biomarkers in cellular processes, and provide a prospective investigation of cellular processes.








Abstract
Cellular processes are mechanisms carried out at the cellular level that are aimed at guaranteeing the stability of the organism they comprise. The investigation of cellular processes is key to understanding cell fate, understanding pathogenic mechanisms, and developing new therapeutic technologies. Microfluidic platforms are thought to be the most powerful tools among all methodologies for investigating cellular processes because they can integrate almost all types of the existing intracellular and extracellular biomarker&#8208;sensing methods and observation approaches for cell behavior, combined with precisely controlled cell culture, manipulation, stimulation, and analysis. Most importantly, microfluidic platforms can realize real&#8208;time in situ detection of secreted proteins, exosomes, and other biomarkers produced during cell physiological processes, thereby providing the possibility to draw the whole picture for a cellular process. Owing to their advantages of high throughput, low sample consumption, and precise cell control, microfluidic platforms with real&#8208;time in situ monitoring characteristics are widely being used in cell analysis, disease diagnosis, pharmaceutical research, and biological production. This review focuses on the basic concepts, recent progress, and application prospects of microfluidic platforms for real&#8208;time in situ monitoring of biomarkers in cellular processes.

         <title>Structural Understanding for High&#8208;Voltage Stabilization of Lithium Cobalt Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural instability is the major factor limiting access to higher capacity and energy density of the monopoly LiCoO2 cathode in consumer electronics. This necessitates in&#8208;depth and thorough knowledge of the LiCoO2 structure. The present review focuses on the fundamental structural understanding of LiCoO2 and aims to establish a deeper structure&#8211;performance relationship to better guide future structural stabilization.








Abstract
The rapid development of modern consumer electronics is placing higher demands on the lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2; LCO) cathode that powers them. Increasing operating voltage is exclusively effective in boosting LCO capacity and energy density but is inhibited by the innate high&#8208;voltage instability of the LCO structure that serves as the foundation and determinant of its electrochemical behavior in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This has stimulated extensive research on LCO structural stabilization. Here, it is focused on the fundamental structural understanding of LCO cathode from long&#8208;term studies. Multi&#8208;scale structures concerning LCO bulk and surface and various structural issues along with their origins and corresponding stabilization strategies with specific mechanisms are uncovered and elucidated at length, which will certainly deepen and advance the knowledge of LCO structure and further its inherent relationship with electrochemical performance. Based on these understandings, remaining questions and opportunities for future stabilization of the LCO structure are also emphasized.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators Based on Fluid Medium: From Fundamental Mechanisms toward Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 6, February 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluid&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (FB&#8208;TENGs) are emerging energy technologies with improved effective contact area and prolonged triboelectric effect compared to their solid&#8208;based counterparts. This review summarizes the working mechanism and optimization strategies of various FB&#8208;TENGs, including liquid&#8208;solid, gas&#8208;solid, liquid&#8208;liquid, and gas&#8208;liquid TENGs. Their respective advantages, applications, and challenges have been also systematically discussed, offering guidance for designing high&#8208;performance FB&#8208;TENGs.








Abstract
Fluid&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (FB&#8208;TENGs) are at the forefront of promising energy technologies, demonstrating the ability to generate electricity through the dynamic interaction between two dissimilar materials, wherein at least one is a fluidic medium (such as gas or liquid). By capitalizing on the dynamic and continuous properties of fluids and their interface interactions, FB&#8208;TENGs exhibit a larger effective contact area and a longer&#8208;lasting triboelectric effect in comparison to their solid&#8208;based counterparts, thereby affording longer&#8208;term energy harvesting and higher&#8208;precision self&#8208;powered sensors in harsh conditions. In this review, various fluid&#8208;based mechanical energy harvesters, including liquid&#8208;solid, gas&#8208;solid, liquid&#8208;liquid, and gas&#8208;liquid TENGs, have been systematically summarized. Their working mechanism, optimization strategies, respective advantages and applications, theoretical and simulation analysis, as well as the existing challenges, have also been comprehensively discussed, which provide prospective directions for device design and mechanism understanding of FB&#8208;TENGs.

         <title>Linearly Interlinked Fe&#8208;Nx&#8208;Fe Single Atoms Catalyze High&#8208;Rate Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Linearly interlinked single atoms offer unprecedented physiochemical properties, but their synthesis for practical applications still poses significant challenges. Herein, we presented linearly interlinked iron single&#8208;atom catalysts that loaded onto interconnected carbon channels as cathodic sulfur hosts for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries. The interlinked iron single&#8208;atom exhibit unique metallic iron bonds that facilitate the transfer of electrons to the sulfur cathode, thereby accelerating the reaction kinetics. Additionally, the columnated and interlinked carbon channels ensure rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics to support high&#8208;rate battery reactions. By combining the iron atomic chains and the topological carbon channels, the resulting sulfur cathodes demonstrate effective high&#8208;rate conversion performance while maintaining excellent stability. Remarkably, even after 5000 cycles at a current density of 10 A g&#8722;1, the Na&#8208;S battery retains a capacity of 325 mAh g&#8722;1. This work could open a new avenue in the design of catalysts and carbon ionic channels, paving the way to achieve sustainable and high&#8208;performance energy devices.

         <title>Surface Crystallization Modulation towards Highly&#8208;Oriented and Phase&#8208;Pure Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites have shown great potential towards stable and efficient photovoltaic devices. However, the crystal orientation and phase impurity issues of 2D perovskite films originated from the anisotropic crystal structure and specific growth mechanism have demoted their optoelectronic performances. Here, we introduce the surface crystallization modulation technique to fabricate the high&#8208;quality 2D perovskite films with both vertical crystal orientation and high phase purity by regulating the crystallization dynamics. The solvent atmosphere condition is instituted during film processing, which promotes the formation of an oriented 2D perovskite layer in stoichiometric composition at the vapor&#8208;liquid interface and templates the subsequent film growth. The solar cells based on the optimized 2D perovskite films exhibit the power conversion efficiency of 15.04%, the record for 2D perovskites (with the perovskite slab thickness n &#8804; 3 and high phase purity). The solar cells based on the highly&#8208;oriented and phase&#8208;pure 2D perovskite films also demonstrate the excellent thermal and humidity stabilities.

         <title>Growth Control of InP/ZnSe Heterostructured Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is controlled, ranging from tetrapod to spherical InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs, under the guidance of DFT calculations. The expanded morphology envelope permits InP/ZnSe heterostructured NCs to customize their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive ones, which will prompt their practical use in a range of photonic applications.








Abstract
The morphology of heterostructured semiconductor nanocrystals (h&#8208;NCs) dictates the spatial distribution of charge carriers and their recombination dynamics and/or transport, which are the main performance indicators of photonic applications utilizing h&#8208;NCs. The inability to control the morphology of heterovalent III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs composed of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free elements hinders their practical use. As a case study of III&#8208;V/II&#8208;VI h&#8208;NCs, the growth control of ZnSe epilayers on InP NCs is demonstrated here. The anisotropic morphology in InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs is attributed to the facet&#8208;dependent energy costs for the growth of ZnSe epilayers on different facets of InP NCs, and effective chemical means for controlling the growth rates of ZnSe on different surface planes are demonstrated. Ultimately, this article capitalizes on the controlled morphology of InP/ZnSe h&#8208;NCs to expand their photophysical characteristics from stable and pure emission to environment&#8208;sensitive one, which will facilitate their use in a variety of photonic applications.

         <title>Tunable Adhesion for All&#8208;Dry Transfer of 2D Materials Enabled by the Freezing of Transfer Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, by freezing the transfer medium to induce the crosslinking of polymer chains, the adhesion is successfully tuned between graphene and polymer for wafer&#8208;scale all&#8208;dry of graphene and MoS2 onto various substrates, compatible with industrial production for future applications.








Abstract
The real applications of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#8208;grown graphene films require the reliable techniques for transferring graphene from growth substrates onto application&#8208;specific substrates. The transfer approaches that avoid the use of organic solvents, etchants, and strong bases are compatible with industrial batch processing, in which graphene transfer should be conducted by dry exfoliation and lamination. However, all&#8208;dry transfer of graphene remains unachievable owing to the difficulty in precisely controlling interfacial adhesion to enable the crack&#8208; and contamination&#8208;free transfer. Herein, through controllable crosslinking of transfer medium polymer, the adhesion is successfully tuned between the polymer and graphene for all&#8208;dry transfer of graphene wafers. Stronger adhesion enables crack&#8208;free peeling of the graphene from growth substrates, while reduced adhesion facilitates the exfoliation of polymer from graphene surface leaving an ultraclean surface. This work provides an industrially compatible approach for transferring 2D materials, key for their future applications, and offers a route for tuning the interfacial adhesion that would allow for the transfer&#8208;enabled fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Self&#8208;Disassembling and Oxygen&#8208;Generating Porphyrin&#8208;Lipoprotein Nanoparticle for Targeted Glioblastoma Resection and Enhanced Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrin lipoprotein&#8208;coated calcium peroxide nanoparticles (PLCNP) help realize the targeted accumulation, enhance porphyrin&#8208;lipid fluorescence, and boost reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanoplatform enables precise fluorescence&#8208;guided GBM resection and enhances the post&#8208;operative PDT effect via real&#8208;time tumor fluorescence imaging and an ameliorated hypoxic tumor microenvironment.

Abstract
The dismal prognosis for glioblastoma multiform (GBM) patients is primarily attributed to the highly invasive tumor residual that remained after surgical intervention. The development of precise intraoperative imaging and postoperative residual removal techniques will facilitate the gross total elimination of GBM. Here, a self&#8208;disassembling porphyrin lipoprotein&#8208;coated calcium peroxide nanoparticles (PLCNP) is developed to target GBM via macropinocytosis, allowing for fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery of GBM and improving photodynamic treatment (PDT) of GBM residual by alleviating hypoxia. By reducing self&#8208;quenching and enhancing lysosome escape efficiency, the incorporation of calcium peroxide (CaO2) cores in PLCNP amplifies the fluorescence intensity of porphyrin&#8208;lipid. Furthermore, the CaO2 core has diminished tumor hypoxia and improves the PDT efficacy of PLCNP, enabling low&#8208;dose PDT and reversing tumor progression induced by hypoxia aggravation following PDT. Taken together, this self&#8208;disassembling and oxygen&#8208;generating porphyrin&#8208;lipoprotein nanoparticle may serve as a promising all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanotheranostic platform for guiding precise GBM excision and empowering post&#8208;operative PDT, providing a clinically applicable strategy to combat GBM in a safe and effective manner.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Rapid 3D Printing of Photoresponsive Resins for Optically Clear Multifunctional 3D Objects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors have developed novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven acrylic resins for photoactive 3D printing. Their mechanistic evaluation of photoinitiating systems enable 3D printing of transparent objects with rapid build speeds and exceptional feature resolution. By incorporating hexaarylbiimidazole derivatives in the resin formulation, spatially&#8208;resolved photoactivation is achieved, providing capabilities such as crack healing and selective erasing under violet/blue light irradiation.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven 3D printing is gaining significant attention for its unparalleled build speed and high&#8208;resolution in additive manufacturing. However, extending vat photopolymerization to multifunctional, photoresponsive materials poses challenges, such as light attenuation and interference between the photocatalysts (PCs) and photoactive moieties. This study introduces novel visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven acrylic resins that enable rapid, high&#8208;resolution photoactive 3D printing. The synergistic combination of a cyanine&#8208;based PC, borate, and iodonium coinitiators (HNu 254) achieves an excellent printing rate and feature resolution under low&#8208;intensity, red light exposure. The incorporation of novel hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) crosslinkers allows for spatially&#8208;resolved photoactivation upon exposure to violet/blue light. Furthermore, a photobleaching mechanism inhibited by HNu 254 during the photopolymerization process results in the production of optically&#8208;clear 3D printed objects. Real&#8208;time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy validates the rapid photopolymerization of the HABI&#8208;containing acrylic resin, whereas mechanistic evaluations reveal the underlying dynamics that are responsible for the rapid photopolymerization rate, wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photoactivation, and observed photobleaching phenomenon. Ultimately, this visible&#8208;light&#8208;based printing method demonstrates: (i) rapid printing rate of 22.5&#160;mm h&#8722;1, (ii) excellent feature resolution (&#8776;20&#160;&#181;m), and (iii) production of optically clear object with self&#8208;healing capability and spatially controlled cleavage. This study serves as a roadmap for developing next&#8208;generation &#8220;smart&#8221; 3D printing technologies.

An oriented molecular bridge is proposed to construct homogeneous buried interface and enhance interfacial carrier transport. The resulting perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with an active area of 0.08 cm2 and 1 cm2 obtain PCEs of 25.32% (certified PCE: 25.32%) and 24.20%, respectively. In addition, the PSCs with oriented molecular bridge also exhibit excellent stability.








Abstract
Buried interface optimization matters the efficiency improvement of planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and the molecular bridge is reported to be an effective approach. Herein, a molecular bridge is constructed at buried interface using 4&#8208;chloro&#8208;3&#8208;sulfamoylbenzoic acid (CSBA), and its preferred arrangement is systematically investigated. It is elucidated that the CSBA molecular is prone to be orientationally absorbed on TiO2 surface through COOH&#8211;Ti, and then connect with perovskite through S&#9552;O&#8211;Pb, resulting in a feasible oriented molecular bridge. Contributing to the passivated interfacial defects, optimized interfacial energy level, and released perovskite tensile stress, resulting from the oriented CSBA molecular bridge, the PSCs with an active area of 0.08 cm2 achieve a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.32%, the highest among the TiO2&#8208;based planar PSCs. Encouragingly, the PSCs with an active area of 1 cm2 achieve a champion PCE of 24.20%, significantly promoting the efficiency progress of large&#8208;area PSCs. In addition, the PSCs with oriented CSBA molecular bridge possess enhanced stability, the unencapsulated PSCs can maintain &#8776;91% and &#8776;85% of their initial PCE after 3000 h aging under ambient condition and 1200 h aging under exposure to UV irradiation.

         <title>PbS Quantum Dots Ink with Months&#8208;long Shelf&#8208;lifetime Enabling Scalable and Efficient Short&#8208;wavelength Infrared Photodetectors</title>

Abstract
The phase&#8208;transfer ligand exchange of PbS quantum dots (QDs) has substantially simplified device fabrication giving hope for future industrial exploitation. However, this technique when applied to QDs of large size (&gt; 4&#160;nm) gives rise to inks with poor colloidal stability, thus hindering the development of QDs photodetectors in short&#8208;wavelength infrared range (&#8764;1000&#8208;3000&#160;nm). Here, we demonstrate that methylammonium lead iodide ligands can provide sufficient passivation of PbS QDs of size up to 6.7&#160;nm, enabling inks with a minimum of ten&#8208;week shelf&#8208;life time, as proven by optical absorption and solution&#8208;small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Furthermore, the maximum linear electron mobility of 4.5 &#215; 10&#8722;2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 was measured in field&#8208;effect transistors fabricated with fresh inks, while transistors fabricated with the same solution after ten&#8208;week storage retained 74% of the average starting electron mobility, demonstrating the outstanding quality both of the fresh and aged inks. Finally, photodetectors fabricated via blade&#8208;coating exhibited 76% external quantum efficiency at 1300&#160;nm and 1.8 &#215; 1012 Jones specific detectivity, values comparable with devices fabricated using ink with lower stability and wasteful methods such as spin&#8208;coating.

         <title>Chemical Rules for Stacked Kagome and Honeycomb Topological Semimetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing tight&#8208;binding model and high&#8208;throughput calculation, the chemical rules governing topological states have been studied in stacked kagome and honeycomb lattices.Calculation results reveal that the IAMX family materials are topological nodal&#8208;line semimetals categorized into four groups, and change into Weyl semimetals with spin&#8208;orbit coupling. The detailed chemical rule analysis paves a way to study the rich topological states in kagome materials.








Abstract
The chemical rules for predicting and understanding topological states in stacked kagome and honeycomb lattices are studied in both analytical and numerical ways. Starting with a minimal five&#8208;band tight&#8208;binding model, all the topological states are sorted into five groups, which are determined by the interlayer and intralayer hopping parameters. Combined with the model, an algorithm is designed to obtain a series of experimentally synthesized topological semimetals with kagome and honeycomb layers, i.e., IAMX family (IA = Alkali metal element, M = Rare earth metal element, X = Carbon group element), in the inorganic crystal structure database. A follow&#8208;up high&#8208;throughput calculation shows that IAMX family materials are all nodal&#8208;line semimetals and they will be Weyl semimetals after taking spin&#8208;orbit coupling into consideration. To have further insights into the topology of the IAMX family, a detailed chemical rule analysis is carried out on the high&#8208;throughput calculations, including the lattice constants of the structure, intralayer and interlayer couplings, bond strengths, electronegativity, and so on, which are consistent with the tight&#8208;binding model. This study provides a way to discover and modulate topological properties in stacked kagome and honeycomb crystals and offers candidates for studying topology&#8208;related properties like topological superconductors and axion&#160;insulators.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Compatible Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions with a SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Composite Barrier as Low&#8208;Voltage and Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Speed Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a sub&#8208;nanosecond switching speed of 500&#160;ps is demonstrated in HfO2&#8208;based ferroelectric tunnel junctions with a SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 composite barrier. The memristors show a low write current density, long retention, high endurance, 8 discrete and 128 gradually tunable conductance states, promising for next&#8208;generation nonvolatile memories and memristive synapses.








Abstract
The big data era requires ultrafast, low&#8208;power, and silicon&#8208;compatible materials and devices for information storage and processing. Here, ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) based on SiO2/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 composite barrier and both conducting electrodes are designed and fabricated on Si substrates. The FTJ achieves the fastest write speed of 500&#160;ps under 5&#160;V (2 orders of magnitude faster than reported silicon&#8208;compatible FTJs) or 10&#160;ns speed at a low voltage of 1.5&#160;V (the lowest voltage among FTJs at similar speeds), low write current density of 1.3 &#215; 104 A cm&#8722;2, 8 discrete states, good retention &gt;&#160;105 s at 85&#160;&#176;C, and endurance &gt;&#160;107. In addition, it provides a large read current (88 A cm&#8722;2) at 0.1&#160;V, 2 orders of magnitude larger than reported FTJs. Interestingly, in FTJ&#8208;based synapses, gradually tunable conductance states (128 states) with high linearity (&lt;1) are obtained by 10&#160;ns pulses of &lt;1.2&#160;V, and a high accuracy of 91.8% in recognizing fashion product images is achieved by online neural network simulations. These results highlight that silicon&#8208;compatible HfO2&#8208;based FTJs are promising for high&#8208;performance nonvolatile memories and electrical synapses.

         <title>Graphene and MOF Assembly: Enhanced Fabrication and Functional Derivative via MOF Amorphization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The assembly of graphene&#8208;MOFs (MOFs, metal&#8211;organic frameworks) carries substantial implications across diverse domains. This work provides an efficient fabrication of graphene&#8208;MOFs assembly, uncovers critical mechanisms underlying the assembly efficiency, and showcases the assembly's versatility in electrocatalysis through MOF amorphization. By doing so, it is aimed to open up new avenues for graphene&#8208;MOFs in advancing the field of electrocatalysis and beyond.








Abstract
The integration of graphene and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has numerous implications across various domains, but fabricating such assemblies is often complicated and time&#8208;consuming. Herein, a one&#8208;step preparation of graphene&#8208;MOF assembly is presented by directly impregnating vertical graphene (VG) arrays into the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) precursors under ambient conditions. This approach can effectively assemble multiple ZIFs, including ZIF&#8208;7, ZIF&#8208;8, and ZIF&#8208;67, resulting in their uniform dispersion on the VG with adjustable sizes and shapes. Hydrogen defects on the VG surface are critical in inducing such high&#8208;efficiency ZIF assembly, acting as the reactive sites to interact with the ZIF precursors and facilitate their crystallisation. The versatility of VG&#8208;ZIF&#8208;67 assembly is further demonstrated&#160;by exploring the process of MOF amorphization. Surprisingly, this process leads to an amorphous thin&#8208;film coating formed on VG (named VG&#8208;IL&#8208;amZIF&#8208;67), which preserves the short&#8208;range molecular bonds of crystalline ZIF&#8208;67 while sacrificing the long&#8208;range order. Such a unique film&#8208;on&#8208;graphene architecture maintains the essential characteristics and functionalities of ZIF&#8208;67 within a disordered arrangement, making it well&#8208;suited for electrocatalysis. In electrochemical oxygen reduction, VG&#8208;IL&#8208;amZIF&#8208;67 exhibits exceptional activity, selectivity, and stability to produce H2O2 in acid media.

Herein, a one-step preparation of graphene-MOF assembly is presented by directly impregnating vertical graphene (VG) arrays into the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) precursors under ambient conditions. This approach can effectively assemble multiple ZIFs, including ZIF-7, ZIF-8, and ZIF-67, resulting in their uniform dispersion on the VG with adjustable sizes and shapes. Hydrogen defects on the VG surface are critical in inducing such high-efficiency ZIF assembly, acting as the reactive sites to interact with the ZIF precursors and facilitate their crystallisation. The versatility of VG-ZIF-67 assembly is further demonstrated&#160;by exploring the process of MOF amorphization. Surprisingly, this process leads to an amorphous thin-film coating formed on VG (named VG-IL-amZIF-67), which preserves the short-range molecular bonds of crystalline ZIF-67 while sacrificing the long-range order. Such a unique film-on-graphene architecture maintains the essential characteristics and functionalities of ZIF-67 within a disordered arrangement, making it well-suited for electrocatalysis. In electrochemical oxygen reduction, VG-IL-amZIF-67 exhibits exceptional activity, selectivity, and stability to produce H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in acid media.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Rapid&#8208;Formation Sprayable Hydrogels for Challenging Tissue Injury Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly sought in medical scarcity situations, the hydrogel system offers rapid gelation and in situ spraying for treating extensive tissue injuries. Designed to address hemostasis, barrier establishment, and therapeutic treatment, the hydrogel forms in &lt;0.5 s, maintaining a balance between fluidity and mechanical strength. Its inherently bioactive includes osteogenesis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and angiogenesis, providing innovative solutions for challenging tissue injury management.








Abstract
Rapid&#8208;acting, convenient, and broadly applicable medical materials are in high demand for the treatment of extensive and intricate tissue injuries in extremely medical scarcity environment, such as battlefields, wilderness, and traffic accidents. Conventional biomaterials fail to meet all the high criteria simultaneously for emergency management. Here, a multifunctional hydrogel system capable of rapid gelation and in situ spraying, addressing clinical challenges related to hemostasis, barrier establishment, support, and subsequent therapeutic treatment of irregular, complex, and urgent injured tissues, is designed. This hydrogel can be fast formed in less than 0.5 s under ultraviolet initiation. The precursor maintains an impressively low viscosity of 0.018 Pa s, while the hydrogel demonstrates a storage modulus of 0.65&#160;MPa, achieving the delicate balance between sprayable fluidity and the mechanical strength requirements in practice, allowing flexible customization of the hydrogel system for differentiated handling and treatment of various tissues. Notably, the interactions between the component of this hydrogel and the cell surface protein confer upon its inherently bioactive functionalities such as osteogenesis, anti&#8208;inflammation, and angiogenesis. This research endeavors to provide new insights and designs into emergency management and complex tissue injuries treatment.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Spirobifluorene Phosphonate Based Exciplex Interface Enables Voc Reaching 95% of Theoretical Limit for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exciplex interface is developed by the designed and synthesized spirobifluorene phosphonate molecules to mitigate VOC loss in perovskite solar cells. The multi&#8208;functional spirobifluorene phosphonate based exciplex interface can promote hole extraction by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, optimize energy band alignment, and reduce defect&#8208;induced recombination. A record VOC reaching 95% of theoretical limit and a high efficiency are achieved.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show significant advancements in power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs is limited by interfacial factors such as defect&#8208;induced recombination, energy band mismatch, and non&#8208;intimate interface contact. Here, an exciplex interface is first developed based on the strategically designed and synthesized two spirobifluorene phosphonate molecules to mitigate VOC loss in PSCs. The exciplex interface constructed by the intimate contact between the multi&#8208;functional molecules and hole transport layer takes the roles to promote the hole extraction by donor&#8211;acceptor interaction, passivate coordination&#8208;unsaturated Pb2+ defects by equipped phosphonate groups, and optimize the energy level alignment. As a result, a record VOC of 1.26&#160;V with a perovskite bandgap of 1.61&#160;eV is achieved, representing over 95% of theoretical limit. This advancement leads to an increase in PCE from 21.29% to 24.12% and improved stability. The exciplex interface paves the way for addressing the long&#8208;standing challenge of VOC loss and promotes the wider application of PSCs.

Abstract
3D printing technology with enhanced fidelity can achieve multiple functionalities and boost electrochemical performance of customizable planar micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs), however, precise structural control of additive&#8208;free graphene&#8208;based macro&#8208;assembly electrode for monolithic integrated MSCs (MIMSCs) remain challenging. Here, we report the large&#8208;scale 3D printing fabrication of customizable planar MIMSCs utilizing additive&#8208;free, high&#8208;quality electrochemically exfoliated graphene inks, which is not required the conventional cryogenic assistance during the printing process and any post&#8208;processing reduction. The resulting MSCs reveal an extremely small engineering footprint of 0.025 cm2, exceptionally high areal capacitance of 4900 mF cm&#8722;2, volumetric capacitance of 195.6 F cm&#8722;3, areal energy density of 2.1 mWh cm&#8722;2, and unprecedented volumetric energy density of 23 mWh cm&#8722;3 for a single cell, surpassing most previously reported 3D printed MSCs. We further demonstrate the 3D printed MIMSC pack, with the maximum areal cell count density of 16 cell cm&#8722;2, achieve the highest output voltage of 192.5&#160;V and the largest output voltage per unit area of 56&#160;V cm&#8722;2 up to date. This work presents an innovative solution for processing high&#8208;performance additive&#8208;free graphene ink and realizing the large&#8208;scale production of 3D printed MIMSCs for planar energy storage.

         <title>Observation of High&#8208;Capacity Monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 with Ultrafast Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Apart from Li4Ti5O12, there are few anode substitutes that can be used in commercial high&#8208;power lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Orthorhombic T&#8208;Nb2O5 has recently been proven to be another substitute anode. However, monoclinic B&#8208;Nb2O5 of same chemistry is essentially inert for lithium storage, but the underlying reasons are unclear. In order to activate the &#8220;inert&#8221; B&#8208;Nb2O5, herein, we propose nano&#8208;porous pseudocrystals to achieve a larger specific capacity of 243 mAh g&#8211;1 than Li4Ti5O12 (theoretical capacity: 175 mAh g&#8211;1). These pseudocrystals are rationally synthesized via a &#8220;shape&#8208;keep&#8221; topological micro&#8208;corrosion process from LiNbO3 precursor. Compared to pristine B&#8208;Nb2O5, experimental investigations reveal that B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8208;x delivers &#8764;3000 times higher electronic conductivity and 10&#8208;fold enhanced Li+ diffusion coefficient. A &#8764;30% reduction of energy barrier for Li&#8208;ion migration is alos confirmed by the theoretical calculations. The nano&#8208;porous B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8208;x delivers unique ion/electron transport channels to proliferate the reversible and deeper lithiation, which activate the &#8220;inert&#8221; B&#8208;Nb2O5. The capacitive&#8208;like behavior is observed to endow B&#8208;Nb2O5&#8208;x ultrafast lithium storage ability, harvesting 136 mAh g&#8211;1 at 100C and 72 mAh g&#8211;1 even at 250C, superior to Li4Ti5O12. Pouch&#8208;type full cells exhibit the energy density of &#8764;251&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 and ultrahigh power density up to &#8764;35&#160;kW kg&#8211;1.

         <title>Efficient Thermal Management with Selective Metamaterial Absorber for Boosting Photothermal CO2 Hydrogenation under Sunlight</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photothermal catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is a prospective strategy to simultaneously reduce CO2 emission and generate value&#8208;added fuels. However, the demand of extremely intense light hinders its development in practical applications. Herein, we report the novel design of Ni&#8208;based selective metamaterial absorber and employ it as the photothermal catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation. The selective absorption property reduces the heat loss caused by radiation while possessing effectively solar absorption, thus substantially increasing local photothermal temperature. Notably, the enhancement of local electric field by plasmon resonance promotes the adsorption and activation of reactants. Moreover, benefiting from the ingenious morphology that Ni nanoparticles are encapsulated by SiO2 matrix through co&#8208;sputtering, the greatly improved dispersion of Ni nanoparticles enables enhancing the contact with reaction gas and preventing the agglomeration. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits an unprecedented CO2 conversion rate of 516.9&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under 0.8&#160;W cm&#8722;2 irradiation, with near 90% CO selectivity and high stability. Significantly, our designed photothermal catalyst demonstrates the great potential in practical applications under sunlight. This work provides new sights for designing high&#8208;performance photothermal catalysts by thermal management.

         <title>A Gas Therapy Strategy for Intestinal Flora Regulation and Colitis Treatment by Nanogel&#8208;based Multistage NO Delivery Microcapsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Current approaches to treating inflammatory bowel disease focus on the suppression of overactive immune responses, the removal of reactive intestinal oxygen species, and regulation of the intestinal flora. However, owing to the complex structure of the gastrointestinal tract and the influence of mucus, current small&#8208;molecule and biologic&#8208;based drugs for treating colitis cannot effectively act at the site of colon inflammation, and as a result, they tend to exhibit low efficacies and toxic side effects. In this study, nanogel&#8208;based multistage NO delivery microcapsules are developed to achieve NO release at the inflammation site by targeting the inflammatory tissues using the nanogel. Surprisingly, oral administration of the microcapsules suppresses the growth of pathogenic bacteria and increase the abundance of probiotic bacteria. Metabolomics further show that an increased abundance of intestinal probiotics promotes the production of metabolites, including short&#8208;chain fatty acids and indole derivatives, which modulate the intestinal immunity and restore the intestinal barrier via the interleukin&#8208;17 and PI3K&#8208;Akt signaling pathways. This work reveals that the developed gas therapy strategy based on multistage NO delivery microcapsules modulates the intestinal microbial balance, thereby reducing inflammation and promoting intestinal barrier repair, ultimately providing a new therapeutic approach for the clinical management of colitis.

         <title>Establishing Pinhole Deposition Mode of Zn via Scalable Monolayer Graphene Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The uneven texture evolution of Zn during electrodeposition would adversely impact upon the lifespan of aqueous Zn metal batteries. To address this issue, tremendous endeavors have been made to induce Zn(002) orientational deposition employing graphene and its derivatives. Nevertheless, the effect of prototype graphene film over Zn deposition behavior has garnered less attention. Here, we attempt to solve such a puzzle via utilizing transferred high&#8208;quality graphene film with controllable layer numbers in a scalable manner on a Zn foil. The multilayer graphene fails to facilitate a Zn epitaxial deposition, whereas the monolayer film with slight breakages steers a unique pinhole deposition mode. In&#8208;depth electrochemical measurements and theoretical simulations discover that the transferred graphene film not only acts as an armor to inhibit side reactions but also serves as a buffer layer to homogenize initial Zn nucleation and decrease Zn migration barrier, accordingly enabling a smooth deposition layer with closely stacked polycrystalline domains. As a result, both assembled symmetric and full cells manage to deliver satisfactory electrochemical performances. This study proposes a concept of &#8220;pinhole deposition&#8221; to dictate Zn electrodeposition and broadens the horizons of graphene&#8208;modified Zn anodes.

         <title>Chemical Circularity in 3D Printing with Biobased &#916;&#8208;Valerolactone</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;ceiling temperature biobased alkyl&#8208;substituted &#948;&#8208;valerolactone is utilized to synthesize a depolymerizable photoprecursor through ring&#8208;opening polymerization. It can serve as a platform material to formulate different resins for vat photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing. The intrinsic recyclability of the low&#8208;ceiling feature of &#948;&#8208;valerolactone enables the &#8220;monomer&#8208;polymer&#8208;monomer&#8221; closed&#8208;loop recycling that enhances the chemical circularity in 3D printing.








Abstract
Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a vat photopolymerization&#8208;based 3D printing technology that fabricates parts typically made of chemically crosslinked polymers. The rapidly growing DLP market has an increasing demand for polymer raw materials, along with growing environmental concerns. Therefore, circular DLP printing with a closed&#8208;loop recyclable ink is of great importance for sustainability. The low&#8208;ceiling temperature alkyl&#8208;substituted &#948;&#8208;valerolactone (VL) is an industrially accessible biorenewable feedstock for developing recyclable polymers. In this work, acrylate&#8208;functionalized poly(&#948;&#8208;valerolactone) (PVLA), synthesized through the ring&#8208;opening transesterification polymerization of VL, is used as a platform photoprecursor to improve the chemical circularity in DLP printing. A small portion of photocurable reactive diluent (RD) turns the unprintable PVLA into DLP printable ink. Various photocurable monomers can serve as RDs to modulate the properties of printed structures for applications like sacrificial molds, soft actuators, sensors, etc. The intrinsic depolymerizability of PVLA is well preserved, regardless of whether the printed polymer is a thermoplastic or thermoset. The recovery yield of virgin quality VL monomer is 93% through direct bulk thermolysis of the printed structures. This work proposes the utilization of depolymerizable photoprecursors and highlights the feasibility of biorenewable VL as a versatile material platform toward circular DLP printing.

The utilization of a microstructural&#8208;informed thermodynamic model enables the creation of pseudoelastic Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni shape&#8208;memory alloys with enhanced reversibility. The feasibility of the proposed alloy&#8208;design strategy is proven by complementary spherical nanoindentation and in situ compression tests. The innovative computational&#8208;thermodynamics approach allows a direct composition design for improved functional properties, marking a substantial advance in shape&#8208;memory alloy research.








Abstract
A microstructural informed thermodynamic model is utilized to tailor the pseudoelastic performance of a series of Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni shape&#8208;memory alloys. Following this approach, the influence of the stability and the amount of the B2&#8208;ordered precipitates on the stability of the austenitic state and the pseudoelastic response is revealed. This is assessed by a combination of complementary nanoindentation measurements and incremental&#8208;strain tests under compressive loading. Based on these investigations, the applicability of the proposed models for the prediction of shape&#8208;memory capabilities of Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni alloys is confirmed. Eventually, these thermodynamic considerations enable the guided enhancement of functional properties in this alloy system through the direct design of alloy compositions. The procedure proposed renders a significant advancement in the field of shape&#8208;memory alloys.

Developing triboelectric nanogenerators with specific output remains a challenge mainly due to the uncertainties associated with their complex designs. This paper provides insights into the current challenges of designing and optimizing triboelectric nanogenerators and presents physics&#8208;informed artificial intelligence inverse design strategies to tackle these challenges. The potential of physics&#8208;informed inverse design to propel triboelectric nanogenerators to intelligent systems is discussed.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators offer an environmentally friendly approach to harvesting energy from mechanical excitations. This capability has made them widely sought&#8208;after as an efficient, renewable, and sustainable energy source, with the potential to decrease reliance on traditional fossil fuels. However, developing triboelectric nanogenerators with specific output remains a challenge mainly due to the uncertainties associated with their complex designs for real&#8208;life applications. Artificial intelligence&#8208;enabled inverse design is a powerful tool to realize performance&#8208;oriented triboelectric nanogenerators. This is an emerging scientific direction that can address the concerns about the design and optimization of triboelectric nanogenerators leading to a next generation nanogenerator systems. This perspective paper aims at reviewing the principal analysis of triboelectricity, summarizing the current challenges of designing and optimizing triboelectric nanogenerators, and highlighting the physics&#8208;informed inverse design strategies to develop triboelectric nanogenerators. Strategic inverse design is particularly discussed in the contexts of expanding the four&#8208;mode analytical models by physics&#8208;informed artificial intelligence, discovering new conductive and dielectric materials, and optimizing contact interfaces. Various potential development levels of artificial intelligence&#8208;enhanced triboelectric nanogenerators are delineated. Finally, the potential of physics&#8208;informed artificial intelligence inverse design to propel triboelectric nanogenerators from prototypes to multifunctional intelligent systems for real&#8208;life applications is discussed.

         <title>Engineering Mesoscopic 3D Tumor Models with a Self&#8208;Organizing Vascularized Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D bioprinting and bioengineering approaches are combined to cultivate 3D vascularized tumors, including patient&#8208;derived ones, at the mesoscopic scale. Functional connections between self&#8208;evolved vascular networks and bioprinted endothelium enable the spontaneous migration of cancer cells from tumor spheroids to the fluid flow. This work opens new avenues for exploring the metastatic cascade in vitro at physiologically relevant spatial and temporal scales.








Abstract
Advanced in vitro systems such as multicellular spheroids and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices have been developed, but often fall short in reproducing the tissue scale and self&#8208;organization of human diseases. A bioprinted artificial tumor model is introduced with endothelial and stromal cells self&#8208;organizing into perfusable and functional vascular structures. This model uses 3D hydrogel matrices to embed multicellular tumor spheroids, allowing them to grow to mesoscopic scales and to interact with endothelial cells. It is shown that angiogenic multicellular tumor spheroids promote the growth of a vascular network, which in turn further enhances the growth of cocultivated tumor spheroids. The self&#8208;developed vascular structure infiltrates the tumor spheroids, forms functional connections with the bioprinted endothelium, and can be perfused by erythrocytes and polystyrene microspheres. Moreover, cancer cells migrate spontaneously from the tumor spheroid through the self&#8208;assembled vascular network into the fluid flow. Additionally, tumor type specific characteristics of desmoplasia, angiogenesis, and metastatic propensity are preserved between patient&#8208;derived samples and tumors derived from this same material growing in the bioreactors. Overall, this modular approach opens up new avenues for studying tumor pathophysiology and cellular interactions in vitro, providing a platform for advanced drug testing while reducing the need for in vivo experimentation.

         <title>Highly Robust Conductive Organo&#8208;Hydrogels with Powerful Sensing Capabilities Under Large Mechanical Stress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly robust conductive organo&#8208;hydrogels are fabricated via self&#8208;assembly assisted stretch training. The fabricated conductive organo&#8208;hydrogels exhibit remarkable strength and toughness, as well as impressive sensitivity even when subjected to significant stress. This study addresses the mechanical limitations of traditional conductive hydrogels, making them suitable for facing the practical complex conditions in motion monitoring of strenuous activities and the soft robotics.








Abstract
The low mechanical strength of conductive hydrogels (&lt;1&#160;MPa) has been a significant hurdle in their practical application, as they are prone to fracturing under complex conditions, limiting their effectiveness. Here, this work fabricates a strong and tough conductive hierarchical poly(vinyl alcohol) (PEDOT:PSS/PVA) organo&#8208;hydrogel (PPS organo&#8208;hydrogel) via a facile combining strategy of self&#8208;assembly and stretch training. With PVA/PEDOT:PSS microlayers and aligned PVA/PEDOT:PSS nanofibers, PVA and PEDOT:PSS nanocrystalline domains, and semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer networks, PPS organo&#8208;hydrogels display outstanding mechanical performances (strength: 54.8&#160;MPa, toughness: 153.97&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). Additionally, PPS organo&#8208;hydrogels also exhibit powerful sensing capabilities (gauge factor (GF): 983) due to the aligned hierarchical structures and organic liquid phase of DMSO. Notably, with the synergy of such mechanical and sensing properties, organo&#8208;hydrogels can even detect objects as light as 1 gram, despite bearing a tensile strength of &#8776;23&#160;MPa. By incorporating these materials into human&#8208;machine interfaces, such as controlling artificial arms for grabbing objects and monitoring sport behaviors in soccer training, this work has unlocked a new realm of possibilities for these high&#8208;performance hierarchical organo&#8208;hydrogels. This approach to designing hierarchical structures has the potential to lead to even more high&#8208;performance hydrogels in the future.

         <title>High Thermoelectric Power Factors in Plastic/Ductile Bulk SnSe2&#8208;Based Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a power factor of 18.0 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 in plastic/ductile bulk SnSe2&#8208;based crystals is reported. The origin of such high power factor is from the modulation of material's stacking forms and polymorph crystal structures via simultaneously doping Cl/Br at Se&#8208;site and intercalating Cu inside the van der Waals gap, which significantly enhances the carrier concentration and mobility.








Abstract
The recently discovered plastic/ductile inorganic thermoelectric (TE) materials open a new avenue for the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiently flexible TE devices, which can utilize the small temperature difference between human body and environment to generate electricity. However, the maximum power factor (PF) of current plastic/ductile TE materials is usually around or less than 10 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, much lower than the classic brittle TE materials. In this work, a record&#8208;high PF of 18.0 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 375 K in plastic/ductile bulk SnSe2&#8208;based crystals is reported, superior to all the plastic inorganic TE materials and flexible organic TE materials reported before. The origin of such high PF is from the modulation of material's stacking forms and polymorph crystal structures via simultaneously doping Cl/Br at Se&#8208;site and intercalating Cu inside the van der Waals gap, leading to the significantly enhanced carrier concentrations and mobilities. An in&#8208;plane fully flexible TE device made of the plastic/ductile SnSe2&#8208;based crystals is successfully developed to show a record&#8208;high normalized maximum power density to 0.18&#160;W m&#8722;1 under a temperature difference of 30 K. This work indicates that the plastic/ductile material can realize high TE power factor to achieve large output electric power density in flexible TE technology.

         <title>Engineering Clinically Relevant Probiotics with Switchable &#8220;Nano&#8208;Promoter&#8221; and &#8220;Nano&#8208;Effector&#8221; for Precision Tumor Therapy</title>

Dynamic regulation of the metabolism of probiotics for precise colorectal cancer therapy by using inducible artificial enzymes as switchable &#8220;nano&#8208;promoter&#8221; to upregulate the expression of acidic metabolites in probiotics and &#8220;nano&#8208;effector&#8221; to produce a great deal of lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) to combat the tumors.








Abstract
Probiotics have the potential as biotherapeutic agents for cancer management in preclinical models and human trials by secreting antineoplastic or immunoregulatory agents in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, current probiotics lack the ability to dynamically respond to unique TME characteristics, leading to limited therapeutic accuracy and efficacy. Although progress has been made in customizing controllable probiotics through synthetic biology, the engineering process is complex and the predictability of production is relatively low. To address this, here, for the first time, this work adopts pH&#8208;dependent peroxidase&#8208;like (POD&#8208;like) artificial enzymes as both an inducible &#8220;nano&#8208;promoter&#8221; and &#8220;nano&#8208;effector&#8221; to engineer clinically relevant probiotics to achieve switchable control of probiotic therapy.

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic regulation of the metabolism of probiotics for precise colorectal cancer therapy by using inducible artificial enzymes as switchable &#8220;nano-promoter&#8221; to upregulate the expression of acidic metabolites in probiotics and &#8220;nano-effector&#8221; to produce a great deal of lethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) to combat the tumors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probiotics have the potential as biotherapeutic agents for cancer management in preclinical models and human trials by secreting antineoplastic or immunoregulatory agents in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, current probiotics lack the ability to dynamically respond to unique TME characteristics, leading to limited therapeutic accuracy and efficacy. Although progress has been made in customizing controllable probiotics through synthetic biology, the engineering process is complex and the predictability of production is relatively low. To address this, here, for the first time, this work adopts pH-dependent peroxidase-like (POD-like) artificial enzymes as both an inducible &#8220;nano-promoter&#8221; and &#8220;nano-effector&#8221; to engineer clinically relevant probiotics to achieve switchable control of probiotic therapy. The nanozyme initially serves as an inducible &#8220;nano-promoter,&#8221; generating trace amounts of nonlethal reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress to upregulate acidic metabolites in probiotics. Once metabolites acidify the TME to a threshold, the nanozyme switches to a &#8220;nano-effector,&#8221; producing a great deal of lethal ROS to fight cancer. This approach shows promise in subcutaneous, orthotopic, and colitis-associated colorectal cancer tumors, offering a new methodology for modulating probiotic metabolism in a pathological environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Highly&#8208;Efficient Boron Interstitially Inserted Ru Anode Catalyst for Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boron interstitially inserted Ru catalyst (B&#8208;Ru/C) is synthesized and used as an anode catalyst for anion exchange membrane fuel cell, achieving a peak power density of 1.37&#160;W cm&#8722;2. Moreover, an inflection point behavior in the pH&#8208;dependent hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics on B&#8208;Ru is observed, showing an anomalous behavior that the HOR activity under alkaline electrolyte surpasses acidic electrolyte.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is crucial for the commercialization of anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Here, boron interstitially inserted ruthenium (B&#8208;Ru/C) is synthesized and used as an anode catalyst for AEMFC, achieving a peak power density of 1.37&#160;W cm&#8722;2, close to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial PtRu catalyst. Unexpectedly, instead of the monotonous decline of HOR kinetics with pH as generally believed, an inflection point behavior in the pH&#8208;dependent HOR kinetics on B&#8208;Ru/C is observed, showing an anomalous behavior that the HOR activity under alkaline electrolyte surpasses acidic electrolyte. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations reveal that the upshifted d&#8208;band center of Ru after the intervention of interstitial boron can lead to enhanced adsorption ability of OH and H2O, which together with the reduced energy barrier of water formation, contributes to the outstanding alkaline HOR performance with a mass activity of 1.716&#160;mA &#181;gPGM&#8722;1, which is 13.4&#8208;fold and 5.2&#8208;fold higher than that of Ru/C and commercial Pt/C, respectively.

         <title>Indoor Self&#8208;Powered Perovskite Optoelectronics with Ultraflexible Monochromatic Light Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultraflexible self&#8208;powered perovskite sensors are developed by integrating high&#8208;performance solar cells and monochromatic light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). These ultraflexible perovskite solar cell modules power ultraflexible perovskite nanocrystal LEDs (PNC&#8208;LEDs) even with the indoor light, with excellent power&#8208;conversion and current efficiencies of 18.2% and 15.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, respectively. The narrowband electroluminescence (EL) of PNC&#8208;LED eliminates Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) interference, resulting selective photo&#8208;plethysmography with a signal selectivity of 98.2%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;powered skin optoelectronics fabricated on ultrathin polymer films is emerging as one of the most promising components for the next&#8208;generation Internet of Things (IoT) technology. However, a longstanding challenge is the device underperformance owing to the low process temperature of polymer substrates. In addition, broadband electroluminescence (EL) based on organic or polymer semiconductors inevitably suffers from periodic spectral distortion due to Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot (FP) interference upon substrate bending, preventing advanced applications. Here, ultraflexible skin optoelectronics integrating high&#8208;performance solar cells and monochromatic light&#8208;emitting diodes using solution&#8208;processed perovskite semiconductors is presented. n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cells and perovskite nanocrystal light&#8208;emitting diodes (PNC&#8208;LEDs), with power&#8208;conversion and current efficiencies of 18.2% and 15.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, respectively, are demonstrated on ultrathin polymer substrates with high thermal stability, which is a record&#8208;high efficiency for ultraflexible perovskite solar cell. The narrowband EL with a full width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm successfully eliminates FP interference, yielding bending&#8208;insensitive spectra even under 50% of mechanical compression. Photo&#8208;plethysmography using the skin optoelectronic device demonstrates a signal selectivity of 98.2% at 87&#160;bpm pulse. The results presented here pave the way to inexpensive and high&#8208;performance ultrathin optoelectronics for self&#8208;powered applications such as wearable displays and indoor IoT sensors.

         <title>Reversible Ultrafast Chiroptical Responses in Planar Plasmonic Nano&#8208;Oligomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides a comprehensive analysis of ultrafast chiroptical responses in planar plasmonic nano&#8208;oligomers with facile reversibility. The polarimetric measurements demonstrate the transient helicity&#8208;resolved optical transitions in chiral nanoplasmonics in an all&#8208;optical setting, providing a framework for future applications of ultrafast switching and optical logic circuits in nanophotonics and quantum optics.








Abstract
Ultracompact chiral plasmonic nanostructures with unique chiral light&#8211;matter interactions are vital for future photonic technologies. However, previous studies are limited to reporting their steady&#8208;state performance, presenting a fundamental obstacle to the development of high&#8208;speed optical devices with polarization sensitivity. Here, a comprehensive analysis of ultrafast chiroptical response of chiral gold nano&#8208;oligomers using time&#8208;resolved polarimetric measurements is provided. Significant differences are observed in terms of the absorption intensity, thus hot electron generation, and hot carrier decay time upon polarized photopumping, which are explained by a phenomenological model of the helicity&#8208;resolved optical transitions. Moreover, the chiroptical signal is switchable by reversing the direction of the pump pulse, demonstrating the versatile modulation of polarization selection in a single device. The results offer fundamental insights into the helicity&#8208;resolved optical transitions in photoexcited chiral plasmonics and can facilitate the development of high&#8208;speed polarization&#8208;sensitive flat optics with potential applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics.

         <title>p&#8208;Phenylenediamine&#8208;Bridged Binder&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Unified Supramolecules for Versatile Lithium Secondary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binder&#8208;electrolyte integrated solid&#8208;state battery (SSB) system exploiting a new synergistic ionic conduction mechanism through supramolecular bridging with p&#8208;phenylenediamine molecules is proposed. As such, the contact issue in SSBs can be minimized, enabling the implementation of high loading SSB systems. These achievements are expected to provide a strong foundation for the development of SSB systems with exceptional energy density.








Abstract
The binder is an essential component in determining the structural integrity and ionic conductivity of Li&#8208;ion battery electrodes. However, conventional binders are not sufficiently conductive and durable to be used with solid&#8208;state electrolytes. In this study, a novel system is proposed for a Li secondary battery that combines the electrolyte and binder into a unified structure, which is achieved by employing para&#8208;phenylenediamine (pPD) moiety to create supramolecular bridges between the parent binders. Due to a partial crosslinking effect and charge&#8208;transferring structure of pPD, the proposed strategy improves both the ionic conductivity and mechanical properties by a factor of 6.4 (achieving a conductivity of 3.73 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 for poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;pPD) and 4.4 (reaching a mechanical strength of 151.4&#160;kPa for poly(acrylic acid)&#8208;pPD) compared to those of conventional parent binders. As a result, when the supramolecules of pPD are used as a binder in a pouch cell with a lean electrolyte loading of 2&#160;&#181;L mAh&#8722;1, a capacity retention of 80.2% is achieved even after 300 cycles. Furthermore, when it is utilized as a solid&#8208;state electrolyte, an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% and capacity retention of 98.7% are attained under operations at 50&#160;&#176;C without external pressure or a pre&#8208;aging process.

In this study, a novel system is proposed for a Li secondary battery that combines the electrolyte and binder into a unified structure, which is achieved by employing para-phenylenediamine (pPD) moiety to create supramolecular bridges between the parent binders. Due to a partial crosslinking effect and charge-transferring structure of pPD, the proposed strategy improves both the ionic conductivity and mechanical properties by a factor of 6.4 (achieving a conductivity of 3.73 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for poly(ethylene oxide)-pPD) and 4.4 (reaching a mechanical strength of 151.4&#160;kPa for poly(acrylic acid)-pPD) compared to those of conventional parent binders. As a result, when the supramolecules of pPD are used as a binder in a pouch cell with a lean electrolyte loading of 2&#160;&#181;L mAh&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a capacity retention of 80.2% is achieved even after 300 cycles. Furthermore, when it is utilized as a solid-state electrolyte, an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% and capacity retention of 98.7% are attained under operations at 50&#160;&#176;C without external pressure or a pre-aging process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Photochromic Film for Solar Heat and Daylight Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photochromic (PC) film that simultaneously regulates solar heat and visible light entrance is introduced. On a sunny day, the film tints and blocks sunlight, which reduces energy consumption for cooling and&#160;preventing excessive brightness and glare. With weak sunlight intensity, the photochromic film becomes transparent to let sunlight enter the room, which prevents additional heating and lighting energy use.








Abstract
The adaptive control of sunlight through photochromic smart windows could have a huge impact on the energy efficiency and daylight comfort in buildings. However, the fabrication of inorganic nanoparticle and polymer composite photochromic films with a high contrast ratio and high transparency/low haze remains a challenge. Here, a solution method is presented for the in situ growth of copper&#8208;doped tungsten trioxide nanoparticles in polymethyl methacrylate, which allows a low&#8208;cost preparation of photochromic films with a high luminous&#160;transparency (luminous transmittance Tlum = 91%) and scalability (30 &#215; 350 cm2). High modulation of visible light (&#916;Tlum = 73%) and solar heat (modulation of solar transmittance &#916;Tsol = 73%, modulation of solar heat gain coefficient &#916;SHGC = 0.5) of the film improves the indoor daylight comfort and energy efficiency. Simulation results show that low&#8208;e windows with the photochromic film applied can greatly enhance the energy efficiency and daylight comfort. This photochromic film presents an attractive strategy for achieving more energy&#8208;efficient buildings and carbon neutrality to combat global climate change.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Current 10 nm Spin Hall Nano&#8208;Oscillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin Hall nano&#8208;oscillators as narrow as 10 nm, with auto&#8208;oscillation threshold currents below 30 &#956;$\umu$A, are experimentally demonstrated and studied using electrical microwave measurements and optical micro&#8208;Brillouin light scattering microscopy. The current shunting issue through the Si substrate is successfully addressed using different insulating seed layers, with ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 showing the best performance and SiO2 the worst.








Abstract
Nano&#8208;constriction based spin Hall nano&#8208;oscillators (SHNOs) are at the forefront of spintronics research for emerging technological applications, such as oscillator&#8208;based neuromorphic computing and Ising Machines. However, their miniaturization to the sub&#8208;50 nm width regime results in poor scaling of the threshold current. Here, it shows that current shunting through the Si substrate is the origin of this problem and studies how different seed layers can mitigate it. It finds that an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 seed layer and SiN (200 nm) coated p&#8208;Si substrates provide the best improvement, enabling us to scale down the SHNO width to a truly nanoscopic dimension of 10 nm, operating at threshold currents below 30 &#956;$\umu$A. In addition, the combination of electrical insulation and high thermal conductivity of the Al2O3 seed will offer the best conditions for large SHNO arrays, avoiding any significant temperature gradients within the array. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultra&#8208;low operational current SHNOs hence pave an energy&#8208;efficient route to scale oscillator&#8208;based computing to large dynamical neural networks of linear chains or 2D&#160;arrays.

         <title>Cascade Catalytic Nanoparticles Selectively Alkalize Cancerous Lysosomes to Suppress Cancer Progression and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade catalytic nanoparticle with high biocompatibility is reported, serving as a potent lysosomal alkalizer capable of converting excessive hydrogen peroxide and H+ into hydroxide ions only in cancerous lysosomes, leading to lysosomal alkalization and consequent suppression of tumor progression and metastasis.








Abstract
Lysosomes are critical in modulating the progression and metastasis for various cancers. There is currently an unmet need for lysosomal alkalizers that can selectively and safely alter the pH and inhibit the function of cancer lysosomes. Here an effective, selective, and safe lysosomal alkalizer is reported that can inhibit autophagy and suppress tumors in mice. The lysosomal alkalizer consists of an iron oxide core that generates hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) in the presence of excessive H+ and hydrogen peroxide inside cancer lysosomes and cerium oxide satellites that capture and convert &#8226;OH into hydroxide ions. Alkalized lysosomes, which display impaired enzyme activity and autophagy, lead to cancer cell apoptosis. It is shown that the alkalizer effectively inhibits both local and systemic tumor growth and metastasis in mice. This work demonstrates that the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles can be harnessed to build effective lysosomal alkalizers that are both selective and safe.

         <title>Spin Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by 2D Chiral Perovskite with Spin&#8208;Dependent Carrier Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin quantum dot light emitting diode emitting circularly polarized light is achieved by introducing chiral perovskite with chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. The spin polarized holes generated by the CISS effect of chiral perovskite recombine with correspondent electrons according to the optical selective rules and directly emit left&#8208; or right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light.








Abstract
Chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect provides innovative approach to spintronics and quantum&#8208;based devices for chiral materials. Different from the conventional ferromagnetic devices, the application of CISS effect is potential to operate under room temperature and zero applied magnetic field. Low dimensional chiral perovskites by introducing chiral amines are beginning to show significant CISS effect for spin injection, but research on chiral perovskites is still in its infancy, especially on spin&#8208;light emitting diode (spin&#8208;LED) construction. Here, the spin&#8208;QLEDs enabled by 2D chiral perovskites as CISS layer for spin&#8208;dependent carrier injection and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) as light emitting layer are reported. The regulation pattern of the chirality and thickness of chiral perovskites, which affects the circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) emission of spin&#8208;QLED, is discovered. Notably, the spin injection polarization of 2D chiral perovskites is higher than 80% and the CP&#8208;EL asymmetric factor (gCP&#8208;EL) achieves up to 1.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2. Consequently, this work opens up a new and effective approach for high&#8208;performance spin&#8208;LEDs.

         <title>Deep Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Metamaterials with Heat&#8208;Enhanced Thermal Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing parallels from nonlinear optics, artificial intelligence assists a configurable nonlinear thermal material whose effective thermal conductivity being responsive to its temperature gradient. Such deep learning&#8208;assisted nonlinear thermal material promotes two typical self&#8208;adaptive devices, which can perceive their environment deeply. One maintains stable function, and another switches its function, in a changeable environment.








Abstract
Heat management is crucial for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications such as passive radiative cooling, thermally adjustable wearables, and camouflage systems. Their adaptive versions, to cater to varied requirements, lean on the potential of adaptive metamaterials. Existing efforts, however, feature with highly anisotropic parameters, narrow working&#8208;temperature ranges, and the need for manual intervention, which remain long&#8208;term and tricky obstacles for the most advanced self&#8208;adaptive metamaterials. To surmount these barriers, heat&#8208;enhanced thermal diffusion metamaterials powered by deep learning is introduced. Such active metamaterials can automatically sense ambient temperatures and swiftly, as well as continuously, adjust their thermal functions with a high degree of tunability. They maintain robust thermal performance even when external thermal fields change direction, and both simulations and experiments demonstrate exceptional results. Furthermore, two metadevices with on&#8208;demand adaptability, performing distinctive features with isotropic materials, wide working temperatures, and spontaneous response are designed. This work offers a framework for the design of intelligent thermal diffusion metamaterials and can be expanded to other diffusion fields, adapting to increasingly complex and dynamic environments.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Mediated Recombination Dynamics in Perovskite&#8208;Based Memory Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes for Neuromorphic Control Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;pixel perovskite&#8208;organic tandem light&#8208;emitting diode capable of changing colors is demonstrated. The distinctive dual time constants (fast organic emission and slow perovskite emission) are analogous to a biological synapse. High dynamic range and color&#8208;switching capabilities in pulsed emission are used in neuromorphic computing to improve the efficiencies of applications that are conventionally memory&#8208;intensive.








Abstract
Neuromorphic devices can help perform memory&#8208;heavy tasks more efficiently due to the co&#8208;localization of memory and computing. In biological systems, fast dynamics are necessary for rapid communication, while slow dynamics aid in the amplification of signals over noise and regulatory processes such as adaptation&#8208; such dual dynamics are key for neuromorphic control systems. Halide perovskites exhibit much more complex phenomena than conventional semiconductors due to their coupled ionic, electronic, and optical properties which result in modulatable drift, diffusion of ions, carriers, and radiative recombination dynamics. This is exploited to engineer a dual&#8208;emitter tandem device with the requisite dual slow&#8208;fast dynamics. Here, a perovskite&#8208;organic tandem light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) capable of modulating its emission spectrum and intensity owing to the ion&#8208;mediated recombination zone modulation between the green&#8208;emitting quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layer and the red&#8208;emitting organic layer is introduced. Frequency&#8208;dependent response and high dynamic range memory of emission intensity and spectra in a LED are demonstrated. Utilizing the emissive read&#8208;out, image contrast enhancement as a neuromorphic pre&#8208;processing step to improve pattern recognition capabilities is illustrated. As proof of concept using the device's slow&#8208;fast dynamics, an inhibition of the return mechanism is physically emulated.

         <title>Air&#8208;Working Electrochromic Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript describes the first electrochemical artificial muscle that can realize color&#8208;changing and actuation dual responses in air, which effectively solves the problem of connection of the electrolyte with the active layer during the operation of independently operating electrochemically actuated devices in air by hot pouring of the rapidly cooling electrolyte layer.








Abstract
Artificial muscles are indispensable components for next&#8208;generation robotics to mimic the sophisticated movements of living systems and provide higher output energies when compared with real muscles. However, artificial muscles actuated by electrochemical ion injection have problems with single actuation properties and difficulties in stable operation in air. Here, air&#8208;working electrochromic artificial muscles (EAMs) with both color&#8208;changing and actuation functions are reported, which are constructed based on vanadium pentoxide nanowires and carbon tube yarn. Each EAM can generate a contractile stroke of &#8776;12% during stable operation in the air with multiple color changes (yellow&#8208;green&#8208;gray) under &#177;4&#160;V actuation voltages. The reflectance contrast is as high as 51%, demonstrating the excellent versatility of the EAMs. In addition, a torroidal EAM arrangement with fast response and high resilience is constructed. The EAM's contractile stroke can be displayed through visual color changes, which provides new ideas for future artificial muscle applications in soft robots and artificial limbs.

         <title>Nanoscale Chemical Diversity of Coke Deposits on Nanoprinted Metal Catalysts Visualized by Tip&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coke formation is a prime cause of catalyst deactivation, where undesired carbon products block the catalytic active sites and impede further reaction. Herein, the nanofabrication of metal catalysts is synergized with advanced coke characterization via tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy. This approach reveals the chemical diversity of coke deposits at the nanoscale, opening novel routes for extending the catalyst's lifespan.








Abstract
Coke formation is the prime cause of catalyst deactivation, where undesired carbon wastes block the catalyst surface and hinder further reaction in a broad gamut of industrial chemical processes. Yet, the origins of coke formation and their distribution across the catalyst remain elusive, obstructing the design of coke&#8208;resistant catalysts. Here, the first&#8208;time application of tip&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is demonstrated as a nanoscale chemical probe to localize and identify coke deposits on a post&#8208;mortem metal nanocatalyst. Monitoring coke at the nanoscale circumvents bulk averaging and reveals the local nature of coke with unmatched detail. The nature of coke is chemically diverse and ranges from nanocrystalline graphite to disordered and polymeric coke, even on a single nanoscale location of a top&#8208;down nanoprinted SiO2&#8208;supported Pt catalyst. Surprisingly, not all Pt is an equal producer of coke, where clear isolated coke &#8220;hotspots&#8221; are present non&#8208;homogeneously on Pt which generate large amounts of disordered coke. After their formation, coke shifts to the support and undergoes long&#8208;range transport on the surrounding SiO2 surface, where it becomes more graphitic. The presented results provide novel guidelines to selectively free&#8208;up the coked metal surface at more mild rejuvenation conditions, thus securing the long&#8208;term catalyst stability.

         <title>Construct Robust Epitaxial Growth of (101) Textured Zinc Metal Anode for Long Life and High Capacity in Mild Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel (101) epitaxial growth model that enables robust epitaxial growth at high capacity is proposed here. Additionally, side reactions are effectively suppressed due to the low grain boundary area. The constructed texture zinc achieves excellent stability, which provides an effective and feasible approach for the protection and practical application of zinc metal.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries are considered to have the potential for energy storage due to their high safety and low cost. However, the practical applications of zinc batteries are limited by dendrite growth and side reactions. Epitaxial growth is considered an effective method for stabilizing Zn anode, especially for manipulating the (002) plane of deposited zinc. However, (002) texture zinc is difficult to achieve stable cycle at high capacity due to its large lattice distortion and uneven electric field distribution. Here, a novel zinc anode with highly (101) texture (denoted as (101)&#8208;Zn) is constructed. Due to unique directional guidance and strong bonding effect, (101)&#8208;Zn can achieve dense vertical electroepitaxy in near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. In addition, the low grain boundary area inhibits the occurrence of side reactions. The resultant (101)&#8208;Zn symmetric cells exhibit excellent stability over 5300 h (4 mA cm&#8722;2 for 2 mAh cm&#8722;2) and 330 h (15 mA cm&#8722;2 for 10 mAh cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the cycle life of Zn//MnO2 full cell is meaningfully improved over 1000 cycles.

Due to unique directional guidance and strong bonding effect, (101)-Zn can achieve dense vertical electroepitaxy in near-neutral electrolytes. In addition, the low grain boundary area inhibits the occurrence of side reactions. The resultant (101)-Zn symmetric cells exhibit excellent stability over 5300 h (4 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 2 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 330 h (15 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 10 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Meanwhile, the cycle life of Zn//MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cell is meaningfully improved over 1000 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lowering the Temperature of Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells Using Triple&#8208;Doped Bismuth Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceptionally conductive and stable bismuth oxides are developed through the rational doping of isovalent and aliovalent elements for low&#8208;temperature applications. The triple&#8208;doped bismuth oxides are incorporated into composite oxygen electrodes and bilayer electrolytes for low&#8208;temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells, resulting in unprecedentedly high performance in both fuel cell and electrolysis cell modes.








Abstract
Despite the great potential of solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) as highly efficient energy conversion devices, the undesirable high operating temperature limits their wider applicability. Herein, a novel approach to developing high&#8208;performance low&#8208;temperature SOCs (LT&#8208;SOCs) is presented through the use of an Er, Y, and Zr triple&#8208;doped bismuth oxide (EYZB). This study demonstrates that EYZB exhibits &gt; 147 times higher ionic conductivity of 0.44 S cm&#8722;1 at 600 &#176;C compared to commercial Y&#8208;stabilized zirconia electrolyte with excellent stability over 1000&#160;h. By rationally incorporating EYZB in composite electrodes and bilayer electrolytes, the zirconia&#8208;based electrolyte LT&#8208;SOC achieves the unprecedentedly high performance of 3.45 and 2.02&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in the fuel cell mode and 2.08 and 0.95 A cm&#8722;2 in the electrolysis cell mode at 700 &#176;C and 600 &#176;C, respectively. Further, a distinctive microstructural feature of EYZB that largely extends triple phase boundary at the interface is revealed through digital twinning. This work provides insights for developing high&#8208;performance LT&#8208;SOCs.

         <title>Phosphorescent Carbene&#8208;Gold&#8208;Arylacetylide Materials as Emitters for Near UV&#8208;OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbene&#8208;gold&#8208;acetylide (CMAc) complexes are bright deep&#8208;blue and green phosphorescent emitters with quantum yields up to 43% which also show UV prompt&#8208;fluorescence. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on CMAc emitters show near&#8208;UV electroluminescence with a device efficiency of 1% and a device lifetime LT50 up to 20&#160;min at practical brightness.








Abstract
A series of carbene&#8208;gold&#8208;acetylide complexes [(BiCAAC)AuCC]nC6H5&#8722;n (n = 1, Au1; n = 2, Au2; n = 3, Au3; BiCAAC = bicyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) have been synthesized in high yields. Compounds Au1&#8211;Au3 exhibit deep&#8208;blue to blue&#8208;green phosphorescence with good quantum yields up to 43% in all media. An increase of the (BiCAAC)Au moieties in gold complexes Au1&#8211;Au3 increases the extinction coefficients in the UV&#8211;vis spectra and stronger oscillator strength coefficients supported by theoretical calculations. The luminescence radiative rates decrease with an increase of the (BiCAAC)Au moieties. The time&#8208;dependent density functional theory study supports a charge&#8208;transfer nature of the phosphorescence due to the large (0.5&#8211;0.6&#160;eV) energy gap between singlet excited (S1) and triplet excited (T1) states. Transient luminescence study reveals the presence of both nonstructured UV prompt&#8208;fluorescence and vibronically resolved long&#8208;lived phosphorescence 428&#160;nm. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) are fabricated by physical vapor deposition with 2,8&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphoryl)dibenzo[b,d]furan (PPF) as a host material with complex Au1. The near&#8208;UV electroluminescence is observed at 405&#160;nm with device efficiency of 1% while demonstrating OLED device lifetime LT50 up to 20&#160;min at practical brightness of 10 nits, indicating a highly promising class of materials to develop stable UV&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>A Data&#8208;Driven Approach to Molten Salt Synthesis of N&#8208;Rich Carbon Adsorbents for Selective CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of experiments and response surface methodology applied to molten salt synthesis enable inverse design of N&#8208;rich nanoporous carbons for selective CO2 adsorption. Mapping the phase space of accessible N&#8208;rich turbostratic carbons reveals that a combination of moderate porosity with tuned interlayer d&#8208;spacing enables highly selective CO2 adsorption (even from dilute streams with only 4% CO2) due to molecular sieving.








Abstract
Applying a design of experiments methodology to the molten salt synthesis of nanoporous carbons enables inverse design and optimization of nitrogen (N)&#8208;rich carbon adsorbents with excellent CO2/N2 selectivity and appreciable CO2 capacity for carbon capture via swing adsorption from dilute gas mixtures such as natural gas combined cycle flue gas. This data&#8208;driven study reveals fundamental structure&#8208;function relationships between the synthesis conditions, physicochemical properties, and achievable selective adsorption performance of N&#8208;rich nanoporous carbons derived from molten salt synthesis for CO2 capture. Taking advantage of size&#8208;sieving separation of CO2 (3.30 &#197;) from N2 (3.64 &#197;) within the turbostratic nanostructure of these N&#8208;rich carbons, while limiting deleterious N2 adsorption in a weaker adsorption site that harms selectivity, enables a large CO2 capacity (0.73&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 at 30.4&#160;Torr and 30 &#176;C) with noteworthy concurrent CO2/N2 selectivity as predicted by the ideal adsorbed solution theory&#160;(SIAST = 246) with an adsorbed phase purity of 91% from a simulated gas stream containing only 4% CO2. Optimized N&#8208;rich porous carbons, with good physicochemical stability, low cost, and moderate regeneration energy, can achieve performance for selective CO2 adsorption that competes with other classes of advanced porous materials such as chemisorbing zeolites and functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks.

         <title>Large Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoresistance in a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processable high&#8208;spin donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymer provides large negative magnetoresistance (MR) at low temperatures and positive MR at room temperature that correlates with its electronic and spin structure. The performance of a simple, monolithic device exceeds other organic materials including those utilized in conjunction with ferromagnetic electrodes or complex device architectures. These materials open new opportunities for emerging spin&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
Open&#8208;shell conjugated polymers (CPs) offer new opportunities for the development of emerging technologies that utilize the spin degree of freedom. Their light&#8208;element composition, weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling, synthetic modularity, high chemical stability, and solution&#8208;processability offer attributes that are unavailable from other semiconducting materials. However, developing an understanding of how electronic structure correlates with emerging transport phenomena remains central to their application. Here, the first connections between molecular, electronic, and solid&#8208;state transport in a high&#8208;spin donor&#8211;acceptor CP, poly(4&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,5&#8208;didodecylbenzylidene)&#8208;4H&#8208;cyclopenta[2,1&#8208;b:3,4&#8208;b&#8217;]dithiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;6,7&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;[1,2,5]&#8208;thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;g]quinoxaline), are provided. At low temperatures (T &lt; 180 K), a giant negative magnetoresistance (MR) is achieved in a thin&#8208;film device with a value of &#8722;98% at 10 K, which surpasses the performance of all other organic materials. The thermal depopulation of the high&#8208;spin manifold and negative MR decrease as temperature increases and at T &gt; 180 K, the MR becomes positive with a relatively large MR of 13.5% at room temperature. Variable temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements demonstrate that modulation of both the sign and magnitude of the MR correlates with the electronic and spin structure of the CP.

     alt="Large Room-Temperature Magnetoresistance in a High-Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A solution-processable high-spin donor&#8211;acceptor conjugated polymer provides large negative magnetoresistance (MR) at low temperatures and positive MR at room temperature that correlates with its electronic and spin structure. The performance of a simple, monolithic device exceeds other organic materials including those utilized in conjunction with ferromagnetic electrodes or complex device architectures. These materials open new opportunities for emerging spin-based applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open-shell conjugated polymers (CPs) offer new opportunities for the development of emerging technologies that utilize the spin degree of freedom. Their light-element composition, weak spin-orbit coupling, synthetic modularity, high chemical stability, and solution-processability offer attributes that are unavailable from other semiconducting materials. However, developing an understanding of how electronic structure correlates with emerging transport phenomena remains central to their application. Here, the first connections between molecular, electronic, and solid-state transport in a high-spin donor&#8211;acceptor CP, poly(4-(4-(3,5-didodecylbenzylidene)-4&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-cyclopenta[2,1-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;:3,4-&lt;i&gt;b&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;]dithiophen-2-yl)-6,7-dimethyl-[1,2,5]-thiadiazolo[3,4-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;]quinoxaline), are provided. At low temperatures (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 180 K), a giant negative magnetoresistance (MR) is achieved in a thin-film device with a value of &#8722;98% at 10 K, which surpasses the performance of all other organic materials. The thermal depopulation of the high-spin manifold and negative MR decrease as temperature increases and at &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 180 K, the MR becomes positive with a relatively large MR of 13.5% at room temperature. Variable temperature electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic susceptibility measurements demonstrate that modulation of both the sign and magnitude of the MR correlates with the electronic and spin structure of the CP. These results indicate that donor&#8211;acceptor CPs with open-shell and high-spin ground states offer new opportunities for emerging spin-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Amorphous Silicon Carbide for Nanomechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>An unprecedented amorphous silicon carbide (a&#8208;SiC) thin film exhibits the highest ultimate tensile strength recorded for any nanostructured amorphous material, surpassing 10 GPa. This study showcases the fabrication of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio a&#8208;SiC strings with quality factors exceeding 108, revealing significant potential for diverse high&#8208;performance applications, from nanomechanical sensors to space exploration, and offering newfound prospects for employing amorphous materials where strength and stability are crucial.








Abstract
For decades, mechanical resonators with high sensitivity have been realized using thin&#8208;film materials under high tensile loads. Although there are remarkable strides in achieving low&#8208;dissipation mechanical sensors by utilizing high tensile stress, the performance of even the best strategy is limited by the tensile fracture strength of the resonator materials. In this study, a wafer&#8208;scale amorphous thin film is uncovered, which has the highest ultimate tensile strength ever measured for a nanostructured amorphous material. This silicon carbide (SiC) material exhibits an ultimate tensile strength of over 10 GPa, reaching the regime reserved for strong crystalline materials and approaching levels experimentally shown in graphene nanoribbons. Amorphous SiC strings with high aspect ratios are fabricated, with mechanical modes exceeding quality factors 108 at room temperature, the highest value achieves among SiC resonators. These performances are demonstrated faithfully after characterizing the mechanical properties of the thin film using the resonance behaviors of free&#8208;standing resonators. This robust thin&#8208;film material has significant potential for applications in nanomechanical sensors, solar cells, biological applications, space exploration, and other areas requiring strength and stability in dynamic environments. The findings of this study open up new possibilities for the use of amorphous thin&#8208;film materials in high&#8208;performance&#160;applications.

         <title>UV&#8208;Curing Assisted Direct Ink Writing of Dense, Crack&#8208;Free, and High&#8208;Performance Zirconia&#8208;Based Composites With Aligned Alumina Platelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid 3D printing by coupling UV&#8208;curing with direct ink writing is proposed to fabricate dense and crack&#8208;free ceramics. Non&#8208;reactive diluent relieves polymerization&#8208;induced stress, avoiding warpage and cracking, and facilitates de&#8208;binding. Benefiting from aligned platelets, this work highlights the possibilities of additively fabricating ceramics that are stronger than conventionally manufactured ceramics, along with the unprecedented potentials of locally tunable compositions.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) of high&#8208;performance structural ceramic components with comparative strength and toughness as conventionally manufactured ceramics remains challenging. Here, a UV&#8208;curing approach is integrated in direct ink writing (DIW), taking advantage from DIW to enable an easy use of high solid&#8208;loading pastes and multi&#8208;layered materials with compositional changes; while, avoiding drying problems. UV&#8208;curable opaque zirconia&#8208;based slurries with a solid loading of 51 vol% are developed to fabricate dense and crack&#8208;free alumina&#8208;toughened zirconia (ATZ) containing 3 wt% alumina platelets. Importantly, a non&#8208;reactive diluent is added to relieve polymerization&#8208;induced internal stresses, avoid subsequent warping and cracking, and facilitate the de&#8208;binding. For the first time, UV&#8208;curing assisted DIW&#8208;printed ceramic after sintering reveals even better mechanical properties than that processed by a conventional pressing. This is attributed to the aligned alumina platelets, enhancing crack deflection and improving the fracture toughness from 6.8 &#177; 0.3&#160;MPa m0.5 (compacted) to 7.4 &#177; 0.3&#160;MPa m0.5 (DIW). The four&#8208;point bending strength of the DIW ATZ (1009 &#177; 93&#160;MPa) is also higher than that of the conventionally manufactured equivalent (861 &#177; 68&#160;MPa). Besides homogeneous ceramic, laminate structures are demonstrated. This work provides a valuable hybrid approach to additively manufacture tough and strong ceramic components.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reconstruction of Highly Degraded LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 toward Stable Single&#8208;Crystalline Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple but effective LiOH&#8208;NaCl molten salt strategy is developed for recycling of highly degraded Ni&#8208;rich cathode (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) to performance&#8208;enhanced single&#8208;crystalline cathodes. The structural and chemical evolution during the recycling process is revealed. Meanwhile, this approach can also be successfully extended to recycle other cathode materials with varied Li and Ni compositions.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing demand for resources sustainability has promoted the recycle of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries to a strategic position. Direct recycle outperforms either hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical approaches due to the high added value and facile treatment processes. However, the traditional direct recycling technologies are only applicable for Ni&#8208;poor/middle cathodes. Herein, spent Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (S&#8208;NCM) to performance&#8208;enhanced single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials is directly recycled using a simple but effective LiOH&#8208;NaCl molten salt. The evolution process of the Li&#8208;supplement and grain&#8208;recrystallization during regeneration is systematically investigated, and the successful recovery of the highly degraded microstructure is comprehensively proven, including significant elimination of Ni2+ and O vacancies. Beneficial from the favorable reconstructed single&#8208;crystalline particles, the regenerated NCM (R&#8208;NCM) represents remarkably enhanced structural stability, electrochemical activity, O2 and cracks suppression during charge/discharge, thus achieving the excellent performances in long&#8208;term cycling and high&#8208;rate tests. As a result, R&#8208;NCM maintains the 86.5% reversible capacity at 1&#160;C after 200 cycles. Instructively, the present molten salt can be successfully applied for recycling spent NCMs with various Li and Ni compositions (e.g., LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2).

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Single&#8208;Nucleotide&#8208;Variation Detection Enabled by Argonaute&#8208;Mediated Transistor Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Argonaute&#8208;mediated transistor platform monitors single nucleotide variation (SNV) in &#8776;20 copies mL&#8722;1 microRNA, ctDNA, viral RNA, and cDNA samples and achieves the fastest SNV detection in 5&#160;min with comprehensive advantages of specificity, sensitivity, easy operation, portability, and generality, benefiting efficient disease prevention and control as well as point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnoses for timely, precise, and convenient healthcare.








Abstract
&#8220;Test&#8208;and&#8208;go&#8221; single&#8208;nucleotide variation (SNV) detection within several minutes remains challenging, especially in low&#8208;abundance samples, since existing methods face a trade&#8208;off between sensitivity and testing speed. Sensitive detection usually relies on complex and time&#8208;consuming nucleic acid amplification or sequencing. Here, a graphene field&#8208;effect transistor (GFET) platform mediated by Argonaute protein that enables rapid, sensitive, and specific SNV detection is developed. The Argonaute protein provides a nanoscale binding channel to preorganize the DNA probe, accelerating target binding and rapidly recognizing SNVs with single&#8208;nucleotide resolution in unamplified tumor&#8208;associated microRNA, circulating tumor DNA, virus RNA, and reverse transcribed cDNA when a mismatch occurs in the seed region. An integrated microchip simultaneously detects multiple SNVs in agreement with sequencing results within 5&#160;min, achieving the fastest SNV detection in a &#8220;test&#8208;and&#8208;go&#8221; manner without the requirement of nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification.

&lt;p&gt;Argonaute-mediated transistor platform monitors single nucleotide variation (SNV) in &#8776;20 copies mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; microRNA, ctDNA, viral RNA, and cDNA samples and achieves the fastest SNV detection in 5&#160;min with comprehensive advantages of specificity, sensitivity, easy operation, portability, and generality, benefiting efficient disease prevention and control as well as point-of-care diagnoses for timely, precise, and convenient healthcare.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Test-and-go&#8221; single-nucleotide variation (SNV) detection within several minutes remains challenging, especially in low-abundance samples, since existing methods face a trade-off between sensitivity and testing speed. Sensitive detection usually relies on complex and time-consuming nucleic acid amplification or sequencing. Here, a graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) platform mediated by Argonaute protein that enables rapid, sensitive, and specific SNV detection is developed. The Argonaute protein provides a nanoscale binding channel to preorganize the DNA probe, accelerating target binding and rapidly recognizing SNVs with single-nucleotide resolution in unamplified tumor-associated microRNA, circulating tumor DNA, virus RNA, and reverse transcribed cDNA when a mismatch occurs in the seed region. An integrated microchip simultaneously detects multiple SNVs in agreement with sequencing results within 5&#160;min, achieving the fastest SNV detection in a &#8220;test-and-go&#8221; manner without the requirement of nucleic acid extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>B&#8208;N Covalent Bond Embedded Double Hetero&#8208;[n]helicenes for Pure Red Narrowband Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence with High Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the first pair of pure&#8208;red circularly polarized (CP) multiple resonance emitters is presented using a boron&#8208;nitrogen covalent bond to lower the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the boron atom, and devices possessing maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.6% are constructed, circularly polarizing electroluminescence with dissymmetry factor of 1.91 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and a long operational lifetime of &gt; 400 h.








Abstract
Chiral B/N embedded multi&#8208;resonance (MR) emitters&#160;open a new paradigm of circularly polarized (CP) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) owing to their unique narrowband spectra. However, pure&#8208;red CP&#8208;MR emitters and devices remain exclusive in literature. Herein, by introducing a B&#8208;N covalent bond to lower the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the para&#8208;positioned B&#8208;&#960;&#8208;B motif, the first&#160;pair of pure&#8208;red double hetero&#8208;[n]helicenes (n = 6 and 7) CP&#8208;MR emitter peaking 617&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 38&#160;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8776;100% in toluene is developed. The intense mirror&#8208;image CP light produced by the enantiomers is characterized by high photoluminescence dissymmetry factors (gPL) of +1.40/&#8722;1.41 &#215; 10&#8722;3 from their stable helicenes configuration. The corresponding devices using these enantiomers afford impressive CP electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +1.91/&#8722;1.77 &#215; 10&#8722;3, maximum external quantum efficiencies of 36.6%/34.4% and Commission Internationale de I&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.67, 0.33), exactly satisfying the red&#8208;color requirement specified by National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard. Notably a remarkable long LT95 (operational time to 95% of the initial luminance) of &#8776;400 h at an initial brightness of 10,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 is also observed for the same device, representing the most stable CP&#8208;OLED up to date.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Wide&#8208;Narrow Bandgap&#8208;Laminated Perovskite Photodetector with Bipolar Photoresponse for Secure Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bipolar photoresponse based on spontaneously formed wide&#8208;narrow bandgap&#8208;laminated perovskite films by BiI3&#160;doping is demonstrated. Under the visible/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light, corresponding electrons are easier to be separated and transported by the SnO2/PC61BM to the bottom/top electrodes. Benefiting from the wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar response, the signal secure optical communication (SOC) system is realized based on hidden properties of the bipolar signals.








Abstract
Perovskite photodetectors with bipolar photoresponse characteristics are expected to be applied in the field of secure optical communication (SOC). However, how to realize the perovskite photodetector with bipolar response remains challenging. Herein, by introducing bismuth iodide (BiI3) into Sn&#8208;Pb mixed perovskite precursor solution, 2D perovskite FA3Bi2I9 is spontaneously formed at the bottom to realize a wide&#8208;narrow bandgap&#8208;laminated perovskite film. Wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar response is realized based on the absorption difference of the photoactive region with different bandgap combined with the carrier competition of the homotypic transport layer adopted in the as&#8208;fabricated photodetector. Under the visible/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light irradiation, the bottom/top of the film generates a higher carrier concentration, where electrons are easier to be separated and transported by the SnO2/PC61BM to the bottom/top electrodes, respectively, resulting in a negative and positive bipolar response. Finally, based on positive NIR signal as the effective signal and negative visible signal as the interference signal, the SOC system is realized, where the positive NIR signal is well hidden by the negative visible signal. This work provides a simple and feasible strategy for fabrication of laminated perovskite films to achieve bipolar response.

ODPA self&#8208;assembly monolayer (SAM) modifies HTL&#8208;Perovskite interface without altering crystallography. It highlights film and device quality improvements through interfacial defect reduction, followed by a detailed analysis of efficiency, stability, and charge carrier dynamics. Increased band&#8208;to&#8208;band recombination in photoluminescence and electroluminescence indicates enhanced effective photogenerated carrier density, supporting the use of phosphonic acid&#8208;based SAMs for surface passivation in perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play a pivotal role in determining device performance by influencing charge transport and recombination. Understanding the physical processes at these interfaces is essential for achieving high&#8208;power conversion efficiency in PSCs. Particularly, the interfaces involving oxide&#8208;based transport layers are susceptible to defects like dangling bonds, excess oxygen, or oxygen deficiency. To address this issue, the surface of NiOx is passivated using octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA), resulting in improved charge transport across the perovskite hole transport layer (HTL) interface. This surface treatment has led to the development of hysteresis&#8208;free devices with an impressive &#8776;13% increase in power conversion efficiency. Computational studies have explored the halide perovskite architecture of ODPA&#8208;treated HTL/Perovskite, aiming to unlock superior photovoltaic performance. The ODPA surface functionalization has demonstrated enhanced device performance, characterized by superior charge exchange capacity. Moreover, higher band&#8208;to&#8208;band recombination in photoluminescence and electroluminescence indicates presence of lower mid&#8208;gap energy states, thereby increasing the effective photogenerated carrier density. These findings are expected to promote the utilization of various phosphonic acid&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly monolayers for surface passivation of oxide&#8208;based transport layers in perovskite solar cells. Ultimately, this research contributes to the realization of efficient halide PSCs by harnessing the favorable architecture of NiOx interfaces.

         <title>Selective Interfacial Excited&#8208;State Carrier Dynamics and Efficient Charge Separation in Borophene&#8208;Based Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoexcited carrier dynamics are demonstrated in the heterostructures comprising borophene allotropes and MoS2 layers. The diverse borophenes exhibit distinct and selective carrier transfer behaviors with an ultrafast timescale, enabling efficient charge separation and opening doors to potential applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.








Abstract
Borophene&#8208;based van der Waals heterostructures have demonstrated enormous potential in the realm of optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, which has sparked a wide range of interest. However, a thorough understanding of the microscopic excited&#8208;state electronic dynamics at interfaces is lacking, which is essential for determining the macroscopic optoelectronic and photovoltaic performance of borophene&#8208;based devices. In this study, photoexcited carrier dynamics of &#946;12, &#967;3, and &#945;&#900; borophene/MoS2 heterostructures are systematically studied based on time&#8208;domain nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Different Schottky contacts are found in borophene/semiconductor heterostructures. The interplay between Schottky barriers, electronic coupling, and the involvement of different phonon modes collectively contribute to the unique carrier dynamics in borophene&#8208;based heterostructures. The diverse borophene allotropes within the heterostructures exhibit distinct and selective carrier transfer behaviors on an ultrafast timescale: electrons tunnel into &#945;&#900; borophene with an ultrafast transfer rate (&#8776;29&#160;fs) in &#945;&#900;/MoS2 heterostructures, whereas &#946;12 borophene only allows holes to migrate with a lifetime of 176&#160;fs. The feature enables efficient charge separation and offers promising avenues for applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.

     alt="Selective Interfacial Excited-State Carrier Dynamics and Efficient Charge Separation in Borophene-Based Heterostructures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photoexcited carrier dynamics are demonstrated in the heterostructures comprising borophene allotropes and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers. The diverse borophenes exhibit distinct and selective carrier transfer behaviors with an ultrafast timescale, enabling efficient charge separation and opening doors to potential applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borophene-based van der Waals heterostructures have demonstrated enormous potential in the realm of optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, which has sparked a wide range of interest. However, a thorough understanding of the microscopic excited-state electronic dynamics at interfaces is lacking, which is essential for determining the macroscopic optoelectronic and photovoltaic performance of borophene-based devices. In this study, photoexcited carrier dynamics of &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;, &#967;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#900; borophene/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures are systematically studied based on time-domain nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Different Schottky contacts are found in borophene/semiconductor heterostructures. The interplay between Schottky barriers, electronic coupling, and the involvement of different phonon modes collectively contribute to the unique carrier dynamics in borophene-based heterostructures. The diverse borophene allotropes within the heterostructures exhibit distinct and selective carrier transfer behaviors on an ultrafast timescale: electrons tunnel into &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#900; borophene with an ultrafast transfer rate (&#8776;29&#160;fs) in &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#900;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures, whereas &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; borophene only allows holes to migrate with a lifetime of 176&#160;fs. The feature enables efficient charge separation and offers promising avenues for applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. This study provides insight into the interfacial carrier dynamics in borophene-based heterostructures, which is helpful in further design of advanced 2D boron-based optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Separator Enables High&#8208;Performance Sodium Metal Batteries in Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional separator is designed for sodium metal batteries (SMBs) with the carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. Thanks to abundant functional groups and solid mechanical strength, the separator can enable high&#8208;performance SMBs with reduced electrolyte volume. Besides, the lightweight, thinness, and high&#8208;utilization electrolyte properties of the separator can further increase mass and volumetric energy densities.








Abstract
Sodium metal has become one of the most promising anodes for next&#8208;generation cheap and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries; however, challenges caused by the uncontrollable sodium dendrite growth and fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) restrict their large&#8208;scale practical applications in low&#8208;cost and wide&#8208;voltage&#8208;window carbonate electrolytes. Herein, a novel multifunctional separator with lightweight and high thinness is proposed, assembled by the cobalt&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework nanowires (Co&#8208;NWS), to replace the widely applied thick and heavy glass fiber separator. Benefitting from its abundant sodiophilic functional groups and densely stacked nanowires, Co&#8208;NWS not only exhibits outstanding electrolyte wettability and effectively induces uniform Na+ ion flux as a strong ion redistributor but also favors constructing the robust N,F&#8208;rich SEI layer. Satisfactorily, with 10&#160;&#181;L carbonate electrolyte, a Na|Co&#8208;NWS|Cu half&#8208;cell delivers stable cycling (over 260 cycles) with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 98%, and the symmetric cell shows a long cycle life of more than 500&#160;h. Remarkably, the full cell shows a long&#8208;term life span (over 1500 cycles with 92% capacity retention) at high current density in the carbonate electrolyte. This work opens up a strategy for developing dendrite&#8208;free, low&#8208;cost, and long&#8208;life&#8208;span sodium metal batteries in carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Activating Tumor&#8208;Selective Liquid Metal Nanomedicine through Galvanic Replacement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic anticancer bioactivity of liquid metal nanodroplets (&lt;30&#160;nm) can be activated via the galvanic replacement reaction with endogenous Cu2+ ions. This chemotherapy strategy, which leverages endogenous nutrients and features tumor&#8208;selective carrier&#8208;to&#8208;drug conversion, dual anticancer pathways (Ga3+ release and Cu2+ depletion), along with abundant reactive oxygen species generation, provides a new tool for synthesizing drugs in biological environments.








Abstract
Advanced chemotherapeutic strategies including prodrug and nanocatalytic medicine have significantly advanced tumor&#8208;selective theranostics, but delicate prodrug screening, tedious synthesis, low degradability/biocompatibility of inorganic components, and unsatisfied reaction activity complicate treatment efficacies. Here, the intrinsic anticancer bioactivity of liquid metal nanodroplets (LMNDs) is explored through galvanic replacement. By utilizing a mechano&#8208;degradable ligand, the resultant size of the aqueous LMND is unexpectedly controlled as small as &#8776;20&#160;nm (LMND20). It is demonstrated that LMND20 presents excellent tumor penetration and biocompatibility and activates tumor&#8208;selective carrier&#8208;to&#8208;drug conversion, synchronously depleting Cu2+ ions and producing Ga3+ ions through galvanic replacement. Together with abundant generation of reactive oxygen species, multiple anticancer pathways lead to selective apoptosis and anti&#8208;angiogenesis of breast cancer cells. Compared to the preclinical/clinical anticancer drugs of tetrathiomolybdate and Ga(NO3)3, LMND20 administration significantly improves the therapeutic efficacy and survival in a BCap&#8208;37 xenograft mouse model, yet without obvious side effects.

         <title>Complete Suppression of Phase Segregation in Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Nanocrystals under Periodic Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When mixed&#8208;halide CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals are periodically heated with a temperature change of &#8776;10&#160;&#176;C, the phase&#8208;segregation effect can be completely suppressed even under strong light illumination. The above finding marks the emergence of a practical solution to the detrimental phase&#8208;segregation problem, given that a small temperature modulation is readily available in various fundamental and practical studies of mixed&#8208;halide perovskite nanocrystals.








Abstract
Under continuous light illumination, it is known that localized domains with segregated halide compositions form in semiconducting mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, thus severely limiting their optoelectronic applications due to the negative changes in bandgap energies and charge&#8208;carrier characteristics. Here mixed&#8208;halide perovskite CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals are deposited onto an indium tin oxide substrate, whose temperature can be rapidly changed by &#8776;10&#160;&#176;C in a few seconds by applying or removing an external voltage. Such a sudden temperature change induces a temporary transition of CsPbBr1.2I1.8 nanocrystals from the segregated phase to the mixed phase, the latter of which can be permanently maintained when the light illumination is coupled with periodic heating cycles. These findings mark the emergence of a practical solution to the detrimental phase&#8208;segregation problem, given that a small temperature modulation is readily available in various fundamental studies and practical devices of mixed&#8208;halide perovskites.

         <title>Sensitive and Selective Dual&#8208;Mode Responses to Reactive Oxygen Species by Chiral Manganese Dioxide Nanoparticles for Antiaging Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral MnO2 NPs are constructed for the quantitative analysis of ROS. The redox reaction between H2O2 and chiral MnO2 NPs lead to decreased signals on CD and T1&#8208;weighted images, thus achieving ultrasensitive and dual&#8208;mode detection of H2O2. Noticeably, in vivo data show that scavenging ROS inhibits skin oxidative damage and prevents skin aging.








Abstract
Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to oxidative stress and oxidative damage, which is one of the important factors for aging and age&#8208;related diseases. Therefore, real&#8208;time monitoring and the moderate elimination of ROS is extremely important. In this study, a ROS&#8208;responsive circular dichroic (CD) at 553&#160;nm and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dual&#8208;signals chiral manganese oxide (MnO2) nanoparticles (NPs) are designed and synthesized. Both the CD and MRI signals show excellent linear ranges for intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations, with limits of detection (LOD) of 0.0027&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.016&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The lower LOD achieved with CD detection may be attributable to its higher anti&#8208;interference capability from the intracellular matrix. Importantly, ROS&#8208;induced cell aging is intervened by chiral MnO2 NPs via redox reactions with excessive intracellular ROS. In vivo experiments confirm that chiral MnO2 NPs effectively eliminate ROS in skin tissue, reduce oxidative stress levels, and alleviate skin aging. This approach provides a new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of age&#8208;related diseases.

Both the CD and MRI signals show excellent linear ranges for intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentrations, with limits of detection (LOD) of 0.0027&#160;nmol/10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells and 0.016&#160;nmol/10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; cells, respectively. The lower LOD achieved with CD detection may be attributable to its higher anti-interference capability from the intracellular matrix. Importantly, ROS-induced cell aging is intervened by chiral MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs via redox reactions with excessive intracellular ROS. In vivo experiments confirm that chiral MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; NPs effectively eliminate ROS in skin tissue, reduce oxidative stress levels, and alleviate skin aging. This approach provides a new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Suppressing Buried Interface Nonradiative Recombination Losses Toward High&#8208;Efficiency Antimony Triselenide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, buried interface and heterojunction engineering are synergistically employed to regulate the film growth and optimize the band alignment. Thus, the interfacial trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination loss has been successfully minimized, and heterojunction band alignment has been optimized. Hence, the champion device presents a power conversion efficiency of 9.24%, representing the highest efficiency in sputtered&#8208;derived Sb2Se3 solar cells.








Abstract
Antimony triselenide (Sb2Se3) has possessed excellent optoelectronic properties and has gained interest as a light&#8208;harvesting material for photovoltaic technology over the past several years. However, the severe interfacial and bulk recombination obviously contribute to significant carrier transport loss thus leading to the deterioration of power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, buried interface and heterojunction engineering are synergistically employed to regulate the film growth kinetic and optimize the band alignment. Through this approach, the orientation of the precursor films is successfully controlled, promoting the preferred orientational growth of the (hk1) of the Sb2Se3 films. Besides, interfacial trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination loss and heterojunction band alignment are successfully minimized and optimized. As a result, the champion device presents a PCE of 9.24% with short&#8208;circuit density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of 29.47&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 63.65%, respectively, representing the highest efficiency in sputtered&#8208;derived Sb2Se3 solar cells. This work provides an insightful prescription for fabricating high&#8208;quality Sb2Se3 thin film and enhancing the performance of Sb2Se3 solar cells.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Activatable Heterostructured Nanoadjuvant CoP/NiCoP Executing Lactate Metabolism Interventions for Boosted Photocatalytic Hydrogen Therapy and Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;activated immunomodulatory nanoadjuvant based on the yolk&#8211;shell CoP/NiCoP heterostructure is developed to potentiate photoimmunotherapy through modulating lactic acid (LA) metabolism. Meanwhile, nanotherapeutic platform also has the potential for LA metabolic intervention to improve the effectiveness of Photocatalytic therapy and mild photothermal therapy, providing new insights into more advanced oncotherapy with optimal efficacy, precision, and safety.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser&#8208;induced photoimmunotherapy has aroused great interest due to its intrinsic noninvasiveness and spatiotemporal precision, while immune evasion evoked by lactic acid (LA) accumulation severely limits its clinical outcomes. Although several metabolic interventions have been devoted to ameliorate immunosuppression, intracellular residual LA still remains a potential energy source for oncocyte proliferation. Herein, an immunomodulatory nanoadjuvant based on a yolk&#8211;shell CoP/NiCoP (CNCP) heterostructure loaded with the monocarboxylate transporter 4 inhibitor fluvastatin sodium (Flu) is constructed to concurrently relieve immunosuppression and elicit robust antitumor immunity. Under NIR irradiation, CNCP heterojunctions exhibit superior photothermal performance and photocatalytic production of reactive oxygen species and hydrogen. The continuous heat then facilitates Flu release to restrain LA exudation from tumor cells, whereas cumulative LA can be depleted as a hole scavenger to improve photocatalytic efficiency. Subsequently, potentiated photocatalytic therapy can not only initiate systematic immunoreaction, but also provoke severe mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupt the energy supply for heat shock protein synthesis, in turn realizing mild photothermal therapy. Consequently, LA metabolic remodeling endows an intensive cascade treatment with an optimal safety profile to effectually suppress tumor proliferation and metastasis, which offers a new paradigm for the development of metabolism&#8208;regulated immunotherapy.

Functional electrolytes are prepared by employing the weak&#8208;solvation and low&#8208;viscosity isobutyronitrile as a cosolvents. The as&#8208;prepared electrolyte exhibits a sufficiently high conductivity (1.152 mS cm&#8722;1) at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, and enables the LiCoO2//graphite pouch cells to retain 68.7% of the room&#8208;temperature capacity at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C and present stable cycling performance at &#8722;40 and 60&#160;&#176;C. 








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) has always posed a significant challenge, limiting their wide application in cold environments. In this work, the high&#8208;performance LIBs working under ultralow&#8208;temperature conditions, which is achieved by employing the weak&#8208;solvation and low&#8208;viscosity isobutyronitrile as a cosolvent to tame the affinity between solvents and lithium ions, is reported. The as&#8208;prepared electrolytes exhibit a sufficiently high conductivity (1.152 mS cm&#8722;1) at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C. The electrolytes enable LiCoO2 cathode and graphite anode to achieve high Coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9% during long&#8208;term cycling at room temperature, and to respectively achieve 75.8% and 100.0% of their room&#8208;temperature capacities at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. Even the LiCoO2//graphite pouch cells can retain 68.7% of the room&#8208;temperature capacity when discharged at &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C, and present stable cycling performance at &#8722;40 and 60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a solution for the development of advanced electrolytes to enable LIBs working at wide&#8208;temperatures range.

         <title>Manipulating Vertical Phase Separation Enables Pseudoplanar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Over 19% Efficiency via Ternary Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary polymerization strategy is employed to manipulate the vertical phase separation in pseudoplanar heterojunction (PPHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). The terpolymer DL1, with enhanced solubility, partial edge&#8208;on orientation, and high crystallinity, endows DL1/Y6 PPHJ blend film with the optimized vertical phase separation. Therefore, DL1/Y6 based PPHJ OSCs afford an impressive PCE of 19.10%, which is the record for terpolymer donors.








Abstract
Controlling vertical phase separation of the active layer to enable efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport is crucial to boost power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of pseudoplanar heterojunction (PPHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). However, how to optimize the vertical phase separation of PPHJ OSCs via molecule design is rarely reported yet. Herein, ternary polymerization strategy is employed to develop a series of polymer donors, DL1&#8208;DL4, and regulate their solubility, molecular aggregation, molecular orientation, and miscibility, thus efficiently manipulating vertical phase separation in PPHJ OSCs. Among them, DL1 not only has enhanced solubility, inhibited molecular aggregation and partial edge&#8208;on orientation to facilitate acceptor molecules, Y6, to permeate into polymer layer and increase donor/acceptor interfaces, but also sustains high crystallinity and appropriate miscibility with Y6 to acquire ordered molecular packing, thus achieving optimized vertical phase separation to well juggle exciton dissociation and charge transport in PPHJ devices. Therefore, DL1/Y6 based PPHJ OSCs gain the best exciton dissociation probability, highest charge carrier mobilities and weakest charge recombination, and thus afford an impressive PCE of 19.10%, which is the record value for terpolymer donors. It demonstrates that ternary polymerization is an efficient method to optimize vertical phase separation in PPHJ OSCs for high PCEs.

It demonstrates that ternary polymerization is an efficient method to optimize vertical phase separation in PPHJ OSCs for high PCEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insulin&#8211;Dendrimer Nanocomplex for Multi&#8208;Day Glucose&#8208;Responsive Therapy in Mice and Swine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An insulin nanocomplex formulation prepared by coupling electrostatic&#8208; and dynamic&#8208;covalent interactions is shown that affords long&#8208;lasting blood glucose control with an elevated insulin response to glucose challenge for up to a week following a single injection.








Abstract
The management of diabetes in a manner offering autonomous insulin therapy responsive to glucose&#8208;directed need, and moreover with a dosing schedule amenable to facile administration, remains an ongoing goal to improve the standard of care. While basal insulins with reduced dosing frequency, even once&#8208;weekly administration, are on the horizon, there is still no approved therapy that offers glucose&#8208;responsive insulin function. Herein, a nanoscale complex combining both electrostatic&#8208; and dynamic&#8208;covalent interactions between a synthetic dendrimer carrier and an insulin analogue modified with a high&#8208;affinity glucose&#8208;binding motif yields an injectable insulin depot affording both glucose&#8208;directed and long&#8208;lasting insulin availability. Following a single injection, it is even possible to control blood glucose for at least one week in diabetic swine subjected to daily oral glucose challenges. Measurements of serum insulin concentration in response to challenge show increases in insulin corresponding to elevated blood glucose levels, an uncommon finding even in preclinical work on glucose&#8208;responsive insulin. Accordingly, the subcutaneous nanocomplex that results from combining electrostatic&#8208; and dynamic&#8208;covalent interactions between a modified insulin and a synthetic dendrimer carrier affords a glucose&#8208;responsive insulin depot for week&#8208;long control following a single routine injection.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Perovskite Quantum Dots for Highly Selective Room&#8208;Temperature Spin Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell structured perovskite quantum dots with outstanding spin polarization property are developed for room&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes. The 2D chiral organic cation in the shell passivates defects on the quantum dot surface, thereby yielding a high external quantum efficiency of 5.47% and strong circularly polarized electroluminescence with a dissymmetry factor |gCP&#8208;EL| of 2.4 &#215; 10&#8722;1.








Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) is a crucial light source with a wide variety of potential applications such as magnetic recording, and 3D display. Here, core&#8211;shell heterostructured perovskite quantum dots (QDs) for room&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (spin&#8208;LEDs) are developed. Specifically, a 2D chiral perovskite shell is deposited onto the achiral 3D inorganic perovskite (CsPbBr3) core. Owing to the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect, the spin state of the injected charge carriers is biased when they are transmitted through the 2D chiral shell. The spin&#8208;controlled carriers then radiatively recombine inside the CsPbBr3 emissive core, resulting in CPL emission. It is demonstrated that the (R)&#8208; and (S)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;(naphthyl)ethylamine) (R&#8208;/S&#8208;NEA) 2D chiral cations enhance the spin polarization degree due to their strong chiroptical properties. Systematical defect analyses confirm that 2D chiral cations (i.e., R&#8208;/S&#8208;NEA) successfully passivate halide vacancies at the surface of the CsPbBr3 QDs, thereby attaining a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 78%. Moreover, the spin&#8208;LEDs prepared with core&#8211;shell QDs achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency of 5.47% and circularly polarized electroluminescence with a polarization degree (PCP&#8208;EL) of 12% at room temperature. Finally, various patterns fabricated by inkjet printing the core&#8211;shell QDs emit strong CPL, highlighting their potential as an emitter for next&#8208;generation displays.

         <title>Schottky Junction and D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 System Dual Regulation of Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Highly Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large &#960;&#8208;delocalized and &#960;&#8208;stacked Schottky junction that synergistically knits a rebuilt extended &#960;&#8208;delocalized network of D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 system (multiple donor or acceptor units) with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is developed. The catalyst realizes high&#8208;efficient charge separation and transport in both lateral and vertical directions, thus resulting in an outstanding photocatalytic activity and selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate.








Abstract
Covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are emerging as a promising molecular platform for photocatalysis. Nevertheless, the construction of highly effective charge transfer pathways in CTFs for oriented delivery of photoexcited electrons to enhance photocatalytic performance remains highly challenging. Herein, a molecular engineering strategy is presented to achieve highly efficient charge separation and transport in both the lateral and vertical directions for solar&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion. Specifically, a large &#960;&#8208;delocalized and &#960;&#8208;stacked Schottky junction (Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF/RGO) that synergistically knits a rebuilt extended &#960;&#8208;delocalized network of the D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 system (multiple donor or acceptor units, Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF) with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) is developed. It is verified that the single&#8208;site Ru units in Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF/RGO act as effective secondary electron acceptors in the lateral direction for multistage charge separation/transport. Simultaneously, the &#960;&#8208;stacked and covalently bonded graphene is regarded as a hole extraction layer, accelerating the separation/transport of the photogenerated charges in the vertical direction over the Ru&#8208;Th&#8208;CTF/RGO Schottky junction with full use of photogenerated electrons for the reduction reaction. Thus, the obtained photocatalyst has an excellent CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion rate (&#8776;11050 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and selectivity (&#8776;99%), producing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalyst for the heterogeneous conversion of CO2 to formate without an extra photosensitizer.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Plasma Membrane and Mitochondria Dual&#8208;Targeted NIR&#8208;II AIE Photosensitizer Evoking Synergetic Pyroptosis and Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma membrane and mitochondria dual&#8208;targeted photosensitizer (DPITQ) with NIR&#8208;II aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics for evoking synergetic pyroptosis and apoptosis is developed through rational molecular engineering. After encapsulation by DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000, DPITQ presents a clear NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability on the venous vessels of nude mice and efficient NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy for tumors.








Abstract
Phototherapy provides a noninvasive and spatiotemporal controllable paradigm to inhibit the evasion of the programmed cell death (PCD) of tumors. However, conventional photosensitizers (PSs) often induce a single PCD process, resulting in insufficient photodamage and severely impeding their application scopes. In this study, molecular engineering is conducted by adjusting electron donors to develop an aggregation&#8208;induced NIR&#8208;II emissive PS (DPITQ) for plasma membrane and mitochondria dual&#8208;targeted tumor therapy by evoking synergetic pyroptosis and apoptosis. DPITQ displays boosted type I and II reactive oxygen species generation as well as a high photothermal conversion efficacy (43%) after laser irradiation of 635 nm. The excellent biocompatibility and appropriate lipophilicity help the DPITQ to specifically anchor in the plasma membrane and mitochondria of cancer cells. Furthermore, the photosensitized DPITQ can disrupt the intact plasma membrane and cause mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately causing concurrent pyroptosis and apoptosis to suppress cancer cell proliferation even under hypoxia. It is noteworthy that the DPITQ nanoparticles (NPs) present clear NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging capability on the venous vessels of nude mice. Notably, the DPITQ NPs exert efficient NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy both in multicellular tumor spheroids and in vivo, causing maximum destruction to tumors but minimum adverse effects to normal tissue.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phototherapy provides a noninvasive and spatiotemporal controllable paradigm to inhibit the evasion of the programmed cell death (PCD) of tumors. However, conventional photosensitizers (PSs) often induce a single PCD process, resulting in insufficient photodamage and severely impeding their application scopes. In this study, molecular engineering is conducted by adjusting electron donors to develop an aggregation-induced NIR-II emissive PS (DPITQ) for plasma membrane and mitochondria dual-targeted tumor therapy by evoking synergetic pyroptosis and apoptosis. DPITQ displays boosted type I and II reactive oxygen species generation as well as a high photothermal conversion efficacy (43%) after laser irradiation of 635 nm. The excellent biocompatibility and appropriate lipophilicity help the DPITQ to specifically anchor in the plasma membrane and mitochondria of cancer cells. Furthermore, the photosensitized DPITQ can disrupt the intact plasma membrane and cause mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately causing concurrent pyroptosis and apoptosis to suppress cancer cell proliferation even under hypoxia. It is noteworthy that the DPITQ nanoparticles (NPs) present clear NIR-II fluorescence imaging capability on the venous vessels of nude mice. Notably, the DPITQ NPs exert efficient NIR-II fluorescence imaging-guided phototherapy both in multicellular tumor spheroids and in vivo, causing maximum destruction to tumors but minimum adverse effects to normal tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Multifunctional Amino Acid Enables Direct Recycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathode Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydroxyl groups and amino groups in L&#8208;threonine act as electron donors and nitrogen sources, respectively. N atoms derived from amino groups are able to dope into carbon layers, generating more active sites and enhancing the conductive properties of LFP particles. Therefore, the regenerated LFP shows excellent cycling performance with 86% retention after 500 cycles at 5 C rate.








Abstract
Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) batteries are extensively used in electric vehicles and energy storage due to their good cycling stability and safety. However, the finite service life of lithium&#8208;ion batteries leads to significant amounts of retired LFP batteries, urgently required to be recycled by environmentally friendly and effective methods. Here, a direct regeneration strategy using natural and low&#8208;cost L&#8208;threonine as a multifunctional reductant is proposed. The hydroxyl groups and amino groups in L&#8208;threonine act as electron donors and nitrogen sources, respectively. The reductive environment created by L&#8208;threonine not only aids in converting the degraded FePO4 phase back to a single LFP phase but also facilitates the elimination of detrimental Li&#8211;Fe anti&#8208;site defects; thus, reconstructing fast Li+ diffusion channels. Meanwhile, N atoms derived from amino groups are able to dope into carbon layers, generating more active sites and enhancing the conductive properties of LFP particles. The regenerated LFP shows great electrochemical performance with a discharge capacity of 147.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C and a capacity retention of 86% after 500 cycles at 5 C. Further, this approach is also feasible for LFP black mass sourced from practical industrial dismantling lines, providing considerable prospects for the large&#8208;scale recycling of LFP batteries.

         <title>Injectable Supramolecular Hydrogels for In Situ Programming of Car&#8208;T Cells toward Solid Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable CAR plasmid (pCAR)&#8208;loaded supramolecular hydrogel system for long&#8208;term and sustained reprogramming of CAR&#8208;T cells in situ for solid tumor immunotherapy is introduced. After injection locally adjacent to a solid tumor, the supramolecular hydrogel platform produces in situ CAR&#8208;T cells by sustaining release of T cell&#8208;targeting nanocomplexes&#8208;carrying pCAR and significantly diminishes the immunosuppressive microenvironment or facilitates the clearance of solid tumors.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell immunotherapy is approved in the treatment of hematological malignancies, but remains far from satisfactory&#160;in solid tumor treatment due to inadequate intra&#8208;tumor CAR&#8208;T cell infiltration. Herein, an injectable supramolecular hydrogel system, based on self&#8208;assembly between cationic polymer mPEG&#8208;PCL&#8208;PEI (PPP) conjugated with T cell targeting anti&#8208;CD3e f(ab')2 fragment and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#945;&#8208;CD), is designed to load plasmid CAR (pCAR) with a T cell specific CD2 promoter, which successfully achieves in situ fabrication and effective accumulation of CAR&#8208;T cells at the tumor site in humanized mice models. More importantly, due to this tumor microenvironment reprogramming, secretion of cellular inflammatory cytokines (interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2), tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; (TNF&#8208;&#945;), and interferon&#8208;&#947; (IFN&#8208;&#947;)) or tumor killer protein granzyme B is significantly promoted, which reverses the immunosuppressive microenvironment and significantly enhances the intra&#8208;tumor CAR&#8208;T cells and cytotoxic T cells infiltration. To the best of the current knowledge, this is a pioneer report of using injectable supramolecular hydrogel for in situ reprogramming CAR&#8208;T cells, which might be beneficial for solid tumor CAR&#8208;T immunotherapy.

         <title>Manganese@Albumin Nanocomplex and Its Assembled Nanowire Activate TLR4&#8208;Dependent Signaling Cascades of Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace Mn2+ bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form Mn@BSA nanocomplexes can potentiate pro&#8208;inflammatory responses through TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling cascades. Furthermore, assembly of the resultant Mn@BSA nanocomplexes into larger nanowires enables robust and long&#8208;duration interactions with membrane&#8208;bound TLR4s via phagocytosis, boosting the immunostimulation of macrophages.








Abstract
The immunomodulatory effect of divalent manganese cations (Mn2+), such as activation of the cGAS&#8722;STING pathway or NLRP3 inflammasomes, positions them as adjuvants for cancer immunotherapy. In this study, it is found that trace Mn2+ ions, bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) to form Mn@BSA nanocomplexes, stimulate pro&#8208;inflammatory responses in human&#8208; or murine&#8208;derived macrophages through TLR4&#8208;mediated signaling cascades. Building on this, the assembly of Mn@BSA nanocomplexes to obtain nanowire structures enables stronger and longer&#8208;lasting immunostimulation of macrophages by regulating phagocytosis. Furthermore, Mn@BSA nanocomplexes and their nanowires efficiently activate peritoneal macrophages, reprogramme tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, and inhibit the growth of melanoma tumors in vivo. They also show better biosafety for potential clinical applications compared to typical TLR4 agonists such as lipopolysaccharides. Accordingly, the findings provide insights into the mechanism of metalloalbumin complexes as potential TLR agonists that activate macrophage polarization and highlight the importance of their nanostructures in regulating macrophage&#8208;mediated innate immunity.

         <title>Hydrophobic Trinuclear Copper Cluster&#8208;Containing Organic Framework for Synergetic Electrocatalytic Synthesis of Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed perfluoroalkyl hydrophobic crystalline trinuclear Cu&#8208;containing cluster organic frameworks not only inhibit hydrogen evolution reaction, but also the dynamic reconfiguration of the trinuclear Cu clusters in the F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF allows short&#8208;range Cu atoms to activate NO3&#8722; and keto acids at the same time and shows excellent performance in electrocatalytic C&#9472;N coupling to generate a series of amino acids.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic synthesis of amino acids provides a promising green and efficient pathway to manufacture the basic substances of life. Herein, reaction of 2,5&#8208;perfluroalkyl&#8208;terepthalohydrazide and tris(4&#8208;&#181;2&#8208;O&#8208;carboxaldehyde&#8208;pyrazolato&#8208;N, N&#8242;)&#8208;tricopper affords a crystalline trinuclear copper cluster&#8208;containing organic framework, named F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF. Incorporation of abundant hydrophobic perfluroalkyl groups inside the channels of F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF is revealed to successfully suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction via preventing H+ cation with large polarity from the framework of F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF and in turn increasing the adsorption of other substrates with relatively small polarity like NO3&#8722; and keto acids on the active sites. The copper atoms with short distance in the trinuclear copper clusters of F&#8208;Cu3&#8208;OF enable simultaneous activization of NO3&#8722; and keto acids, facilitating the following synergistic and efficient C&#9472;N coupling on the basis of in situ spectroscopic investigations together with theoretical calculation. Combination of these effects leads to efficient electroproduction of various amino acids including glycine, alanine, leucine, valine, and phenylalanine from NO3&#8722; and keto acids with a Faraday efficiency of 42%&#8211;71% and a yield of 187&#8211;957&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, representing the thus far best performance. This work shall be helpful for developing economical, eco&#8208;friendly, and high&#8208;efficiency strategy for the production of amino acids and other life substances.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and keto acids with a Faraday efficiency of 42%&#8211;71% and a yield of 187&#8211;957&#160;&#181;mol cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing the thus far best performance. This work shall be helpful for developing economical, eco-friendly, and high-efficiency strategy for the production of amino acids and other life substances.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling Synergistic Effect of Defects and Piezoelectric Field in Breakthrough Piezo&#8208;Photocatalytic N2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergy of defects and piezoelectric field renders an outstanding piezo&#8208;photocatalytic nitrogen reduction activity of BaTiO3. Oxygen&#8208;vacancies (OVs) can strengthen the piezoelectric polarization of BaTiO3 to promote photogenerated carrier separation, meanwhile the optimized piezoelectric polarization field can also modulate the electronic structure of Ti3+ adjacent to OVs to facilitate the chemisorption, activation and dissociation of N2.








Abstract
Piezo&#8208;photocatalysis is a frontier technology for converting mechanical and solar energies into crucial chemical substances and has emerged as a promising and sustainable strategy for N2 fixation. Here, for the first time, defects and piezoelectric field are synergized to achieve unprecedented piezo&#8208;photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) activity and their collaborative catalytic mechanism is unraveled over BaTiO3 with tunable oxygen vacancies (OVs). The introduced OVs change the local dipole state to strengthen the piezoelectric polarization of BaTiO3, resulting in a more efficient separation of photogenerated carrier. Ti3+ sites adjacent to OVs promote N2 chemisorption and activation through d&#8211;&#960; back&#8208;donation with the help of the unpaired d&#8208;orbital electron. Furthermore, a piezoelectric polarization field could modulate the electronic structure of Ti3+ to facilitate the activation and dissociation of N2, thereby substantially reducing the reaction barrier of the rate&#8208;limiting step. Benefitting from the synergistic reinforcement mechanism and optimized surface dynamics processes, an exceptional piezo&#8208;photocatalytic NH3 evolution rate of 106.7&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 is delivered by BaTiO3 with moderate OVs, far surpassing that of previously reported piezocatalysts/piezo&#8208;photocatalysts. New perspectives are provided here for the rational design of an efficient piezo&#8208;photocatalytic system for the NRR.

         <title>Laser Synthesis of PtMo Single&#8208;Atom Alloy Electrode for Ultralow Voltage Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The universal laser ablation synthesis strategy of single&#8208;atom alloy (PtMo, RhMo, IrMo, and RuMo) self&#8208;standing electrodes is developed. Attributed to the optimized electron distribution and strong bonding between the Pt single atom and Mo substrate, the self&#8208;standing PtMo single&#8208;atom alloy electrode (Pt&#8208;SA0.056/Mo&#8208;L) possesses the splendid catalytic activity and high&#8208;current&#8208;density stability for hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Maximizing atom&#8208;utilization efficiency and high current stability are crucial for the platinum (Pt)&#8208;based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, the Pt single&#8208;atom anchored molybdenum (Mo) foil (Pt&#8208;SA/Mo&#8208;L) as a single&#8208;atom alloy electrode is synthesized by the laser ablation strategy. The local thermal effect with fast rising&#8211;cooling rate of laser can achieve the single&#8208;atom distribution of the precious metals (e.g., Pt, Rh, Ir, and Ru) onto the Mo foil. The synthesized self&#8208;standing Pt&#8208;SA/Mo&#8208;L electrode exhibits splendid catalytic activity (31&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and high&#8208;current&#8208;density stability (&#8776;850&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 50 h) for HER in acidic media. The strong coordination of Pt&#8208;Mo bonding in Pt&#8208;SA/Mo&#8208;L is critical for the efficient and stable HER. In addition, the ultralow electrolytic voltage of 0.598&#160;V to afford the current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is realized by utilization of the anodic molybdenum oxidation instead of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Here a universal synthetic strategy of single&#8208;atom alloys (PtMo, RhMo, IrMo, and RuMo) as self&#8208;standing electrodes is provided for ultralow voltage and membrane&#8208;free hydrogen production.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Lattice&#8208;Matched Boron&#8208;Doped Gallium Phosphide: A Scalable Acousto&#8208;Optic Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study implements the first integrated photonic and acousto&#8208;optic devices in novel thin&#8208;film boron&#8208;doped gallium phosphide, indicating its potential as a highly scalable hybrid photonics platform for integration with color centers in high&#8208;index materials. Optical, acoustic, and materials characterization is performed, revealing both strong intrinsic properties and clear pathways toward improvement.








Abstract
The compact size, scalability, and strongly confined fields in integrated photonic devices enable new functionalities in photonic networking and information processing, both classical and quantum. Gallium phosphide (GaP) is a promising material for active integrated photonics due to its high refractive index, wide bandgap, strong nonlinear properties, and large acousto&#8208;optic figure&#160;of merit. This study demonstrates that silicon&#8208;lattice&#8208;matched boron&#8208;doped GaP (BGaP), grown at the 12&#8208;inch wafer scale, provides similar functionalities as GaP. BGaP optical resonators exhibit intrinsic quality factors exceeding 25,000 and 200,000 at visible and telecom wavelengths, respectively. It further demonstrates the electromechanical generation of low&#8208;loss acoustic waves and an integrated acousto&#8208;optic (AO) modulator. High&#8208;resolution spatial and compositional mapping, combined with ab initio calculations, indicate two candidates for the excess optical loss in the visible band: the silicon&#8208;GaP interface and boron dimers. These results demonstrate the promise of the BGaP material platform for the development of scalable AO technologies at telecom and provide potential pathways toward higher performance at shorter&#160;wavelengths.

         <title>In Situ Regulating Cobalt/Iron Oxide&#8208;Oxyhydroxide Exchange by Dynamic Iron Incorporation for Robust Oxygen Evolution at Large Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exceptional and stable oxygen&#8208;evolving electrocatalyst is developed from self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous bimetallic FeOOH/Co(OH)2 microsheet arrays through a mechanical stirring strategy, yielding a current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at low overpotentials of 290 and 304&#160;mV. This catalyst rapidly reconstructs into Co1&#8208;xFexOOH species through in situ iron incorporation into CoOOH as confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron, Raman spectroscopic studies, and theoretical calculations.








Abstract
The key dilemma for green hydrogen production via electrocatalytic water splitting is the high overpotential required for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Co/Fe&#8208;based materials show superior catalytic OER activity to noble metal&#8208;based catalysts, but still lag far behind the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni/Fe&#8208;based catalysts probably due to undesirable side segregation of FeOOH with poor conductivity and unsatisfied structural durability under large current density. Here, a robust and durable OER catalyst affording current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at extremely low overpotentials of 290 and 304&#160;mV in base is reported. This catalyst evolves from amorphous bimetallic FeOOH/Co(OH)2 heterostructure microsheet arrays fabricated by a facile mechanical stirring strategy. Especially, in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman analysis decipher the rapid reconstruction of FeOOH/Co(OH)2 into dynamically stable Co1&#8208;xFexOOH active phase through in situ iron incorporation into CoOOH, which perform as the real active sites accelerating the rate&#8208;determining step supported by density functional theory calculations. By coupling with MoNi4/MoO2 cathode, the self&#8208;assembled alkaline electrolyzer can deliver 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.613&#160;V, better than commercial IrO2(+)||Pt/C(&#8208;) and most of reported transition metal&#8208;based electrolyzers. This work provides a feasible strategy for the exploration and design of industrial water&#8208;splitting catalysts for large&#8208;scale green hydrogen production.

Here, a robust and durable OER catalyst affording current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at extremely low overpotentials of 290 and 304&#160;mV in base is reported. This catalyst evolves from amorphous bimetallic FeOOH/Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure microsheet arrays fabricated by a facile mechanical stirring strategy. Especially, in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman analysis decipher the rapid reconstruction of FeOOH/Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into dynamically stable Co&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;OOH active phase through in situ iron incorporation into CoOOH, which perform as the real active sites accelerating the rate-determining step supported by density functional theory calculations. By coupling with MoNi&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/MoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode, the self-assembled alkaline electrolyzer can deliver 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a low cell voltage of 1.613&#160;V, better than commercial IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;(+)&lt;/sup&gt;||Pt/C&lt;sup&gt;(-)&lt;/sup&gt; and most of reported transition metal-based electrolyzers. This work provides a feasible strategy for the exploration and design of industrial water-splitting catalysts for large-scale green hydrogen production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This work reports the synthesis of novel platinum group metal free catalysts, heterostructure of molybdenum selenide&#8208;nickel selenide (Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe) core&#8211;shell nanowire arrays constructed on nickel foam by single&#8208;step in situ hydrothermal process through optimized shape engineering and structural control technology. The Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe core&#8211;shell nanowire arrays electrocatalyst shows superior electrocatalytic performance, hydrogen evolution reaction with low overpotential from alkaline/seawater electrolysis, respectively.








Abstract
The rational design and steering of earth&#8208;abundant, efficient, and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation is highly desirable but challenging with catalysts free of platinum group metals (PGMs). Mass production of high&#8208;purity hydrogen fuel from seawater electrolysis presents a transformative technology for sustainable alternatives. Here, a heterostructure of molybdenum selenide&#8208;nickel selenide (Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe) core&#8211;shell nanowire arrays constructed on nickel foam by a single&#8208;step in situ hydrothermal process is reported. This tiered structure provides improved intrinsic activity and high electrical conductivity for efficient charge transfer and endows excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline and natural seawater conditions. The Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe freestanding electrodes require small overpotentials of 84.4 and 166&#160;mV to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline and natural seawater electrolytes, respectively. It maintains an impressive balance between electrocatalytic activity and stability. Experimental and theoretical calculations reveal that the Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe interface provides abundant active sites for the HER process, which modulate the binding energies of adsorbed species and decrease the energetic barrier, providing a new route to design state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, PGM&#8208;free catalysts for hydrogen production from alkaline and seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Highly Crystalized Cl&#8208;Doped SnO2 Nanocrystals for Stable Aqueous Dispersion Toward High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystallized Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs that can form very stable aqueous dispersion with shelf life up to one year are herein prepared without the need of any stabilizer. The fabricated FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells with the electron transport layers made by such NCs achieve champion efficiency up to &#8776;25% for small cell (0.085 cm2) and &#8776;20% for mini&#8208;module (12.125 cm2).








Abstract
Tin dioxide (SnO2) with high conductivity and low photocatalytic activity has been reported as one of the best candidates for highly efficient electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cell (PSC). The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SnO2 layer is achieved by chemical bath deposition with tunable properties, while the commercial SnO2 nanocrystals (NCs) with low tunability still face the necessity of further improvement. Here, a kind of highly crystallized Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs is reported that can form very stable aqueous dispersion with shelf life up to one year without any stabilizer, which can facilitate the fabrication of PSCs with satisfactory performance. Compared to the commercial SnO2 NCs regardless of the extrinsic Cl&#8208;doping conditions, the intrinsic Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs effectively suppress the energy barrier and reduces the trap state density at the buried interface between perovskite and ETL. Consequently, stable PSCs based on such Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs achieve a champion efficiency up to &#8776;25% for small cell (0.085 cm2) and &#8776;20% for mini&#8208;module (12.125 cm2), indicating its potential as a promising candidate for ETL in high&#8208;performance perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Hydrogen Ion Capturing Hydrogel Microspheres for Reversing Inflammaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lactic acid produced in degenerated tissues can activate the NLRP3/Caspase&#8208;1/IL&#8208;1&#946; axis and cause chronic inflammation, finally restricting tissue restoration. The engineered hydrogen ion&#8208;capturing hydrogel microspheres (GMNP) using biomimetic mineralization and microfluidic technologies can block the NLRP3 axis by simultaneously capturing excess hydrogen ions and suppressing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), eventually reconstructing the tissue microenvironment and promoting tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Inflammaging is deeply involved in aging&#8208;related diseases and can be destructive during aging. The maintenance of pH balance in the extracellular microenvironment can alleviate inflammaging and repair aging&#8208;related tissue damage. In this study, the hydrogen ion capturing hydrogel microsphere (GMNP) composed of mineralized transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) and catalase (CAT) nanoparticles is developed via biomimetic mineralization and microfluidic technology for blocking the NLRP3 cascade axis in inflammaging. This GMNP can neutralize the acidic microenvironment by capturing excess hydrogen ions through the calcium carbonate mineralization layer. Then, the subsequent release of encapsulated TGF&#8208;&#946; and CAT can eliminate both endogenous and exogenous stimulus of NLRP3, thus suppressing the excessive activation of inflammaging. In vitro, GMNP can suppress the excessive activation of the TXNIP/NLRP3/IL&#8208;1&#946; cascade axis and enhance extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in nucleus pulposus cells. In vivo, GMNP becomes a sustainable and stable niche with microspheres as the core to inhibit inflammaging and promote the regeneration of degenerated intervertebral discs. Therefore, this hydrogen ion&#8208;capturing hydrogel microsphere effectively reverses inflammaging by interfering with the excessive activation of NLRP3 in the degenerated tissues.

         <title>Acetamide&#8208;Caprolactam Deep Eutectic Solvent&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acetamide&#8208;caprolactam deep eutectic solvent&#8208;based electrolyte achieves excellent electrochemical performance by reconstructing the solvation structure of Zn2+, suppressing HER, forming a solid electrolyte interface, and minimizing the formation of undesirable by&#8208;products.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are promising for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, conventional AZIBs face challenges including hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), leading to high local pH, and by&#8208;product formation on the anode. Hereby the hydrogen bonds in the aqueous electrolyte are reconstructed by using a deep eutectic co&#8208;solvent (DES) made of acetamide (H&#8208;bond donor) and caprolactam (H&#8208;bond acceptor), which effectively suppresses the reactivity of water and broadens the electrochemical voltage stability window. The coordination between Zn2+ and acetamide&#8208;caprolactam in DES&#8208;based electrolytes produces a unique solvation structure that promotes the preferential growth of Zn crystals along the (002) plane. This will inhibit the formation of Zn dendrites and ensure the uniform deposition of Zn&#8208;ions on the anode surface. In addition, it is found that this DES&#8208;based electrolyte can form a protective membrane on the anode surface, reducing the risks of Zn corrosion. Compared to conventional electrolytes, the DES&#8208;based electrolyte shows a long&#8208;term stable plating/stripping performance with a significantly improved Coulombic efficiency from 78.18% to 98.37%. It is further demonstrated that a Zn||VS2 full&#8208;cell with the DES&#8208;based electrolyte exhibits enhanced stability after 500 cycles with 85.4% capacity retention at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.

Hereby the hydrogen bonds in the aqueous electrolyte are reconstructed by using a deep eutectic co-solvent (DES) made of acetamide (H-bond donor) and caprolactam (H-bond acceptor), which effectively suppresses the reactivity of water and broadens the electrochemical voltage stability window. The coordination between Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and acetamide-caprolactam in DES-based electrolytes produces a unique solvation structure that promotes the preferential growth of Zn crystals along the (002) plane. This will inhibit the formation of Zn dendrites and ensure the uniform deposition of Zn-ions on the anode surface. In addition, it is found that this DES-based electrolyte can form a protective membrane on the anode surface, reducing the risks of Zn corrosion. Compared to conventional electrolytes, the DES-based electrolyte shows a long-term stable plating/stripping performance with a significantly improved Coulombic efficiency from 78.18% to 98.37%. It is further demonstrated that a Zn||VS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full-cell with the DES-based electrolyte exhibits enhanced stability after 500 cycles with 85.4% capacity retention at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantitative Description of Metal Center Organization and Interactions in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancing the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts requires reliable tools for discerning distinct metal center arrangements. This study leverages state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art microscopy, machine learning, and simulations to gain insights into the organization and interactions of metal centers and coordination sites in nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons. The findings highlight the impact of density&#8208; and support&#8208;mediated repulsive interactions in shaping spatial configurations and forming low&#8208;nuclearity species.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;high&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts (UHD&#8208;SACs) present unique opportunities for harnessing cooperative effects between neighboring metal centers. However, the lack of tools to establish correlations between the density, types, and arrangements of isolated metal atoms and&#160;the support surface properties hinders efforts to engineer advanced material architectures. Here, this work precisely describes the metal center organization in various mono&#8208; and multimetallic UHD&#8209;SACs based on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) supports by coupling transmission electron microscopy with tailored machine&#8208;learning methods (released as a user&#8208;friendly web app) and density functional theory simulations. This approach quantifies the non&#8208;negligible presence of multimers with increasing atom density, characterizes the size and shape of these low&#8209;nuclearity clusters, and identifies surface atom density criteria to ensure isolation. Further, it provides previously inaccessible experimental insights into coordination site arrangements in the NC host, uncovering a repulsive interaction that influences the disordered distribution of metal centers in UHD&#8208;SACs. This observation holds in multimetallic systems, where chemically&#8208;specific analysis quantifies the degree of intermixing. These fundamental insights into the materials chemistry of single&#8208;atom catalysts are crucial for designing catalytic systems with superior reactivity.

         <title>Diffusible Capping Layer Enabled Homogeneous Crystallization and Component Distribution of Hybrid Sequential Deposited Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, &#8220;diffusible perovskite capping layer&#8221; strategy is proposed to solve the dilemma of uneven crystallization faced by thermal evaporation and spin&#8208;coating hybrid sequential deposited perovskite, which is by far the most promising way to obtain high efficiency of commercially textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Nowadays, the development of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite by thermal evaporation and spin&#8208;coating hybrid sequential deposition (HSD) method has special meaning on textured perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, the common issues of insufficient reaction caused by blocking of perovskite capping layer are exacerbated in HSD, because evaporated precursors are usually denser with higher crystallinity and the widely used additive&#8208;assisted microstructure is also difficult to access. Here, a facile &#8220;diffusible perovskite capping layer&#8221; (DPCL) strategy to solve this dilemma is presented. With DPCL, crystallization alleviation of perovskite and more diffusion channels of organic salts can be realized simultaneously, contributing to a homogenization process. The resultant perovskite films exhibit complete conversion, uniform crystallization, enhanced quality, and reduced defect, leading to obvious improvements in device efficiency, repeatability, and stability. This work offers a way to promote the development of textured tandems a step further.

Cancer Therapy
In article number 2307817, Junjie Yan, Min Yang, Zhen Gu, and co&#8208;workers discover that the intrinsic anticancer bioactivity of liquid metal nanodroplets (&lt;30 nm) can be activated via the galvanic replacement reaction with endogenous Cu2+ ions. This chemotherapy strategy, which leverages endogenous nutrients and features tumor&#8208;selective carrier&#8208;to&#8208;drug conversion, dual anticancer pathways of Ga3+ release and Cu2+ depletion along with abundant reactive oxygen species generation, provides a new tool for synthesizing drugs in biological environments.

In article number 2303196, Twan Lammers, Horst Fischer, Fabian Kiessling, and co&#8208;workers establish mesoscopic 3D vascularized tumors in perfusable bioreactors to mimic the onset of metastasis in vitro. The &#8220;High Tide&#8221; cover art exemplifies how a tumor spheroid triggers bioprinted endothelium's angiogenesis, akin to the moon's effect on the sea, resulting in high tides.

Bismuth Oxides
In article number 2306205, Eric D. Wachsman, Kang Taek Lee, and co&#8208;workers report outstandingly conductive and stable bismuth oxides through a rational triple&#8208;doping strategy. The developed bismuth oxides show &#8776;140 times higher conductivity than YSZ for 1000 h at 600 &#176;C. Designed low&#8208;temperature solid oxide electrochemical cells, utilizing the bismuth oxides, exhibit exceptional performances in both fuel cell (2.02 W cm&#8722;2) and electrolysis modes (0.95 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3 V) at 600 &#176;C.

         <title>Boosting the Viable Water Harvesting in Solar Vapor Generation: From Interfacial Engineering to Devices Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial solar vapor generation (SVG) exhibits considerable potential to mitigate the global freshwater crisis for water and energy sustainability. Here, interfacial engineering of solar evaporators and devices design principles of SVG capable of efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion, along with high&#8208;yielding liquid clean water is reviewed. The challenges and future opportunities are also discussed for fostering SVG economic and commercial applications.








Abstract
Continuously increasing demand for the life&#8208;critical water resource induces severe global water shortages. It is imperative to advance effective, economic, and environmentally sustainable strategies to augment clean water supply. The present work reviews recent reports on the interfacial engineering to devices design of solar vapor generation (SVG) system for boosting the viability of drinkable water harvesting. Particular emphasis is placed on the basic principles associated with the interfacial engineering of solar evaporators capable of efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion and resulting freshwater vapor via eliminating pollutants from quality&#8208;impaired water sources. The critical configurations manufacturing of the devices for fast condensation is then highlighted to harvest potable liquid water. Fundamental and practical challenges, along with prospects for the targeted materials architecture and devices modifications of SVG system are also outlined, aiming to provide future directions and inspiring critical research efforts in this emerging and exciting field.

         <title>The Emerging Landscape for Combating Resistance Associated with Energy&#8208;Based Therapies via Nanomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy&#8208;based therapies (ET) based on athermal and thermal ablation provide distinct advantages for cancer therapy, but the therapeutic efficiency is generally limited by the emergence of ET&#8208;associated resistance (ETR). The underlying mechanisms of ETR and representative applications of nanoplatforms applied in mitigating ETR are highlighted in this comprehensive review, aiming to facilitate future clinical translation.








Abstract
Cancer represents a serious disease with significant implications for public health, imposing substantial economic burden and negative societal consequences. Compared to conventional cancer treatments, such as surgery and chemotherapy, energy&#8208;based therapies (ET) based on athermal and thermal ablation provide distinct advantages, including minimally invasive procedures and rapid postoperative recovery. Nevertheless, due to the complex pathophysiology of many solid tumors, the therapeutic effectiveness of ET is often limited. Nanotechnology offers unique opportunities by enabling facile material designs, tunable physicochemical properties, and excellent biocompatibility, thereby further augmenting the outcomes of ET. Numerous nanomaterials have demonstrated the ability to overcome intrinsic therapeutic resistance associated with ET, leading to improved antitumor responses. This comprehensive review systematically summarizes the underlying mechanisms of ET&#8208;associated resistance (ETR) and highlights representative applications of nanoplatforms used to mitigate ETR. Overall, this review emphasizes the recent advances in the field and presents a detailed account of novel nanomaterial designs in combating ETR, along with efforts aimed at facilitating their clinical translation.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing organic transistor to construct healthcare monitoring sensors has been an active field in the last decades. Functionalization on the surface or interfaces of device is of vital importance for achieving highly sensitive and selective sensing performance. This review highlights surface/interface modification strategy and the enhanced sensing performance of three types of organic transistors toward several typical sensors.








Abstract
Organic transistors possess inherent advantages such as flexibility, biocompatibility, customizable chemical structures, solution&#8208;processability, and amplifying capabilities, making them highly promising for portable healthcare sensor applications. Through convenient and diverse modifications at the material and device surfaces or interfaces, organic transistors allow for a wide range of sensor applications spanning from chemical and biological to physical sensing. In this comprehensive review, the surface and interface engineering aspect associated with four types of typical healthcare sensors is focused. The device operation principles and sensing mechanisms are systematically analyzed and highlighted, and particularly surface/interface functionalization strategies that contribute to the enhancement of sensing performance are focused. An outlook and perspective on the critical issues and challenges in the field of healthcare sensing using organic transistors are provided as well.

         <title>Multienzymatic Cascades and Nanomaterial Scaffolding&#8212;A Potential Way Forward for the Efficient Biosynthesis of Novel Chemical Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on multienzyme cascades for the biosynthesis of novel compounds and how nanomaterials can potentially improve their efficiency. Recent successes in applying biosynthetic strategies for multi&#8208;step, one&#8208;pot reactions toward novel products of interest are highlighted. Then strategies that look toward exploiting bio/nanomaterials for accessing channeling and other nanoscale phenomena in vitro to improve overall catalytic efficiency are discussed.








Abstract
Synthetic biology is touted as the next industrial revolution as it promises access to greener biocatalytic syntheses to replace many industrial organic chemistries. Here, it is shown to what synthetic biology can offer in the form of multienzyme cascades for the synthesis of the most basic of new materials&#8212;chemicals, including especially designer chemical products and their analogs. Since achieving this is predicated on dramatically expanding the chemical space that enzymes access, such chemistry will probably be undertaken in cell&#8208;free or minimalist formats to overcome the inherent toxicity of non&#8208;natural substrates to living cells. Laying out relevant aspects that need to be considered in the design of multi&#8208;enzymatic cascades for these purposes is begun. Representative multienzymatic cascades are critically reviewed, which have been specifically developed for the synthesis of compounds that have either been made only by traditional organic synthesis along with those cascades utilized for novel compound syntheses. Lastly, an overview of strategies that look toward exploiting bio/nanomaterials for accessing channeling and other nanoscale materials phenomena in vitro to direct novel enzymatic biosynthesis and improve catalytic efficiency is provided. Finally, a perspective on what is needed for this field to develop in the short and long term is presented.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Growth Factor Delivery Platforms: Strategies and Recent Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the progress of hydrogel&#8208;based growth factor delivery systems for biomedical applications and the strategies utilized for growth factor delivery optimization is presented, with an emphasis on the ways the hydrogels facilitate the delivery and improve the therapeutic efficacy of growth factors. The current limitations and future research directions in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
Growth factors play a crucial role in regulating a broad variety of biological processes and are regarded as powerful therapeutic agents in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine in the past decades. However, their application is limited by their short half&#8208;lives and potential side effects in physiological environments. Hydrogels are identified as having the promising potential to prolong the half&#8208;lives of growth factors and mitigate their adverse effects by restricting them within the matrix to reduce their rapid proteolysis, burst release, and unwanted diffusion. This review discusses recent progress in the development of growth factor&#8208;containing hydrogels for various biomedical applications, including wound healing, brain tissue repair, cartilage and bone regeneration, and spinal cord injury repair. In addition, the review introduces strategies for optimizing growth factor release including affinity&#8208;based delivery, carrier&#8208;assisted delivery, stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery, spatial structure&#8208;based delivery, and cellular system&#8208;based delivery. Finally, the review presents current limitations and future research directions for growth factor&#8208;delivering hydrogels.

Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals by renewable electric energy is one of the important strategies to address global energy shortage and carbon emission. Though the classical H&#8208;type electrolytic cell can quickly screen high&#8208;efficiency catalysts, the low current density and limited CO2 mass transfer process essentially impede its industrial applications. The electrolytic cells based on electrolyte flow system (flow cells) have shown great potential for industrial devices, due to higher current density, improved local CO2 concentration, and better mass transfer efficiency. The design and optimization of flow cells are of great significance to further accelerate the industrialization of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this review, the progress of flow cells for CO2RR to C2+ products is concerned. Firstly, the main events in the development of the flow cells for CO2RR are outlined. Second, the main design principles of CO2RR to C2+ products, the architectures, and types of flow cells are summarized. Third, the main strategies for optimizing flow cells to generate C2+ products are reviewed in detail, including cathode, anode, ion exchange membrane, and electrolyte. Finally, the preliminary attempts, challenges, and the research prospects of flow cells for industrial CO2RR toward C2+ products are discussed.

         <title>Characterization, Structure, and Reactivity of Hydroxyl Groups on Metal&#8208;Oxide Cluster Nodes of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks: Structural Diversity and Keys to Reactivity and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many metal&#8211;organic frameworks consist of nodes such as Zr6O8 connected by organic linkers. Hydroxyl groups are present in various forms on the nodes, characterized by infrared and NMR spectroscopies. They have contrasting reactivities, and many play central roles in catalysis, with terminal hydroxyl groups being among the most reactive.








Abstract
Among the most stable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are those incorporating nodes that are metal oxide clusters with frames such as Zr6O8. This review is a summary of the structure, bonding, and reactivity of MOF node hydroxyl groups, emphasizing those bonded to nodes containing aluminum and zirconium ions. Hydroxyl groups are often present on these nodes, sometimes balancing the charges of the metal ions. They arise during MOF syntheses in aqueous media or in post&#8208;synthesis treatments. They are identified with infrared and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and characterized by their reactivities with polar compounds such as alcohols. Terminal OH, paired&#160;&#181;2&#8208;OH, and aqua groups&#160;on nodes are catalytic sites in numerous reactions. Relatively unreactive hydroxyl groups (such as isolated&#160;&#181;2&#8208;OH groups) may replace reactive groups and inhibit catalysis; some node hydroxyl groups (e.g.,&#160;&#181;3&#8208;OH) are mere spectators in catalysis. There are similarities between MOF node hydroxyl groups and those on the surfaces of bulk metal oxides, zeolites, and enzymes, but the comparisons are mostly inexact, and much remains to be understood about MOF node hydroxyl group chemistry. It is posited that understanding and controlling this chemistry will lead to tailored MOFs and improved adsorbents and catalysts.

         <title>Advancements in Achieving High Reversibility of Zinc Anode for Alkaline Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 5, February 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The poor reversibility of zinc anodes hampers the development of rechargeable alkaline zinc&#8208;based batteries due to dendrite formation, passivation, corrosion, and hydrogen evolution. In this review, optimization strategies including 3D structures, protective layers, alloying, additives, separators, and charge protocols, are suggested and summarized to overcome the challenges associated with Zn anodes and fully unlock their potential in alkaline zinc&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable alkaline zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBBs) have attracted extensive research attention due to their advantages of low cost, high specific energy, and high safety. Although the investigation of cathodes for alkaline secondary ZBBs has reached a relatively advanced stage, the exploration of zinc anodes is still in its infancy. Zinc anodes in alkaline electrolytes encounter challenges such as dendrite formation, passivation, corrosion during periods of cell inactivity, and hydrogen evolution during cycling, thereby limiting their rechargeability and storability. Drawing upon the latest research on zinc anodes,&#160;six fundamental strategies that encompass a wide range of aspects are identified and categorized, from electrode modifications and electrolytes to charge protocols. Specifically, these strategies include 3D structures, coatings, alloying, additives, separators, and charge protocols. They serve as an insight summary of the current research progress on zinc anodes. Additionally, the complementary nature of these strategies allows for flexible combinations, enabling further enhancement of the overall performance of zinc anodes. Finally, several future directions for the advancement of practical alkaline Zn anode are proposed. This comprehensive review not only consolidates the existing knowledge but also paves the way for broader research opportunities in the pursuit of high&#8208;performance alkaline zinc anodes.
