         <title>Quicker and More Zn2+ Storage Predominantly from the Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificially constructed VOx sub&#8208;nanometer clusters/rGO composite composed of heterogeneous V&#63743;O&#63743;C bonds is used as zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode, in which Zn2+ storage predominantly originates from the interface while electron conduction occurs on the rGO. Such interface&#8208;dominated storage enables an ultrahigh rate capability (174.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1) and a high capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are highly desirable for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their low cost and high&#8208;level safety. However, achieving high energy and high power densities simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a VOx sub&#8208;nanometer cluster/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) cathode material composed of interfacial V&#63743;O&#63743;C bonds is artificially constructed. Therein, a new mechanism is revealed, where Zn2+ ions are predominantly stored at the interface between VOx and rGO, which causes anomalous valence changes compared to conventional mechanisms and exploits the storage ability of non&#8208;energy&#8208;storing active yet highly conductive rGO. Further, this interface&#8208;dominated storage triggers decoupled transport of electrons/Zn2+ ions, and the reversible destruction/reconstruction allows the interface to store more ions than the bulk. Finally, an ultrahigh rate capability (174.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1, i.e., capacity retention of 39.4% for a 1000&#8208;fold increase in current density) and a high capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1, exceeding the theoretical capacities of each interfacial component) are achieved. Such interface&#8208;dominated storage is an exciting way to build high&#8208;energy&#8208; and high&#8208;power&#8208;density devices.

         <title>Efficient and Tunable Reflection of Phonon Polaritons at Built&#8208;In Intercalation Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The embedded intercalation nanostructures are constructed in polaritonic &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flakes, serving as efficient and tunable reflectors for phonon polaritons. Reflected phonon polaritons with low losses exhibit propagation&#8208;dependent reflection phase shifts and propagation&#8208;independent reflectance. Both experiment and simulation results confirm that this nontrivial reflection stems from the permittivity discontinuity at the built&#8208;in interfaces, offering potential electrical tunability.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to lattice vibrations&#8212;in polar van der Waals crystals offer unprecedented opportunities for controlling light at the nanoscale due to their anisotropic and ultralow&#8208;loss propagation. While their analog plasmon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to electron oscillations&#8212;have long been studied and exhibit interesting reflections at geometrical edges and electronic boundaries, whether phonon polaritons can be reflected by such barriers has been elusive. Here, the effective and tunable reflection of phonon polaritons at embedded interfaces formed in hydrogen&#8208;intercalated &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flakes is elaborated upon. Without breaking geometrical continuity, such intercalation interfaces can reflect phonon polaritons with low losses, yielding the distinct phase changes of &#8722;0.8&#960; and &#8722;0.3&#960; associated with polariton propagation, high efficiency of 50%, and potential electrical tunability. The results point to a new approach to construct on&#8208;demand polariton reflectors, phase modulators, and retarders, which may be transplanted into building future polaritonic circuits using van der Waals crystals.

         <title>Mechanically Robust and UV&#8208;Curable Shape&#8208;Memory Polymers for Digital Light Processing Based 4D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically robust and UV&#8208;curable shape&#8208;memory polymer (SMP) system can be stretched by to 1240% of its original length and is compatible with Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based high&#8208;resolution 3D printing technology (up to 2&#160;&#181;m). The high deformability and fatigue resistance (more than 10&#160;000 cycles loading&#8211;unloading) make the SMP an ideal 4D printing material for engineering applications.








Abstract
4D printing is an emerging fabrication technology that enables 3D printed structures to change configuration over &#8220;time&#8221; in response to an environmental stimulus. Compared with other soft active materials used for 4D printing, shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) have higher stiffness, and are compatible with various 3D printing technologies. Among them, ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;curable SMPs are compatible with Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based 3D printing to fabricate SMP&#8208;based structures with complex geometry and high&#8208;resolution. However, UV&#8208;curable SMPs have limitations in terms of mechanical performance, which significantly constrains their application ranges. Here, a mechanically robust and UV&#8208;curable SMP system is reported, which is highly deformable, fatigue resistant, and compatible with DLP&#8208;based 3D printing, to fabricate high&#8208;resolution (up to 2&#160;&#181;m), highly complex 3D structures that exhibit large shape change (up to 1240%) upon heating. More importantly, the developed SMP system exhibits excellent fatigue resistance and can be repeatedly loaded more than 10&#160;000 times. The development of the mechanically robust and UV&#8208;curable SMPs significantly improves the mechanical performance of the SMP&#8208;based 4D printing structures, which allows them to be applied to engineering applications such as aerospace, smart furniture, and soft robots.

         <title>Biomimetic Dendrimer&#8211;Peptide Conjugates for Early Multi&#8208;Target Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease by Inflammatory Microenvironment Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;target nanoconjugate is developed to target the Alzheimer's disease microenvironment in the early stage. Synergistic therapeutic effects are achieved by scavenging reactive oxygen species, restoring cellular antioxidant capacity, polarizing microglia phenotype, inhibiting formation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid plaques, and recovering immunologic function based on the functional polymers and nuclear factor (erythroid&#8208;derived 2)&#8208;like 2 activating peptide. Cognitive functions are enhanced in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 model transgenic mice after treatment.








Abstract
Current therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments mainly focus on &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) targeting. However, such therapeutic strategies have limited clinical outcomes due to the chronic and irreversible impairment of the nervous system in the late stage of AD. Recently, inflammatory responses, manifested in oxidative stress and glial cell activation, have been reported as hallmarks in the early stages of AD. Based on the crosstalk between inflammatory response and brain cells, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive dendrimer&#8211;peptide conjugate (APBP) is devised to target the AD microenvironment and inhibit inflammatory responses at an early stage. With the modification of the targeting peptide, this nanoconjugate can efficiently deliver peptides to the infected regions and restore the antioxidant ability of neurons by activating the nuclear factor (erythroid&#8208;derived 2)&#8208;like 2 signaling pathway. Moreover, this multi&#8208;target strategy exhibits a synergistic function of ROS scavenging, promoting A&#946; phagocytosis, and normalizing the glial cell phenotype. As a result, the nanoconjugate can reduce ROS level, decrease A&#946; burden, alleviate glial cell activation, and eventually enhance cognitive functions in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 model mice. These results indicate that APBP can be a promising candidate for the multi&#8208;target treatment of AD.

         <title>Dense All&#8208;Electrochem&#8208;Active Electrodes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of cathodes with superior ionic/electronic conductivities is demonstrated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries. No carbon and electrolyte additives are needed in such an &#8220;all&#8208;electrochem&#8208;active&#8221; (AEA) cathode so the space and mass of the electrode are fully utilized and high mass/volume energy density are obtained.








Abstract
The energy density presents the core competitiveness of lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries. In conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries, the utilization of the gravimetric/volumetric energy density at the electrode level is unsatisfactory (&lt;84 wt% and &lt;62 vol%,&#160;respectively)&#160;due to the existence of non&#8208;electrochemical active parts among the 3D porous electrodes, including electrolytes, binders, and carbon additives. These are regarded as indispensable and irreducible components of the electronic and ionic transport network. Here, a dense &#8220;all&#8208;electrochem&#8208;active&#8221; (AEA) electrode for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries is proposed, which is entirely constructed from a family of superior mixed electronic&#8211;ionic&#8208;conducting cathodes, to minimize the energy density gap between the accessible and theoretical energy density at the electrode level. Furthermore, with the ionic&#8211;electronic&#8208;conductive network self&#8208;supported from the AEA cathode, the dense hybrid sulfur (S)&#8208;based AEA electrode exhibits a high compacted filling rate of 91.8%, which indicates a high energy density of 777 W h kg&#8722;1 and 1945 W h L&#8722;1 at the electrode level based on the total cathodes and anodes when at 70 &#176;C.

         <title>Boosting Selective Nitrogen Reduction via Geometric Coordination Engineering on Single&#8208;Tungsten&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of W single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with N and O dual&#8208;coordination (W&#8208;oxygen and nitrogen coordination NO/NC) is prepared to achieve excellent electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) performance. The unique electronic structures optimize the binding energy of NRR intermediate, resulting in facilitating the selectivity and activity of NRR. This opens an avenue toward exploring the correlation between coordination structure and properties.








Abstract
Atomic interface regulation that can efficiently optimize the performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is a worthwhile research topic. The challenge lies in deeply understanding the structure&#8211;properties correlation based on control of the coordination chemistry of individual atoms. Herein, a new kind of W SACs with oxygen and nitrogen coordination (W&#8208;NO/NC) and a high metal loading over 10 wt% is facilely prepared by introducing an oxygen&#8208;bridged [WO4] tetrahedron. The local structure and coordination environment of the W SACs are confirmed by high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. The catalyst shows excellent selectivity and activity for the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Density functional theory calculation reveals that unique electronic structures of the N and O dual&#8208;coordinated W sites optimize the binding energy of the NRR intermediate, resulting in facilitating the electrocatalytic NRR. This work opens an avenue toward exploring the correlation between coordination structure and properties.

         <title>Modulation of Negative Differential Resistance in Black Phosphorus Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of room&#8208;temperature negative differential resistance (NDR) is demonstrated in 2D ambipolar semiconductor transistors. The NDR device, which is activated by specific electrical field dependence of lateral carrier distribution and occurs in the transistor saturation regime, exhibits a high current peak and superior gate and light tunability, opening new avenues for designing future electronics devices.








Abstract
Negative differential resistance (NDR), which describes the current decrease as the applied bias increases, holds great potential for varieties of electronic applications including radio&#8208;frequency oscillators, multipliers, and multivalue logics. Here, the modulation of a unique NDR effect in ambipolar black phosphorus (BP) transistors is reported, which is activated by specific electrical field dependence of lateral carrier distribution and is distinct from conventional NDR devices that rely on quantum tunneling. The NDR device exhibits a high peak current density (34 &#181;A &#181;m&#8722;1) and a high operating temperature. More importantly, due to the strong coupling between the channel and the gate electrode, both the NDR peak current and peak/valley voltages can be effectively modulated by the electrostatic gate. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that light can serve as an additional terminal for NDR modulation. The findings could provide an important insight into the transport behavior of BP transistors and contribute to the design of ambipolar&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based electrical circuits.

         <title>Superconducting Quantum Metamaterials from Convergence of Soft and Hard Condensed Matter Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting mesostructured niobium carbonitrides with different morphologies are prepared from a single block copolymer via self&#8208;assembly using a variety of new synthetic routes. Superconducting transition temperatures are comparable to bulk analogues but vary with mesostructure, a typical fingerprint of metamaterials, while some materials exhibit atypical flux avalanches. The results suggest a fruitful convergence of soft and hard condensed matter science.








Abstract
Superconducting quantum metamaterials are expected to exhibit a variety of novel properties, but have been a major challenge to prepare as a result of the lack of appropriate synthetic routes to high&#8208;quality materials. Here, the discovery of synthesis routes to block copolymer (BCP) self&#8208;assembly&#8208;directed niobium nitrides and carbonitrides is described. The resulting materials exhibit unusual structure retention even at temperatures as high as 1000 &#176;C and resulting critical temperature, Tc, values comparable to their bulk analogues. Applying the concepts of soft matter self&#8208;assembly, it is demonstrated that a series of four different BCP&#8208;directed mesostructured superconductors are accessible from a single triblock terpolymer. Resulting materials display a mesostructure&#8208;dependent Tc without substantial variation of the XRD&#8208;measured lattice parameters. Finally, field&#8208;dependent magnetization measurements of a sample with double&#8208;gyroid morphology show abrupt jumps comparable in overall behavior to flux avalanches. Results suggest a fruitful convergence of soft and hard condensed matter science.

         <title>10 &#956;m&#8208;Thick High&#8208;Strength Solid Polymer Electrolytes with Excellent Interface Compatibility for Flexible All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
10 &#956;m&#8208;thick high&#8208;strength solid polymer electrolytes with an ultrahigh room&#8208;temperature ionic conductance of 34.84&#160;mS are presented. They possess excellent interfacial stability with a lithium anode. The derived flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries, employing LiFePO4 or LiCoO2 as cathode materials, exhibit excellent cycling stability as well as high rate capability.








Abstract
An ultrathin solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) consisting of modified polyethylene (PE) as the host and poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether acrylate and lithium salts as fillers is presented. The porous poly(methyl methacrylate)&#8211;polystyrene interface layers closely attached on both sides of the PE effectively improve the interface compatibility among electrolytes and electrodes. The resultant 10 &#956;m&#8208;thick SPEs possess an ultrahigh ionic conductance of 34.84&#160;mS at room temperature and excellent mechanical properties of 103.0&#160;MPa with elongation up to 142.3%. The Li//Li symmetric cell employing an optimized solid electrolyte can stably cycle more than 1500&#160;h at 60&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the LiFePO4//Li pouch cell can stably cycle over 1000 cycles at 1&#160;C rate and with a capacity retention of 76.4% from 148.9 to 113.7&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 60&#160;&#176;C. The LiCoO2//Li pouch cell can stably operate at 0.1 and 0.2&#160;C rate for each 100 cycles. Furthermore, the LiFePO4//Li pouch cell can work stably after curling and folding, which proves its excellent flexibility and safety simultaneously. This work offers a promising strategy to realize ultrathinness, excellent compatibility, high strength, as well as safe solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Dose&#8208;Independent Transfection of Hydrophobized Polyplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike viral vectors that are capable of individual transfection, dynamically complexed cationic polymers/DNA nanoparticles (i.e., polyplexes) dissociate and thus lose transfection ability at reduced concentrations, causing in vivo transfection inefficiency once systemically administered. Optimizing the polymer hydrophobicity is shown to integrate the polyplexes upon dilution and enter cells via macropinocytosis, leading to virus&#8208;mimicking dose&#8208;independent DNA transfection.








Abstract
Cationic polymers dynamically complex DNA into complexes (polyplexes). So, upon dilution, polyplexes easily dissociate and lose transfection ability, limiting their in vivo systemic gene delivery. Herein, it is found that polyplex's stability and endocytosis pathway determine its transfection dose&#8208;dependence. The polyplexes of hydrophilic polycations have dose&#8208;dependent integrity and lysosome&#8208;trafficking endocytosis; at low doses, most of these polyplexes dissociate, and the remaining few are internalized and trapped in lysosomes, abolishing their transfection ability. In contrast, the polyplexes of the polycations with optimal hydrophobicity remain integrated even at low concentrations and enter cells via macropinocytosis directly into the cytosol evading lysosomes, so each polyplex can accomplish its infection process, leading to dose&#8208;independent DNA transfection like viral vectors. Furthermore, the tuned hydrophobicity balancing the affinity of anionic poly(&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid) (&#947;&#8208;PGA) to the polyplex surface enables &#947;&#8208;PGA to stick on the polyplex surface as a shielding layer but peel off on the cell membrane to release the naked polyplexes for dose&#8208;independent transfection. These findings may provide guidelines for developing polyplexes that mimick a viral vector's dose&#8208;independent transfection for effective in vivo gene delivery.

         <title>Fully 3D Printed and Disposable Paper Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully 3D printed and disposable paper supercapacitors are designed from the bottom up by a combination of nanocellulose, biopolymers, and carbon nanomaterials leading to monolithic integrated devices with excellent electrochemical properties. The results combining digital material assembly, high performance, and nontoxicity have the potential to move the field of sustainable electronics forward.








Abstract
With the development of the internet&#8208;of&#8208;things for applications such as wearables and packaging, a new class of electronics is emerging, characterized by the sheer number of forecast units and their short service&#8208;life. Projected to reach 27 billion units in 2021, connected devices are generating an exponentially increasing amount of electronic waste (e&#8208;waste). Fueled by the growing e&#8208;waste problem, the field of sustainable electronics is attracting significant interest. Today, standard energy&#8208;storage technologies such as lithium&#8208;ion or alkaline batteries still power most of smart devices. While they provide good performance, the nonrenewable and toxic materials require dedicated collection and recycling processes. Moreover, their standardized form factor and performance specifications limit the designs of smart devices. Here, exclusively disposable materials are used to fully print nontoxic supercapacitors maintaining a high capacitance of 25.6 F&#160;g&#8722;1 active material at an operating voltage up to 1.2 V. The presented combination of digital material assembly, stable high&#8208;performance operation, and nontoxicity has the potential to open new avenues within sustainable electronics and applications such as environmental sensing, e&#8208;textiles, and healthcare.

         <title>Expansion Microscopy with Multifunctional Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of engineered multifunctional polymer dots enabling biomolecular targeting, gel anchoring, and high&#8208;fidelity fluorescence is reported for expansion microcopy. The average brightness values of the polymer dots range from 3 to 6 times higher than those of commercial dyes. By combining sample expansion with super&#8208;resolution imaging, subcellular structures of &#8776;30&#160;nm can be resolved using conventional microscopes.








Abstract
Expansion microscopy (ExM) provides nanoscale resolution on conventional microscopes via physically enlarging specimens with swellable polyelectrolyte gels. However, challenges involving fluorophore degradation and dilution during sample expansion have yet to be overcome. Herein, sequential cellular targeting, gel anchoring, and high&#8208;fidelity fluorescence reported using multifunctional polymer dots (Pdots) designed for ExM applications are demonstrated. The impressive brightness of the Pdots facilitates multicolor ExM, thereby enabling visualization of a variety of subcellular structures and neuron synapses. The average fluorescence intensities of Pdots in ExM range from &#8776;3 to 6 times higher than those achieved using commercially available Alexa dyes. Moreover, the fluorescence brightness and optical fluctuation are significantly improved by a surfactant&#8208;containing expansion buffer, which enables further resolution enhancement via super&#8208;resolution optical fluctuation imaging (SOFI). The combination of ExM and SOFI allows subcellular structures of &#8776;30&#160;nm to be resolved by conventional microscopes. These results highlight the immense potential of multifunctional Pdots for ExM&#8208;enhanced super&#8208;resolution imaging.

         <title>Broadband Detection of X&#8208;ray, Ultraviolet, and Near&#8208;Infrared Photons using Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite&#8211;Lanthanide Nanotransducers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for broadband photodetection of X&#8208;ray, ultraviolet, and near&#8208;infrared photons is proposed. A class of lanthanide&#8211;perovskite nanocrystals is developed by in situ crystallization of perovskite nanocrystals on the surface of mSiO2&#8208;coated lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanocrystals. Such nanotransducers are further used to implement flexible X&#8208;ray imaging with a spatial resolution up to 20 lp mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal&#8208;halide perovskites hold great promise in developing next&#8208;generation low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance photodetectors. However, the weak absorption of perovskites beyond the near&#8208;infrared spectral region posts a stringent limitation on their use for broadband photodetectors. Here, the rational design and synthesis of an upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8211;perovskite nanotransducer are presented, namely UCNPs@mSiO2@MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, or I), for broadband photon detection spanning from X&#8208;rays, UV, to NIR. It is demonstrated that, by in situ crystallization and deliberately tuning the material composition in the lanthanide core and perovskites, the nanotransducers allow for a high stability and show a wide linear response to X&#8208;rays of various dose rates, as well as UV/NIR photons of various power densities. The findings provide an opportunity to explore the next&#8208;generation broadband photodetectors in the field of high&#8208;quality imaging and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Correlated Magnetic Weyl Semimetal State in Strained Pr2Ir2O7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel correlated magnetic Weyl semimetal state with logarithmic renormalization is experimentally realized in the high&#8208;quality strained film of Pr2Ir2O7. Strain&#8208;induced all&#8208;in&#8211;all&#8208;out antiferromagnetic ordering breaks time&#8208;reversal symmetry and leads to the magnetic Weyl semimetal state. Combing the experimental results and renormalization group calculations, an interacting Weyl semimetal state with logarithmic Fermi velocity renormalization is reported, dressed by long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions.








Abstract
Correlated topological phases (CTPs) with interplay between topology and electronic correlations have attracted tremendous interest in condensed matter physics. Therein, correlated Weyl semimetals (WSMs) are rare in nature and, thus, have so far been less investigated experimentally. In particular, the experimental realization of the interacting WSM state with logarithmic Fermi velocity renormalization has not been achieved yet. Here, experimental evidence of a correlated magnetic WSM state with logarithmic renormalization in strained pyrochlore iridate Pr2Ir2O7 (PIO) which is a paramagnetic Luttinger semimetal in bulk, is reported. Benefitting from epitaxial strain, &#8220;bulk&#8208;absent&#8221; all&#8208;in&#8211;all&#8208;out antiferromagnetic ordering can be stabilized in PIO film, which breaks time&#8208;reversal symmetry and leads to a magnetic WSM state. With further analysis of the experimental data and renormalization group calculations, an interacting Weyl liquid state with logarithmically renormalized Fermi velocity, similar to that in graphene, is found, dressed by long&#8208;range Coulomb interactions. This work highlights the interplay of strain, magnetism, and topology with electronic correlations, and paves the way for strain&#8208;engineering of CTPs in pyrochlore iridates.

         <title>Divergent Paths, Same Goal: A Pair&#8208;Electrosynthesis Tactic for Cost&#8208;Efficient and Exclusive Formate Production by Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Derived 2D Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair&#8208;electrosynthesis tactic for concurrent formate production is pioneeringly developed by coupling electrocatalytic methanol oxidation and CO2 reduction reactions, which can achieve highly efficient and selective value&#8208;added synthesis in both electrodes with lower energy consumption, using in situ metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived high&#8208;performance 2D electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of formic acid/formate is a promising alternative protocol to industrial processes. Herein, a pioneering pair&#8208;electrosynthesis tactic is reported for exclusively producing formate via coupling selectively electrocatalytic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), in which the electrode derived from Ni&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF) nanosheet arrays (Ni&#8208;NF&#8208;Af), as well as the Bi&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived ultrathin bismuthenes (Bi&#8208;enes), both obtained through an in situ electrochemical conversion process, are used as efficient anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, respectively, achieving concurrent yielding of the same high&#8208;value product at both electrodes with greatly reduced energy input. The as&#8208;prepared Ni&#8208;NF&#8208;Af only needs quite low potentials to reach large current densities (e.g., 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2@1.345&#160;V)&#160;with &#8776;100% selectivity for anodic methanol&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion. Meanwhile, for CO2RR in the cathode, the as&#8208;prepared Bi&#8208;enes can simultaneously exhibit near&#8208;unity selectivity, large current densities, and good stability in a wide potential window toward formate production. Consequently, the coupled MOR//CO2RR system based on the distinctive MOF&#8208;derived catalysts displays excellent performance for pair&#8208;electrosynthesis of formate, delivering high current densities and nearly 100% selectivity for formate production in both the anode and the cathode. This work provides a novel way to design advanced MOF&#8208;derived electrocatalysts and innovative electrolytic systems for electrochemical production of value&#8208;added feedstocks.

         <title>Hydroplastic Micromolding of 2D Sheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general approach to mold 2D sheet microstructured materials based on hydroplasticity is described. An innovative interlayer&#8208;spacing&#8208;induced brittle&#8211;plastic transition in 2D materials is revealed. The approach enables direct forming with high design freedom and accuracy from 2D layered solids. The molded assemblies possess tunable electrical, optical, and other functional properties.








Abstract
Processing 2D sheets into desired structures with high precision is of great importance for fabrication and application of their assemblies. Solution processing of 2D sheets from dilute dispersions is a commonly used method but offers limited control over feature size precision owing to the extreme volume shrinkage. Plastic processing from the solid state is therefore a&#160;preferable approach to achieve high precision. However, plastic processing is intrinsically hampered by strong interlayer interactions of the 2D sheet solids. Here, a hydroplastic molding method to shape layered solids of 2D sheets with micrometer&#8208;scale precision under ambient conditions is reported. The dried 2D layered solids are plasticized by intercalated solvents, affording plastic near&#8208;solid compounds that enable local plastic deformation. Such an intercalated solvent&#8208;induced hydroplasticity is found in a broad family of 2D materials, for example graphene, MoS2, and MXene. The hydroplastic molding enables fabrication of complex spatial structures (knurling, origami) and microimprinted tubular structures down to diameters of 390&#160;nm with good fidelity. The method enhances the structural accuracy and enriches the structural diversity of 2D macroassemblies, thus providing a feasible strategy to tune their electrical, optical, and other functional properties.

         <title>Covalently Crosslinked Hydrogels via Step&#8208;Growth Reactions: Crosslinking Chemistries, Polymers, and Clinical Impact</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various polymers and crosslinking chemistries are utilized for fabricating hydrogels for translational research. However, selecting appropriate crosslinking chemistries and polymers for the intended clinical application is challenging and time&#8208;consuming. The key features of crosslinking chemistries and polymers commonly used for preparing hydrogels are outlined and their performance in the context of the regulatory process and clinical translation barriers summarized.








Abstract
Hydrogels are an important class of biomaterials with the unique property of high&#8208;water content in a crosslinked polymer network. In particular, chemically crosslinked hydrogels have made a great clinical impact in past years because of their desirable mechanical properties and tunability of structural and chemical properties. Various polymers and step&#8208;growth crosslinking chemistries are harnessed for fabricating such covalently crosslinked hydrogels for translational research. However, selecting appropriate crosslinking chemistries and polymers for the intended clinical application is time&#8208;consuming and challenging. It requires the integration of polymer chemistry knowledge with thoughtful crosslinking reaction design. This task becomes even more challenging when other factors such as the biological mechanisms of the pathology, practical administration routes, and regulatory requirements add additional constraints. In this review, key features of crosslinking chemistries and polymers commonly used for preparing translatable hydrogels are outlined and their performance in biological systems is summarized. The examples of effective polymer/crosslinking chemistry combinations that have yielded clinically approved hydrogel products are specifically highlighted. These hydrogel design parameters in the context of the regulatory process and clinical translation barriers, providing a guideline for the rational selection of polymer/crosslinking chemistry combinations to construct hydrogels with high translational potential are further considered.

         <title>Adipocyte&#8208;Derived Anticancer Lipid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid droplet, an organelle in adipocytes, are engineered to be a controllable, effective, and biocompatible drug delivery system for cancer therapy. It is demonstrated that the lipid droplet can augment the therapeutic performance of encapsulated drug via several pathways, including generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, providing a promising material with clinical translation potential.








Abstract
Engineering of efficient and safe materials remains a challenge for cancer therapy. Here, the lipid droplet, an organelle in adipocytes, is demonstrated to be a controllable and biocompatible vehicle to deliver anticancer drugs. It is validated that isolated lipid droplets maintain their key physiological functions to interact with other organelles and augment the therapeutic effect of cancer photodynamic therapy by encapsulation with a lipid&#8208;conjugated photosensitizer (Pyrolipid) through a variety of pathways, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); lipid peroxidation; and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. As such, the IC50 value of Pyrolipid is reduced by 6.0&#8208;fold when loaded into the lipid droplet. Of note, in vivo results demonstrate that engineered lipid droplets induce significant inhibition of tumor growth with minimal side effects.

&lt;p&gt;Engineering of efficient and safe materials remains a challenge for cancer therapy. Here, the lipid droplet, an organelle in adipocytes, is demonstrated to be a controllable and biocompatible vehicle to deliver anticancer drugs. It is validated that isolated lipid droplets maintain their key physiological functions to interact with other organelles and augment the therapeutic effect of cancer photodynamic therapy by encapsulation with a lipid-conjugated photosensitizer (Pyrolipid) through a variety of pathways, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); lipid peroxidation; and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. As such, the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of Pyrolipid is reduced by 6.0-fold when loaded into the lipid droplet. Of note, in vivo results demonstrate that engineered lipid droplets induce significant inhibition of tumor growth with minimal side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Imaging and Controlling Photonic Modes in Perovskite Microcavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under a resonant femtosecond pulsed laser (fs&#8208;laser) excitation, the spatial pattern of the photonic modes in a CsPbBr3 microcavity is revealed by photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM), which is the strong coupling of excitons and photons in the perovskite microcavity. Mode control through light field and structure is also mapped by the PEEM technique in real space and real time.








Abstract
Perovskite microcavities have excellent photophysical properties for integrated optoelectronic devices, such as nanolasers. Imaging and controlling the photonic modes within the cavity are fundamentally important to understand and develop applications. Here, photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) is used to image the photonic modes within optical microcavities with a nanometer&#8208;scale spatial resolution. From a CsPbBr3 microcavity, hybrid mode patterns are observed. Spatial frequency spectrum analysis on the patterns uncovers the characteristic cavity modes, which are modeled with transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) waves, and assigned to exciton&#8211;polariton modes. Based on this understanding, the light focus in a designed microcavity is imaged in real space and controlled by the light field polarization. The study confirms that the cavity modes in perovskites can be effectively observed by the PEEM technique under resonant excitation, which, in turn, promotes the design of optoelectronic devices based on perovskite microcavities.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Elastomer&#8208;Actuated Reconfigurable Microscale Kirigami Metastructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable and reconfigurable metasurfaces at the microscale are achieved by using uniaxially aligned liquid crystal elastomer film as artificial muscle to thermally actuate kirigami microstructures 3D&#8208;printed via the two&#8208;photon polymerization technique. This strategy paves the way to a host of potential applications, such as tunable phononic/photonic crystals, optoelectronics, biomedical devices, camouflage, microelectromechanical systems, and soft microrobots.








Abstract
Programmable actuation of metastructures with predesigned geometrical configurations has recently drawn significant attention in many applications, such as smart structures, medical devices, soft robotics, prosthetics, and wearable devices. Despite remarkable progress in this field, achieving wireless miniaturized reconfigurable metastructures remains a challenge due to the difficult nature of the fabrication and actuation processes at the micrometer scale. Herein, microscale thermo&#8208;responsive reconfigurable metasurfaces using stimuli&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) is fabricated as an artificial muscle for reconfiguring the 2D microscale kirigami structures. Such structures are fabricated via two&#8208;photon polymerization with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. Through rationally designed experiments guided by simulations, the optimal formulation of the LCE artificial muscle is explored and the relationship between shape transformation behaviors and geometrical parameters of the kirigami structures is build. As a proof of concept demonstration, the constructs for temperature&#8208;dependent switching and information encryption is applied. Such reconfigurable kirigami metastructures have significant potential for boosting the fundamental small&#8208;scale metastructure research and the design and fabrication of wireless functional devices, wearables, and soft robots at the microscale as well.

         <title>An Oligonucleotide&#8208;Distortion&#8208;Responsive Organic Transistor for Platinum&#8208;Drug&#8208;Induced DNA&#8208;Damage Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With specific responsiveness to oligonucleotide distortion on organic semiconductor surface, the double&#8208;stranded DNA functionalized organic thin&#8208;film transistor can detect platinum&#8208;drug&#8208;induced DNA damage at single site level. The organic&#8208;transistor&#8208;based ultrasensitive DNA&#8208;damage sensor can be further integrated into arrayed biochip for high&#8208;throughput DNA&#8208;damage analysis under different environmental conditions.








Abstract
Organic transistor with DNA&#8208;damage evaluation ability can open up novel opportunities for bioelectronic devices. Even though trace amounts of drugs can cause cumulative gene damage in vivo, the extremely low occurrence proportion makes them hardly transduced into detectable electric signals. Here, an ultrasensitive DNA&#8208;damage sensor based on an oligonucleotide&#8208;distortion&#8208;responsive organic transistor (DROT) is reported by creating controllable conformation change of double&#8208;stranded DNA on the surface of organic semiconductors. In combination with interfacial charge redistribution and efficient signal amplification, the DROT provides an ultrasensitive single&#8208;site DNA&#8208;damage response with 20.5 s even upon 1 &#215; 10&#8722;12 m cisplatin. The high generalizability of this DROT to three generations of classical platinum drugs and gene&#8208;relevant DNA damage is demonstrated. A biochip is further designed for intelligent damage analysis in complex environments, which holds the potential for high&#8208;throughput biotoxicity evaluation and drug screening in the future.

         <title>Enhanced Electrochemical Kinetics with Highly Dispersed Conductive and Electrocatalytic Mediators for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchical Mo2C nanocluster/carbon nanosheets hybrid material is prepared to improve the performance of practical Li&#8211;S batteries. The ultrasmall and highly conductive Mo2C nanocrystals can effectively promote anchoring and conversion of lithium polysulfides and increase the number of the nuclei for Li2S2/Li2S precipitation. Benefitting from the synergistic effects, the electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;S batteries is greatly improved.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising energy&#8208;storage devices because of their high theoretical energy densities. However, the practical application of Li&#8211;S batteries is still impeded by the poor cycling performance and rate capability at practical conditions. In order to improve the performance of practical Li&#8211;S batteries, a hierarchical Mo2C nanocluster/carbon nanosheets hybrid based hollow spherical material (Mo2C/CHS) is designed and prepared. The hollow spheres composed of stacked carbon nanosheets can facilitate the infiltration of electrolyte. The ultrasmall and highly conductive Mo2C nanocrystals are confined in the carbon nanosheets and expose more active sites for anchoring and conversion of lithium polysulfides and increase the number of the nuclei for Li2S2/Li2S precipitation. Benefitting from the synergistic effects, Mo2C/CHS greatly promotes electrochemical kinetics in Li&#8211;S batteries with high sulfur loading (5 mg cm&#8722;2). Even under lean electrolyte conditions (E/S = 7 &#956;L mgsulfur&#8722;1), the Li&#8211;S batteries with Mo2C/CHS added exhibit a discharge capacity of 904 mAh g&#8722;1 at the high current rate of 0.5 C, and with 894 mAh g&#8722;1 maintained after 200 cycles. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the electrochemical processes and guides the rational design of host and additive materials for practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Surface Wettability of Nanoparticle Modulated Sonothrombolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface wettability modulated nanoparticles are designed to investigate the mechanism of sonodynamic therapy. The wettability of nanoparticles is related to the desorption energy between nanoparticles and nanobubbles. Higher desorption energy of the system consisted to higher stability of nanobubbles, more cavitation nuclei site, higher reactive oxygen species yield, and higher sonothrombolysis efficiency.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a non&#8208;invasive and highly penetrating treatment strategy under ultrasound irradiation. However, uncertainty in the mechanism of SDT has seriously hindered its future clinical application. Here, the mechanism of SDT enhanced by the wettability of nanoparticles is investigated. Nanoparticles can adsorb and stabilize nanobubbles in liquid, thus enhancing SDT efficiency. The stability of the nanobubbles is positively correlated with the desorption energy of the nanoparticles, which is determined by the wettability of the nanoparticles. This conclusion is verified for mesoporous silica and polystyrene nanoparticles and it is found that nanoparticles with a water contact angle of about 90&#176; possess the largest desorption energy. To further apply this conclusion, thrombus models are constructed on rats and the experimental results demonstrate that nanoparticles with the largest desorption energy have the highest thrombolytic efficiency.

     alt="Surface Wettability of Nanoparticle Modulated Sonothrombolysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface wettability modulated nanoparticles are designed to investigate the mechanism of sonodynamic therapy. The wettability of nanoparticles is related to the desorption energy between nanoparticles and nanobubbles. Higher desorption energy of the system consisted to higher stability of nanobubbles, more cavitation nuclei site, higher reactive oxygen species yield, and higher sonothrombolysis efficiency.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a non-invasive and highly penetrating treatment strategy under ultrasound irradiation. However, uncertainty in the mechanism of SDT has seriously hindered its future clinical application. Here, the mechanism of SDT enhanced by the wettability of nanoparticles is investigated. Nanoparticles can adsorb and stabilize nanobubbles in liquid, thus enhancing SDT efficiency. The stability of the nanobubbles is positively correlated with the desorption energy of the nanoparticles, which is determined by the wettability of the nanoparticles. This conclusion is verified for mesoporous silica and polystyrene nanoparticles and it is found that nanoparticles with a water contact angle of about 90&#176; possess the largest desorption energy. To further apply this conclusion, thrombus models are constructed on rats and the experimental results demonstrate that nanoparticles with the largest desorption energy have the highest thrombolytic efficiency. It is believed that these findings will help to better understand the SDT mechanism and guide new strategies for rational design of nanoparticles adopted in SDT.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Beyond Photo: Xdynamic Therapies in Fighting Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xdynamic therapies (X = sono, radio, microwave, chemo, thermo, and electro), which are non&#8208;photo&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species generation strategies, show great promise in fighting cancer. Recent advances in the development of Xdynamic therapies are summarized. The approaches to enhance treatment efficiency of Xdynamic therapy are highlighted.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related therapeutic approaches are developed as a promising modality for cancer treatment because the aberrant increase of intracellular ROS level can cause cell death due to nonspecific oxidation damage to key cellular biomolecules. However, the most widely considered strategy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), suffers from critical limitations such as limited tissue&#8208;penetration depth, high oxygen dependence, and phototoxicity. Non&#8208;photo&#8208;induced ROS generation strategies, which are defined as Xdynamic therapies (X = sono, radio, microwave, chemo, thermo, and electro), show good potential to overcome the drawbacks of PDT. Herein, recent advances in the development of Xdynamic therapies, including the design of systems, the working mechanisms, and examples of cancer therapy application, are introduced. Furthermore, the approaches to enhance treatment efficiency of Xdynamic therapy are highlighted. Finally, the perspectives and challenges of these strategies are also discussed.

         <title>Super Stretchable and Durable Electroluminescent Devices Based on Double&#8208;Network Ionogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A super stretchable electroluminescent device is successfully fabricated with double&#8208;network ionogel as a soft electrode owing to its excellent mechanical robustness and electrical conductivity. The fabricated device exhibits extremely stable light&#8208;emitting operation even at high elongation as well as demonstrating mechanical, electrical, and thermal stability, which can be applied to new types of stretchable light display and sensors.








Abstract
Ionogels are good candidates for flexible electronics owing to their excellent mechanical and electrical properties, including stretchability, high conductivity, and stability. In this study, conducting ionogels comprising a double network (DN) of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;diethylacrylamide)/chitosan which are further reinforced by the ionic and covalent crosslinking of the chitosan network by tripolyphosphate and glutaraldehyde, respectively, are prepared. Based on their excellent mechanical properties and high conductivity, the developed DN ionogels are envisioned as stretchable ionic conductors for extremely stretchable alternating&#8208;current electroluminescent (ACEL) devices. The ACEL device fabricated with the developed ionogel exhibits stable working operation under an ultrahigh elongation of over 1200% as well as severe mechanical deformations such as bending, rolling, and twisting. Furthermore, the developed ACEL devices also display stable luminescence over 1000 stretch/release cycles or at temperatures as harsh as 200 &#176;C.

         <title>Programmable Metal Nanoclusters with Atomic Precision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) in the quantum size regime are an emerging class of new materials. The progress in the synthesis and structure&#8211;function correlation is summarized using gold NCs as a paradigm system. The rich types of structures impact the electronic and optical properties. For future work, the field will move toward &#8220;programmable&#8221; control with advanced synthesis methods.








Abstract
With the recent establishment of atomically precise nanochemistry, capabilities toward programmable control over the nanoparticle size and structure are being developed. Advances in the synthesis of atomically precise nanoclusters (NCs, 1&#8211;3&#160;nm) have been made in recent years, and more importantly, their total structures (core plus ligands) have been mapped out by X&#8208;ray crystallography. These ultrasmall Au nanoparticles exhibit strong quantum&#8208;confinement effect, manifested in their optical absorption properties. With the advantage of atomic precision, gold&#8208;thiolate nanoclusters (Aun(SR)m) are revealed to contain an inner kernel, Au&#8211;S interface (motifs), and surface ligand (&#8208;R) shell. Programming the atomic packing into various crystallographic structures of the metal kernel can be achieved, which plays a significant role in determining the optical properties and the energy gap (Eg) of NCs. When the size increases, a general trend is observed for NCs with fcc or decahedral kernels, whereas those NCs with icosahedral kernels deviate from the general trend by showing comparably smaller Eg. Comparisons are also made to further demonstrate the more decisive role of the kernel structure over surface motifs based on isomeric Au NCs and NC series with evolving kernel or motif structures. Finally, future perspectives are discussed.

         <title>Transparent, Compliant 3D Mesostructures for Precise Evaluation of Mechanical Characteristics of Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D mesostructures are designed to mechanically and reversibly constrain organoids for measurements of their viscoelastic properties. Finite element analysis guides the selection of 3D layouts to grasp organoids with minimal force, without damage to the tissues. Nanoindentation applied directly to organoids gently held within these 3D structures allows for accurate and repeated measurements of force/displacement data. Changes in mechanical characteristics induced by drugs highlight responses to the chemical environment, as an application example.








Abstract
Recently developed methods for transforming 2D patterns of thin&#8208;film materials into 3D mesostructures create many interesting opportunities in microsystems design. A growing area of interest is in multifunctional thermal, electrical, chemical, and optical interfaces to biological tissues, particularly 3D multicellular, millimeter&#8208;scale constructs, such as spheroids, assembloids, and organoids. Herein, examples of 3D mechanical interfaces are presented, in which thin ribbons of parylene&#8208;C form the basis of transparent, highly compliant frameworks that can be reversibly opened and closed to capture, envelop, and mechanically restrain fragile 3D tissues in a gentle, nondestructive manner, for precise measurements of viscoelastic properties using techniques in nanoindentation. Finite element analysis serves as a design tool to guide selection of geometries and material parameters for shape&#8208;matching 3D architectures tailored to organoids of interest. These computational approaches also quantitate all aspects of deformations during the processes of opening and closing the structures and of forces imparted by them onto the surfaces of enclosed soft tissues. Studies of cerebral organoids by nanoindentation show effective Young's moduli in the range from 1.5 to 2.5 kPa depending on the age of the organoid. This collection of results suggests broad utility of compliant 3D mesostructures in noninvasive mechanical measurements of millimeter&#8208;scale, soft biological tissues.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks and Metal&#8211;Organic Gels for Oxygen Electrocatalysis: Structural and Compositional Considerations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boosting the intrinsic activity and the active&#8208;site density through rational design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal&#8211;organic gels (MOGs) as precursors represents a new approach of improving oxygen electrocatalysis efficiency. Several key compositional and structural considerations for the MOF/MOG design and new perspectives between synthesis, characterization, and performance are comprehensively discussed.








Abstract
Increasing demand for sustainable and clean energy is calling for the next&#8208;generation energy conversion and storage technologies such as fuel cells, water electrolyzers, CO2/N2 reduction electrolyzers, metal&#8211;air batteries, etc. All these electrochemical processes involve oxygen electrocatalysis. Boosting the intrinsic activity and the active&#8208;site density through rational design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal&#8211;organic gels (MOGs) as precursors represents a new approach toward improving oxygen electrocatalysis efficiency. MOFs/MOGs afford a broad selection of combinations between metal nodes and organic linkers and are known to produce electrocatalysts with high surface areas, variable porosity, and excellent activity after pyrolysis. Some recent studies on MOFs/MOGs for oxygen electrocatalysis and their new perspectives in synthesis, characterization, and performance are discussed. New insights on the structural and compositional design in MOF/MOG&#8208;derived oxygen electrocatalysts are summarized. Critical challenges and future research directions are also outlined.

&lt;p&gt;Boosting the intrinsic activity and the active-site density through rational design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal&#8211;organic gels (MOGs) as precursors represents a new approach of improving oxygen electrocatalysis efficiency. Several key compositional and structural considerations for the MOF/MOG design and new perspectives between synthesis, characterization, and performance are comprehensively discussed.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing demand for sustainable and clean energy is calling for the next-generation energy conversion and storage technologies such as fuel cells, water electrolyzers, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction electrolyzers, metal&#8211;air batteries, etc. All these electrochemical processes involve oxygen electrocatalysis. Boosting the intrinsic activity and the active-site density through rational design of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and metal&#8211;organic gels (MOGs) as precursors represents a new approach toward improving oxygen electrocatalysis efficiency. MOFs/MOGs afford a broad selection of combinations between metal nodes and organic linkers and are known to produce electrocatalysts with high surface areas, variable porosity, and excellent activity after pyrolysis. Some recent studies on MOFs/MOGs for oxygen electrocatalysis and their new perspectives in synthesis, characterization, and performance are discussed. New insights on the structural and compositional design in MOF/MOG-derived oxygen electrocatalysts are summarized. Critical challenges and future research directions are also outlined.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Layered Intercalation Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intercalation of layered materials produces a rich class of materials with tunable structural and electronic properties for both fundamental studies and practical technologies. The key intercalation methods for preparing layered intercalation materials are summarized; the associated modulation of multiple properties is reviewed; and further prospects regarding the future challenges and opportunities in layered intercalation materials are considered.








Abstract
2D layered materials typically feature strong in&#8208;plane covalent chemical bonding within each atomic layer and weak out&#8208;of&#8208;plane van der Waals (vdW) interactions between adjacent layers. The non&#8208;bonding nature between neighboring layers naturally results in a vdW gap, in which various foreign species may be inserted without breaking the in&#8208;plane covalent bonds. By tailoring the composition, size, structure, and electronic properties of the intercalated guest species and the hosting layered materials, an expansive family of layered intercalation materials may be produced with highly variable compositional and structural features as well as widely tunable physical/chemical properties, invoking unprecedented opportunities in fundamental studies of property modulation and potential applications in diverse technologies, including electronics, optics, superconductors, thermoelectrics, catalysis, and energy storage. Here, the principles and protocols for various intercalation methods, including wet chemical intercalation, gas&#8208;phase intercalation, electrochemical intercalation, and ion&#8208;exchange intercalation, are comprehensively reviewed and how the intercalated species alter the crystal structure and the interlayer coupling of the host 2D layered materials, introducing unusual physical and chemical properties and enabling devices with superior performance or unique functions, is discussed. To conclude, a brief summary on future research opportunities and emerging challenges in the layered intercalation materials is given.

         <title>Golden Vaterite as a Mesoscopic Metamaterial for Biophotonic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mesoscopic biofrendly metamaterial, which includes a sub&#8208;micrometer vaterite spherulite infiltrated with gold nanoseeds, is presented. Highly controllable gold loading leads to a variety of electric and magnetic Mie resonances, covering first and second biological transparency windows 700&#8211;1300 nm. The great potential for biophotonic applications is exemplified by demonstration of efficient spherulites laser heating at red and near&#8208;infrared wavelengths.








Abstract
Mesoscopic photonic systems with tailored optical responses have great potential to open new frontiers in implantable biomedical devices. However, biocompatibility is typically a problem, as engineering of optical properties often calls for using toxic compounds and chemicals, unsuitable for in vivo applications. Here, a unique approach to biofriendly delivery of optical resonances is demonstrated. It is shown that the controllable infusion of gold nanoseeds into polycrystalline sub&#8208;micrometer vaterite spherulites gives rise to a variety of electric and magnetic Mie resonances, producing a tuneable mesoscopic optical metamaterial. The 3D reconstruction of the spherulites demonstrates the capability of controllable gold loading with volumetric filling factors exceeding 28%. Owing to the biocompatibility of the constitutive elements, &#8220;golden vaterite&#8221; paves the way to introduce designer&#8208;made Mie resonances to cutting&#8208;edge biophotonic applications. This concept is exemplified by showing efficient laser heating of gold&#8208;filled vaterite spherulites at red and near&#8208;infrared wavelengths, highly desirable in photothermal therapy, and photoacoustic tomography.

         <title>Superamphiphilic TiO2 Composite Surface for Protein Antifouling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that a TiO2&#8208;composite nanostructured superamphiphilic coating can resist protein adsorption at a water/solid interface. This work combines interface science and the practical application of the nonfouling property in capillary electrophoresis and multifunctional microfluidics. This work offers significant insights into the design of advanced superwetting materials to control biomolecule adhesion.








Abstract
Unwanted protein adsorption deteriorates fouling processes and reduces analytical device performance. Wettability plays an important role in protein adsorption by affecting interactions between proteins and surfaces. However, the principles of protein adsorption are not completely understood, and surface coatings that exhibit resistance to protein adsorption and long&#8208;term stability still need to be developed. Here, a nanostructured superamphiphilic TiO2 composite (TiO2/SiO2) coating that can effectively prevent nonspecific protein adsorption on water/solid interfaces is reported. The confined water on the superamphiphilic surface enables a low adhesion force and the formation of an energy barrier that plays a key role in preventing protein adsorption. This adaptive design protects the capillary wall from fouling in a harsh environment during the bioanalysis of capillary electrophoresis and is further extended to applications in multifunctional microfluidics for liquid transportation. This facile approach is not only perfectly applied in channels with complicated configurations but may also offer significant insights into the design of advanced superwetting materials to control biomolecule adhesion in biomedical devices, microfluidics, and biological assays.

         <title>Hydrogen Gas Sensors Using Palladium Nanogaps on an Elastomeric Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd nanogap&#8208;based sensors, which operate with a gap opening and closing mechanism, typically have many advantages, such as very high sensitivity and reliability and rapid response, compared to conventional Pd&#8208;based sensors operated by electron scattering mechanisms. The progress and advanced approaches achieved over the last decade for Pd nanogap&#8208;based H2 sensors supported on elastomeric substrates are reviewed.








Abstract
With the recent reillumination of the hydrogen economy around the world, the demand for H2 sensors is expected to increase rapidly. Due to safety issues caused by the highly flammable and explosive character of hydrogen gas (H2), it is imperative to develop the sensors that can quickly and sensitively detect H2 leaks. For the development of H2 sensors, Pd&#8208;based materials have been extensively used due to the high affinity of Pd metal for H2. Among Pd&#8208;based H2 sensors, Pd nanogap&#8208;based sensors have been extensively investigated because these sensors can operate in an on&#8211;off manner, which enables them to have improved sensing capabilities, including high sensitivity, rapid response, short recovery time, and good reliability. Importantly, significant advances in H2&#8208;sensing performance have been achieved by simply using an elastomeric substrate to form Pd nanogaps. Herein, the progress and advanced approaches achieved over the last decade for Pd nanogap&#8208;based H2 sensors supported on elastomeric substrates are reviewed, with a focus on strategies to reduce detection limits and increase reliability, sensitivity, and stability.

         <title>2D Electrolytes: Theory, Modeling, Synthesis, and Characterization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D electrolytes are stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that possess the chemical and physical properties of 2D materials and electrolytes. These materials can undergo reversible morphological transformations according to the environmental conditions, such as pH, temperature, electric permittivity of the medium, and ionic concentration, and exhibit flexible functionalities, being promising for highly dynamic systems, such as drug&#8208;delivery applications, artificial muscles, and energy&#8208;storage systems.








Abstract
A class of compounds sharing the properties of 2D materials and electrolytes, namely 2D electrolytes is described theoretically and demonstrated experimentally. 2D electrolytes dissociate in different solvents, such as water, and become electrically charged. The chemical and physical properties of these compounds can be controlled by external factors, such as pH, temperature, electric permittivity of the medium, and ionic concentration. 2D electrolytes, in analogy with polyelectrolytes, present reversible morphological transitions from 2D to 1D, as a function of pH, due to the interplay of the elastic and Coulomb energies. Since these materials show stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior to the environmental conditions, 2D electrolytes can be considered as a novel class of smart materials that expand the functionalities of 2D materials and are promising for applications that require stimuli&#8208;responsive demeanor, such as drug delivery, artificial muscles, and energy storage.

Since these materials show stimuli-responsive behavior to the environmental conditions, 2D electrolytes can be considered as a novel class of smart materials that expand the functionalities of 2D materials and are promising for applications that require stimuli-responsive demeanor, such as drug delivery, artificial muscles, and energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Plasmonic Photoelectrochemistry: In View of Hot Carriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemistry provides a powerful toolbox for mechanistic studies on hot&#8208;carrier&#8208;driven reactions in plasmonic photocatalysis. Working principles and applications of plasmonic photoelectrochemistry are summarized in this review.








Abstract
Utilizing plasmon&#8208;generated hot carriers to drive chemical reactions has emerged as a popular topic in solar photocatalysis. However, a complete description of the underlying mechanism of hot&#8208;carrier transfer in photochemical processes remains elusive, particularly for those involving hot holes. Photoelectrochemistry enables to localize hot holes on photoanodes and hot electrons on photocathodes and thus offers an approach to separately explore the hole&#8208;transfer dynamics and electron&#8208;transfer dynamics. This review summarizes a comprehensive understanding of both hot&#8208;hole and hot&#8208;electron transfers from photoelectrochemical studies on plasmonic electrodes. Additionally, working principles and applications of spectroelectrochemistry are discussed for plasmonic materials. It is concluded that photoelectrochemistry provides a powerful toolbox to gain mechanistic insights into plasmonic photocatalysis.

         <title>HASEL Artificial Muscles for a New Generation of Lifelike Robots&#8212;Recent Progress and Future Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydraulically amplified self&#8208;healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators are a new, versatile class of high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;sensing artificial muscles. Current research in materials, designs, fabrication, modeling, and controls is discussed and the wide opportunities for future interdisciplinary research to realize HASEL artificial muscles with drastically improved performance for use as building blocks of bioinspired intelligent systems of the future are laid out.








Abstract
Future robots and intelligent systems will autonomously navigate in unstructured environments and closely collaborate with humans; integrated with our bodies and minds, they will allow us to surpass our physical limitations. Traditional robots are mostly built from rigid, metallic components and electromagnetic motors, which make them heavy, expensive, unsafe near people, and ill&#8208;suited for unpredictable environments. By contrast, biological organisms make extensive use of soft materials and radically outperform robots in terms of dexterity, agility, and adaptability. Particularly, natural muscle&#8212;a masterpiece of evolution&#8212;has long inspired researchers to create &#8220;artificial muscles&#8221; in an attempt to replicate its versatility, seamless integration with sensing, and ability to self&#8208;heal. To date, natural muscle remains unmatched in all&#8208;round performance, but rapid advancements in soft robotics have brought viable alternatives closer than ever. Herein, the recent development of hydraulically amplified self&#8208;healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a new class of high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;sensing artificial muscles that couple electrostatic and hydraulic forces to achieve diverse modes of actuation, is discussed; current designs match or exceed natural muscle in many metrics. Research on materials, designs, fabrication, modeling, and control systems for HASEL actuators is detailed. In each area, research opportunities are identified, which together lays out a roadmap for actuators with drastically improved performance. With their unique versatility and wide potential for further improvement, HASEL actuators are poised to play an important role in a paradigm shift that fundamentally challenges the current limitations of robotic hardware toward future intelligent systems that replicate the vast capabilities of biological organisms.

         <title>New Frontiers in 3D Structural Sensing Robots</title>

         <dc:description>
Sensing robots synergically merge 3D integrated sensors and robotics. Geometrical difficulty from the structural complexity of sensing robots has been the main challenge in the production of sensing robots. 3D integrated electronics prepared by 3D printing is a potential solution for realistic sensing robot systems. The platform of 3D sensing systems is investigated, and their expansion into sensing robots is studied further in practical settings such as in healthcare and manufacturing units. The progress toward sensing robots from 3D electronics integrated into 3D objects is discussed.








Abstract
Advanced robotics is the result of various contributions from complex fields of science and engineering and has tremendous value in human society. Sensing robots are highly desirable in practical settings such as healthcare and manufacturing sectors through sensing activities from human&#8211;robot interaction. However, there are still ongoing research and technical challenges in the development of ideal sensing robot systems. The sensing robot should synergically merge sensors and robotics. Geometrical difficulty in the sensor positioning caused by the structural complexity of sensing robots and their corresponding processing have been the main challenges in the production of sensing robots. 3D electronics integrated into 3D objects prepared by the 3D printing process can be the potential solution for designing realistic sensing robot systems. 3D printing provides the advantage to manufacture complex 3D structures in electronics in a single setup, allowing the ease of design flexibility, and customized functions. Therefore, the platform of 3D sensing systems is investigated and their expansion into sensing robots is studied further. The progress toward sensing robots from 3D electronics integrated into 3D objects and the advanced material strategies, used to overcome the challenges, are discussed.

         <title>Recent Progress of Flexible Image Sensors for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest research of flexible image sensors for biomedical application&#160;is comprehensively reviewed. The individual components of an image sensor are described, along with basic parameters used to evaluate the performance of the image sensors and biomedical application of flexible image sensors are described. Finally, the outlook for future research regarding flexible image sensors is discussed.








Abstract
Flexible image sensors have attracted increasing attention as new imaging devices owing to their lightness, softness, and bendability. Since light can measure inside information from outside of the body, optical&#8208;imaging&#8208;based approaches, such as X&#8208;rays, are widely used for disease diagnosis in hospitals. Unlike conventional sensors, flexible image sensors are soft and can be directly attached to a curved surface, such as the skin, for continuous measurement of biometric information with high accuracy. Therefore, they are expected to gain wide application to wearable devices, as well as home medical care. Herein, the application of such sensors to the biomedical field is introduced. First, their individual components, photosensors, and switching elements, are explained. Then, the basic parameters used to evaluate the performance of each of these elements and the image sensors are described. Finally, examples of measuring the dynamic and static biometric information using flexible image sensors, together with relevant real&#8208;world measurement cases, are presented. Furthermore, recent applications of the flexible image sensors in the biomedical field are introduced.

         <title>Exploiting Mechanical Instabilities in Soft Robotics: Control, Sensing, and Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical instabilities provide a novel route to achieve power amplification and attain impressive actuation speeds. An overview of the development of soft robots and actuators that exploit mechanical instabilities to expand their actuation speed, output power, and functionality is presented. These strategies have the potential to address the current challenges in the areas of soft robotic control, sensing, and actuation.








Abstract
The rapidly expanding field of soft robotics has provided multiple examples of how entirely soft machines and actuators can outperform conventional rigid robots in terms of adaptability, maneuverability, and safety. Unfortunately, the soft and flexible materials used in their construction impose intrinsic limitations on soft robots, such as low actuation speeds and low output forces. Nature offers multiple examples where highly flexible organisms exploit mechanical instabilities to store and rapidly release energy. Guided by these examples, researchers have recently developed a variety of strategies to overcome speed and power limitations in soft robotics using mechanical instabilities. These mechanical instabilities provide, through rapid transitions from structurally stable states, a new route to achieve high output power amplification and attain impressive actuation speeds. Here, an overview of the literature related to the development of soft robots and actuators that exploit mechanical instabilities to expand their actuation speed, output power, and functionality is presented. Additionally, strategies using structural phase transitions to address current challenges in the area of soft robotic control, sensing, and actuation are discussed. Approaches using instabilities to create entirely soft logic modules to imbue soft robots with material intelligence and distributed computational capabilities are also reviewed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imperceptible soft robotics have great potential to assist humans, and a great enhancement in robotics engineering is expected from the optical transparency of both actuators and sensors, along with camouflage skins. This soft robotic system will potentially enable great advancements in undercover military robots and assistive devices through the development of manufacturing and materials, and understanding the mechanics and working mechanisms and principles.








Abstract
The advent of soft robotics has led to great advancements in robots, wearables, and even manufacturing processes by employing entirely soft&#8208;bodied systems that interact safely with any random surfaces while providing great mechanical compliance. Moreover, recent developments in soft robotics involve advances in transparent soft actuators and sensors that have made it possible to construct robots that can function in a visually and mechanically unobstructed manner, assisting the operations of robots and creating more applications in various fields. In this aspect, imperceptible soft robotics that mainly consist of optically transparent imperceptible hardware components is expected to constitute a new research focus in the forthcoming era of soft robotics. Here, the recent progress regarding extended imperceptible soft robotics is provided, including imperceptible transparent soft robotics (transparent soft actuators/sensors) and imperceptible nontransparent camouflage skins. Their principles, materials selections, and working mechanisms are discussed so that key challenges and perspectives in imperceptible soft robotic systems can be explored.

         <title>Becoming Sustainable, The New Frontier in Soft Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In future, robots will be seamlessly integrated in everyday life and&#8212;as much as consumer electronics is omnipresent today&#8212;assist in a myriad of tasks. However, environmental concerns at their end&#8208;of&#8208;life phase necessitate sustainable solutions for actuators, energy storage, electronics, and all involved materials. Soft and bioinspired robotics offer a remarkably unique potential to succeed this challenge.








Abstract
The advancement of technology has a profound and far&#8208;reaching impact on the society, now penetrating all areas of life. From cradle to grave, one is supported by and depends on a wide range of electronic and robotic appliances, with an ever more intimate integration of the digital and biological spheres. These advances, however, often come at the price of negatively impacting our ecosystem, with growing demands on energy, contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution&#8212;from production to improper disposal. Mitigating these adverse effects is among the grand challenges of the society and at the forefront of materials research. The currently emerging forms of soft, biologically inspired electronics and robotics have the unique potential of becoming not only like their natural antitypes in performance and capabilities, but also in terms of their ecological footprint.

     alt="Becoming Sustainable, The New Frontier in Soft Robotics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In future, robots will be seamlessly integrated in everyday life and&#8212;as much as consumer electronics is omnipresent today&#8212;assist in a myriad of tasks. However, environmental concerns at their end-of-life phase necessitate sustainable solutions for actuators, energy storage, electronics, and all involved materials. Soft and bioinspired robotics offer a remarkably unique potential to succeed this challenge.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advancement of technology has a profound and far-reaching impact on the society, now penetrating all areas of life. From cradle to grave, one is supported by and depends on a wide range of electronic and robotic appliances, with an ever more intimate integration of the digital and biological spheres. These advances, however, often come at the price of negatively impacting our ecosystem, with growing demands on energy, contributions to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution&#8212;from production to improper disposal. Mitigating these adverse effects is among the grand challenges of the society and at the forefront of materials research. The currently emerging forms of soft, biologically inspired electronics and robotics have the unique potential of becoming not only like their natural antitypes in performance and capabilities, but also in terms of their ecological footprint. This review outlines the rise of sustainable materials in soft and bioinspired robotics, targeting all robotic components from actuators to energy storage and electronics. The state-of-the-art in biobased robotics spans flourishing fields and applications ranging from microbots operating in vivo to biohybrid machines and fully biodegradable yet resilient actuators. These first steps initiate the evolution of robotics and guide them into a sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Energy Harvesting and Storage with Soft and Stretchable Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methods to harvest ambient energy (mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electromagnetic energy) using soft and stretchable materials are summarized. These materials and devices pave the way for untethered soft robots, selfpowered sensors, wearable devices, stretchable electronics, and electronic skins. The challenges and opportunities associated with ambient energy harvesting techniques are also discussed.








Abstract
This review highlights various modes of converting ambient sources of energy into electricity using soft and stretchable materials. These mechanical properties are useful for emerging classes of stretchable electronics, e&#8208;skins, bio&#8208;integrated wearables, and soft robotics. The ability to harness energy from the environment allows these types of devices to be tetherless, thereby leading to a greater range of motion (in the case of robotics), better compliance (in the case of wearables and e&#8208;skins), and increased application space (in the case of electronics). A variety of energy sources are available including mechanical (vibrations, human motion, wind/fluid motion), electromagnetic (radio frequency (RF), solar), and thermodynamic (chemical or thermal energy). This review briefly summarizes harvesting mechanisms and focuses on the materials&#8217; strategies to render such devices into soft or stretchable embodiments.

         <title>Locomotion of Miniature Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Miniature soft robots are made of smart materials that can be actuated by external stimuli to realize their desired functionalities. Critical analyses and discussions on the locomotion producible by soft robots in micro&#8208; to centimeter length scales are provided, with the aim of inspiring future development of miniature soft robots that can be significantly more dexterous and robust.








Abstract
Miniature soft robots are mobile devices, which are made of smart materials that can be actuated by external stimuli to realize their desired functionalities. Here, the key advancements and challenges of the locomotion producible by miniature soft robots in micro&#8208; to centimeter length scales are highlighted. It is highly desirable to endow these small machines with dexterous locomotive gaits as it enables them to easily access highly confined and enclosed spaces via a noninvasive manner. If miniature soft robots are able to capitalize this unique ability, they will have the potential to transform a vast range of applications, including but not limited to, minimally invasive medical treatments, lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip applications, and search&#8208;and&#8208;rescue missions. The gaits of miniature soft robots are categorized into terrestrial, aquatic, and aerial locomotion. Except for the centimeter&#8208;scale robots that can perform aerial locomotion, the discussions in this report are centered around soft robots that are in the micro&#8208; to millimeter length scales. Under each category of locomotion, prospective methods and strategies that can improve their gait performances are also discussed. This report provides critical analyses and discussions that can inspire future strategies to make miniature soft robots significantly more agile.

         <title>Progress and Roadmap for Intelligent Self&#8208;Healing Materials in Autonomous Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing materials are exciting avenues toward sustainable and intelligent long lifespan robots. The history and recent advances in material strategies for self&#8208;healing in robotics and stretchable electronics toward future development of the fully autonomous self&#8208;healing robots are reviewed.








Abstract
Robots are increasingly assisting humans in performing various tasks. Like special agents with elite skills, they can venture to distant locations and adverse environments, such as the deep sea and outer space. Micro/nanobots can also act as intrabody agents for healthcare applications. Self&#8208;healing materials that can autonomously perform repair functions are useful to address the unpredictability of the environment and the increasing drive toward the autonomous operation. Having self&#8208;healable robotic materials can potentially reduce costs, electronic wastes, and improve a robot endowed with such materials longevity. This review aims to serve as a roadmap driven by past advances and inspire future cross&#8208;disciplinary research in robotic materials and electronics. By first charting the history of self&#8208;healing materials, new avenues are provided to classify the various self&#8208;healing materials proposed over several decades. The materials and strategies for self&#8208;healing in robotics and stretchable electronics are also reviewed and discussed. It is believed that this article encourages further innovation in this exciting and emerging branch in robotics interfacing with material science and electronics.

         <title>Shape Changing Robots: Bioinspiration, Simulation, and Physical Realization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological tissues exhibit incredible dynamic plasticity, enabling organisms to grow and thrive in challenging environments. Inspired by such feats, engineers have begun to design robots capable of actively editing their own structure and behaviors. An overview of the literature on shape changing robots is provided, and how multifunctional materials will help solve grand challenges to enable next&#8208;generation robots is elucidated.








Abstract
One of the key differentiators between biological and artificial systems is the dynamic plasticity of living tissues, enabling adaptation to different environmental conditions, tasks, or damage by reconfiguring physical structure and behavioral control policies. Lack of dynamic plasticity is a significant limitation for artificial systems that must robustly operate in the natural world. Recently, researchers have begun to leverage insights from regenerating and metamorphosing organisms, designing robots capable of editing their own structure to more efficiently perform tasks under changing demands and creating new algorithms to control these changing anatomies. Here, an overview of the literature related to robots that change shape to enhance and expand their functionality is presented. Related grand challenges, including shape sensing, finding, and changing, which rely on innovations in multifunctional materials, distributed actuation and sensing, and somatic control to enable next&#8208;generation shape changing robots are also&#160;discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A relation map of dynamic fibers/fabrics with responsive functions, including actuation, sensing, and energy harvesting, is built for potential construction of a soft, safe, user&#8208;friendly human&#8211;robot interface. It promises the seamless integration between actuators, sensors, and power sources into fibers/fabrics, envisaging self&#8208;regulated, autonomous, and intelligent robotic fibers/fabrics for daily functions and biomedical services.








Abstract
Soft robotics inspired by the movement of living organisms, with excellent adaptability and accuracy for accomplishing tasks, are highly desirable for efficient operations and safe interactions with human. With the emerging wearable electronics, higher tactility and skin affinity are pursued for safe and user&#8208;friendly human&#8211;robot interactions. Fabrics interlocked by fibers perform traditional static functions such as warming, protection, and fashion. Recently, dynamic fibers and fabrics are favorable to deliver active stimulus responses such as sensing and actuating abilities for soft&#8208;robots and wearables. First, the responsive mechanisms of fiber/fabric actuators and their performances under various external stimuli are reviewed. Fiber/yarn&#8208;based artificial muscles for soft&#8208;robots manipulation and assistance in human motion are discussed, as well as smart clothes for improving human perception. Second, the geometric designs, fabrications, mechanisms, and functions of fibers/fabrics for sensing and energy harvesting from the human body and environments are summarized. Effective integration between the electronic components with garments, human skin, and living organisms is illustrated, presenting multifunctional platforms with self&#8208;powered potential for human&#8211;robot interactions and biomedicine. Lastly, the relationships between robotic/wearable fibers/fabrics and the external stimuli, together with the challenges and possible routes for revolutionizing the robotic fibers/fabrics and wearables in this new era are proposed.

         <title>Artificial Skin Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial skin perception that integrates the perception functionality into a flexible and stretchable sensing system could endow current flexible electronic devices with higher intelligence. The recent progress, challenges, and prospects of artificial skin perception are discussed, offering some inspiration for the development of next&#8208;generation intelligent systems, especially soft robotics.








Abstract
Skin is the largest organ, with the functionalities of protection, regulation, and sensation. The emulation of human skin via flexible and stretchable electronics gives rise to electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), which has realized artificial sensation and other functions that cannot be achieved by conventional electronics. To date, tremendous progress has been made in data acquisition and transmission for e&#8208;skin systems, while the implementation of perception within systems, that is, sensory data processing, is still in its infancy. Integrating the perception functionality into a flexible and stretchable sensing system, namely artificial skin perception, is critical to endow current e&#8208;skin systems with higher intelligence. Here, recent progress in the design and fabrication of artificial skin perception devices and systems is summarized, and challenges and prospects are discussed. The strategies for implementing artificial skin perception utilize either conventional silicon&#8208;based circuits or novel flexible computing devices such as memristive devices and synaptic transistors, which enable artificial skin to surpass human skin, with a distributed, low&#8208;latency, and energy&#8208;efficient information&#8208;processing ability. In future, artificial skin perception would be a new enabling technology to construct next&#8208;generation intelligent electronic devices and systems for advanced applications, such as robotic surgery, rehabilitation, and prosthetics.

         <title>Printing Multi&#8208;Material Organic Haptic Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 19, May 13, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of emerging organic actuator materials and digital printing technologies for fabricating soft organic haptic actuators to emulate touch sensations is provided. In particular, the focus is on the challenges and potential solutions associated with integration of multi&#8208;material actuators. The progress in achieving compact, lightweight haptic actuators by combining different polymers and composites in freeform designs is reported.








Abstract
Haptic actuators generate touch sensations and provide realism and depth in human&#8211;machine interactions. A new generation of soft haptic interfaces is desired to produce the distributed signals over large areas that are required to mimic natural touch interactions. One promising approach is to combine the advantages of organic actuator materials and additive printing technologies. This powerful combination can lead to devices that are ergonomic, readily customizable, and economical for researchers to explore potential benefits and create new haptic applications. Here, an overview of emerging organic actuator materials and digital printing technologies for fabricating haptic actuators is provided. In particular, the focus is on the challenges and potential solutions associated with integration of multi&#8208;material actuators, with an eye toward improving the fidelity and robustness of the printing process. Then the progress in achieving compact, lightweight haptic actuators by using an open&#8208;source extrusion printer to integrate different polymers and composites in freeform designs is reported. Two haptic interfaces&#8212;a tactile surface and a kinesthetic glove&#8212;are demonstrated to show that printing with organic materials is a versatile approach for rapid prototyping of various types of haptic devices.

         <title>3D Printing of Monolithic Capillarity&#8208;Driven Microfluidic Devices for Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel powder&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing method enables monolithic capillarity&#8208;driven microfluidic devices. Precise spatial control over the internal surface chemistry of porous bodies enables fabrication of microfluidic devices capable of multistep laboratory assays in a self&#8208;contained format.








Abstract
Rapid diagnostic testing at the site of the patient is essential when a fully equipped laboratory is not accessible. To maximize the impact of this approach, low&#8208;cost, disposable tests that require minimal user&#8208;interference and external equipment are desired. Fluid transport by capillary wicking removes the need for bulky ancillary equipment to actuate and control fluid flow. Nevertheless, current microfluidic paper&#8208;based analytical devices based on this principle struggle with the implementation of multistep diagnostic protocols because of fabrication&#8208;related issues. Here, 3D&#8208;printed microfluidic devices are demonstrated in a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay in which a multistep assay timeline is completed by precisely engineering capillary wetting within printed porous bodies. 3D printing provides a scalable route to low&#8208;cost microfluidic devices and obviates the assembly of discrete components. The resulting rapid and seamless transition between digital data and physical objects allows for rapid design iterations, and opens up perspectives on distributed manufacturing.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Scanning&#8208;Guided Assembly of Quasi&#8208;3D Patterned Arrays of Plasmonic Dimers for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile laser writing strategy is developed to fabricate plasmonic dimer arrays with arbitrary patterns. This approach allows for precisely controlling the z&#8208;axis orientation, interparticle spacing, and nanoparticle size and shape of plasmonic dimers. The plasmonic color of the patterned dimers can be reversibly displayed and erased, enabling their use in information encryption and beyond.








Abstract
The application of plasmonic dimeric nanostructures in color displays, data storage, and especially metamaterials necessitates the patterning of dimers into ordered arrays, but controllable assembly of plasmonic nanoparticles into patterned dimer arrays on substrates still remains a challenge. Here, a facile laser&#8208;scanning&#8208;based strategy to fabricate quasi&#8208;3D patterned arrays of plasmonic nanoparticle dimers with controlled orientation for plasmonic information encryption is reported. Laser scanning of polymer&#8208;covered plasmonic nanoparticle (e.g., gold) arrays selectively exposes the surface of irradiated nanoparticle via localized photothermal heating, guiding the assembly of another type of nanoparticles onto the exposure nanoparticle surface to form dimers on substrates. This combined top&#8208;down/bottom&#8208;up approach is highly flexible in forming high&#8208;resolution patterns of plasmonic dimers from nanoparticles of different sizes and shapes. The z&#8208;axis orientation, interparticle spacing, and nanoparticle size and shape of plasmonic dimers can be precisely tuned, enabling the modulation of the coupled resonances of the dimer arrays. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the patterned dimer arrays can be used in information encryption where their plasmonic color can be repeatedly displayed and erased. This work provides an important addition to tools for the fabrication of patterned complex plasmonic nanostructures from as&#8208;synthesized nanoparticles with broad applications.

         <title>Surpassing 13% Efficiency for Polythiophene Organic Solar Cells Processed from Nonhalogenated Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient polythiophene&#8208;based organic solar cell (OSC) is demonstrated based on a fluorinated polythiophene donor with deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and appropriate miscibility with the acceptor. With further interfacial modification by a fullerene self&#8208;assembled monolayer, a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.65% for polythiophene&#8208;based OSCs is achieved with the device processed from nonhalogenated solvent.








Abstract
Benefiting from low cost and simple synthesis, polythiophene (PT) derivatives are one of the most popular donor materials for organic solar cells (OSCs). However, polythiophene&#8208;based OSCs still suffer from inferior power conversion efficiency (PCE) than those based on donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A)&#8208;type conjugated polymers. Herein, a fluorinated polythiophene derivative, namely P4T2F&#8208;HD, is introduced to modulate the miscibility and morphology of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ)&#8208;active layer, leading to a significant improvement of the OSC performance. The Flory&#8211;Huggins interaction parameters calculated from the surface energy and differential scanning calorimetry results suggest that P4T2F&#8208;HD shows moderate miscibility with the popular nonfullerene acceptor Y6&#8208;BO (2,2&#8242;&#8208;((2Z,2&#8242;Z)&#8208;((12,13&#8208;bis(2&#8208;butyloctyl)&#8208;3,9&#8208;diundecyl&#8208;12,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;e]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4&#8242;,5&#8242;]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;g]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]indole&#8208;2,10&#8208;diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;2,1&#8208;diylidene))dimalononitrile), while poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is very miscible with Y6&#8208;BO. As a result, the P4T2F&#8208;HD case forms desired nanoscale phase separation in the BHJ film while the P3HT case forms a completely mixed BHJ film, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS). By optimizing the cathode interface and the morphology of the P4T2F&#8208;HD:Y6&#8208;BO films processed from nonhalogenated solvents, a new record PCE of 13.65% for polythiophene&#8208;based OSCs is demonstrated. This work highlights the importance of controlling D/A interactions for achieving desired morphology and also demonstrates a promising OSC system for potential cost&#8208;effective organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Solvent Li&#8208;Ion Solvation Enables High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to optimize the electrolyte formulations for Li&#8208;metal batteries. Li&#8208;ion solvating fluorinated molecules with increasing chain lengths are used as main&#8208;solvents to promote electrolyte stability. 1,2&#8208;Dimethoxyethane (DME) is used as the co&#8208;solvent to enhance the ionic conductivity. The resulting 1&#160;m LiFSI/6FDMH&#8208;DME electrolyte enables dual&#8208;solvent Li&#8208;ion solvation environments, inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphases, and long cycling of Li&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Novel electrolyte designs to further enhance the lithium (Li) metal battery cyclability are highly desirable. Here, fluorinated 1,6&#8208;dimethoxyhexane (FDMH) is designed and synthesized as the solvent molecule to promote electrolyte stability with its prolonged &#8211;CF2&#8211; backbone. Meanwhile, 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane is used as a co&#8208;solvent to enable higher ionic conductivity and much reduced interfacial resistance. Combining the dual&#8208;solvent system with 1 m lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI), high Li&#8208;metal Coulombic efficiency (99.5%) and oxidative stability (6&#160;V) are achieved. Using this electrolyte, 20&#160;&#181;m&#160;Li||NMC batteries are able to retain &#8776;80% capacity after 250 cycles and Cu||NMC anode&#8208;free pouch cells last 120 cycles with 75% capacity retention under &#8776;2.1&#160;&#181;L&#160;mAh&#8722;1 lean electrolyte conditions. Such high performances are attributed to the anion&#8208;derived solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, originating from the coordination of Li&#8208;ions to the highly stable FDMH and multiple anions in their solvation environments. This work demonstrates a new electrolyte design strategy that enables high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;metal batteries with multisolvent Li&#8208;ion solvation with rationally optimized molecular structure and ratio.

         <title>Reconfigurable Magnetic Origami Actuators with On&#8208;Board Sensing for Guided Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic origami actuators equipped with highly compliant magnetic field sensors can monitor their shape and detect their magnetization state, making feedback control and guided assembly possible. These actuators are based on composite films of ferromagnetic microparticles embedded in shape&#8208;memory polymer films. Photothermal heating from light and applied magnetic fields enable on&#8208;demand reconfigurability.








Abstract
Origami utilizes orchestrated transformation of soft 2D structures into complex 3D architectures, mimicking shapes and functions found in nature. In contrast to origami in nature, synthetic origami lacks the ability to monitor the environment and correspondingly adjust its behavior. Here, magnetic origami actuators with capabilities to sense their orientation and displacement as well as detect their own magnetization state and readiness for supervised folding are designed, fabricated, and demonstrated. These origami actuators integrate photothermal heating and magnetic actuation by using composite thin films (&#8776;60&#160;&#181;m thick) of shape&#8208;memory polymers with embedded magnetic NdFeB microparticles. Mechanically compliant magnetic field sensors, known as magnetosensitive electronic skins, are laminated on the surface of the soft actuators. These ultrathin actuators accomplish sequential folding and recovery, with hinge locations programmed on the fly. Endowing mechanically active smart materials with cognition is an important step toward realizing intelligent, stimuli&#8208;responsive structures.

         <title>K&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode Design Utilizing Trigonal Prismatic Ligand Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemistry of a trigonal&#8208;prismatic (TP) TMO6 unit is revealed in a K&#8208;ion battery cathode. The activity, reversibility, and stability of TP FeO6 based on comprehensive synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analyses demonstrate it is a feasible structural gene for electrode design and exploration. Further materials lattice and electronic structure manipulation are expected.








Abstract
The intrinsic physical and chemical properties of materials are largely governed by the bonding and electronic structures of their fundamental building units. The majority of cathode materials contain octahedral TMO6 (TM = transition metal), which dominates the redox chemistry during electrochemical operation. As a less symmetric form of TMO6, the trigonal prismatic geometry is not a traditionally favored coordination configuration as it tends to lose the crystal&#8208;field stabilization energy and thus generate large ligand repulsion. Herein, a K&#8208;ion battery cathode design, K2Fe(C2O4)2, is shown&#8203;, where the TMO6 trigonal prism (TP) is not only electrochemically active but stable enough to allow for excellent cycling stability. Detailed synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements reveal the evolution of localized fine structure, evidencing the electrochemical activity, reversibility, and stability of the TP motif. The findings are expected to expand the toolbox for the rational design of electrode materials by taking advantage of TP as a structural gene.

         <title>Exceptional Cocatalyst&#8208;Free Photo&#8208;Enhanced Piezocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution of Carbon Nitride Nanosheets from Strong In&#8208;Plane Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exceptional photo&#8208;enhanced piezocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 12.16 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 without any cocatalysts is realized by g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, outperforming most previously reported piezocatalysts and g&#8208;C3N4&#8208;based photocatalysts, which originates from the large anomalous piezoelectricity induced by in&#8208;plane polarization, coupled with the photo&#8208;improved surface charge transfer and strain&#8208;enriched surface reactive sites.








Abstract
Utilizing mechanical energy to produce hydrogen is emerging as a promising way to generate renewable energy, but is challenged by low efficiency and scanty cognition. In this work, graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) with an atomically thin sheet&#8208;like structure is applied for prominent piezocatalytic and photo&#8208;enhanced piezocatalytic H2 production. It is revealed that the anomalous piezoelectricity in g&#8208;C3N4 originates from the strong in&#8208;plane polarization along the a&#8208;axis, contributed by the superimposed polar tri&#8208;s&#8208;triazine units and flexoelectric effect derived from the structured triangular cavities, which provides powerful electrochemical driving force for the water reduction reaction. Furthermore, the photo&#8208;enhanced charge transfer enables g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets to reserve more energized polarization charges to fully participate in the reaction at the surface reactive sites enriched by strain&#8208;induced carbon vacancies. Without any cocatalysts, an exceptional photo&#8208;piezocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 12.16 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is delivered by the g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, far exceeding that of previously reported piezocatalysts and g&#8208;C3N4 photocatalysts. Further, high pure&#8208;water&#8208;splitting performance with production of the value&#8208;added oxidation product H2O2 via photo&#8208;piezocatalysis is also disclosed. This work not only exposes the potential of g&#8208;C3N4 as a piezo&#8208;semiconductor for catalytic H2 evolution, but also breaks a new ground for the conversion of solar and mechanical energy by photomediated piezocatalytic reaction.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline Silicon Frameworks: A New Platform for Transparent Flexible Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;supported, flexible, and highly transparent single&#8208;crystalline silicon frameworks (sc&#8208;SiFs) are fabricated from commonly used Si wafers by combining wet&#8208;etching and microfabrication technologies. They provide a new platform for transparent flexible optoelectronics, enabling the construction of high&#8208;performance transparent flexible Si&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystalline silicon (sc&#8208;Si) is the dominant semiconductor material for the modern electronics industry. Despite their excellent photoelectric and electronic properties, the rigidity, brittleness, and nontransparency of commonly used silicon wafers limit their application in transparent flexible optoelectronics. In this study, a new type of Si microstructure, named single&#8208;crystalline Si frameworks (sc&#8208;SiFs), is developed, through a combination of wet&#8208;etching and microfabrication technologies. The sc&#8208;SiFs are self&#8208;supported, flexible, lightweight, tailorable, and highly transparent. They can withstand a small bending radius of less than 0.5&#160;mm and have a transparency of up to 96% in all wavelength ranges, owing to the hollowed&#8208;out framework structures. Thus, the sc&#8208;SiFs provide a new platform for high&#8208;performance transparent flexible optoelectronics. Taking transparent flexible photodetectors (TFPDs) as an example, substrate&#8208;free and self&#8208;driven TFPDs are achieved based on the sc&#8208;SiFs. The devices exhibit superior performance compared to other reported TFPDs and reveal the great potential for integrated optoelectronic applications. The development of sc&#8208;SiFs paves the way toward the fabrication of high&#8208;performance transparent flexible devices for a host of applications, including e&#8208;skins, the Internet of Things, transparent flexible displays, and artificial&#160;visual&#160;cortexes.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Gradient Hydrogels Enable Direct Zero Liquid Discharge for Hypersaline Wastewater Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero liquid discharge (ZLD), as the ultimate goal of wastewater treatment, is hampered by the lack of robust membrane&#8208;based desalination technologies. A hydrophilic nonporous charge&#8208;gradient hydrogel (CGH) membrane shows high water flux and excellent fouling/scaling&#8208;free properties in membrane distillation, enabling direct and ultrastable desalination of hypersaline wastewater (130&#160;g&#160;L&#8722;1) containing broad&#8208;spectrum foulants (500&#160;mg&#160;L&#8722;1) for 200&#160;h.








Abstract
Zero liquid discharge (ZLD), which maximizes water recovery and eliminates environmental impact, is an urgent wastewater management strategy for alleviating freshwater shortage. However, because of the high concentration of salts and broad&#8208;spectrum foulants in wastewater, a huge challenge for ZLD is lack of a robust membrane&#8208;based desalination technology that enables direct wastewater recovery without costly pretreatment processes. Here, a paradigm&#8208;shift membrane distillation (MD) strategy is presented, wherein the traditional hydrophobic porous membrane is replaced with a hydrophilic nonporous charge&#8208;gradient hydrogel (CGH) membrane that possesses hypersaline tolerance, fouling/scaling&#8208;free properties, and negligible vapor transfer resistance inside the membrane, simultaneously. Therefore, the CGH&#8208;based MD with high water flux enables direct desalination of hypersaline wastewater (130&#160;g&#160;L&#8208;1) containing broad&#8208;spectrum foulants (500&#160;mg&#160;L&#8208;1) during continuous long&#8208;term operation (200 h), and this technology paves a promising way to direct ZLD for wastewater management.

         <title>A Safe and Sustainable Lithium&#8208;Ion&#8211;Oxygen Battery based on a Low&#8208;Cost Dual&#8208;Carbon Electrodes Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li&#8208;ion&#8211;O2 battery system with a dual&#8208;carbon electrodes architecture is constructed to address the concerns of safety and costs. Li&#8208;ions undergo a (de)intercalation process into the graphite anode and an O2/Li2O2 redox conversion on the carbon nanotube cathode. Benefitting from superior electrode compatibilities, a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cell (302.52 W h kg&#8722;1) with cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly carbon components is fabricated.








Abstract
People anticipate high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technology with better security, stability, and sustainability. By tuning the advantage of specific capacity, the lithium&#8208;metal anode is replaced with a graphite intercalation compound and a conceptual prototype lithium&#8208;ion&#8211;oxygen battery based on a low&#8208;cost dual&#8208;carbon electrodes architecture is proposed. The lithium&#8208;ion involves a (de)intercalation process into the graphite anode and an O2/Li2O2 redox conversion on the carbon&#8208;nanotube cathode. After a thorough examination as to the electrode compatibility with current electrolytes, a nonflammable fluorinated ether electrolyte is proposed to render a highly coordinated solvation sheath and low lithium salt concentration (1&#160;mol). Herein, the compatibility with graphite anode is investigated, which maintains high capacity retention (88.1%) after long&#8208;term lifespan (over 1 year). In view of the ultrahigh reversibility (average Coulombic efficiency over 99.93%) of the graphite anode, a lithium&#8208;ion&#8211;oxygen coin cell with high depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge of 80% and 60% deliver a satisfactory life over 150 and 300 cycles, respectively. Moreover, systematic spectroscopy characterizations demonstrate a reversible and efficient 2e&#8211; O2/Li2O2 redox reaction without relying on noble&#8208;metal catalysts. Lastly, in the engineering aspect, a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cell (302.52 W h kg&#8722;1 based on the weight of the entire pouch) with cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly carbon&#8208;composed cell components is successfully fabricated.

A self&#8208;powered biomimetic whisker mechanoreceptor based on the bionics design of animal whiskers and a robotic tactile sensing system is constructed for robots to realize environmental exploration, robotic navigation, prey&#8208;tracking, and danger avoidance with effectively improved device lifetime, sensitivity, stability, and anti&#8208;interference performance compared to traditional electronic skin.








Abstract
Touch sensing is among the most important sensing capabilities of a human, and the same is true for smart robotics. Current research on tactile sensors is mainly concentrated on electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), but e&#8208;skin is prone to be easily dirtied, damaged, and disturbed after repeated usage, which greatly limits its practical applications in robotics. Here, by mimicking the way that animals explore the environment using hair&#8208;based sensors, a bendable biomimetic whisker mechanoreceptor (BWMR) is designed for robotic tactile sensing. Owing to the advantages of triboelectric nanogenerator technology, the BWMR can convert external mechanical stimuli into electrical signals without a power supply, which is conducive to its widespread applications in robots. Because of the leverage effect of the whisker, the BWMR can distinguish an exciting force of 1.129&#160;&#956;N by amplifying external weak signals, which can be further improved by increasing the whisker length. Real&#8208;time sensing is demonstrated using a BWMR, exhibiting its potential for robotic tactile systems.

         <title>Immune Checkpoint&#8208;Bioengineered Beta Cell Vaccine Reverses Early&#8208;Onset Type 1 Diabetes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

A subcutaneous injectable immune checkpoint ligand&#8208;functionalized &#946; cell vaccine is bioengineered to induce islet antigen&#8208;specific immunotolerance and reverse early&#8208;onset type 1 diabetes mellitus.








Abstract
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease that results from autoreactive T cells destroying insulin&#8208;producing pancreatic beta (&#946;) cells. The development of T1DM is associated with the deficiency of co&#8208;inhibitory immune checkpoint ligands (e.g., PD&#8208;L1, CD86, and Gal&#8208;9) in &#946; cells. Here, a new translational approach based on metabolic glycoengineering and bioorthogonal click chemistry, which bioengineers &#946; cells with co&#8208;inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules that induce antigen&#8208;specific immunotolerance and reverse early&#8208;onset hyperglycemia is reported. To achieve this goal, a subcutaneous injectable acellular pancreatic extracellular matrix platform for localizing the bioengineered &#946; cells while creating a pancreas&#8208;like immunogenic microenvironment, in which the autoreactive T cells can interface with the &#946; cells, is devised.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Crossover Molecules on Surfaces: From Isolated Molecules to Ultrathin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;crossover molecules (SCMs) are one of the most promising candidates for molecular spintronics applications due to their ability to exist in two spin states that can be reversibly switched by light and voltage, among others. Investigations of SCMs on surfaces are summarized, highlighting the achievements and challenges, as well as laying out the future prospects.








Abstract
Molecular spintronics seeks to use single or few molecules as functional building blocks for spintronic applications, directly relying on molecular properties or properties of interfaces between molecules and inorganic electrodes. Spin&#8208;crossover molecules (SCMs) are one of the most promising classes of candidates for molecular spintronics due to their bistability deriving from the existence of two spin states that can be reversibly switched by temperature, light, electric fields, etc. Building devices based on single or few molecules would entail connecting the molecule(s) with solid surfaces and understanding the fundamental behavior of the resulting assemblies. Herein, the investigations of SCMs on solid surfaces, ranging from isolated single molecules (submonolayers) to ultrathin films (mainly in the sub&#8208;10 nm range) are summarized. The achievements, challenges and prospects in this field are highlighted.

         <title>Surfactant&#8208;Free, One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Hollow Nanospheres for Trace CO Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly pure lead&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs2PdBr6 hollow nanospheres are synthesized in large quantities using a surfactant&#8208;free one&#8208;step method. These ultrapure nanospheres exhibit superiority in detection of CO with a lower limit of 50 ppb, which is the lowest among all reported CO chemresistive materials.








Abstract
Owing to their special photoelectric properties, halide perovskites have always attracted research attention. Hollow&#8208;structured halide perovskites have many practical applications but are challenging to prepare as most template methods violate their poor chemical and thermal stability. In this study, novel halide perovskite Cs2PdBr6 hollow nanospheres are prepared using a template&#8208;free method; specifically, large quantities of highly pure lead&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs2PdBr6 hollow nanospheres are produced at 30&#160;&#176;C without a surfactant. These ultrapure nanospheres exhibit superiority in chemresistive detection of CO with a detection limit of 50 ppb, which is the lowest among all the reported CO sensing materials. Moreover, in situ sum&#8208;frequency&#8208;generation spectra and density functional theory calculations reveal that the high sensitivity is attributable to the large specific surface area and surfactant&#8208;free surface of rich Br&#8722; vacancies that favor CO binding. Overall, this work provides insight on regulation of the halide perovskite structure and the use of hollow spheres in gas&#8208;sensing applications.

         <title>A Floating Mold Technique for the Programmed Assembly of Protocells into Protocellular Materials Capable of Non&#8208;Equilibrium Biochemical Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protocellular materials are constructed using a bottom&#8208;up strategy enabled by simple floating molds. The technique allows the fabrication of free&#8208;standing, macroscopic, and robust materials from protocell building blocks that are stable in water media, are capable of communicating both internally and with the external environment, and display rudimentary forms of emergent behaviors that are generated from the synergistic interaction of their constituent parts.








Abstract
Despite important breakthroughs in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology, a major challenge still remains the construction of free&#8208;standing, macroscopic, and robust materials from protocell building blocks that are stable in water and capable of emergent behaviors. Herein, a new floating mold technique for the fabrication of millimeter&#8208; to centimeter&#8208;sized protocellular materials (PCMs) of any shape that overcomes most of the current challenges in prototissue engineering is reported. Significantly, this technique also allows for the generation of 2D periodic arrays of PCMs that display an emergent non&#8208;equilibrium spatiotemporal sensing behavior. These arrays are capable of collectively translating the information provided by the external environment and are encoded in the form of propagating reaction&#8211;diffusion fronts into a readable dynamic signal output. Overall, the methodology opens up a route to the fabrication of macroscopic and robust tissue&#8208;like materials with emergent behaviors, providing a new paradigm of bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology and biomimetic materials science.

         <title>Novel Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque Generation at Room Temperature in an All&#8208;Oxide Epitaxial La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/SrIrO3 System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;oxide, SrTiO3//La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO)/SrIrO3 (SIO) heterostructure with lattice&#8208;matched crystal structure is synthesized, exhibiting an epitaxial and atomically sharp interface between the ferromagnetic LSMO and the high spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled metal SIO. Remarkably, epitaxial LSMO/SIO exhibits a large spin&#8211;orbit torque efficiency, &#958;||&#160;=&#160;1, while retaining a reasonably low shunting factor and increasing the effective magnetization of LSMO by &#8776;50%.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs) that arise from materials with large spin&#8211;orbit coupling offer a new pathway for energy&#8208;efficient and fast magnetic information storage. SOTs in conventional heavy metals and topological insulators are explored extensively, while 5d transition metal oxides, which also host ions with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, are a relatively new territory in the field of spintronics. An all&#8208;oxide, SrTiO3 (STO)//La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO)/SrIrO3 (SIO) heterostructure with lattice&#8208;matched crystal structure is synthesized, exhibiting an epitaxial and atomically sharp interface between the ferromagnetic LSMO and the high spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled metal SIO. Spin&#8208;torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST&#8208;FMR) is used to probe the effective magnetization and the SOT efficiency in LSMO/SIO heterostructures grown on STO substrates. Remarkably, epitaxial LSMO/SIO exhibits a large SOT efficiency, &#958;||&#160;=&#160;1, while retaining a reasonably low shunting factor and increasing the effective magnetization of LSMO by &#8776;50%. The findings highlight the significance of epitaxy as a powerful tool to achieve a high SOT efficiency, explore the rich physics at the epitaxial interface, and open up a new pathway for designing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;efficient spintronic devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin&#8211;orbit torques (SOTs) that arise from materials with large spin&#8211;orbit coupling offer a new pathway for energy-efficient and fast magnetic information storage. SOTs in conventional heavy metals and topological insulators are explored extensively, while 5d transition metal oxides, which also host ions with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, are a relatively new territory in the field of spintronics. An all-oxide, SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (STO)//La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LSMO)/SrIrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (SIO) heterostructure with lattice-matched crystal structure is synthesized, exhibiting an epitaxial and atomically sharp interface between the ferromagnetic LSMO and the high spin&#8211;orbit-coupled metal SIO. Spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) is used to probe the effective magnetization and the SOT efficiency in LSMO/SIO heterostructures grown on STO substrates. Remarkably, epitaxial LSMO/SIO exhibits a large SOT efficiency, &#958;&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;=&#160;1, while retaining a reasonably low shunting factor and increasing the effective magnetization of LSMO by &#8776;50%. The findings highlight the significance of epitaxy as a powerful tool to achieve a high SOT efficiency, explore the rich physics at the epitaxial interface, and open up a new pathway for designing next-generation energy-efficient spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unravelling Magnetic Nanochain Formation in Dispersion for In Vivo Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticles in dispersion can be controlled to form flexible and reversible chains in the presence of a magnetic field, which is useful for biomedical applications. The role of control parameters is determined and these novel assemblies formed in dispersions are visualized using advanced scattering methods and reverse Monte Carlo simulations.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) into 1D chains is appealing, because of their biocompatibility and higher mobility compared to 2D/3D assemblies while traversing the circulatory passages and blood vessels for in vivo biomedical applications. In this work, parameters such as size, concentration, composition, and magnetic field, responsible for chain formation of IONPs in a dispersion as opposed to spatially confining substrates, are examined. In particular, the monodisperse 27&#160;nm IONPs synthesized by an extended LaMer mechanism are shown to form chains at 4 mT, which are lengthened with applied field reaching 270&#160;nm at 2.2 T. The chain lengths are completely reversible in field. Using a combination of scattering methods and reverse Monte Carlo simulations the formation of chains is directly visualized. The visualization of real&#8208;space IONPs assemblies formed in dispersions presents a novel tool for biomedical researchers. This allows for rapid exploration of the behavior of IONPs in solution in a broad parameter space and unambiguous extraction of &#8203;the parameters of the equilibrium structures. Additionally, it can be extended to study novel assemblies formed by more complex geometries of IONPs.

         <title>Bioinspired Dual&#8208;Mode Temporal Communication via Digitally Programmable Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A digitally programmable phase&#8208;change material is reported, for which the crystallization kinetics can be controlled in a pixelated manner. It enables secured temporal communications in both optical and infrared modes, and the stored information can self&#8208;evolve with time, standing in sharp contrast to stimuli&#8208;responsive color/infrared change of other systems.








Abstract
Switchable optical properties are essential for numerous technologies including communication, anticounterfeiting, camouflage, and imaging/sensing. Typically, the switching is enabled by applying external stimulation such as UV light for fluorescence detection. In contrast, ground squirrels utilize spontaneous live infrared emission for fencing off predators as a unique way of communication. Inspired by this, live evolution of both optical and thermal images for temporal communication in which time is the encoded information is demonstrated. This system is based on a digitally light&#8208;cured polymeric phase&#8208;change material for which the crystallization kinetics can be controlled in a pixelated manner. Consequently, live evolution in optical transparency during the crystallization process enables temporal optical communication. Additionally, by harnessing the dynamic evolution of the thermal enthalpy, multiple sets of time&#8208;specific information can be reversibly retrieved as self&#8208;evolving infrared thermal images. The versatility of this dual&#8208;mode temporal system expands the scope for secured communication, with potential implications for various other areas including optics, thermal regulation, and 3D/4D printing.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Bridged Graphene&#8211;Protein Supraparticles for Analog and Digital Nitric Oxide Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) can assemble into self&#8208;limited supraparticles when van der Waals forces are supplemented by coordination bonds with Tb3+ ions. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is incorporated into supraparticles, which enables a selective assay for nitric oxide (NO) with ultrahigh sensitivity. Practical for NO detection in exhaled breath, a rapid non&#8208;invasive test is approached for pulmonary inflammation, such as coronavirus pneumonia.








Abstract
Self&#8208;limited nanoassemblies, such as supraparticles (SPs), can be made from virtually any nanoscale components, but SPs from nanocarbons including graphene quantum dots (GQDs), are hardly known because of the weak van der Waals attraction between them. Here it is shown that highly uniform SPs from GQDs can be successfully assembled when the components are bridged by Tb3+ ions supplementing van der Waals interactions. Furthermore, they can be coassembled with superoxide dismutase, which also has weak attraction to GQDs. Tight structural integration of multilevel components into SPs enables efficient transfer of excitonic energy from GQDs and protein to Tb3+. This mechanism is activated when Cu2+ is reduced to Cu1+ by nitric oxide (NO)&#8212;an important biomarker for viral pulmonary infections and Alzheimer's disease. Due to multipronged fluorescence enhancement, the limit of NO detection improves 200 times reaching 10 &#215; 10&#8211;12 m. Furthermore, the uniform size of SPs enables digitization of the NO detection using the single particle detection format resulting in confident registration of as few as 600 molecules mL&#8722;1. The practicality of the SP&#8208;based assay is demonstrated by the successful monitoring of NO in human breath. The biocompatible SPs combining proteins, carbonaceous nanostructures, and ionic components provide a general path for engineering uniquely sensitive assays for noninvasive tracking of infections and other diseases.

         <title>Lotus&#8208;Root&#8208;Like Carbon Fibers Embedded with Ni&#8211;Co Nanoparticles for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lotus&#8208;root&#8208;like carbon fibers embedded with Ni&#8211;Co nanoparticles (NCH@CFs) are designed as a lithium (Li) host via facile electrospinning and the subsequent thermal annealing. Benefitting from the 3D conductive framework and the internal hollow structure with highly dispersed lithiophilic sites, the NCH@CF host can spatially regulate the electric field to effectively suppress the Li&#8208;dendrite growth and withstand severe volume expansion for long&#8208;term cycling performance in both symmetric and full cells.








Abstract
The growth of lithium (Li) dendrites and the huge volume change are the critical issues for the practical applications of Li&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, a spatial control strategy is proposed to address the above challenges using lotus&#8208;root&#8208;like Ni&#8211;Co hollow prisms@carbon fibers (NCH@CFs) as the host. The homogeneously distributed bimetallic Ni&#8211;Co particles on the N&#8208;doped carbon fibers serve as nucleation sites to effectively reduce the overpotential for Li nucleation. Furthermore, the 3D conductive network can alter the electric field. More importantly, the hierarchical lotus&#8208;root&#8208;like hollow fibers provide sufficient void space to withstand the volume expansion during Li deposition. These structural features guide the uniform Li nucleation and non&#8208;dendritic growth. As a result, the NCH@CFs host enables a very stable Li metal anode with a low voltage hysteresis during repeated Li plating/stripping for 1200 h at a current density of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformative advances are made in the field of tissue adhesives, fueled by the synergy between disciplines ranging from mechanics and chemistry to biology. A multifaceted design of tissue adhesives is presented with examples in emerging applications. Immediate opportunities and future directions are highlighted for next&#8208;generation tissue adhesives, which would make broad impact in engineering and medicine.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives can form appreciable adhesion with tissues and have found clinical use in a variety of medical settings such as wound closure, surgical sealants, regenerative medicine, and device attachment. The advantages of tissue adhesives include ease of implementation, rapid application, mitigation of tissue damage, and compatibility with minimally invasive procedures. The field of tissue adhesives is rapidly evolving, leading to tissue adhesives with superior mechanical properties and advanced functionality. Such adhesives enable new applications ranging from mobile health to cancer treatment. To provide guidelines for the rational design of tissue adhesives, here, existing strategies for tissue adhesives are synthesized into a multifaceted design, which comprises three design elements: the tissue, the adhesive surface, and the adhesive matrix. The mechanical, chemical, and biological considerations associated with each design element are reviewed. Throughout the report, the limitations of existing tissue adhesives and immediate opportunities for improvement are discussed. The recent progress of tissue adhesives in topical and implantable applications is highlighted, and then future directions toward next&#8208;generation tissue adhesives are outlined. The development of tissue adhesives will fuse disciplines and make broad impacts in engineering and medicine.

         <title>Underwater Communication and Optical Camouflage Ionogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transparent, underwater adhesive, underwater self&#8208;healable, stretchable, and 3D&#8208;printable ionogel with high ionic conductivity is developed to create a submersible soft sensor. Optical camouflage, human&#8208;body&#8208;motion detection, and barrier&#8208;free communication can be achieved by the ionogel sensor in the aquatic environment. A novel contactless sensing mechanism, which can avoid fatigue and physical damage, is also proposed.








Abstract
Marine animals, such as leptocephalus and jellyfish, can sense external stimuli and achieve optical camouflage in the aquatic environment. Fabricating an intelligent soft sensor that can mimic the capabilities of transparent marine animals and function underwater can enable transformative applications in various novel fields. However, previously reported soft sensors struggle to meet the requirements of adhesion, self&#8208;healing ability, optical transparency, and stable conductivity in the aquatic environment. Herein, high&#8208;performance ionogels by virtue of ion&#8211;dipole and ion&#8211;ion interactions between fluorine&#8208;rich poly(ionic liquid) and ionic liquid are designed. The hydrophobic dynamic viscoelastic networks provide excellent properties for ionogels, including optical transparency, adjustable mechanical properties, underwater self&#8208;healing ability, underwater adhesiveness, conductivity, and 3D printability. A mechanically compliant and visually invisible underwater soft sensor based on ionogel is developed. This sensor can achieve optical camouflage, human&#8208;body&#8208;motion detection, and barrier&#8208;free communication in the aquatic environment. A novel contactless sensing mechanism based on changing the electron transfer pathway is proposed. Several interesting functions, such as detection of water environment changes, recognition of objects, delivery of information, and even identification of human standing posture can be realized. Importantly, the ionogel sensor can avoid fatigue and physical damage in the sensing process.

         <title>Characterization and Quantification of Depletion and Accumulation Layers in Solid&#8208;State Li+&#8208;Conducting Electrolytes Using In Situ Spectroscopic Ellipsometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes are one of the few battery technologies for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the high interface resistance in contact with electrode materials is still largely unexplained. Spectroscopic ellipsometry combined with in situ electrochemistry reveals highly asymmetric space charge layer occurrence. It opens a new study field to investigate and quantify the charge layer formation in solid&#8208;state electrolytes by optical means.








Abstract
The future of mobility depends on the development of next&#8208;generation battery technologies, such as all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. As the ionic conductivity of solid Li+&#8208;conductors can, in some cases, approach that of liquid electrolytes, a significant remaining barrier faced by solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) is the interface formed at the anode and cathode materials, with chemical instability and physical resistances arising. The physical properties of space charge layers (SCLs), a widely discussed phenomenon in SSEs, are still unclear. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to characterize the accumulation and depletion layers. An optical model is developed to quantify their thicknesses and corresponding concentration changes. It is shown that the Li+&#8208;depleted layer (&#8776;190&#160;nm at 1&#160;V) is thinner than the accumulation layer (&#8776;320&#160;nm at 1&#160;V) in a glassy lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting glass ceramic electrolyte (a trademark of Ohara Corporation). The in situ approach combining electrochemistry and optics resolves the ambiguities around SCL formation. It opens up a wide field of optical measurements on SSEs, allowing various experimental studies in the future.

         <title>Localized Delivery of Theranostic Nanoparticles and High&#8208;Energy Photons using Microneedles&#8208;on&#8208;Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microneedle&#8208;based local delivery of light&#8208;responsive theranostic nanoparticles (NPs) and high&#8208;energy photons to treat brain tumors is proposed. The multifunctional theranostic NPs are delivered locally using bioresorbable microneedles. Then, high&#8208;energy photons generated from integrated bioelectronics are delivered by the light&#8208;guiding/spreading microneedles to the NPs to activate photodynamic therapy/chemotherapy. The efficacy of the proposed treatment is demonstrated with two types of brain tumor model in vivo.








Abstract
The low delivery efficiency of light&#8208;responsive theranostic nanoparticles (NPs) to target tumor sites, particularly to brain tumors due to the blood&#8211;brain barrier, has been a critical issue in NP&#8208;based cancer treatments. Furthermore, high&#8208;energy photons that can effectively activate theranostic NPs are hardly delivered to the target region due to the strong scattering of such photons while penetrating surrounding tissues. Here, a localized delivery method of theranostic NPs and high&#8208;energy photons to the target tumor using microneedles&#8208;on&#8208;bioelectronics is presented. Two types of microneedles and flexible bioelectronics are integrated and mounted on the edge of surgical forceps. Bioresorbable microneedles containing theranostic NPs deliver the NPs into target tumors (e.g., glioblastoma, pituitary adenoma). Magnetic resonance imaging can locate the NPs. Then, light&#8208;guiding/spreading microneedles deliver high&#8208;energy photons from bioelectronics to the NPs. The high&#8208;energy photons activate the NPs to treat tumor tissues by photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. The controlled thermal actuation by the bioelectronics accelerates the diffusion of chemo&#8208;drugs. The proposed method is demonstrated with mouse tumor models in vivo.

         <title>A Wearable Body Condition Sensor System with Wireless Feedback Alarm Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. A versatile laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based integrated flexible sensor system is applied to a diaper as a real&#8208;time feedback tracking system of sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness, toward secure and comfortable lives. The multifunctional wireless sensor system can especially save newborn infants&#8217; lives during sleep.








Abstract
Emerging feedback systems based on tracking body conditions can save human lives. In particular, vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. For example, the high global mortality of infants primarily owing to sudden infant death syndrome while sleeping makes request for extraordinary attentions in neonatal intensive care units or daily lives.

&lt;p&gt;Vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. A versatile laser-induced graphene-based integrated flexible sensor system is applied to a diaper as a real-time feedback tracking system of sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness, toward secure and comfortable lives. The multifunctional wireless sensor system can especially save newborn infants&#8217; lives during sleep.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging feedback systems based on tracking body conditions can save human lives. In particular, vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. For example, the high global mortality of infants primarily owing to sudden infant death syndrome while sleeping makes request for extraordinary attentions in neonatal intensive care units or daily lives. Here, a versatile laser-induced graphene (LIG)-based integrated flexible sensor system, which can wirelessly monitor the sleeping postures, respiration rate, and diaper moisture with feedback alarm notifications, is reported. A tilt sensor based on confining a liquid metal droplet inside a cavity can track at least 18 slanting orientations. A rapid and scalable laser direct writing method realizes LIG patterning in both the in-plane and out-of-plane configurations as well as the formation of nonstick conductive structures to the liquid metal. By rationally merging the LIG-based tilt, strain, and humidity sensors on a thin flexible film, the multimodal sensor device is applied to a diaper as a real-time feedback tracking system of the sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness toward secure and comfortable lives. User-friendly interfaces, which incorporate alarming functions, provide timely feedback for caregivers tending to vulnerable populations with limited self-care capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Epigenetic Remodeling Hydrogel Patches for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epi&#8208;gel provides chemosensitivity recovery and immune activation via simultaneous remodeling of tumor&#8208;initiating cells (T&#8208;IC) stemness and innate immune response. A single dose of epi&#8208;gel pools the advantages of epigenetic therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy in the treatment of multidrug&#8208;resistant triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), achieving superior therapeutic outcomes compared to conventional drug delivery.








Abstract
The induced expansion of tumor&#8208;initiating cells (T&#8208;ICs) upon repeated exposure of tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs forms a major cause for chemoresistance and cancer metastasis. Here, a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive hydrogel patch is designed to modulate the plasticity of T&#8208;ICs in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is insensitive to hormone&#8208; and HER2&#8208;targeting. The on&#8208;site formation of the hydrogel network patches tumors in a chemoresistant TNBC murine model and senses intratumoral reactive oxygen species for linker cleavage and payload release. Patch&#8208;mediated inhibition of the histone demethylase lysine&#8208;specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) epigenetically regulates the switch of T&#8208;ICs from self&#8208;renewal to differentiation, rehabilitating their chemosensitivity. Moreover, the hydrogel patch enhances tumor immunogenicity and increases T&#8208;cell infiltration via epigenetic activation of innate immunity. A single&#8208;dose of the hydrogel patch harboring LSD1 inhibitor and chemotherapy agent efficiently suppresses tumor growth, postsurgical relapse, and metastasis. The superior efficacy against multidrug resistance further reveals the broad applicability of epigenetic remodeling hydrogel patches.

         <title>Interactive Materials for Bidirectional Redox&#8208;Based Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active catechol&#8208;based film can autonomously synthesize diffusible H2O2 signals that enable interactive communication with biology. The reducing redox activities of a bacterial culture provide the electrons that poise this film for subsequent electron&#8208;donation to O2 to generate the H2O2 signaling molecule that induces redox&#8208;responsive gene expression.








Abstract
Emerging research indicates that biology routinely uses diffusible redox&#8208;active molecules to mediate communication that can span biological systems (e.g., nervous and immune) and even kingdoms (e.g., a microbiome and its plant/animal host). This redox modality also provides new opportunities to create interactive materials that can communicate with living systems. Here, it is reported that the fabrication of a redox&#8208;active hydrogel film can autonomously synthesize a H2O2 signaling molecule for communication with a bacterial population. Specifically, a catechol&#8208;conjugated/crosslinked 4&#8208;armed thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel film is electrochemically fabricated in which the added catechol moieties confer redox activity: the film can accept electrons from biological reductants (e.g., ascorbate) and donate electrons to O2 to generate H2O2. Electron&#8208;transfer from an Escherichia coli culture poises this film to generate the H2O2 signaling molecule that can induce bacterial gene expression from a redox&#8208;responsive operon. Overall, this work demonstrates that catecholic materials can participate in redox&#8208;based interactions that elicit specific biological responses, and also suggests the possibility that natural phenolics may be a ubiquitous biological example of interactive materials.

         <title>Ultrathin 2D Copper(I) 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolate Coordination Polymer Nanosheets for Efficient and Selective Gene Silencing and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Cu(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate coordination polymer, acting as both stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers of DNAzyme for cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting gene silencing and intrinsic photosensitizers for hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I photodynamic therapy (PDT), are synthesized by a bottom&#8208;up method. After integrating the DNAzyme with chlorin e6, a type II PDT photosensitizer, the obtained nanoplatform achieves superior therapeutic performance.








Abstract
Gene silencing holds promise for cancer therapeutics because of its potential to inhibit genes involved in tumor development. However, gene silencing is still restricted by its limited efficacy and safety. Nanoscale coordination polymers (CPs) emerge as promising nanocarriers for gene delivery, but their responsiveness and potential therapeutic properties have rarely been explored simultaneously. Here, multifunctional ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Cu(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate CP with a thickness of 4.5 &#177; 0.8 nm are synthesized using a bottom&#8208;up method. These CP nanosheets can act as both an effective DNAzyme nanocarrier for gene therapy and an intrinsic photosensitizer for hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is ascribed to the Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Because of the glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsiveness of the CP nanosheets, DNAzyme&#8208;loaded CP nanosheets exhibit excellent cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting gene silencing of the early growth response factor&#8208;1 (EGR&#8208;1), with messenger RNA inhibited by 84% in MCF&#8208;7 (human breast cancer cells) and only 6% in MCF&#8208;10A (normal human mammary epithelial cells). After tail intravenous injection into MCF&#8208;7&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the CP nanosheets loaded with chlorin&#8208;e6&#8208;modified DNAzyme under photoirradiation show a high antitumor efficacy (88.0% tumor regression), demonstrating a promising therapeutic platform with efficient and selective gene silencing and PDT of cancer.

         <title>High Performance of Simple Organic Phosphorescence Host&#8211;Guest Materials and their Application in Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of simple organic phosphorescence host&#8211;guest materials with high performance are successfully developed. With these materials, high&#8208;contrast labeling of tumors in living mice and encrypted patterns in thermal printing are successfully realized by taking advantage of both their long afterglow time (up to 25&#160;min in aqueous media) and high phosphorescence efficiency (43%).








Abstract
The study of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has drawn increasing attention because of its considerable theoretical research and practical application value. Currently, organic RTP materials with both high efficiency (&#934;P&#160;&gt; 20%) and a long lifetime (&#964;P&#160;&gt; 10 s) in air are still scarce due to the lack of related design guidance. Here, a new strategy to increase the phosphorescence performance of organic materials by integrating the RTP host and RTP guest in one doping system to form a triplet exciplex, is reported. With these materials, the high&#8208;contrast labeling of tumors in living mice and encrypted patterns in thermal printing are both successfully realized by taking advantage of both the long afterglow time (up to 25&#160;min in aqueous media) and high phosphorescence efficiency (43%).

         <title>Leveraging on ENZ Metamaterials to Achieve 2D and 3D Hyper&#8208;Resolution in Two&#8208;Photon Direct Laser Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon direct laser writing is enhanced to hyper&#8208;resolution by leveraging on the extraordinary laser writing collimation enabled by &#949;NZ metamaterials. The realization of ultrathin all&#8208;dielectric metalenses and a highly detailed Da Vinci's &#8220;Lady with an Ermine&#8221; bas&#8208;relief (500 nm full height) confirms full freedom in nanofabrication. These results show intriguing cues in trendsetting research scenarios and industry application.








Abstract
A novel technique is developed to improve the resolution of two&#8208;photon direct laser writing lithography. Thanks to the high collimation enabled by extraordinary &#949;NZ (near&#8208;zero) metamaterial features, ultrathin dielectric hyper&#8208;resolute nanostructures are within reach. With respect to the standard direct laser writing approach, a size reduction of 89% and 50%, in height and width respectively, is achieved with the height of the structures adjustable between 5 and 50&#160;nm. The retrieved 2D fabrication parameters are exploited for realizing extremely thin all&#8208;dielectric metalenses tailored through deep machine learning codes. The hyper&#8208;resolution achieved in the writing process enables the fabrication of a highly detailed dielectric 3D bas&#8208;relief (with full height of 500&#160;nm) of Da Vinci's &#8220;Lady with an Ermine&#8221;. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept results show intriguing cues for the current and trendsetting research scenario in anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications and ultracompact photonics, paving the way for the realization of all&#8208;dielectric and apochromatic ultrathin imaging&#160;systems.

         <title>A Bioinspired Elastic Hydrogel for Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired from nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from various contaminated sources containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only natural sunlight. Since the purification mechanism relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation and does not require water evaporation, an energy&#8208;intensive process, the solar water&#8208;purification rate is the highest reported.








Abstract
The global demand for clean and safe water will continue to grow well into the 21st century. Moving forward, the lack of access to clean water, which threatens human health and strains precious energy resources, will worsen as the climate changes. Therefore, future innovations that produce potable water from contaminated sources must be sustainable. Inspired by nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from contaminated sources using only natural sunlight. The SAG is composed of an elastic thermoresponsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) hydrogel, a photothermal polydopamine (PDA) layer, and a sodium alginate (SA) network. Production of the SAG is facile; all processing is aqueous&#8208;based and occurs at room temperature. Remarkably, the SAG can purify water from various harmful reservoirs containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only sunlight. The SAG relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation at the lower critical solution temperature. Since the purification mechanism does not require water evaporation, an energy&#8208;intensive process, the passive solar water&#8208;purification rate is the highest reported. This discovery can be transformative in the sustainable production of clean water to improve the quality of human life.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive Smart Hydrogel Releasing Immune Adjuvant Synchronized with Repeated Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy to Boost Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alginate is conjugated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) aptamer, which is hybridized with immunoadjuvant CpG oligonucleotide. Upon intratumoral injection, alginate&#8208;based smart hydrogel is formed in situ. Low doses of oxaliplatin or X&#8208;rays, while inducing immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, can trigger release of ATP, which competitively binds with an ATP&#8208;specific aptamer to trigger CpG release to boost antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Certain chemotherapeutics and forms of ionizing radiation can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). If there simultaneously exist immune adjuvants within the tumor, such antitumor immunity would be further amplified. However, as clinical chemo/radiotherapies are usually repeatedly given at low individual doses, it would be impractical to administrate immune adjuvants into tumors at each dose of chemo/radiotherapies. Thus, a smart hydrogel is developed that releases immune adjuvants in response to repeatedly applied chemo&#8208;/radiotherapies. Herein, alginate is conjugated with an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;specific aptamer, which is hybridized with immunoadjuvant CpG oligonucleotide. Upon intratumoral injection, alginate&#8208;based hydrogel is formed in situ. Interestingly, low doses of oxaliplatin or X&#8208;rays, while inducing ICD of tumor cells, could trigger release of ATP, which competitively binds with ATP&#8208;specific aptamer to trigger CpG release. Therefore, the smart hydrogel could release the immune adjuvant synchronized with low&#8208;dose repeated chemo/radiotherapies, achieving remarkable synergistic responses in eliminating established tumors, as well as immune memory to reject re&#8208;challenged tumors. Moreover, repeated radiotherapies assisted by the smart hydrogel could inhibit distant tumor metastases, especially in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. The study presents a conceptually new strategy to boost cancer immunotherapy coherent with repeated low&#8208;dose chemo&#8208;/radiotherapies following a clinically relevant manner.

         <title>Nanoporous Intermetallic Pd3Bi for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous ordered intermetallic Pd3Bi is prepared through electrochemical etching of PdBi2, and it can achieve extraordinary catalytic performance with high selectivity and excellent stability for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) at ambient conditions. The intermetallic interaction between the Pd and neighboring Bi sites in nanoporous Pd3Bi can stabilize the transition state and lower the barrier for efficient NRR.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction at ambient temperature is a green technology for artificial nitrogen fixation but greatly challenging with low yield and poor selectivity. Here, a nanoporous ordered intermetallic Pd3Bi prepared by converting chemically etched nanoporous PdBi2 exhibits efficient electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction under ambient conditions. The resulting nanoporous intermetallic Pd3Bi can achieve high activity and selectivity with an NH3 yield rate of 59.05&#160;&#177; 2.27&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 21.52&#160;&#177; 0.71% at &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.05 m H2SO4 electrolyte, outperforming most of the reported catalysts in electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy studies combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that strong coupling between the Pd&#8211;Bi sites bridges the electron&#8208;transfer channel of intermetallic Pd3Bi, in which the Bi sites can absorb N2 molecules and lower the energy barrier of *N2 for N2 adsorption and activation. Meanwhile, the intermetallic Pd3Bi with bicontinuous nanoporous structure can accelerate the electron transport during the NRR process, thus improving the NRR performance.

The stress&#8208;free detection of cortisol using natural finger sweat is reported. Using an electrodeposited molecularly imprinted polymer with an embedded Prussian blue probe for label&#8208;free sensing and a highly permeable hydrogel for rapid natural sweat extraction from the fingertip, the sensor, in both strip and stretchable patch form factors, can detect the cortisol level in 3.5&#160;min with a simple touch.








Abstract
Tracking fluctuations of the cortisol level is important in understanding the body's endocrine response to stress stimuli. Traditional cortisol sensing relies on centralized laboratory settings, while wearable cortisol sensors are limited to slow and complex assays. Here, a touch&#8208;based non&#8208;invasive molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemical sensor for rapid, simple, and reliable stress&#8208;free detection of sweat cortisol is described. The sensor readily measures fingertip sweat cortisol via highly selective binding to the cortisol&#8208;imprinted electropolymerized polypyrrole coating. The MIP network is embedded with Prussian blue redox probes that offer direct electrical signaling of the binding event to realize sensitive label&#8208;free amperometric detection. Using a highly permeable sweat&#8208;wicking porous hydrogel, instantaneously secreted fingertip sweat can be conveniently and rapidly collected without any assistance. By eliminating time lags, such rapid (3.5&#160;min) fingertip assay enables the capture of sharp variations in cortisol levels, compared to previous methods. Such advantages are demonstrated by tracking cortisol response in short cold&#8208;pressor tests and throughout day&#8208;long circadian rhythm, along with gold&#8208;standard immunoassay validation. A stretchable epidermal MIP sensor is also described for directly tracking cortisol in exercise&#8208;induced sweat. The rapid touch&#8208;based cortisol sensor offers an attractive, accessible, stressless avenue for quantitative stress management.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics using Eutectic Acceptor Fibrils to Achieve Current Amplification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary organic solar cells are fabricated, achieving a significant JSC boost by virtue of an optimized crystalline feature with the formation of a eutectic mixture with better acceptor crystalline fibrils. The optimal morphology suppresses energetic disorder and recombination and increases charge transfer and transport, yielding a high efficiency of 17.84% with significant current boost.








Abstract
The intrinsic electronic properties of donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials in coupling with morphological features dictate the output in organic solar cells (OSCs). New physical properties of intimate eutectic mixing are used in nonfullerene&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 ternary blends to fine&#8208;tune the bulk heterojunction thin film morphology as well as their electronic properties. With enhanced thin film crystallinity and improved carrier transport, a significant JSC amplification is achieved due to the formation of eutectic fibrillar lamellae and reduced defects state density. Material wise, aligned cascading energy levels with much larger driving force, and suppressed recombination channels confirm efficient charge transfer and transport, enabling an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.84%. These results reveal the importance of utilizing specific material interactions to control the crystalline habit in blended films to form a well&#8208;suited morphology in guiding superior performances, which is of high demand in the next episode of OSC fabrication toward 20% PCE.

         <title>Conferring Ti&#8208;Based MOFs with Defects for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;rich Ti&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (D&#8208;MOF(Ti)) is successfully constructed by simple hydrogenation and serves as a new generation of robust sonosensitizer for enhanced sonodynamic therapy. Moreover, it also exhibits a high level of Fenton&#8208;like activity to amplify production of reactive oxygen species under ultrasound irradiation. Besides, the degradability of D&#8208;MOF(Ti) is a bright spot for promoting its clinical transformation.








Abstract
The development of highly efficient, multifunctional, and biocompatible sonosensitizer is still a priority for current sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Herein, a defect&#8208;rich Ti&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (D&#8208;MOF(Ti)) with greatly improved sonosensitizing effect is simply constructed and used for enhanced SDT. Compared with the commonly used sonosensitizer TiO2, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) results in a superior reactive oxygen species (ROS) yield under ultrasound (US) irradiation due to its narrow bandgap, which principally improves the US&#8208;triggered electron&#8211;hole separation. Meanwhile, due to the existence of Ti3+ ions, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) also exhibits a high level of Fenton&#8208;like activity to enable chemodynamic therapy. Particularly, US as the excitation source of SDT can simultaneously enhance the Fenton&#8208;like reaction to achieve remarkably synergistic outcomes for oncotherapy. More importantly, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) can be degraded and metabolized out of the body after completion of its therapeutic functions without off&#8208;target toxicity. Overall, this work identifies a novel Ti&#8208;familial sonosensitizer harboring great potential for synergistic sonodynamic and chemodynamic cancer therapy.

         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;stabilized Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide (LMR) cathode for a practical Li&#8208;ion battery system through a novel structural and morphological design is reported: a relatively delocalized excess&#8208;Li system in sub&#8208;micrometer particles. The lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;stabilized LMR exhibits an outstanding energy density over other prospective cathode materials, and a long&#8208;lasting cycle retention in full&#8208;cells in practical conditions.








Abstract
In recent years, Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMRs) have been vigorously explored as promising cathodes for next&#8208;generation, Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their high specific energy. Nevertheless, their actual implementation is still far from a reality since the trade&#8208;off relationship between the particle size and chemical reversibility prevents LMRs from achieving a satisfactory, industrial energy density. To solve this material dilemma, herein, a novel morphological and structural design is introduced to Li1.11Mn0.49Ni0.29Co0.11O2, reporting a sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;level LMR with a relatively delocalized, excess&#8208;Li system. This system exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 2880&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and a long&#8208;lasting cycle retention of 83.1% after the 100th cycle for 45 &#176;C full&#8208;cell cycling, despite its practical electrode conditions. This outstanding electrochemical performance is a result of greater lattice&#8208;oxygen stability in the delocalized excess&#8208;Li system because of the low amount of highly oxidized oxygen ions. Geometric dispersion of the labile oxygen ions effectively suppresses oxygen evolution from the lattice when delithiated, eradicating the rapid energy degradation in a practical cell system.

         <title>Near&#8208;Field Characterization of Higher&#8208;Order Topological Photonic States at Optical Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A higher&#8208;order topological photonic metasurface is studied using near&#8208;field techniques to show conclusively topological transition accompanied by the emergence of the Wannier&#8208;type dipole polarization. Measurements across different boundaries reveal a hierarchy of topological boundary states: i) the first order edge states and ii) the second order corner states, including states induced by the long&#8208;range interactions within the metasurface.








Abstract
Higher&#8208;order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a new type of topological system, supporting boundary states localized over boundaries, two or more dimensions lower than the dimensionality of the system itself. Interestingly, photonic HOTIs can possess a richer physics than their original condensed matter counterpart, supporting conventional HOTI states based on tight&#8208;binding coupling, and a new type of topological HOTI states enabled by long&#8208;range interactions. Here, a new mechanism to establish all&#8208;dielectric infrared HOTI metasurfaces exhibiting both types of HOTI states is proposed, supported by a topological transition accompanied by the emergence of topological Wannier&#8208;type polarization. Two kinds of near&#8208;field experimental studies are performed: i) the solid immersion spectroscopy and ii) near&#8208;field imaging using scattering scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy to directly observe the topological transition and the emergence of HOTI states of two types. It is shown that the near&#8208;field profiles indicate the displacement of the Wannier center across the topological transition leading to the topological dipole polarization and emergence of the topological boundary states. The proposed all&#8208;dielectric HOTI metasurface offers a new approach to confine the optical field in micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale topological cavities and thus paves the way to achieve a novel nanophotonic technology.

&lt;p&gt;Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a new type of topological system, supporting boundary states localized over boundaries, two or more dimensions lower than the dimensionality of the system itself. Interestingly, photonic HOTIs can possess a richer physics than their original condensed matter counterpart, supporting conventional HOTI states based on tight-binding coupling, and a new type of topological HOTI states enabled by long-range interactions. Here, a new mechanism to establish all-dielectric infrared HOTI metasurfaces exhibiting both types of HOTI states is proposed, supported by a topological transition accompanied by the emergence of topological Wannier-type polarization. Two kinds of near-field experimental studies are performed: i) the solid immersion spectroscopy and ii) near-field imaging using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy to directly observe the topological transition and the emergence of HOTI states of two types. It is shown that the near-field profiles indicate the displacement of the Wannier center across the topological transition leading to the topological dipole polarization and emergence of the topological boundary states. The proposed all-dielectric HOTI metasurface offers a new approach to confine the optical field in micro- and nano-scale topological cavities and thus paves the way to achieve a novel nanophotonic technology.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 22% via Small&#8208;Molecule Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing and mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination defects in perovskite materials are still crucial prerequisites for achieving high performance in light&#8208;emitting applications. Ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate is introduced in antisolvent to passivate surface and bulk defects during the spinning process, and external quantum efficiency of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes as high as 22.49% is demonstrated.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are considered as particularly attractive candidates for high&#8208;quality lighting and displays, due to possessing the features of wide gamut and real color expression. However, most PeLEDs are made from polycrystalline perovskite films that contain a high concentration of defects, including point and extended imperfections. Reducing and mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination defects in perovskite materials are still crucial prerequisites for achieving high performance in light&#8208;emitting applications. Here, ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) is introduced as a functional additive dissolved in antisolvent to passivate surface and bulk defects during the spinning process. The ETPTA can effectively decrease the charge trapping states by passivation and/or suppression of defects. Eventually, the perovskite films that are sufficiently passivated by ETPTA make the devices achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.49%. To our knowledge, these are the most efficient green PeLEDs up to now. In addition, a threefold increase in the T50 operational time of the devices was observed, compared to control samples. These findings provide a simple and effective strategy to make highly efficient perovskite polycrystalline films and their optoelectronics devices.

         <title>Pt Single Atoms Supported on N&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Hollow Carbon Spheres with Enhanced Electrocatalytic H2&#8208;Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N&#8208;doped mesoporous hollow carbon sphere supported Pt single atom (Pt1/NMHCS) composite for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is fabricated by a novel strategy. Owing to the strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction in the unique N1&#8722;Pt&#8722;C2 coordination structure that significantly alters the electronic structure of the Pt 5d states, both the reduction of adsorbed H+ and the generation of H2 are promoted, thus leading to bare&#8208;Pt&#8208;like activity and extraordinary durability for HER.








Abstract
The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) plays a crucial role in catalysis as it can induce electron transfer between metal and support, modulate the electronic state of the supported metal, and optimize the reduction of intermediate species. In this work, the tailoring of electronic structure of Pt single atoms supported on N&#8208;doped mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (Pt1/NMHCS) via strong EMSI engineering is reported. The Pt1/NMHCS composite is much more active and stable than the nanoparticle (PtNP) counterpart and commercial 20&#160;wt% Pt/C for catalyzing the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), exhibiting a low overpotential of 40&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a high mass activity of 2.07 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 50&#160;mV overpotential, a large turnover frequency of 20.18 s&#8722;1 at 300&#160;mV overpotential, and outstanding durability in acidic electrolyte. Detailed spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the strong EMSI effect in a unique N1&#8722;Pt1&#8722;C2 coordination structure significantly tailors the electronic structure of Pt 5d states, resulting in promoted reduction of adsorbed proton, facilitated H&#8722;H coupling, and thus Pt&#8208;like HER activity. This work provides a constructive route for precisely designing single&#8208;Pt&#8208;atom&#8208;based robust electrocatalysts with high HER activity and durability.

Two new orange&#8211;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, PzTDBA and PzDBA, are developed based on the acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor configuration. The TADF devices fabricated with 5 wt% PzTDBA and PzDBA as emitting dopants show maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.3% and 21.8% with extremely low roll&#8208;off of 3.6% and 3.2% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2. The high efficiency and low roll&#8208;off is due to the high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and short delayed exciton lifetime.








Abstract
Two new orange&#8211;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, PzTDBA and PzDBA, are reported. These materials are designed based on the acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A) configuration, containing rigid boron acceptors and dihydrophenazine donor moieties. These materials exhibit a small &#916;EST of 0.05&#8211;0.06&#160;eV, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as near unity, and short delayed exciton lifetime (&#964;d) of less than 2.63 &#181;s in 5 wt% doped film. Further, these materials show a high reverse intersystem crossing rate (krisc) on the order of 106 s&#8722;1. The TADF devices fabricated with 5 wt% PzTDBA and PzDBA as emitting dopants show maximum EQE of 30.3% and 21.8% with extremely low roll&#8208;off of 3.6% and 3.2% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and electroluminescence (EL) maxima at 576 nm and 595&#160;nm, respectively. The low roll&#8208;off character of these materials is analyzed by using a roll&#8208;off model and the exciton annihilation quenching rates are found to be suppressed by the fast krisc and short delayed exciton lifetime. These devices show operating device lifetimes (LT50) of 159 and 193 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 for PzTDBA and PzDBA, respectively. The high efficiency and low roll&#8208;off of these materials are attributed to the good electronic properties originatng from the A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecular configuration.

         <title>Optically and Electrocatalytically Decoupled Si Photocathodes with a Porous Carbon Nitride Catalyst for Nitrogen Reduction with Over 61.8% Faradaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Si photocathode with a unique design, in which the light&#8208;harvesting and electrocatalysis components in the monolithic device are spatially decoupled, exhibits outstanding photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction activity with maximum Faradaic efficiency of 61.8% and NH3 yield of 13.8 &#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at a low applied potential of &#8722;0.10&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.








Abstract
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) approach is attractive as a promising route for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) toward ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the challenges in synergistic management of optical, electrical, and catalytic properties have limited the efficiency of PEC NRR devices. Herein, to enhance light&#8208;harvesting, carrier separation/transport, and the catalytic reactions, a concept of decoupling light&#8208;harvesting and electrocatalysis by employing a cascade n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode is implemented.

&lt;p&gt;A Si photocathode with a unique design, in which the light-harvesting and electrocatalysis components in the monolithic device are spatially decoupled, exhibits outstanding photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction activity with maximum Faradaic efficiency of 61.8% and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 13.8 &#181;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a low applied potential of &#8722;0.10&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photoelectrochemical (PEC) approach is attractive as a promising route for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) toward ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) synthesis. However, the challenges in synergistic management of optical, electrical, and catalytic properties have limited the efficiency of PEC NRR devices. Herein, to enhance light-harvesting, carrier separation/transport, and the catalytic reactions, a concept of decoupling light-harvesting and electrocatalysis by employing a cascade &lt;i&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;np&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-Si photocathode is implemented. Such a decoupling design not only abolishes the parasitic light blocking but also concurrently improves the optical and electrical properties of the &lt;i&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;np&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-Si photocathode without compromising the efficiency. Experimental and density functional theory studies reveal that the porous architecture and N-vacancies promote N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption of the Au/porous carbon nitride (PCN) catalyst. Impressively, an &lt;i&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;np&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-Si photocathode integrating the Au/PCN catalyst exhibits an outstanding PEC NRR performance with maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 61.8% and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production yield of 13.8 &#181;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.10&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is the highest FE at low applied potential ever reported for the PEC NRR.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reconstructable Gradient Structures and Reprogrammable 3D Deformations of Hydrogels with Coumarin Units as the Photolabile Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reprogrammable shape&#8208;morphing of hydrogels is realized on the basis of reconstructable gradient networks containing coumarin units as photolabile crosslinks. Reversible photodimerization and photocleavage of coumarins at specific regions of one hydrogel are directed by photolithography. The reprogrammed structural gradients result in distinct internal stresses and 3D deformations of the hydrogel into different configurations.








Abstract
Morphing hydrogels have versatile applications in soft robotics, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices. Controlling component distribution and internal stress within a hydrogel is crucial for shape&#8208;changing. However, existing gradient structures of hydrogels are usually non&#8208;reconstructable, once encoded by chemical reactions and covalent bonds. Fabricating hydrogels with distinct gradient structures is inevitable for every new configuration, resulting in poor reusability, adaptability, and sustainability that are disadvantageous for diverse applications. Herein, a hydrogel containing reversible photo&#8208;crosslinks that enable reprogramming of the gradient structures and 3D deformations into various configurations is reported. The hydrogel is prepared by micellar polymerization of hydrophobic coumarin monomer and hydrophilic acrylic acid. The presence of hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride micelles increases the local concentration of coumarin units and also improves the mechanical properties of the hydrogel by forming robust polyelectrolyte/surfactant complexes that serve as the physical crosslinks. High&#8208;efficiency photodimerization and photocleavage reactions of coumarins are realized under 365 and 254 nm light irradiation, respectively, affording reversible tuning of the network structure of the hydrogel. Through photolithography, different gradient structures are sequentially patterned in one hydrogel that direct the deformations into distinct configurations. Such a strategy should be applicable for other photolabile hydrogels toward reprogrammable control of network structures and versatile functions.

         <title>Antimony Nanopolyhedrons with Tunable Localized Surface Plasmon Resonances for Highly Effective Photoacoustic&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Synergistic Photothermal/Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy for preparing high&#8208;quality Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with tunable localized surface plasmon resonance is successfully developed. The PEGylated Sb NPHs show an ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency and good photothermal stability under irradiation at 808&#160;nm. As a result, highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergic therapies based on Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are presented.








Abstract
Antimony (Sb), a typical group VA semimetal, has rarely been studied both experimentally and theoretically in plasmonic photothermal therapy, possibly due to the lack of effective morphology&#8208;controllable methods for the preparation of high&#8208;quality Sb nanocrystals. In this study, an effective ligand&#8208;guided growth strategy to controllably synthesize Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE), good photothermal stability, as well as biocompatibility is presented. Furthermore, the modulation effect of different morphologies on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Sb NPHs in experimentation is successfully observed. When the resonance frequency of the Sb NPHs is matched well with the excitation wavelength (808&#160;nm), the PTCE of the Sb NPHs is as high as 62.1%, which is noticeably higher compared to most of the reported photothermal agents. The Sb NPHs also exhibit good photothermal stability. In addition, Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are further constructed via loading 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;tryptophan on PEGylated Sb NPHs for a highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photothermal/immune&#8208;therapy of tumors in vivo. This work can stimulate further theoretical and experimental investigations of Sb NPHs and other semimetal nanomaterials regarding their LSPR properties and inspire various potential applications of semimetals in biomedicine and sensors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Diagnostic Polymers&#8212;Inline Detection of Thermal Degradation of Unsaturated Poly(ester imide)s</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inline sensing system for degradation of polyester resins is reported, able to detect thermal degradation within widely used poly(ester imide) (PEI) resins. Trifluoroacetyl functionalized stilbenes act as sensor molecules, detecting the release of alcoholic degradation products. Solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy is able to monitor long&#8208;term degradation of the PEI resins.








Abstract
Monitoring polymer degradation is an important quest, particularly relevant for industry. Although many indirect methodologies for assessing polymer degradation exist, only few are applicable for an inline&#8208;monitoring via optic detection&#8208;systems. An inline&#8208;monitoring system is introduced for the thermal degradation of crosslinked poly(ester imide)s (PEIs) by embedding trifluoroacetyl functionalized stilbene molecules, serving as chemosensors to track the release of generated alcoholic byproducts. Nucleophilic addition of an alcohol to the sensors trifluoroacetyl functionality triggers hemiacetal formation which is accompanied by significant changes in optical properties, in turn allowing monitoring of sensor activation by direct spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectroscopy offers an easy detection tool for the inline thermal monitoring of PEI&#8208;degradation.

         <title>Superkinetic Growth of Oval Organic Semiconductor Microcrystals for Chaotic Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superkinetic crystal growth strategy is developed to synthesize semiconductor microcrystals with smoothly curved surfaces by breaking the crystal growth anisotropy. The oval organic semiconductor microcrystals constitute fully chaotic optical microresonators, which enable low&#8208;threshold directional lasing.








Abstract
Synthesis of novel mesoscopic semiconductor architectures continually generates new photonic knowledge and applications. However, it remains a great challenge to synthesize semiconductor microcrystals with smoothly curved surfaces owing to the crystal growth anisotropy. Here, a superkinetic crystal growth method is developed to synthesize 2D oval organic semiconductor microcrystals. The solid source dispersion induces an exceptionally large molecular supersaturation for vapor deposition, which breaks the crystal growth anisotropy. The synthesized stadium&#8208;shaped organic semiconductor microcrystals naturally constitute fully chaotic optical microresonators. They support low&#8208;threshold lasing on high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor scar modes localized near the stadium boundary and directional laser emission assisted by the chaotic modes. These results will reshape the understanding of the crystal growth theory and provide valuable guidance for crystalline photonic materials design.

In article number 2006104, Arben Merko&#231;i and co&#8208;workers consider the unique properties of nanomaterials that will enable, in the near future, the development of point&#8208;of&#8208;care sensors for the detection of microbiome&#8208;related biomarkers. A graphene&#8208;based &#8220;fishing net&#8221; is illustrated here, which is thrown to catch different types of biomarkers, such as microorganisms, nucleic acids, or other molecules related to the human microbiome.

         <title>Metasurfaces: Near&#8208;Field Characterization of Higher&#8208;Order Topological Photonic States at Optical Frequencies (Adv. Mater. 18/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004376 Andrea Al&#249;, Alexander B. Khanikaev, and co&#8208;workers apply a near&#8208;field technique to investigate a higher&#8208;order topological photonic metasurface. They show that the near&#8208;field profiles reveal the topological nature of the optical modes (depicted as a torus). Topology manifests in the displacement of the Wannier center, giving rise to the topological dipole polarization and emergence of the topological boundary states observed in the optical near&#8208;field.

         <title>Chemosensors: Self&#8208;Diagnostic Polymers&#8212;Inline Detection of Thermal Degradation of Unsaturated Poly(ester imide)s (Adv. Mater. 18/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inline sensing system for degradation of polyester resins  is reported by Wolfgang Binder and co&#8208;workers in article number 2100068, which is able to detect thermal degradation within poly(ester imide) resins, widely used as a coating  material for copper wires in electric motors. Trifluoroacetyl&#8208;functionalized stilbenes act as sensor molecules, detecting the release of alcoholic degradation products by solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, due to emission shifts induced by the hemiacetal formation, thus allowing monitoring of long&#8208;term degradation of the PEI resins.

         <title>Organic Solar Cells: High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics using Eutectic Acceptor Fibrils to Achieve Current Amplification (Adv. Mater. 18/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2007177, Feng Liu and co&#8208;workers report the fabrication of ternary organic solar cells, achieving a significant JSC boost, by virtue of their optimized crystalline feature, with the formation of eutectic crystalline fibrils. The optimal morphology suppresses energetic disorder and nongeminate recombination, and increases charge transfer and transport, yielding a high efficiency of 17.84% with significant current amplification.

The human microbiome is an enormous source of clinical information and a promising area of personalized and precision medicine. Point&#8208;of&#8208;care medical nanobiosensors might define the landscape of microbiome&#8208;related diagnostics by exploiting the outstanding properties of nanomaterials. The strategies of international scientific consortia, diagnostics market, and the legal and societal issues related to this field are reviewed.








Abstract
Monitoring of the human microbiome is an emerging area of diagnostics for personalized medicine. Here, the potential of different nanomaterials and nanobiosensing technologies is reviewed for the development of novel diagnostic devices for the detection and measurement of microbiome&#8208;related biomarkers. Moreover, the current and future landscape of microbiome&#8208;based diagnostics is defined by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of current nanotechnology&#8208;based approaches, especially in the context of developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) devices that would meet the international guidelines known as REASSURED (Real&#8208;time connectivity; Ease of specimen collection; Affordability; Sensitivity; Specificity; User&#8208;friendliness; Rapid &amp; robust operation; Equipment&#8208;free; and Deliverability). Finally, the strategies of the latest international scientific consortia working in this field are analyzed, the current microbiome diagnostics market are reported and the principal ethical, legal, and societal issues related to microbiome R&amp;D and innovation are discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in 2D Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct superconductivity of 2D superconductors is discussed comprehensively based on the material structure characteristics and modulation methods. Perspectives on the unconventional superconductivity, Ising superconductivity, and topological superconductivity are also provided on the basis of experiment&#8208;based literature to date.








Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in 2D materials has attracted much attention and there has been rapid development in recent years because of their fruitful physical properties, such as high transition temperature (Tc), continuous phase transition, and enhanced parallel critical magnetic field (Bc). Tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring different physical parameters to figure out the mechanisms behind the unexpected superconductivity phenomena, including adjusting the thickness of samples, fabricating various heterostructures, tuning the carrier density by electric field and chemical doping, and so on. Here, different types of 2D superconductivity with their unique characteristics are introduced, including the conventional Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer superconductivity in ultrathin films, high&#8208;Tc superconductivity in Fe&#8208;based and Cu&#8208;based 2D superconductors, unconventional superconductivity in newly discovered twist&#8208;angle bilayer graphene, superconductivity with enhanced Bc, and topological superconductivity. A perspective toward this field is then proposed based on academic knowledge from the recently reported literature. The aim is to provide researchers with a clear and comprehensive understanding about the newly developed 2D superconductivity and promote the development of this field much further.

         <title>Recent Progress in Cartilage Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the origins of the outstanding lubricity of healthy articular cartilage is crucial both to potentially treat osteoarthritis symptoms, and for the design of better biomaterials. The mechanism of lubrication in the joints, in particular focusing on boundary lubrication is reviewed, and the recent development of natural and of bioinspired lubricants are explored.








Abstract
Healthy articular cartilage, covering the ends of bones in major joints such&#160;as hips and knees, presents the most efficiently&#8208;lubricated surface known in nature, with friction coefficients as low as 0.001 up to physiologically high pressures. Such low friction is indeed essential for its well&#8208;being. It minimizes wear&#8208;and&#8208;tear and hence the cartilage degradation associated with osteoarthritis, the most common joint disease, and, by reducing shear stress on the mechanotransductive, cartilage&#8208;embedded chondrocytes (the only cell type in the cartilage), it regulates their function to maintain homeostasis. Understanding the origins of such low friction of the articular cartilage, therefore, is of major importance in order to alleviate disease symptoms, and slow or even reverse its breakdown. This progress report considers the relation between frictional behavior and the cellular mechanical environment in the cartilage, then reviews the mechanism of lubrication in the joints, in particular focusing on boundary lubrication. Following recent advances based on hydration lubrication, a proposed synergy between different molecular components of the synovial joints, acting together in enabling the low friction, has been proposed. Additionally, recent development of natural and bio&#8208;inspired lubricants is reviewed.

         <title>Engineering Permanent Porosity into Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in the emerging field of porous liquids is reviewed. These liquids reported to date are classified, and particular attention is given to their design strategies and the relationship between the structures of the porous liquids and their properties. Challenges including preparation, scale&#8208;up of synthesis, volatility, thermal and chemical stability, and relatively small pore volumes are also discussed.








Abstract
The possibility of engineering well&#8208;defined pores into liquid materials is fascinating from both a conceptual and an applications point of view. Although the concept of porous liquids was proposed in 2007, these materials had remained hypothetical due to the technical challenges associated with their synthesis. Over the past five years, however, reports of the successful construction of porous liquids based on existing porous scaffolds, such as coordination cages, organic cages, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, porous carbons, zeolites, and porous polymers, have started to emerge. Here, the focus is on these early reports of porous liquids as prototypes in the field, classified according to the previously defined types of porous liquids. Particular attention will be paid to design strategies and structure&#8211;property relationships. Porous liquids have already exhibited promising applications in gas storage, transportation, and chemical separations. Thus, they show great potential for use in the chemical industry. The challenges of preparation, scale&#8208;up, volatility, thermal and chemical stability, and competition with porous solids will also be discussed.
