         <title>High Throughput Characterization of Organic Thin Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective article provides a comprehensive overview of how the research group has adopted &#8220;hybrid automation&#8221; by using simple automatic electrical testers (autotesters) as a tool to increase productivity and enhance reproducibility in organic thin film transistor (OTFT) research. The autotester enables OTFT research acceleration within the large parameter spaces created by both diverse material roles and device architectures.








Abstract
Automation is vital to accelerating research. In recent years,&#160;the application of self&#8208;driving labs to materials discovery and device optimization has highlighted many benefits and challenges inherent to these new technologies. Successful automated workflows offer tangible benefits to fundamental science and industrial scale&#8208;up by significantly increasing productivity and reproducibility all while enabling entirely new types of experiments. However, it's implemtation is often time&#8208;consuming and cost&#8208;prohibitive and necessitates establishing multidisciplinary teams that bring together domain&#8208;specific knowledge with specific skillsets in computer science and engineering. This perspective article provides a comprehensive overview of how the research group has adopted &#8220;hybrid automation&#8221; over the last 8 years by using simple automatic electrical testers (autotesters) as a tool to increase productivity and enhance reproducibility in organic thin film transistor (OTFT) research. From wearable and stretchable electronics to next&#8208;generation sensors and displays, OTFTs have the potential to be a key technology that will enable new applications from health to aerospace. The combination of materials chemistry, device manufacturing, thin film characterization and electrical engineering makes OTFT research challenging due to the large parameter space created by both diverse material roles and device architectures. Consequently, this research stands to benefit enormously from automation. By leveraging the multidisciplinary team and taking a user&#8208;centered design approach in the design and continued improvement of the autotesters, the group has meaningfully increased productivity, explored research avenues impossible with traditional workflows, and developed as scientists and engineers capable of effectively designing and leveraging automation to build the future of their fields to encourage this approach, the files for replicating the infrastructure are included, and questions and potential
collaborations are welcomed.

         <title>Revisiting the Epitaxial Growth Mechanism of 2D TMDC Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uncovers the pivotal role of sulfur evaporation rates in directing the growth modes of MoS2 on sapphire. Low sulfur levels preserve O/Al&#8208;terminated step edges, fostering atomic&#8208;edge epitaxy, while high sulfur levels favor S&#8208;terminated edges, promoting van der Waals epitaxy. The findings highlight that van der Waals epitaxy achieves superior MoS2 alignment (&#8776;99%) on a 2 in. wafer, offering new insights into precise 2D material fabrication.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) on sapphire substrates has been recognized as a pivotal method for producing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal films. Both step&#8208;edges and symmetry of substrate surfaces have been proposed as controlling factors. However, the underlying fundamental still remains elusive. In this work, through the molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) growth on C/M sapphire, it is demonstrated that controlling the sulfur evaporation rate is crucial for dictating the switch between atomic&#8208;edge guided epitaxy and van der Waals epitaxy. Low&#8208;concentration sulfur condition preserves O/Al&#8208;terminated step edges, fostering atomic&#8208;edge epitaxy, while high&#8208;concentration sulfur leads to S&#8208;terminated edges, preferring van der Waals epitaxy. These experiments reveal that on a 2 in. wafer, the van der Waals epitaxy mechanism achieves better control in MoS2 alignment (&#8776;99%) compared to the step edge mechanism (&lt;85%). These findings shed light on the nuanced role of atomic&#8208;level thermodynamics in controlling nucleation modes of TMDCs, thereby providing a pathway for the precise fabrication of single&#8208;crystal 2D materials on a wafer scale.

         <title>Polymeric Nanocarriers Autonomously Cross the Plant Cell Wall and Enable Protein Delivery for Stress Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cationic high aspect ratio polymeric nanocarrier is developed to deliver functional protein in crops to enable species&#8208;independent plant engineering. The delivered sensor protein reduction&#8208;oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP) successfully monitors stressors in tobacco, tomato, and maize. This functional protein delivery platform paves the way for new technologies in plant sensing and engineering, contributing to the design of new solutions that promote plant&#8208;based sustainable development.








Abstract
Delivery of proteins in plant cells can facilitate the design of desired functions by modulation of biological processes and plant traits but is currently limited by narrow host range, tissue damage, and poor scalability. Physical barriers in plants, including cell walls and membranes, limit protein delivery to desired plant tissues. Herein, a cationic high aspect ratio polymeric nanocarriers (PNCs) platform is developed to enable efficient protein delivery to plants. The cationic nature of PNCs binds proteins through electrostatic. The ability to precisely design PNCs&#8217; size and aspect ratio allowed us to find a cutoff of &#8776;14&#160;nm in the cell wall, below which cationic PNCs can autonomously overcome the barrier and carry their cargo into plant cells. To exploit these findings, a reduction&#8208;oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (roGFP) is deployed as a stress sensor protein cargo in a model plant Nicotiana benthamiana and common crop plants, including tomato and maize. In vivo imaging of PNC&#8208;roGFP enabled optical monitoring of plant response to wounding, biotic, and heat stressors. These results show that PNCs can be precisely designed below the size exclusion limit of cell walls to overcome current limitations in protein delivery to plants and facilitate species&#8208;independent plant engineering.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Manipulated Optical Chirality in Ferroelectric Vortex Domains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembly ferroelectric nanoislands with polar vortex domains and optical chirality, are designed and fabricated, leading to a reversible and nonvolatile on/off switching of optical chirality by electric fields. Such ferroelectric nanoislands, serving as discrete chiral units, can be integrated into ordered arrays and exhibit capabilities in chiral optical display functionalities.








Abstract
Manipulating optical chirality via electric fields has garnered considerable attention in the realm of both fundamental physics and practical applications. Chiral ferroelectrics, characterized by their inherent optical chirality and switchable spontaneous polarization, are emerging as a promising platform for electronic&#8208;photonic integrated circuits applications. Unlike organics with chiral carbon centers, integrating chirality into technologically mature inorganic ferroelectrics has posed a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, the successful introduction of chirality is reported into self&#8208;assembly La&#8208;doped BiFeO3 nanoislands, which exhibit ferroelectric vortex domains. By employing synergistic experimental techniques with piezoresponse force microscopy and nonlinear optical second&#8208;harmonic generation probes, a clear correlation between chirality and polarization configuration within these ferroelectric nanoislands is established. Furthermore, the deterministic control of ferroelectric vortex domains and chirality is demonstrated by applying electric fields, enabling reversible and nonvolatile generation and elimination of optically chiral signals. These findings significantly expand the repertoire of field&#8208;controllable chiral systems and lay the groundwork for the development of innovative ferroelectric optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Manipulating optical chirality via electric fields has garnered considerable attention in the realm of both fundamental physics and practical applications. Chiral ferroelectrics, characterized by their inherent optical chirality and switchable spontaneous polarization, are emerging as a promising platform for electronic-photonic integrated circuits applications. Unlike organics with chiral carbon centers, integrating chirality into technologically mature inorganic ferroelectrics has posed a long-standing challenge. Here, the successful introduction of chirality is reported into self-assembly La-doped BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoislands, which exhibit ferroelectric vortex domains. By employing synergistic experimental techniques with piezoresponse force microscopy and nonlinear optical second-harmonic generation probes, a clear correlation between chirality and polarization configuration within these ferroelectric nanoislands is established. Furthermore, the deterministic control of ferroelectric vortex domains and chirality is demonstrated by applying electric fields, enabling reversible and nonvolatile generation and elimination of optically chiral signals. These findings significantly expand the repertoire of field-controllable chiral systems and lay the groundwork for the development of innovative ferroelectric optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Schematic illustration of the periodic single&#8208;metal site catalysts (PSMSCs) with the atomically dispersed and uniform structure of metal sites, exhibiting enhanced activity, optimized selectivity, mechanism exploration ability, predictable reactivity, and intricate reaction suitability.








Abstract
Heterogeneous single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts (SMSCs), often referred to as single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), demonstrate promising catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability across a wide spectrum of reactions due to their rationally designed microenvironments encompassing coordination geometry, binding ligands, and electronic configurations. However, the inherent disorderliness of SMSCs at both atomic scale and nanoscale poses challenges in deciphering working principles and establishing the correlations between microenvironments and the catalytic performances of SMSCs. The rearrangement of randomly dispersed single metals into homogeneous and atomic&#8208;precisely structured periodic single&#8208;metal site catalysts (PSMSCs) not only simplifies the chaos in SMSCs systems but also unveils new opportunities for manipulating catalytic performance and gaining profound insights into reaction mechanisms. Moreover, the synergistic effects of adjacent single metals and the integration effects of periodic single&#8208;metal arrangement further broaden the industrial application scope of SMSCs. This perspective offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements and outlines prospective avenues for research in the design and characterizations of PSMSCs, while also acknowledging the formidable challenges encountered and the promising prospects that lie ahead.

         <title>Unveiling the Reaction Mystery Between Lithium Polysulfides and Lithium Metal Anode in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction mystery of the reaction between lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and Li metal is revealed. Lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfony)imide (LiTFSI) slowly reacts with Li metal to form a SO42&#8722;&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). LiPSs react rapidly with Li metal to form a Li2S&#8208;rich SEI with poor stability. Lithium nitrate (LiNO3) modulates the solvation structure of LiPSs to inherently suppress the reactivity of LiPSs and improves the Li anode stability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are widely regarded as one of the most promising next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy storage devices. However, soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) corrode Li metal and deteriorate the cycling stability of Li&#8211;S batteries. Understanding the reaction mechanism between LiPSs and Li metal anode is imperative. Herein, the reaction rate and products of LiPSs with Li metal anode, the composition and structure of the as&#8208;generated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and the mechanism of lithium nitrate (LiNO3) additives for inhibiting the corrosion reactions are systematically unveiled. Concretely, LiPSs react with Li metal anode more rapidly than Li salt and generate a Li2S&#8208;rich SEI. The Li2S&#8208;rich SEI is highly reactive with LiPSs, which exacerbates the formation of dendritic Li and the continuous corrosion of active Li. LiNO3 functions dominantly by modulating the solvation structure of LiPSs and inherently reducing the reactivity of LiPSs, rather than the conventional understanding of LiNO3 participating in the formation of SEI. This work reveals the reaction mechanism between LiPSs and Li metal anode and inspires rational regulating of the solvation structure of LiPSs for stabilizing Li metal anode in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Growing Hydrogel Bioadhesives for Chronic Wound Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel bioadhesive patch, which is featured with a gradual increase in mechanics in an autonomous and self&#8208;growing manner is exploited for the chronic wound management through long&#8208;term yet dynamic mechanical modulation.








Abstract
Hydrogel bioadhesives have emerged as a promising alternative to wound dressings for chronic wound management. However, many existing bioadhesives do not meet the functional requirements for efficient wound management through dynamically mechanical modulation, due to the reduced wound contractibility, frequent wound recurrence, incapability to actively adapt to external microenvironment variation, especially for those gradually&#8208;expanded chronic wounds. Here, a self&#8208;growing hydrogel bioadhesive (sGHB) patch that exhibits instant adhesion to biological tissues but also a gradual increase in mechanical strength and interfacial adhesive strength within a 120&#8208;h application is presented. The gradually increased mechanics of the sGHB patch could effectively mitigate the stress concentration at the wound edge, and also resist the wound expansion at various stages, thus mechanically contracting the chronic wounds in a programmable manner. The self&#8208;growing hydrogel patch demonstrated enhanced wound healing efficacy in a mouse diabetic wound model, by regulating the inflammatory response, promoting the faster re&#8208;epithelialization and angiogenesis through mechanical modulation. Such kind of self&#8208;growing hydrogel bioadhesives have potential clinical utility for a variety of wound management where dynamic mechanical modulation is indispensable.

         <title>Highly Efficient Wide Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells With Tunneling Junction by Self&#8208;Assembled 2D Dielectric Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;assembled 2D perovskite layer (BA&#8322;PbBr&#8324;) is engineered as a tunneling layer to mitigate the band alignment mismatch between SnO&#8322; and wide bandgap perovskite layers. This approach significantly enhanced the open&#8208;circuit voltage, achieving values of 1.30 and 1.33&#160;V, and resulted in power conversion efficiencies of 21.54% and 19.16% for bandgaps of 1.7 and 1.8 eV, respectively.








Abstract
Reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination and addressing band alignment mismatches at interfaces remain major challenges in achieving high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells. This study proposes the self&#8208;organization of a thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskite BA2PbBr4 layer beneath a wide&#8208;bandgap three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3, forming a 2D/3D bilayer structure on a tin oxide (SnO2) layer. This process is driven by interactions between the oxygen vacancies on the SnO2 surface and hydrogen atoms of the n&#8208;butylammonium cation, aiding the self&#8208;assembly of the BA2PbBr4 2D layer. The 2D perovskite acts as a tunneling layer between SnO2 and the 3D perovskite, neutralizing the energy level mismatch and reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination. This results in high power conversion efficiencies of 21.54% and 19.16% for wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells with bandgaps of 1.7 and 1.8 eV, with open&#8208;circuit voltages over 1.3 V under 1&#8208;Sun illumination. Furthermore, an impressive efficiency of over 43% is achieved under indoor conditions, specifically under 200 lux white light&#8208;emitting diode light, yielding an output voltage exceeding 1 V. The device also demonstrates enhanced stability, lasting up to 1,200 hours.

         <title>Ionizable Drugs Enable Intracellular Delivery of Co&#8208;Formulated siRNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;delivery of small molecule drugs and ribonucleic acids (RNA) in the same nanocarrier can unlock the benefits of combination therapies, but current formulation strategies are typically limited by low drug loading. Here, ionizable analogs of a colloid&#8208;forming drug, fulvestrant, are used to formulate high&#8208;content nanoparticles that encapsulate small interfering RNA (siRNA). This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study demonstrates effective siRNA delivery by ionizable drugs.








Abstract
Targeting complementary pathways in diseases such as cancer can be achieved with co&#8208;delivery of small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) and small molecule drugs; however, current formulation strategies are typically limited to one, but not both. Here, ionizable small molecule drugs and siRNA are co&#8208;formulated&#160;in drug&#8208;rich nanoparticles. Ionizable analogs of the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant self&#8208;assemble into colloidal drug aggregates and cause endosomal disruption, allowing co&#8208;delivery of siRNA against a non&#8208;druggable target. siRNA is encapsulated in lipid&#8208;stabilized, drug&#8208;rich colloidal nanoparticles where the ionizable lipid used in conventional lipid nanoparticles is replaced with an ionizable fulvestrant analog. The selection of an appropriate phospholipid and formulation buffer enables endocytosis and potent reporter gene knockdown in cancer cells. Importantly, siRNA targeting cyclin E1 is effectively delivered to drug&#8208;resistant breast cancer cells, demonstrating the utility of this approach. This strategy opens the possibility of using ionizable drugs to co&#8208;deliver RNA and ultimately improve therapeutic outcomes.

&lt;p&gt;Co-delivery of small molecule drugs and ribonucleic acids (RNA) in the same nanocarrier can unlock the benefits of combination therapies, but current formulation strategies are typically limited by low drug loading. Here, ionizable analogs of a colloid-forming drug, fulvestrant, are used to formulate high-content nanoparticles that encapsulate small interfering RNA (siRNA). This proof-of-concept study demonstrates effective siRNA delivery by ionizable drugs.

         <title>Ultrahigh Single Au Atoms Loaded Porous Aromatic Frameworks for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in situ strategy with pre&#8208;metallated monomers is employed to achieve a new porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;164) with Au single atoms loading up to a record high 45.3 wt.%. The serial PAF supported Au single atoms catalysts exhibit excellent photocatalytic activities toward hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising in heterogeneous catalysis because of their atom economy, unusual transformations, and mechanistic clarity. The metal SAs loading, however, limits the catalytic efficiency. Herein, an in situ pre&#8208;metallated monomer&#8208;based preparation strategy is shown to achieve ultrahigh Au SAs loading in catalyst formations. The polymerization of single&#8208;atom loaded monomers yield a new porous aromatic framework (PAF&#8208;164) with Au SAs loading up to a record high 45.3 wt.%. SACs of Au&#8208;PAFs exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity in hydrogen (H2) evolution, and the H2 evolution rate of Au100%&#8208;SAs&#8208;PAF&#8208;164 can reach 4.82&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with great recyclability.

         <title>Optical&#8208;Propulsion Metastructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces optical&#8208;propulsion metastructures, for enhanced laser micropropulsion performance. This metastructure achieves 99% light absorption efficiency and a material density of 0.958 g cm&#8722;3. It maintains exceptional energy conversion and structural integrity under adverse conditions. The cost&#8208;effective fabrication technique suggests scalability for future microspacecraft and nanosatellite propulsion systems.








Abstract
Pulsed laser micropropulsion (PLMP) offers a promising avenue for miniature space craft, yet conventional propellants face challenges in balancing efficiency and stability. An optical&#8208;propulsion metastructure strategy using metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is presented to generate graphene&#8208;metal metastructures (GMM), specifically GMM&#8208;(HKUST&#8208;1), which significantly enhances PLMP performance. This novel approach leverages the unique interaction between pulsed lasers and the precisely engineered GMMs&#8212;comprising optimized metal nanoparticle size, graphene layers, and inter&#8208;particle gaps&#8212;to boost both propulsion efficiency and stability. Experimental and numerical analyses reveal that GMM&#8208;(HKUST&#8208;1) achieves aspecific impulse of 1072.94 s, ablation efficiency of 51.22%, and impulse thrust per mass of 105.15 &#181;N &#181;g&#8722;1, surpassing traditional propellants. With an average particle size of &#8776;12 nm and a density of 0.958&#160;g&#160;cm&#8722;3, these metastructures exhibit 99% light absorption efficiency and maintain stability under atmospheric and humid conditions. The graphene nanolayer efficiently absorbs and converts laser energy, while the metal nanostructures enhance light&#8208;matter interactions, promoting energy transfer and material stability. These findings suggest that this GMM&#8208;based optical&#8208;propulsion strategy can revolutionize microspacecraft propulsion and energy systems, offering significant advancements across various domains.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Biomaterial for the Treatment and Prevention of Central Line&#8208;Associated Bloodstream Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
SteriGel is an injectable tissue adhesive hydrogel engineered to address central line&#8208;associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI). With its combined antimicrobial and wound&#8208;healing capabilities, SteriGel shows great potential for preventing and treating CLABSI. The hydrogel can effectively infiltrate the skin incision site surrounding the catheter, quickly solidify upon injection, adhere to skin tissue, and endure external pressures, thus guaranteeing sustained antimicrobial and healing effects.








Abstract
Central venous catheters are among the most used medical devices in hospitals today. Despite advances in modern medicine, catheter infections remain prevalent, causing significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Here, SteriGel is reported, which is a multifunctional hydrogel engineered to prevent and treat central line&#8208;associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). The mechanical properties of SteriGel are optimized to ensure appropriate gelation kinetics, bio&#8208;adhesiveness, stretchability, and recoverability to promote durability upon application and to provide persistent protection against infection. In vitro assays demonstrated that SteriGel exhibits long&#8208;term antimicrobial efficacy and has bactericidal effects against highly resistant patient&#8208;derived pathogens known to be frequently associated with CLABSI. SteriGel outperformed Biopatch, which is a clinically used device for CLABSI, in ex vivo cadaver studies that simulate clinical scenarios. Furthermore, SteriGel has biocompatible, pro&#8208;healing, and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties in vitro and in a rat subcutaneous injection model, suggesting a potential synergistic effect in the prevention and treatment of CLABSI. SteriGel is a multifunctional adherent biomaterial with potent antimicrobial effects for sustained sterility while promoting healing of the catheter incision site to protect against infection.

         <title>Substrate Induced p&#8211;n Transition for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;induced re&#8208;growth strategy is proposed to induce p&#8208; to n&#8208;transition of perovskite surface. Bulk perovskite grows on ITO/P3CT&#8208;N and shows p&#8208;type, while its surface re&#8208;grows on ITO/SnO2 and transits to n&#8208;type, introducing an interfacial junction. Resulting inverted perovskite solar cells exhibit &gt;25% efficiency with good stability, retaining 90% of initial efficiency after MPP tracking for 800&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The p&#8208; or n&#8208;type property of semiconductor materials directly determine the final performance of photoelectronic devices. Generally, perovskite deposited on p&#8208;type substrate tends to be p&#8208;type, while perovskite deposited on n&#8208;type substrate tends to be n&#8208;type. Motived by this, a substrate&#8208;induced re&#8208;growth strategy is reported to induce p&#8208; to n&#8208;transition of perovskite surface in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). p&#8208;type perovskite film is obtained and crystallized on p&#8208;type substrate first. Then an n&#8208;type ITO/SnO2 substrate with saturated perovskite solution is pressed onto the perovskite film and annealed to induce the secondary re&#8208;growth of perovskite surface region. As a result, p&#8208; to n&#8208;type transition happens and induces an extra junction at perovskite surface region, thus enhancing the built&#8208;in potential and promoting carrier extraction in PSCs. Resulting inverted PSCs exhibit high efficiency of over 25% with good operational stability, retaining 90% of initial efficiency after maximum power point (MPP) tracking for 800&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C with ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adhesive and Self&#8208;Sustainable Bioelectronic Patch for Physiological Feedback Electronic Modulation of Soft Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bionic electrical stimulation (Bio&#8208;ES), spontaneously synchronized with target neural signatures in a convenient and electronics&#8208;free form, has always been a coveted goal for the development of flexible bioelectronics technology. Targeting the above goal, the study develops a Bio&#8208;ES strategy synchronized with the vagal nerve impulses peak envelope for physiological feedback electronic modulation of visceral organs innervated by the vagal interoceptive system. In particular, it can operate self&#8208;sustainably without the need for any external energy input through a conformal self&#8208;adhesive design of tissue&#8208;device interface to realize dynamic synergizing with the real&#8208;time physiological environment via the electromechanical coupling effect.








Abstract
Bionic electrical stimulation (Bio&#8208;ES) aims to achieve personalized therapy and proprioceptive adaptation by mimicking natural neural signatures of the body, while current Bio&#8208;ES devices are reliant on complex sensing and computational simulation systems, thus often limited by the low&#8208;fidelity of simulated electrical signals, and failure of interface information interaction due to the mechanical mismatch between soft tissues and rigid electrodes. Here, the study presents a flexible and ultrathin self&#8208;sustainable bioelectronic patch (Bio&#8208;patch), which can self&#8208;adhere to the lesion area of organs and generate bionic electrical signals synchronized vagal nerve envelope in situ to implement Bio&#8208;ES. It allows adaptive adjustment of intensity, frequency, and waveform of the Bio&#8208;ES to fully meet personalized needs of tissue regeneration based on real&#8208;time feedback from the vagal neural controlled organs. With this foundation, the Bio&#8208;patch can effectively intervene with excessive fibrosis and microvascular stasis during the natural healing process by regulating the polarization time of macrophages, promoting the reconstruction of the tissue&#8208;engineered structure, and accelerating the repair of damaged liver and kidney. This work develops a practical approach to realize biomimetic electronic modulation of the growth and development of soft organs only using a multifunctional Bio&#8208;patch, which establishes a new paradigm for precise bioelectronic medicine.

         <title>Percutaneous Delivery of Oncogel for Targeted Liver Tumor Ablation and Controlled Release of Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable Oncogel (OG) comprising of a nanocomposite hydrogel loaded with an ionic liquid, chemotherapy, and a checkpoint inhibitor for achieving a predictable and uniform tumor ablation with long&#8208;term slow release of anticancer agents into the ablation zone is developed. Intratumoral injection of OG can potentially augment immunotherapy and improve outcomes in liver cancer patients.








Abstract
Advanced&#8208;stage liver cancers are associated with poor prognosis and have limited treatment options, often leading the patient to hospice care. Percutaneous intratumoral injection of anticancer agents has emerged as a potential alternative to systemic therapy to overcome tumor barriers, increase bioavailability, potentiate immunotherapy, and avoid systemic toxicity, which advanced&#8208;stage cancer patients cannot tolerate. Here, an injectable OncoGel (OG) comprising of a nanocomposite hydrogel loaded with an ionic liquid (IL) is developed for achieving a predictable and uniform tumor ablation and long&#8208;term slow release of anticancer agents into the ablation zone. Rigorous mechanical, physiochemical, drug release, cytotoxicity experiments, and ex vivo human tissue testing identify an injectable version of the OG with bactericidal properties against highly resistant bacteria. Intratumoral injection of OG loaded with Nivolumab (Nivo) and doxorubicin (Dox) into highly malignant tumor models in mice, rats, and rabbits demonstrates enhanced survival and tumor regression associated with robust tissue ablation and drug distribution throughout the tumor. Mass cytometry and proteomic studies in a mouse model of colorectal cancer that often metastasizes to the liver indicate an enhanced anticancer immune response following the intratumoral injection of OG. OG may augment immunotherapy and potentially improve outcomes in liver cancer patients.

         <title>A Pressure&#8208;Sensitive, Repositionable Bioadhesive for Instant, Atraumatic Surgical Application on Internal Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While ubiquitous in everyday life, pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (e.g., scotch tape) are limited to dry surfaces. By integrating hydrogels and pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives, a pressure&#8208;sensitive bioadhesive that adheres to internal organs is fabricated. The unique adhesive properties of pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives enable the atraumatic interfacing between surgical equipment and internal tissues for tissue stabilization and fault&#8208;tolerant integration of bioelectronics.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives are widely utilized due to their instant and reversible adhesion to various dry substrates. Though offering intuitive and robust attachment of medical devices on skin, currently available clinical pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives do not attach to internal organs, mainly due to the presence of interfacial water on the tissue surface that acts as a barrier to adhesion. In this work, a pressure&#8208;sensitive, repositionable bioadhesive (PSB) that adheres to internal organs by synergistically combining the characteristic viscoelastic properties of pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives and the interfacial behavior of hydrogel bioadhesives, is introduced. Composed of a viscoelastic copolymer, the PSB absorbs interfacial water to enable instant adhesion on wet internal organs, such as the heart and lungs, and removal after use without causing any tissue damage. The PSB's capabilities in diverse on&#8208;demand surgical and analytical scenarios including tissue stabilization of soft organs and the integration of bioelectronic devices in rat and porcine models, are demonstrated.

         <title>Sulfate Radical Based In Situ Vaccine Boosts Systemic Antitumor Immunity via Concurrent Activation of Necroptosis and STING Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfate radical based in situ vaccine (ISV) is developed by intercalating peroxydisulfate into manganese&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanoparticles. This ISV mediates advanced oxidation process in tumor microenvironment to produce SO4&#183;&#8722; that induces immunogenic necroptosis of tumor cells, and concurrently activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING)&#160;signaling pathway that augments immune cells maturation, leading to remarkable systemic T cell immunity against primary and distant/metastatic tumors.








Abstract
In situ vaccine (ISV) can provoke systemic anti&#8208;tumor immunity through the induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD). The development of ISV technology has been restricted by the limited and suboptimal ICD driven tumor antigen production which are currently relying on chemo&#8208;drugs, photo&#8208;/radio&#8208;sensitizers, oncolytic&#8208;virus and immunostimulatory agents. Herein, a sulfate radical (SO4&#183;&#8722;) based ISV is reported that accomplishes superior tumor immunotherapy dispense from conventional approaches. The ISV denoted as P&#8208;Mn&#8208;LDH is constructed by intercalating peroxydisulfate (PDS, a precursor of SO4&#183;&#8722;) into manganese layered double hydroxide nanoparticles (Mn&#8208;LDH). This design allows the stabilization of PDS under ambient condition, but triggers a Mn2+ mediated PDS decomposition in acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) to generate in situ SO4&#183;&#8722;. Importantly, it is found that the SO4&#183;&#8208; radicals not only effectively kill cancer cells, but also induce a necroptotic cell death pathway, leading to robust ICD signaling for eliciting adaptive immunity. Further, the P&#8208;Mn&#8208;LDH can activate the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to further boost anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Collectively, the P&#8208;Mn&#8208;LDH based ISV exhibited potent activity in inhibiting tumor growth and lung metastasis. When combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor, significant inhibition of distant tumors is achieved. This study underpins the promise of SO4&#183;&#8208; based vaccine technology for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Modulated Protonated Iridium Oxide for Acidic Water Oxidation in Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonated iridium oxides, known for their durability in acidic water oxidation, have limited intrinsic catalytic performance. This study demonstrates that incorporating Ru single atoms and oxygen vacancies within the Ir&#9472;O lattice can optimize oxygen intermediate binding and stabilize Ir active sites, significantly enhancing both catalytic activity and stability, leading to a highly efficient electrocatalyst in proton exchange membrane water electrolysers.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysers promise to usher in a new era of clean energy, but they remain a formidable obstacle in designing active and durable electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, a protonated iridium oxide embedded with single&#8208;atom dispersed ruthenium atoms (H3.8Ir1&#8722;xRuxO4) that demonstrates exceptional activity and stability in acidic water oxidation is introduced. The single Ru dopants favorably induce localized oxygen vacancies in the Ir&#9472;O lattice, synergistically strengthening the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and enhancing the intrinsic OER activity. In addition, the preferential oxidation of Ru and the electronegativity of the oxygen vacancies significantly stabilize the Ir&#9472;O active sites, improving the OER stability. Consequently, the H3.8Ir1&#9472;xRuxO4 catalyst shows an overpotential of 255&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and displays exceptional catalytic endurance in acidic electrolytes, surpassing 1100 h, representing a remarkable one&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in stability compared to that of pristine H3.8IrO4. A proton exchange membrane electrolyser utilizing the H3.8Ir1&#8722;xRuxO4 catalyst as an anode exhibits stable performance for more than 1280 h under a high current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2.

&lt;p&gt;Protonated iridium oxides, known for their durability in acidic water oxidation, have limited intrinsic catalytic performance. This study demonstrates that incorporating Ru single atoms and oxygen vacancies within the Ir&#9472;O lattice can optimize oxygen intermediate binding and stabilize Ir active sites, significantly enhancing both catalytic activity and stability, leading to a highly efficient electrocatalyst in proton exchange membrane water electrolysers.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proton exchange membrane water electrolysers promise to usher in a new era of clean energy, but they remain a formidable obstacle in designing active and durable electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, a protonated iridium oxide embedded with single-atom dispersed ruthenium atoms (H&lt;sub&gt;3.8&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) that demonstrates exceptional activity and stability in acidic water oxidation is introduced. The single Ru dopants favorably induce localized oxygen vacancies in the Ir&#9472;O lattice, synergistically strengthening the adsorption of OOH* intermediates and enhancing the intrinsic OER activity. In addition, the preferential oxidation of Ru and the electronegativity of the oxygen vacancies significantly stabilize the Ir&#9472;O active sites, improving the OER stability. Consequently, the H&lt;sub&gt;3.8&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;1&#9472;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Ru&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst shows an overpotential of 255&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and displays exceptional catalytic endurance in acidic electrolytes, surpassing 1100 h, representing a remarkable one-order-of-magnitude increase in stability compared to that of pristine H&lt;sub&gt;3.8&lt;/sub&gt;IrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/i&gt;Ru&lt;i&gt;

         <title>Ultrastable Carboxyl&#8208;Functionalized Pore&#8208;Space&#8208;Partitioned Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large family of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs with high porosity for gas separation have been synthesized. New Cr&#8208;MOFs are exceptionally stable in boiling water, extremely acidic (pH &lt; 0) or basic (pH &gt; 14) conditions and can be deprotonated and re&#8208;protonated following cycle of base&#8208;acid treatments, opening up applications under harsh conditions. New materials exhibit excellent adsorption properties such as high uptake capacity and promising separation performance for gas mixtures such as C2H2/CO2, C2H2/C2H4, and C6H6/C6H12.








Abstract
Isoreticular chemistry, which enables property optimization by changing compositions without changing topology, is a powerful synthetic strategy. One of the biggest challenges facing isoreticular chemistry is to extend it to ligands with strongly coordinating substituent groups such as unbound &#8722;COOH, because competitive interactions between such groups and metal ions can derail isoreticular chemistry. It is even more challenging to have an isoreticular series of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized MOFs capable of encompassing chemically disparate metal ions. Here, with the simultaneous introduction of carboxyl functionalization and pore space partition, a family of carboxyl&#8208;functionalized materials is developed in diverse compositions from homometallic Cr3+ and Ni2+ to heterometallic Co2+/V3+, Ni2+/V3+, Co2+/In3+, Co2+/Ni2+. Cr&#8208;MOFs remain highly crystalline in boiling water. Unprecedentedly, one Cr&#8208;MOF can withstand the treatment cycle with 10m NaOH and 12m HCl, allowing reversible inter&#8208;conversion between unbound &#8722;COOH acid form and &#8722;COO&#8722; base form. These materials exhibit excellent sorption properties such as high uptake capacity for CO2 (100.2 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1) and hydrocarbon gases (e.g., 142.1 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1 for C2H2, 110.5 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1 for C2H4) at 1 bar and 298K, high benzene/cyclohexane selectivity (up to &#8776;40), and promising separation performance for gas mixtures such as C2H2/CO2 and C2H2/C2H4.

         <title>Enabling Stable Operation of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries under Fast&#8208;Operating Conditions by Tuning the Electrolyte Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated ester&#8208;based fast&#8208;charging electrolytes (FCEs) facilitate an exceptional lifespan of 3000 cycles at charge rates of as high as 4 C with 0&#8211;100% state&#8208;of&#8208;charge in commercial 1 Ah graphite|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells. The superior performance is due to the well&#8208;tuned solvation structure, enhanced solvent solvation ability, and ameliorated electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase chemistry.








Abstract
Inferior fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature performances remain a hurdle for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Overcoming this hurdle is extremely challenging primarily due to the low conductivity of commercial ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;based electrolytes and the formation of undesirable solid electrolyte interphases with poor Li+&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics. Here, a series of EC&#8208;free fast&#8208;charging electrolytes (FCEs) by incorporating a fluorinated ester, methyl trifluoroacetate (MTFA), as a special cosolvent into a practically viable LiPF6&#8211;dimethyl carbonate&#8211;fluoroethylene carbonate system, is reported. With a solvent&#8208;dominated solvation structure, MTFA facilitates the formation of thin, yet robust, interphases on both the cathode and anode. Commercial 1 Ah graphite|LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 pouch cells filled with the FCE exhibit &#8776;80% capacity retention over 3000 cycles at 3 C and 4 C (15&#160;min) charging rates in the full range of 0&#8211;100% state&#8208;of&#8208;charge. Moreover, even at a low operating temperature of &#8722;20 &#176;C, the 1 Ah cell retains a high capacity of 0.65 Ah at a 2 C discharge rate and displays virtually no capacity fade on cycling at a C/5 rate. The work highlights the power of electrolyte design in achieving extra&#8208;fast&#8208;charging and low&#8208;temperature performances.

         <title>Modulating the Electronic Structure of Cobalt&#8208;Vanadium Bimetal Catalysts for High&#8208;Stable Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic structures of Co&#8208;V bimetallic electrocatalyst are precisely modulated by nitrogen and phosphate anions to enhance hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction, respectively, significantly promoting the performance of anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer.








Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to effectively couple the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for developing high&#8208;efficiency anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). Herein, a coral&#8208;like nanoarray composed of nanosheets through the synergistic layering effect of cobalt and the 1D guiding of vanadium is synthesized, which promotes extensive contact between the active sites and electrolyte. The HER and OER activities can be enhanced by modulating the electronic structure through nitridation and phosphorization, respectively, enhancing the strength of metal&#8208;H bond to optimize hydrogen adsorption and facilitating the proton transfer to improve the transformation of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. Resultantly, the AEMWE achieves a current density of 500 mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.76 V for 1000 h in 1.0 M KOH at 70&#160;&#176;C. The energy consumption is 4.21 kWh Nm&#8211;3 with the producing hydrogen cost of $0.93 per kg H2. Operando synchrotron radiation and Bode phase angle analyses reveal that during the high&#8208;energy consumed OER, the dissolution of vanadium species transforms distorted Co&#8722;O octahedral into regular octahedral structures, accompanied by a shortening of the Co&#8722;Co bond length. This structural evolution facilitates the formation of oxygen intermediates, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.

Operando synchrotron radiation and Bode phase angle analyses reveal that during the high-energy consumed OER, the dissolution of vanadium species transforms distorted Co&#8722;O octahedral into regular octahedral structures, accompanied by a shortening of the Co&#8722;Co bond length. This structural evolution facilitates the formation of oxygen intermediates, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Immunogenicity of Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have shown great potential as next&#8208;generation therapeutics and drug delivery systems. This article discusses factors influencing the immunogenicity of EVs, including origin, size, endogenous and exogenous content, production and storage methods, dosage, infusion rate, and the biomolecular corona. Strategies to mitigate immunogenicity are proposed, offering valuable insights for future clinical applications of EVs.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are promising next&#8208;generation therapeutics and drug delivery systems due to demonstrated safety and efficacy in preclinical models and early&#8208;stage clinical trials. There is an urgent need to address the immunogenicity of EVs (beyond the apparent lack of immunotoxicity) to advance clinical development. To date, few studies have assessed unintended immunological recognition of EVs. An in&#8208;depth understanding of EV&#8208;induced immunogenicity and clearance is necessary to develop effective therapeutic strategies, including approaches to mitigate immunological recognition when undesired. This article summarizes various factors involved in the potential immunogenicity of EVs and strategies to reduce immunological recognition for improved therapeutic benefit.

         <title>Fundamental Understanding of the Low Initial Coulombic Efficiency in SiOx Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Mechanisms and Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) hinders the practical application of SiOx anode. This perspective provides valuable insights into the possible causes that fundamentally result in low ICE, based on which the rational design of high ICE SiOx anodes and paves the way toward industrial application of SiOx as the next generation LIB anode.








Abstract
To meet the ever&#8208;increasing demand for high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), it is imperative to develop next&#8208;generation anode materials. Compared to conventional carbon&#8208;based anodes, Si&#8208;based materials are promising due to their high theoretical capacity and reasonable cost. SiOx, as a Si&#8208;derivative anode candidate, is particularly encouraging for its durable cycling life, the practical application of which is, however, severely hindered by low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) that leads to continuous lithium consumption. What is worse, low ICE also easily triggers a terrible chain reaction causing bad cycling stability. To further develop SiOx anode, researchers have obtained in&#8208;depth understandings regarding its working/failing mechanisms so as to further propose effective remedies for low ICE mitigation. In this sense, herein recent studies investigating the possible causes that fundamentally result in low ICE of SiOx, based on which a variety of solutions addressing the low ICE issue are discussed and summarized, are timely summarized. This perspective provides valuable insights into the rational design of high ICE SiOx anodes and paves the way toward industrial application of SiOx as the next generation LIB anode.

         <title>High&#8208;Energy Earth&#8208;Abundant Cathodes with Enhanced Cationic/Anionic Redox for Sustainable and Long&#8208;Lasting Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy and earth&#8208;abundant Na0.67Fe0.3Mn0.5Mg0.1Ti0.1O2 cathode is developed, which shows significantly improved cycling stability at a high charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V versus Na. Multiscale characterization reveals that the Mg/Ti co&#8208;doping improves the surface and bulk structural stability and enhances the cationic and anionic redox reaction reversibility during prolong cycling.








Abstract
Layered iron/manganese&#8208;based oxides are a class of promising cathode materials for sustainable batteries due to their high energy densities and earth abundance. However, the stabilization of cationic and anionic redox reactions in these cathodes during cycling at high voltage remain elusive. Here, an electrochemically/thermally stable P2&#8208;Na0.67Fe0.3Mn0.5Mg0.1Ti0.1O2 cathode material with zero critical elements is designed for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) to realize a highly reversible capacity of &#8776;210&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 and good cycling stability with a capacity retention of 74% after 300 cycles at 200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, even when operated with a high charge cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V versus sodium metal. Combining a suite of cutting&#8208;edge characterizations and computational modeling, it is shown that Mg/Ti co&#8208;doping leads to stabilized surface/bulk structure at high voltage and high temperature, and more importantly, enhances cationic/anionic redox reaction reversibility over extended cycles with the suppression of other undesired oxygen activities. This work fundamentally deepens the failure mechanism of Fe/Mn&#8208;based layered cathodes and highlights the importance of dopant engineering to achieve high&#8208;energy and earth&#8208;abundant cathode material for sustainable and long&#8208;lasting NIBs.

         <title>Spectroscopic and Interferometric Sum&#8208;Frequency Imaging of Strongly Coupled Phonon Polaritons in SiC Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;linear technique of infrared + visible sum&#8208;frequency spectro&#8208;microscopy is introduced to image phonon polaritons in SiC metasurfaces. This approach allows for access to both the spatial propagation and spectral dispersion of the polaritons with sub&#8208;wavelength spatial resolution. The hybridization and strong coupling of propagating (SPhP) and localized (LSPhP) phonon polaritons and the activation of polaritonic edge states are observed.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons enable waveguiding and localization of infrared light with extreme confinement and low losses. The spatial propagation and spectral resonances of such polaritons are usually probed with complementary techniques such as near&#8208;field optical microscopy and far&#8208;field reflection spectroscopy. Here, infrared&#8208;visible sum&#8208;frequency spectro&#8208;microscopy is introduced as a tool for spectroscopic imaging of phonon polaritons. The technique simultaneously provides sub&#8208;wavelength spatial resolution and highly&#8208;resolved spectral resonance information. This is implemented by resonantly exciting polaritons using a tunable infrared laser and wide&#8208;field microscopic detection of the upconverted light. The technique is employed to image hybridization and strong coupling of localized and propagating surface phonon polaritons in a metasurface of SiC micropillars. Spectro&#8208;microscopy allows to measure the polariton dispersion simultaneously in momentum space by angle&#8208;dependent resonance imaging, and in real space by polariton interferometry. Notably, it is possible to directly image how strong coupling affects the spatial localization of polaritons, inaccessible with conventional spectroscopic techniques. The formation of edge states is observed at excitation frequencies where strong coupling prevents polariton propagation into the metasurface. The technique is applicable to the wide range of polaritonic materials with broken inversion symmetry and can be used as a fast and non&#8208;perturbative tool to image polariton hybridization and&#160;propagation.

         <title>Manipulation of Cooper&#8208;Pair Tunneling via Domain Structure in a van der Waals Ferromagnetic Josephson Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferromagnetic Josephson junction is important for understanding the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. The NbSe2/Cr2Ge2Te6/NbSe2 ferromagnetic Josephson junction shows an unconventional dual&#8208;peak feature in the magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent critical supercurrent due to the multidomain structure of the Cr2Ge2Te6 tunnel barrier. This work helps researchers explore the interactions between Ising Cooper pairs and magnetic domains and realize practical magnetic Josephson junction devices.








Abstract
Ferromagnetic Josephson junctions play a key role in understanding the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism in condensed matter physics. The magnetic domain structures of the ferromagnet in such junctions can significantly affect the tunneling of the superconducting Cooper pairs due to the strong interactions between Cooper pairs and local magnetic moments in the ferromagnetic tunnel barrier. However, the underlying microscopic mechanism of relevant quasiparticle tunneling processes with magnetic domain structures remains largely unexplored. Here, the manipulation of Cooper&#8208;pair tunneling in the NbSe2/Cr2Ge2Te6/NbSe2 ferromagnetic Josephson junction is demonstrated by using a multidomain ferromagnetic barrier with anisotropic magnetic moments. The evolution of up&#8208;, down&#8208;magnetized domain and Bloch domain structures in Cr2Ge2Te6 barrier under external magnetic fields leads to the enhancement of the critical tunneling supercurrent and an unconventional dual&#8208;peak feature with two local maxima in the field&#8208;dependent critical current curve. The phenomenon of magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;modulated critical tunneling supercurrent can be well explained by the competition between the coherence length of tunneling Cooper pairs and the size of magnetic domain walls in Cr2Ge2Te6 barrier. This kind of ferromagnetic Josephson junction provides an intriguing material system for manipulating Cooper&#8208;pair tunneling by tuning the local magnetic moments within magnetic Josephson junction devices.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Derived Nanoparticles with Enhanced Acoustical Performance for Efficient Mechano&#8208;Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A MOF&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;doped zinc oxide nanoparticle is constructed for enhanced acoustically triggered mechano&#8208;sonodynamic therapy. The introduction of carbon (C) element improves the inherent acoustic properties of the nanoparticles, intensifying their generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cavitation effect under ultrasound (US) irradiation, thereby exhibiting potent cytotoxicity against cancer cells.








Abstract
Ultrasound (US) generates toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) by acting on sonosensitizers for cancer treatment, and the mechanical damage induced by cavitation effects under US is equally significant. Therefore, designing a novel sonosensitizer that simultaneously possesses efficient ROS generation and enhanced mechanical effects is promising. In this study, carbon&#8208;doped zinc oxide nanoparticles (C&#8208;ZnO) are constructed for mechano&#8208;sonodynamic cancer therapy. The presence of carbon (C) doping optimizes the electronic structure, thereby enhancing the ROS generation triggered by US, efficiently inducing tumor cell death. On the other hand, the high specific surface area and porous structure brought about by C doping enable C&#8208;ZnO to enhance the mechanical stress induced by cavitation bubbles under US irradiation, causing severe mechanical damage to tumor cells. Under the dual effects of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and mechanical therapy mediated by C&#8208;ZnO, excellent anti&#8208;tumor efficacy is demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, along with a high level of biological safety. This is the first instance of utilizing an inorganic nanomaterial to achieve simultaneous enhancement of ROS production and US&#8208;induced mechanical effects for cancer therapy. This holds significant importance for the future development of novel sonosensitizers and advancing the applications of US in cancer treatment.

         <title>Octahedral Nanocrystals of Ru&#8208;Doped PtFeNiCuW/CNTs High&#8208;Entropy Alloy: High Performance Toward pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ru&#8208;PtFeNiCuW&#160;HEA octahedra nanocrystals enclosed by {111} facets are deliberately prepared. The robust pH&#8208;universal HER performance of such octahedra nanocrystals is ascribed to the high activity and stability of the surface {111} facets, the specific high entropy alloy composition, the active W site for water splitting, and superior Cu and Pt sites for hydrogen desorption.








Abstract
Integrating high&#8208;entropy philosophy and nanocrystal&#8208;specific orientation into a single catalyst represents a promising strategy in development of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Nonetheless, shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanocrystals is challenging owing to the distinct redox potentials and growth dynamics of metal elements. Herein, a one&#8208;pot co&#8208;reduction method is developed to fabricate ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;doped PtFeNiCuW octahedral HEA nanocrystals onto carbon nanotubes (Ru&#8211;PtFeNiCuW/CNTs). It is demonstrated that Ru dopants and W(CO)6 promote the concurrent reduction and growth of other metal precursors to obtain higher yield and larger size of HEA nanocrystals, despite low Ru content in Ru&#8211;PtFeNiCuW/CNTs. As an electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Ru&#8211;PtFeNiCuW/CNTs exhibits low overpotentials of 9, 16, and 34&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slopes of 19.2, 27.9, and 23.1&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. As a cathodic catalyst, Ru&#8211;PtFeNiCuW/CNTs operates for up to 1500 and 1200 h in acidic and alkaline electrolyte, respectively, at a current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a two&#8208;electrode system for full water splitting. Theoretical calculations reveal accelerated kinetics of H2O dissociation on W sites and *H desorption on hollow Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cu and Cu&#8211;Cu&#8211;Pt sites.

         <title>Surface Gradient Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;rich cathode with a surface gradient is synthesized via a low&#8208;cost and scalable ammoniacal leaching method based on coordination dissolution and redox reactions. This cathode allows a full cell to exhibit impressive capacity retention and fast charging capability. Moreover, a 1.2&#160;Ah pouch cell that lasts over 500 cycles with only an 8% capacity loss is successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode material LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) has emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). These cathode materials possess high theoretical specific capacity, fast electron/ion transfer rate, and high output voltage. However, their potential is impeded by interface instability, irreversible phase transition, and the resultant significant capacity loss, limiting their practical application in LIBs. In this work, a simple and scalable approach is proposed to prepare gradient cathode material (M&#8208;NCM) with excellent structural stability and rate performance. Taking advantage of the strong coordination of Ni2+ with ammonia and the reduction reaction of KMnO4, the elemental compositions of the Ni&#8208;rich cathode are reasonably adjusted. The resulted gradient compositional design plays a crucial role in stabilizing the crystal structure, which effectively mitigates Li/Ni mixing and suppresses unwanted surficial parasitic reactions. As a result, the M&#8208;NCM cathode maintains 98.6% capacity after 200 cycles, and a rapid charging ability of 107.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 15 C. Furthermore, a 1.2 Ah pouch cell configurated with graphite anode demonstrates a lifespan of over 500 cycles with only 8% capacity loss. This work provides a simple and scalable approach for the in situ construction of gradient cathode materials via cooperative coordination and deposition reactions.

         <title>Dark Current in Broadband Perovskite&#8211;Organic Heterojunction Photodetectors Controlled by Interfacial Energy Band Offset</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, perovskite&#8211;organic heterojunction (POH) broadband photodetectors with ultra&#8208;low noise current of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;14&#160;A Hz&#8722;1/2 and a high specific detectivity of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;Jones in the NIR is shown. The underlaying physical properties of the POH devices and their application as NIR pulse oximeters with high&#8208;accuracy heartbeat monitoring at long&#8208;distance of 2&#160;m are revealed.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite and organic semiconductors are promising classes of materials for photodetector (PD) applications. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite PDs have performance metrics exceeding silicon PDs in the visible. While organic semiconductors offer bandgap tunability due to their chemical design with detection extended into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR), perovskites are limited to the visible band and the first fraction of the NIR spectrum. In this work, perovskite&#8211;organic heterojunction (POH) PDs with absorption up to 950&#160;nm are designed by the dual contribution of perovskite and the donor:acceptor bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ), without any intermediate layer. The effect of the energetics of the donor materials is systematically studied on the dark current (Jd) of the device by using the PBDB&#8208;T polymer family. Combining the experimental results with drift&#8208;diffusion simulations, it is shown that Jd in POH devices is limited by thermal generation via deep trap states in the BHJ. Thus, the best performance is obtained for the PM7&#8208;based POH, which delivers an ultra&#8208;low noise current of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;14&#160;A&#160;Hz&#8722;1/2 and high specific detectivity of 4.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1012&#160;Jones in the NIR. Last, the application of the PM7&#8208;based POH devices as NIR pulse oximeter with high&#8208;accuracy heartbeat monitoring at long&#8208;distance of 2 meters is demonstrated.

         <title>Boronic Acid&#8208;Rich Lanthanide Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Enable Deep Proteomics with Ultratrace Biological Samples</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteomic coverage is constrained due to complex pretreatments. A hybrid of four boronic acid&#8208;rich lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high protein affinity to capture proteins in ultratrace samples, is introduced. A MOFs Aided Sample Preparation (MASP) workflow that shrinks sample volume and integrates pre&#8208;handle steps into a PCR tube to minimize sample loss caused by non&#8208;specific absorption, is described.








Abstract
Label&#8208;free proteomics is widely used to identify disease mechanism and potential therapeutic targets. However, deep proteomics with ultratrace clinical specimen remains a major technical challenge due to extensive contact loss during complex sample pretreatment. Here, a hybrid of four boronic acid&#8208;rich lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with high protein affinity is introduced to capture proteins in ultratrace samples jointly by nitrogen&#8208;boronate complexation, cation&#8208;&#960; and ionic interactions. A MOFs Aided Sample Preparation (MASP) workflow that shrinks sample volume and integrates lysis, protein capture, protein digestion and peptide collection steps into a single PCR tube to minimize sample loss caused by non&#8208;specific absorption, is proposed further. MASP is validated to quantify &#8776;1800 proteins in 10 HEK&#8208;293T cells. MASP is applied to profile cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome from cerebral stroke and brain damaged patients, and identified &#8776;3700 proteins in 1&#160;&#181;L CSF. MASP is further demonstrated to detect &#8776;9600 proteins in as few as 50&#160;&#181;g mouse brain tissues. MASP thus enables deep, scalable, and reproducible proteome on precious clinical samples with low abundant proteins.

         <title>Digital Light 3D Printing of Double Thermoplastics with Customizable Mechanical Properties and Versatile Reprocessability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Digital light 3D printing of thermoplastics with customizable mechanical properties and versatile reprocessability is realized by sequentially constructing stiff and flexible double linear polymers. The obtained 3D double thermoplastics exhibit tunable mechanical properties from rigid to flexible, as well as multiple reprocessability such as self&#8208;healing and reprinting, demonstrating potential applications in soft robotics and soft electronics.








Abstract
Digital light processing (DLP) is a 3D printing technology offering high resolution and speed. Printable materials are commonly based on multifunctional monomers, resulting in the formation of thermosets that usually cannot be reprocessed or recycled. Some efforts are made in DLP 3D printing of thermoplastic materials. However, these materials exhibit limited and poor mechanical properties. Here, a new strategy is presented for DLP 3D printing of thermoplastics based on a sequential construction of two linear polymers with contrasting (stiff and flexible) mechanical properties. The inks consist of two vinyl monomers, which lead to the stiff linear polymer, and &#945;&#8208;lipoic acid, which forms the flexible linear polymer via thermal ring&#8208;opening polymerization in a second step. By varying the ratio of stiff and flexible linear polymers, the mechanical properties can be tuned with Young's modulus ranging from 1.1&#160;GPa to 0.7&#160;MPa, while the strain at break increased from 4% to 574%. Furthermore, these printed thermoplastics allow for a variety of reprocessability pathways including self&#8208;healing, solvent casting, reprinting, and closed&#8208;loop recycling of the flexible polymer, contributing to the development of a sustainable materials economy. Last, the potential of the new material in applications ranging from soft robotics to electronics is demonstrated.

         <title>Voltage&#8208;Driven Fluorine Motion for Novel Organic Spintronic Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work discovers the voltage&#8208;driven fluorine (F) motion in the La0.6Sr0.4MnO3(LSMO)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/Co junction, which can generate a huge reversible resistivity change up to 106% with ns timescale upon polarizing voltage. Removing F from PVDF layer also significantly enhances the tunneling magnetoresistance, paving the way to develop multifunctional organic spintronic memristor for storage and neuromorphic applications.








Abstract
Integrating tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in memristors is a long&#8208;term aspiration because it allows to realize multifunctional devices, such as multi&#8208;state memory and tunable plasticity for synaptic function. However, the reported TMR in different multiferroic tunnel junctions is limited to 100%. This work demonstrates a giant TMR of &#8722;266% in La0.6Sr0.4MnO3(LSMO)/poly(vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF)/Co memristor with thin organic barrier. Different from the ferroelectricity&#8208;based memristors, this work discovers that the voltage&#8208;driven florine (F) motion in the junction generates a huge reversible resistivity change up to 106% with nanosecond (ns) timescale. Removing F from PVDF layer suppresses the dipole field in the tunneling barrier, thereby significantly enhances the TMR. Furthermore, the TMR can be tuned by different polarizing voltage due to the strong modification of spin&#8208;polarization at the LSMO/PVDF interface upon F doping. Combining of high TMR in the organic memristor paves the way to develop high&#8208;performance multifunctional devices for storage and neuromorphic applications.

The method does not alter the nanopore constriction, which can be optimized to improve sensing accuracy, providing more flexibility in nanopore design. This new strategy is supported by continuum electrohydrodynamic simulations on simple geometries, atomistic simulations of biological nanopores and reversal potential.








Abstract
Nanopores are powerful tools for single&#8208;molecule sensing of biomolecules and nanoparticles. The signal coming from the molecule to be analyzed strongly depends on its interaction with the narrower section&#160;of the nanopore (constriction) that may be tailored to increase sensing accuracy. Modifications of nanopore constriction have also been commonly used to induce electroosmosis, that favors the capture of molecules in the nanopore under a voltage bias and independently of their charge. However, engineering nanopores for increasing both electroosmosis and sensing accuracy is challenging. Here it is shown that large electroosmotic flows can be achieved without altering the nanopore constriction. Using continuum electrohydrodynamic simulations, it is found that an external charged ring generates strong electroosmosis in cylindrical nanopores. Similarly, for conical nanopores it is shown that moving charges away from the cone tip still results in an electroosmotic flow (EOF), whose intensity reduces increasing the diameter of the nanopore section&#160;where charges are placed. This paradigm is applied to engineered biological nanopores showing, via atomistic simulations and experiments, that mutations outside the constriction induce a relatively intense electroosmosis. This strategy provides much more flexibility in nanopore design since electroosmosis can be controlled independently from the constriction, which can be optimized to improve sensing&#160;accuracy.

         <title>Turning Waste into Wealth: A Potent Sono&#8208;Immune Strategy Based on Microcystis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon US exposure, natural sonosensitizer Microcystis elabens (Me)generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and releases debris to stimulate dendritic cell (DC) maturation via the Toll&#8208;like receptor (TLR) pathway to activate anti&#8208;cancer immunity. After combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the therapeutic outcomes of the Me&#8208;mediated sono&#8208;immune strategy are potentiated with improved metastatic inhibition.








Abstract
Currently, sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has limited therapeutic outcomes and immune responses, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced strategies that can stimulate robust and long&#8208;lasting antitumor effects. Microcystis, a notorious microalga, reveals the possibility of mediating SDT owing to the presence of gas vesicles (GVs) and phycocyanin (PC). Herein, a nontoxic strain of Microcystis elabens (labeled Me) is developed as a novel agent for SDT because it generates O2 under red light (RL) illumination, while GVs and PC act as cavitation nuclei and sonosensitizers, respectively. Moreover, algal debris is released after ultrasound (US) irradiation, which primes the Toll&#8208;like receptor pathway to initiate a cascade of immune responses. This sono&#8208;immune strategy inhibits CT26 colon tumor growth largely by promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation and cytotoxic T&#8208;cell activation. After combination with the immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), the therapeutic outcome is further amplified, accompanied by satisfactory abscopal and immune memory effects; the similar potency is proven in the &#8220;cold&#8221; 4T1 triple&#8208;negative breast tumor. In addition, Me exhibits good biosafety without significant acute or chronic toxicity. Briefly, this study turns waste into wealth by introducing sono&#8208;immunotherapy based on Microcystis that achieved encouraging therapeutic effects on cancer, which is expected to be translated into the clinic.

         <title>Stacking Fault&#8208;Enriched MoNi4/MoO2 Enables High&#8208;Performance Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect engineering in MoNi&#8208;based catalyst for hydrogen production: a path toward exceeding perfection. A high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst is developed for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), utilizing engineered stacking fault (SF) defects in MoNi4/MoO2 nanosheets. These SF defects enhance catalytic efficiency by reducing proton adsorption energy, significantly boosting activity and durability, offering a cost&#8208;effective pathway for sustainable hydrogen production.








Abstract
Producing green hydrogen in a cost&#8208;competitive manner via water electrolysis will make the long&#8208;held dream of hydrogen economy a reality. Although platinum (Pt)&#8208;based catalysts show good performance toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the high cost and scarce abundance challenge their economic viability and sustainability. Here, a non&#8208;Pt, high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for HER achieved by engineering high fractions of stacking fault (SF) defects for MoNi4/MoO2 nanosheets (d&#8208;MoNi) through a combined chemical and thermal reduction strategy is shown. The d&#8208;MoNi catalyst offers ultralow overpotentials of 78 and 121&#160;mV for HER at current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;M KOH, respectively. The defect&#8208;rich d&#8208;MoNi exhibits four times higher turnover frequency than the benchmark 20% Pt/C, together with its excellent durability (&gt; 100 h), making it one of the best&#8208;performing non&#8208;Pt catalysts for HER. The experimental and theoretical results reveal that the abundant SFs in d&#8208;MoNi induce a compressive strain, decreasing the proton adsorption energy and promoting the associated combination of *H into hydrogen and molecular hydrogen desorption, enhancing the HER performance. This work provides a new synthetic route to engineer defective metal and metal alloy electrocatalysts for emerging electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications.

         <title>Enhancing Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence through Energy Transfer within a Chiral Polymer Host</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A host&#8211;guest strategy that allows for energy transfer between a chiral polymer host and a representative chiral thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter is demonstrated. Such energy transfer results in large amplification of the circular polarization of the emitter (from gPL&#160;=&#160;0.00092 to 0.091), including amplified circularly polarized electroluminescence in an organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) device.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that are able to emit high levels of circularly polarized (CP) light hold significant promise in numerous future technologies. Such devices require chiral emissive materials to enable CP electroluminescence. However, the vast majority of current OLED emitter classes, including the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art triplet&#8208;harvesting thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, produce very low levels of CP electroluminescence. Here a host&#8211;guest strategy that allows for energy transfer between a chiral polymer host and a representative chiral TADF emitter is showcased. Such a mechanism results in a large amplification of the circular polarization of the emitter. As such, this study presents a promising avenue to further boost the performance of circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diode devices, enabling their further development and eventual commercialization.

         <title>Volumetric 3D Printing of Endoskeletal Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overprinting, enabled by Computed Axial Lithography (CAL), opens the door for volumetrically 3D printing endoskeletal soft robots in seconds. Using a thermoreversible hydrogel, Cameron Darkes&#8208;Burkey reports the first functional overprint capable of osmotic actuation while demonstrating a ray&#8208;based dose calculation method for predicting the print time of overprinted geometries.








Abstract
Computed Axial Lithography (CAL) is an emerging technology for manufacturing complex parts, all at once, by circumventing the traditional layered approach using tomography. Overprinting, a unique additive manufacturing capability of CAL, allows for a 3D geometry to be formed around a prepositioned insert where the occlusion of light is compensated for by the other angular projections. This method opens the door for novel applications within additive manufacturing for multi&#8208;material systems such as endoskeletal robots. Herein, this work presents one such application with a simple Gelatin Methacrylate (GelMA)hydrogel osmotic actuator with an embedded endoskeletal system. GelMA is an ideal material for this application as it is swellable and has reversible thermal gelation, enabling suspension of the endoskeleton during printing. By tuning the material formulation, the actuator design, and post&#8208;processing, swelling&#8208;induced bending actuation of 60 degrees is achieved. To aid in the printing process, a simple computational method for determining the absolute dose absorbed by the resin allowing for print time prediction is also proposed.

By tuning the material formulation, the actuator design, and post-processing, swelling-induced bending actuation of 60 degrees is achieved. To aid in the printing process, a simple computational method for determining the absolute dose absorbed by the resin allowing for print time prediction is also proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Epitaxial Growth of Large&#8208;Area Monolayers and van der Waals Heterostructures of Transition&#8208;Metal Chalcogenides via Assisted Nucleation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy of 2D chalcogenides typically yields small, disconnected islands, with premature onset of multilayer formation. This work reports how utilizing excited ions of a sacrificial species during the growth can dramatically enhance nucleation of the epitaxial layer, enabling growth of large&#8208;area monolayers with enhanced carrier lifetimes and facilitating the fabrication of all&#8208;epitaxial van der Waals heterostructures.








Abstract
The transition&#8208;metal chalcogenides include some of the most important and ubiquitous families of 2D materials. They host an exceptional variety of electronic and collective states, which can in principle be readily tuned by combining different compounds in van der Waals heterostructures. Achieving this, however, presents a significant materials challenge. The highest quality heterostructures are usually fabricated by stacking layers exfoliated from bulk crystals, which &#8211; while producing excellent prototype devices &#8211; is time consuming, cannot be easily scaled, and can lead to significant complications for materials stability and contamination. Growth via the ultra&#8208;high vacuum deposition technique of molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy (MBE) should be a premier route for 2D heterostructure fabrication, but efforts to achieve this are complicated by non&#8208;uniform layer coverage, unfavorable growth morphologies, and the presence of significant rotational disorder of the grown epilayer. This work demonstrates a dramatic enhancement in the quality of MBE grown 2D materials by exploiting simultaneous deposition of a sacrificial species from an electron&#8208;beam evaporator during the growth. This approach dramatically enhances the nucleation of the desired epi&#8208;layer, in turn enabling the synthesis of large&#8208;area, uniform monolayers with enhanced quasiparticle lifetimes, and facilitating the growth of epitaxial van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Formation and Detriments of Residual Alkaline Compounds on High&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;depth analyses on the formation of surface residual alkaline compounds, electrochemical performances, and structural stability of LiNiO2, LiNi0.95Co0.05O2, LiNi0.95Mn0.05O2, and LiNi0.95Al0.05O2 suggest that although Mn&#8208;doping can suppress residual Li formation in high&#8208;Ni cathodes during ambient air storage, the Mn&#8208;doped cathode suffers from more serious impedance growth and reaction heterogeneity due to the formation of spinel&#8208;like M3&#8211;xLixO4 phases.








Abstract
High&#8208;nickel layered oxides LiNixM1&#8208;xO2 (x&#160;&#8805;&#160;0.9) have emerged as promising cathode materials for automotive batteries due to their high energy density and lower cost. However, the formation and accumulation of surface alkaline compounds during storage hinder their mass production and commercialization. Here, a validated chemical method is employed to deconvolute and quantify the evolution of each residual lithium compound in four representative cathodes during ambient&#8208;air storage, viz., LiNiO2 (LNO), LiNi0.95Co0.05O2 (NC), LiNi0.95Mn0.05O2 (NM), and LiNi0.95Al0.05O2 (NA). Furthermore, the activation energy of the reaction between water and the cathode is determined by measuring the leached LiOH concentration at various temperatures. While residual lithium and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry measurements collectively reveal that the air stability overall follows the trend of NM&#160;&gt;&#160;NA&#160;&#8776;&#160;NC&#160;&gt;&#160;LNO, the aged NM exhibits the highest charge&#8208;transfer resistance and the worst electrochemical performance among the cathodes. In situ, X&#8208;ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy unveil that the aged NM is plagued by a large area of resistive spinel&#8208;like M3&#8211;xLixO4 phases, leading to aggravated particle reaction heterogeneity. Finally, a one&#8208;step recalcination method is demonstrated effective in fully restoring the degraded cathodes. This work provides insights into overcoming air sensitivity issues of high&#8208;Ni cathodes.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Free Cardiac Monitoring Capsule</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bias&#8208;free cardiac monitoring capsule is developed as a zero&#8208;power device implanted in animal models&#8217; cardiac cavity through minimally invasive intervention. It enables continuous and accurate monitoring of cardiac contractility in situ, providing a stable signal, which may contribute to a new option for early diagnosis of heart failure and other cardiovascular diseases.








Abstract
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Patients often fail to recognize the early signs of CVDs, which display irregularities in cardiac contractility and may ultimately lead to heart failure. Therefore, continuously monitoring the abnormal changes in cardiac contractility may represent a novel approach to long&#8208;term CVD surveillance. Here, a zero&#8208;power consumption and implantable bias&#8208;free cardiac monitoring capsule (BCMC) is introduced based on the triboelectric effect for cardiac contractility monitoring in situ. The output performance of BCMC is improved over 10 times with nanoparticle self&#8208;adsorption method. This device can be implanted into the right ventricle of swine using catheter intervention to detect the change of cardiac contractility and the corresponding CVDs. The physiological signals can be wirelessly transmitted to a mobile terminal for analysis through the acquisition and transmission module. This work contributes to a new option for precise monitoring and early diagnosis of CVDs.

         <title>Arbitrary Construction of Versatile NIR&#8208;Driven Microrobots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel spin&#8208;coating method creates light&#8208;driven microrobots (LMNRs) using bulk heterojunction organic semiconductor solar cells (OSSC). This technique uniformly coats various structures with a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive OSSC, enabling microrobots to move under NIR light. Applications include microplastic removal, cargo transport, and precise, light&#8208;guided motion.








Abstract
Emerging light&#8208;driven micro/nanorobots (LMNRs) showcase profound potential for sophisticated manipulation and various applications. However, the realization of a versatile and straightforward fabrication technique remains a challenging pursuit. This study introduces an innovative bulk heterojunction organic semiconductor solar cell (OSC)&#8208;based spin&#8208;coating approach, aiming to facilitate the arbitrary construction of LMNRs. Leveraging the distinctive properties of a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive organic semiconductor heterojunction solution, this technique enables uniform coating across various dimensional structures (0D, 1D, 2D, 3D) to be LMNRs, denoted as &#8220;motorization.&#8221; The film, with a slender profile measuring &#8776;140&#160;nm in thickness, effectively preserves the original morphology of objects while imparting actuation capabilities exceeding hundreds of times their own weight. The propelled motion of these microrobots is realized through NIR&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;diffusiophoresis, showcasing a versatile array of controllable motion profiles. The strategic customization of arbitrary microrobot construction addresses specific applications, ranging from 0D microrobots inducing living crystal formation to intricate, multidimensional structures designed for tasks such as microplastic extraction, cargo delivery, and phototactic precise maneuvers. This study advances user&#8208;friendly and versatile LMNR technologies, unlocking new possibilities for various applications, signaling a transformative era in multifunctional micro/nanorobot technologies.

         <title>Tracing Immunological Interaction in Trimethylamine N&#8208;Oxide Hydrogel&#8208;Derived Zwitterionic Microenvironment During Promoted Diabetic Wound Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a zwitterionic hydrogel for promoted diabetic wound healing by modulating multicellular heterogeneity and interaction of immune cells. This work finds that the zwitterionic hydrogel up&#8208;regulates Ccl3+ macrophages and down&#8208;regulates S100a9+ neutrophils; moreover, it suppresses NETs formation and boosts angiogenesis, thereby enhancing diabetic wound healing.








Abstract
The diabetic wound healing is challenging due to the sabotaged delicate balance of immune regulation via an undetermined pathophysiological mechanism, so it is crucial to decipher multicellular signatures underlying diabetic wound healing and seek therapeutic strategies. Here, this work develops a strategy using novel trimethylamine N&#8208;oxide (TMAO)&#8208;derived zwitterionic hydrogel to promote diabetic wound healing, and explore the multi&#8208;cellular ecosystem around zwitterionic hydrogel, mapping out an overview of different cells in the zwitterionic microenvironment by single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing. The diverse cellular heterogeneity is revealed, highlighting the critical role of macrophage and neutrophils in managing diabetic wound healing. It is found that polyzwitterionic hydrogel can upregulate Ccl3+ macrophages and downregulate S100a9+ neutrophils and facilitate their interactions compared with polyanionic and polycationic hydrogels, validating the underlying effect of zwitterionic microenvironment on the activation of adaptive immune system. Moreover, zwitterionic hydrogel inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and promotes angiogenesis, thus improving diabetic wound healing. These findings expand the horizons of the sophisticated orchestration of immune systems in zwitterion&#8208;directed diabetic wound repair and uncover new strategies of novel immunoregulatory biomaterials.

         <title>Printing Green: Microalgae&#8208;Based Materials for 3D Printing with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microalgae&#8208;based materials for two&#8208;photon laser 3D printing are introduced for the first time. After functionalizing the microalgae&#8208;derived triglycerides with acrylate moieties it is possible to print intricate 3D microstructures with sub&#8208;micron resolution. Printing is enabled solely by the green pigments inherently contained in the microalgae. The 3D printed microstructures are biocompatible.








Abstract
Microalgae have emerged as sustainable feedstocks due to their ability to fix CO2 during cultivation, rapid growth rates, and capability to produce a wide variety of metabolites. Several microalgae accumulate lipids in high concentrations, especially triglycerides, along with lipid&#8208;soluble, photoactive pigments such as chlorophylls and derivatives. Microalgae&#8208;derived triglycerides contain longer fatty acid chains with more double bonds on average than vegetable oils, allowing a higher degree of post&#8208;functionalization. Consequently, they are especially suitable as precursors for materials that can be used in 3D printing with light. This work presents the use of microalgae as &#8220;biofactories&#8221; to generate materials that can be further 3D printed in high resolution. Two taxonomically different strains&#160;&#8212;Odontella aurita (O. aurita, BEA0921B) and Tetraselmis striata (T. striata, BEA1102B)&#8212;&#160;are identified as suitable microalgae for this purpose. The extracts obtained from the microalgae (mainly triglycerides with chlorophyll derivatives) are functionalized with photopolymerizable groups and used directly as printable materials (inks) without the need for additional photoinitiators. The fabrication of complex 3D microstructures with sub&#8208;micron resolution is demonstrated. Notably, the 3D printed materials show biocompatibility. These findings open new possibilities for the next generation of sustainable, biobased, and biocompatible materials with great potential in life science applications.

         <title>Nonequivalent Atomic Vibrations at Interfaces in a Polar Superlattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of the structural nonequivalence of AlN&#8211;AlGaN interfaces on the interface vibrational modes is probed through off&#8208;axis monochromated electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy. By carefully aligning off&#8208;axis deflection with the polar bonds, phonon softening at one interface (but not the other) are isolated and the nonequivalence is measured. This opens the way for polarization&#8208;selective vibrational spectroscopy with ultrahigh spatial resolution.








Abstract
In heterostructures made from polar materials, e.g., AlN&#8211;GaN&#8211;AlN, the nonequivalence of the two interfaces is long recognized as a critical aspect of their electronic properties; in that, they host different 2D carrier gases. Interfaces play an important role in the vibrational properties of materials, where interface states enhance thermal conductivity and can generate unique infrared&#8208;optical activity. The nonequivalence of the corresponding interface atomic vibrations, however, is not investigated so far due to a lack of experimental techniques with both high spatial and high spectral resolution. Herein, the nonequivalence of AlN&#8211;(Al0.65Ga0.35)N and (Al0.65Ga0.35)N&#8211;AlN interface vibrations is experimentally demonstrated using monochromated electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM&#8208;EELS) and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations are employed to gain insights in the physical origins of observations. It is demonstrated that STEM&#8208;EELS possesses sensitivity to the displacement vector of the vibrational modes as well as the frequency, which is as critical to understanding vibrations as polarization in optical spectroscopies. The combination enables direct mapping of the nonequivalent interface phonons between materials with different phonon polarizations. The results demonstrate the capacity to carefully assess the vibrational properties of complex heterostructures where interface states dominate the functional properties.

         <title>Breathable Dual&#8208;Mode Leather&#8208;Like Nanotextile for Efficient Daytime Radiative Cooling and Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A breathable dual&#8208;mode leather&#8208;like nanotextile (LNT) is developed via one&#8208;step electrospinning that balances efficient thermal management performance, wearing comfort, and scalability. Designed with bilayer wrinkle microstructures combined with particles, the LNT offers double&#8208;sided leather&#8208;like appearances and superior radiative cooling and heating properties, as well as excellent wearing performances, achieving personal thermal comfort in changing environments.








Abstract
Incorporating passive radiative cooling and heating into personal thermal management has attracted tremendous attention. However, most current thermal management materials are usually monofunctional with a narrow temperature regulation range, and lack breathability, softness, and stretchability, resulting in a poor wearer experience and limited application scenarios. Herein, a breathable dual&#8208;mode leather&#8208;like nanotextile (LNT) with asymmetrical wrinkle photonic microstructures and Janus wettability for highly efficient personal thermal management is developed via a one&#8208;step electrospinning technique. The LNT is synthesized by self&#8208;bonding a hydrophilic cooling layer with welding fiber networks onto a hydrophobic photothermal layer, constructing bilayer wrinkle structures that offer remarkable optical properties, a wetting gradient, and unique textures. The resultant LNT exhibits efficient cooling capacity (22.0&#160;&#176;C) and heating capacity (22.1&#160;&#176;C) under sunlight, expanding the thermal management zone (28.3&#160;&#176;C wider than typical textiles). Additionally, it possesses favorable breathability, softness, stretchability, and sweat&#8208;wicking capability. Actual wearing tests demonstrate that the LNT can provide a comfortable microenvironment for the human body (1.6&#8211;8.0&#160;&#176;C cooler and 1.0&#8211;7.1&#160;&#176;C warmer than typical textiles) in changing weather conditions. Such a wearable dual&#8208;mode LNT presents great potential for personal thermal comfort and opens up new possibilities for all&#8208;weather smart clothing.

The cribellum layer of diatom skeleton, termed frustule, features a hierarchical porous structure on the nanoscale. A diatom cribellum inspired hierarchical metamaterials are presented to integrate the perfect absorption and subwavelength color printing. These diatom cribellum&#8208;inspired metamaterials offer a fresh perspective on multifunctional metamaterial design, promising scalability production by utilizing the frustule as a template for nanopatterning or bio&#8208;template synthesis.








Abstract
Diatom exoskeletons, known as frustules, exhibit a unique multilayer structure that has attracted considerable attention across interdisciplinary research fields as a source of biomorphic inspiration. These frustules possess a hierarchical porous structure, ranging from millimeter&#8208;scale foramen pores to nanometer&#8208;scale cribellum pores. In this study, this natural template for nanopattern design is leveraged to showcase metamaterials that integrates perfect absorption and subwavelength color printing. The cribellum&#8208;inspired hierarchical nanopatterns, organized in a hexagonal unit cell with a periodicity of 300&#160;nm, are realized through a single&#8208;step electron beam lithography process. By employing numerical models, it is uncovered that an additional induced collective dipole mode is the key mechanism responsible for achieving outstanding performance in absorption, reaching up to 99%. Analysis of the hierarchical organization reveals that variations in nanoparticle diameter and inter&#8208;unit&#8208;cell distance lead to shifts and broadening of the resonance peaks. It is also demonstrated that the hierarchical nanopatterns are capable of color reproduction with high uniformity and fidelity, serving as hexagonal pixels for high&#8208;resolution color printing. These cribellum&#8208;inspired metamaterials offer a novel approach to multifunctional metamaterial design, presenting aesthetic potential applications in the development of robotics and wearable electronic devices, such as smart skin or surface coatings integrated with energy harvesting functionalities.

         <title>Van der Waals Encapsulation by Ultrathin Oxide for Air&#8208;Sensitive 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The native oxide of liquid gallium is used as van der Waals encapsulation layer for the protection of air&#8208;sensitive two&#8208;dimensional materials in ambient environment. The facile selective etching endows it with the ability of direct device fabrication without removal of encapsulation. Robust encapsulation ability is demonstrated with black phosphorus and molybdenum ditelluride, while dual&#8208;gate device can be fabricated without decapsulation.








Abstract
The ambient stability is one of the focal points for applications of 2D materials, especially for those well&#8208;known air&#8208;sensitive ones, such as black phosphorus (BP) and transitional metal telluride. Traditional methods of encapsulation, such as atomic layer deposition of oxides and heterogeneous integration of hexagonal boron nitride, can hardly avoid removal of encapsulation layer when the 2D materials are encapsulated for further device fabrication, which causes complexity and damage during the procedure. Here, a van der Waals encapsulation method that allows direct device fabrication without removal of encapsulation layer is introduced using Ga2O3 from liquid gallium. Taking advantage of the robust isolation ability against ambient environment of the dense native oxide of gallium, hundreds of times longer retention time of (opto)electronic properties of encapsulated BP and MoTe2 devices is realized than unencapsulated devices. Due to the ultrathin high&#8208;&#954; properties of Ga2O3, top&#8208;gated devices are directly fabricated with the encapsulation layer, simultaneously as a dielectric layer. This direct device fabrication is realized by selective etching of Ga2O3, leaving the encapsulated materials intact. Encapsulated 1T' MoTe2 exhibits high conductivity even after 150 days in ambient environment. This method is, therefore, highlighted as a promising and distinctive one compared with traditional passivation approaches.

         <title>A Class of Sodium Transition&#8208;Metal Sulfide Cathodes With Anion Redox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of Na6MS4 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, and Zn) with anion redox is demonstrated as cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries. As a model system, Na6CoS4 is found during the initial charge process to transform from a highly crystalline to an amorphous structure, mainly consisting of nanosized CoS and sulfur particles. Afterward, the conversion is highly reversible between amorphous CoS/S and Na6CoS4.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are entering commercial relevance as a sustainable and low&#8208;cost alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Improving the energy density of SIBs is critical to enable their widespread adoption. Here, a new class of cathode materials Na6MS4 (M = Co, Mn, Fe, and Zn) that exhibit high charge&#8208;storage capacity is reported. Using Na6CoS4 as a prototypical example, a six&#8208;electron conversion reaction dominated by anion redox is observed, confirmed through various electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. After the initial cycle, Na6CoS4 delivers a high capacity of 392&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 with a long lifespan of over 500 cycles. The reaction involves, initially, the transformation of crystalline Na6CoS4 to a nearly amorphous structure consisting of mainly CoS and sulfur nanoparticles, which then reversibly cycles between nearly amorphous a&#8208;CoS/S and a&#8208;Na6CoS4. Such anion&#8208;redox&#8208;driven conversion&#8208;type cathodes hold the potential to enable energy&#8208;dense, stable SIBs.

         <title>Capture and Storage of Cell&#8208;Free DNA via Bio&#8208;Informational Hydrogel Microspheres</title>

         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;informational hydrogel microsphere coupled with polydopamine nanosheets is developed as an intervention mediator for cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) related pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling transduction. The &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking/hydrogen bonding interactions between polydopamine nanosheets and the bases of cfDNA, along with the spatial confinement created by the hydrogel polymer network have found to achieve cfDNA capture and storage, respectively, blocking abnormal activation of cfDNA&#8208;associated toll&#8208;like receptor 9, down&#8208;regulating inflammatory cytokines and ROS levels, thereby alleviating chronic inflammation in diabetic wounds.








Abstract
Excessive cell&#8208;free DNA (cfDNA) can induce chronic inflammation by activating intracellular nucleic acid sensors. Intervention in cfDNA&#8208;mediated &#8220;pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling transduction&#8221; could be a potential alleviating strategy for chronic inflammation, such as in diabetic wounds. However, effectively and specifically downgrading cfDNA concentration in the pathological microenvironment remains a challenge. Therefore, this work prepares free&#8208;standing polydopamine nanosheets through DNA&#8208;guided assembly and loaded them into microfluidic hydrogel microspheres. The &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking/hydrogen bonding interactions between polydopamine nanosheets and the &#960;&#8208;rich bases of cfDNA, along with the cage&#8208;like spatial confinement created by the hydrogel polymer network, achieved cfDNA capture and storage, respectively. Catechol in polydopamine nanosheets can also assist in reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Efficient cfDNA binding independent of serum proteins, specific interdiction of abnormal activation of cfDNA&#8208;associated toll&#8208;like receptor 9, as well as down&#8208;regulation of inflammatory cytokines and ROS levels are shown in this system. The chronic inflammation alleviating and the pro&#8208;healing effects on the mice model with diabetic wounds are also investigated. This work presents a new strategy for capturing and storing cfDNA to intervene in cell signaling transduction. It also offers new insights into the regulatory mechanisms between inflammatory mediators and biomaterials in inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Highly Horizontal Oriented Tricomponent Exciplex Host with Multiple Reverse Intersystem Crossing Channels for High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Electroluminescence and Eye&#8208;Protection White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly horizontal&#8208;oriented tricomponent exciplex with multiple reverse intersystem crossing channels is developed to realize reduced exciton quenching and enhanced up&#8208;conversion of non&#8208;radiative triplet excitons, which enables simultaneous high&#8208;efficiency, low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off narrowband electroluminescence and eye&#8208;protection illumination.








Abstract
Despite multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters with small full&#8208;width at half maximum are attractive for wide color&#8208;gamut display and eye&#8208;protection lighting applications, their inefficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and long exciton lifetime induce serious efficiency roll&#8208;off, which significantly limits their development.

&lt;p&gt;Highly horizontal-oriented tricomponent exciplex with multiple reverse intersystem crossing channels is developed to realize reduced exciton quenching and enhanced up-conversion of non-radiative triplet excitons, which enables simultaneous high-efficiency, low-efficiency roll-off narrowband electroluminescence and eye-protection illumination.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite multiple-resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) emitters with small full-width at half maximum are attractive for wide color-gamut display and eye-protection lighting applications, their inefficient reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process and long exciton lifetime induce serious efficiency roll-off, which significantly limits their development. Herein, a novel device concept of building highly efficient tricomponent exciplex with multiple RISC channels is proposed to realize reduced exciton quenching and enhanced upconversion of nonradiative triplet excitons, and subsequently used as a host for high-performance MR-TADF organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). Compared with traditional binary exciplex, the tricomponent exciplex exhibits obviously improved photoluminescence quantum yield, emitting dipole orientation and RISC rate constant, and a record-breaking external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.4% is achieved for tricomponent exciplex p-PhBCzPh: PO-T2T: DspiroAc-TRZ (50: 20: 30) based OLED. Remarkably, maximum EQEs of 36.2% and 40.3% and ultralow efficiency roll-off with EQEs of 26.1% and 30.0% at 1000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; are respectively achieved for its sky-blue and pure-green MR-TADF doped OLEDs. Additionally, the blue emission unit hosted by tricomponent exciplex is combined with an orange-red TADF emission unit to achieve a double-emission-layer blue-hazard-free warm white OLED with an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 30.3% and stable electroluminescence spectra over a wide brightness range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ion&#8208;Mediated Spiking Chemical Neuron based on Mott Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial spiking chemical neuron is achieved based on transistor&#8208;type biosensor and Mott memristor, which enables encoding ionic information in liquid environment into electrical spike trains via frequency and time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike coding schemes. The artificial neuron demonstrates rich neural dynamics with both excitation and inhibition spiking behaviors toward ionic concentrations like biological neural systems.








Abstract
Artificial spiking neurons capable of interpreting ionic information into electrical spikes are critical to mimic biological signaling systems. Mott memristors are attractive for constructing artificial spiking neurons due to their simple structure, low energy consumption, and rich neural dynamics. However, challenges remain in achieving ion&#8208;mediated spiking and biohybrid&#8208;interfacing in Mott neurons. Here, a biomimetic spiking chemical neuron (SCN) utilizing an NbOx Mott memristor and oxide field&#8208;effect transistor&#8208;type chemical sensor is introduced. The SCN exhibits both excitation and inhibition spiking behaviors toward ionic concentrations akin to biological neural systems. It demonstrates spiking responses across physiological and pathological Na+ concentrations (1&#8211;200&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m). The Na+&#8208;mediated SCN enables both frequency encoding and time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike coding schemes, illustrating the rich neural dynamics of Mott neuron. In addition, the SCN interfaced with L929 cells facilitates real&#8208;time modulation of ion&#8208;mediated spiking under both normal and salty cellular microenvironments.

         <title>Inner Doping of Carbon Nanotubes with Perovskites for Ultralow Power Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are doped by filling with 1D halide perovskites to form CsPbBr3/CNT coaxial heterojunctions. Not only can stable n&#8208;type&#8208;doped CNT field&#8208;effect transistors be achieved, but also, a quasi&#8208;broken&#8208;gap (BG) heterojunction tunnel field&#8208;effect transistor (TFET) can be constructed. The optimized quasi&#8208;BG TFET exhibits a subthreshold swing of 35 mV dec&#8722;1 at room temperature. It paves the way for constructing high&#8208;performance and ultralow power consumption integrated circuits.








Abstract
Semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as the most promising channel material to construct ultrascaled field&#8208;effect transistors, but the perfect sp2 C&#9472;C structure makes stable doping difficult, which limits the electrical designability of CNT devices. Here, an inner doping method is developed by filling CNTs with 1D halide perovskites to form a coaxial heterojunction, which enables a stable n&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistor for constructing complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor electronics. Most importantly, a quasi&#8208;broken&#8208;gap (BG) heterojunction tunnel field&#8208;effect transistor (TFET) is first demonstrated based on an individual partial&#8208;filling CsPbBr3/CNT and exhibits a subthreshold swing of 35&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 with a high on&#8208;state current of up to 4.9&#160;&#181;A per tube and an on/off current ratio of up to 105 at room temperature. The quasi&#8208;BG TFET based on the CsPbBr3/CNT coaxial heterojunction paves the way for constructing high&#8208;performance and ultralow power consumption integrated circuits.

         <title>3D Printing of Composite Radiation Shielding for Broad Spectrum Protection of Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current radiation mitigation techniques to protect electronics in space introduce a high size, weight, power and cost penalty to system design. An alternative additive manufacturing&#8208;based method using composite inks to spot shield only vulnerable electronics minimizing the overall impact shielding causes to the system is described. The approach offers control over both the composition and geometry of shielding materials.








Abstract
The miniaturization of satellite systems has compounded the need to protect microelectronic components from damaging radiation. Current approaches to mitigate this damage, such as indiscriminate mass shielding, built&#8208;in redundancies, and radiation&#8208;hardened electronics, introduce high size, weight, power, and cost penalties that impact the overall performance of the satellite or launch opportunities. Additive manufacturing provides an appealing strategy to deposit radiation shielding only on susceptible components within an electronic assembly. Here, a versatile material platform and process to conformally print customized composite inks at room temperature directly and selectively onto commercial&#8208;off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf electronics is described. The suite of inks uses a flexible styrene&#8208;isoprene&#8208;styrene block copolymer binder that can be filled with particles of different atomic densities for diverging radiation shielding capabilities. Additionally, the system enables the combination of multiple distinct particle species within the same printed structure. The method can produce graded shielding that offers improved radiation attenuation by tailoring both shield geometry and composition to provide comprehensive protection from a broad range of radiation species. The authors anticipate this alternative to traditional shielding methods will enable the rapid proliferation of the next generation of compact satellite designs.

         <title>Membrane Fusion&#8208;Mediated Loading of Therapeutic siRNA into Exosome for Tissue&#8208;Specific Application</title>

By fusing the siRNA&#8208;encapsulated liposome and corneal epithelium cell&#8208;derived exosome through a DNA zipper&#8208;mediated approach, an siRNA&#8208;bearing hybrid exosome vesicle (siRNA&#8208;HEV) is engineered for topical application and dry eye disease (DED) treatment. Utilizing the homing characteristics of exosome, siRNA&#8208;HEV efficiently delivers siRNA to the ocular surface, silencing the target gene, and ultimately alleviating the corneal inflammation in a DED mouse model.









Abstract
Tissue&#8208;specific delivery of oligonucleotide therapeutics beyond the liver remains a key challenge in nucleic acid drug development. To address this issue, exploiting exosomes as a novel carrier has emerged as a promising approach for efficient nucleic acid drug delivery. However, current exosome&#8208;based delivery systems still face multiple hurdles in their clinical applications. Herein, this work presents a strategy for constructing a hybrid exosome vehicle (HEV) through a DNA zipper&#8208;mediated membrane fusion approach for tissue&#8208;specific siRNA delivery. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this work successfully fuses a liposome encapsulating anti&#8208;NFKBIZ siRNAs with corneal epithelium cell (CEC)&#8208;derived exosomes to form a HEV construct for the treatment of dry eye disease (DED). With homing characteristics inherited from exosomes, the siRNA&#8208;bearing HEV can target its parent cells and efficiently deliver the siRNA payloads to the cornea. Subsequently, the NFKBIZ gene silencing significantly reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine secretions from the ocular surface, reshapes its inflammatory microenvironment, and ultimately achieves an excellent therapeutic outcome in a DED mouse model. As a versatile platform, this hybrid exosome with targeting capability and designed therapeutic siRNAs may hold great potential in various disease treatments.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue-specific delivery of oligonucleotide therapeutics beyond the liver remains a key challenge in nucleic acid drug development. To address this issue, exploiting exosomes as a novel carrier has emerged as a promising approach for efficient nucleic acid drug delivery. However, current exosome-based delivery systems still face multiple hurdles in their clinical applications. Herein, this work presents a strategy for constructing a hybrid exosome vehicle (HEV) through a DNA zipper-mediated membrane fusion approach for tissue-specific siRNA delivery. As a proof-of-concept, this work successfully fuses a liposome encapsulating anti-NFKBIZ siRNAs with corneal epithelium cell (CEC)-derived exosomes to form a HEV construct for the treatment of dry eye disease (DED). With homing characteristics inherited from exosomes, the siRNA-bearing HEV can target its parent cells and efficiently deliver the siRNA payloads to the cornea. Subsequently, the NFKBIZ gene silencing significantly reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretions from the ocular surface, reshapes its inflammatory microenvironment, and ultimately achieves an excellent therapeutic outcome in a DED mouse model. As a versatile platform, this hybrid exosome with targeting capability and designed therapeutic siRNAs may hold great potential in various disease treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Stress&#8211;Strain Curves of Flexible Snapping Mechanical Metamaterial for On&#8208;Demand Mechanical Responses via Data&#8208;Driven Inverse Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the realization of spatially and temporally programmable behaviors, a three&#8208;step data&#8208;driven inverse design framework is proposed based on finite element analysis and machine learning to accurately tailor the stress&#8211;strain curves of snapping mechanical metamaterials. Natively coupling nonideal architecture, nonlinear deformation, and nonlinear constitutive model, this framework is also potentially applicable to other responsive mechanical metamaterials with similar nonlinearities.








Abstract
By incorporating soft materials into the architecture, flexible mechanical metamaterials enable promising applications, e.g., energy modulation, and shape morphing, with a well&#8208;controllable mechanical response, but suffer from spatial and temporal programmability towards higher&#8208;level mechanical intelligence. One feasible solution is to introduce snapping structures and then tune their responses by accurately tailoring the stress&#8211;strain curves. However, owing to the strongly coupled nonlinearity of structural deformation and material constitutive model, it is difficult to deduce their stress&#8211;strain curves using conventional ways. Here, a machine learning pipeline is trained with the finite element analysis data that considers those strongly coupled nonlinearities to accurately tailor the stress&#8211;strain curves of snapping metamaterialfor on&#8208;demand mechanical response with an accuracy of 97.41%, conforming well to experiment. Utilizing the established approach, the energy absorption efficiency of the snapping&#8208;metamaterial&#8208;based device can be tuned within the accessible range to realize different rebound heights of a falling ball, and soft actuators can be spatially and temporally programmed to achieve synchronous and sequential actuation with a single energy input. Purely relying on structure designs, the accurately tailored metamaterials&#160;increase the devices&#8217; tunability/programmability. Such an approach can potentially extend to similar nonlinear scenarios towards&#160;predictable or intelligent mechanical responses.

         <title>Sophisticated Structural Ceramics Shaped from 3D Printed Hydrogel Preceramic Skeleton</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to shaping sophisticated structural ceramics is proposed by the retransformation of vat photopolymerization 3D printed hydrogel preceramic. The 3D printed hydrogel preceramic, due to the unique flexible and shape reconfigurable character, achieving reshape repeatedly constructions through circular process from desiccation to rehydration, is readily shaped to various complex 3D ceramic architectures by firstly shape editing and then thermal sintering. This method will bring more innovation to the unsupported and large&#8208;spanning 3D manufacturing of complex shape ceramics.








Abstract
Shaping ceramic materials into sophisticated architecture with 3D hierarchical structure is desirable in multiapplication yet remains challenge due to their brittle and stiff nature. Herein, a new method to achieve ceramic architectures with unsupported and large&#8208;spanning structure by shaping vat photopolymerization 3D printed hydrogel preceramic skeleton with unique flexible and deformable character is proposed. Specifically, the present photopolymerizable hydrogel preceramic achieves one stone, two birds: the photosensitive polymer matrix coupled with ceramic nanoparticles for the first shaping by vat photopolymerization 3D printing and the secondary plasticity of the 3D printed ceramic body through flexible shape deformation of hydrogel networks. Inorganic binder aluminum dihydrogen phosphate serves as hydrogel dispersion medium to achieve ultralow shrinkage photopolymerization ceramic. Compared with conventional polymer&#8208;derived photocuring ceramics, the linear shrinkage of lamina structure is solely 2%, and which of cubic ceramic structure is just 13.3%. More importantly, one 3D printed preceramic is conducted to reshape repeatedly myriad constructions, realizing reusability of intrinsic brittle ceramic, improving manufacturing fault tolerance rate. Finally, a variety of paradigms for ceramic structure applications are proposed toward stereo circuit, biomedicine, and catalytic applications, breaking the limitation of intrinsic brittleness of ceramic in high&#8208;precision manufacturing of complex ceramic devices.

         <title>Eliminating Hole Extraction Barrier in 1D/3D Perovskite Heterojunction for Efficient and Stable Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI3 Solar Cells with a Record Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiocholine iodine (TchI) with a suitable functional group and dipole moment is used to construct TchPbI3/CsPbI3 1D/3D heterojunction, which eliminates the hole extraction barrier and passivates interface defect, thereby improving carriers extraction in the device. The champion cell achieves an efficiency of 19.08%, and a certified efficiency of 18.7%, which is a record efficiency for inorganic perovskite C&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) have the advantages of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;stability, but their photovoltaic performance is limited by severe defect&#8208;induced recombination and low hole extraction efficiency. 1D perovskite is proven to effectively passivate the defects on the perovskite surface, therefore reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination loss. However, the unsuitable energy level of most 1D perovskite renders an undesired downward band bending for 3D perovskite, resulting in a high hole extraction barrier and reduced hole extraction efficiency. Therefore, rational design and selection of 1D perovskites as the modifiers are essential in balancing defect passivation and hole extraction. In this work, based on simulation calculations, thiocholine iodide (TchI) is selected to prepare 1D perovskite with high work function and then constructs TchPbI3/CsPbI3 1D/3D perovskite heterojunction. Experimental results show that this strategy eliminates the hole extraction barrier at the perovskite/carbon interface, which improves the hole extraction efficiency of corresponding devices. Meanwhile, the strong interaction between the thiol group and Pb suppresses defect&#8208;induced recombination effectively and improves the stability of CsPbI3. The assembled C&#8208;PSCs exhibit a champion efficiency of 19.08% and a certified efficiency of 18.7%. To the best of the knowledge, this is a new efficiency record for inorganic C&#8208;PSCs.

         <dc:description>
Breaking through the Na+ transport channel of Na&#8208;containing zeolite molecular sieve by ion&#8208;exchange and confining aggregated liquid ether electrolytes in the nanopore and void of zeolites, it achieves excellent high&#8208;voltage stability enabled by solid&#8208;state zeolite electrolytes, while inheriting the ultra&#8208;high CE (99.84%) from liquid ether electrolytes.








Abstract
Developing anode&#8208;free batteries is the ultimate goal in pursuit of high energy density and safety. It is more urgent for sodium (Na)&#8208;based batteries due to its inherently low energy density and safety hazards induced by highly reactive Na metal anodes. However, there is no electrolyte that can meet the demanding Na plating&#8208;stripping Coulomb efficiency (CE) while resisting oxidative decomposition at high voltages for building stable anode&#8208;free Na batteries. Here, a &#8220;liquid&#8208;in&#8208;solid&#8221; electrolyte design strategy is proposed to integrate target performances of liquid and solid&#8208;state electrolytes.

When applied in a 4.25&#160;V&#8208;class anode&#8208;free Na battery, an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 412&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 (based on the active material of both cathodes and anodes) can be reached, which is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Furthermore, the assembled anode&#8208;free pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling stability, and a high capacity retention of 89.2% can be preserved after 370 cycles.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Bridged Asymmetric CuNi Bimetallic Atom Sites for CO2 Reduction with High Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed catalysts with novel S&#8208;bridged Cu&#8208;S&#8208;Ni sites (named Cu&#8208;S&#8208;Ni/SNC) is synthesized with biomass wool keratin as precursor. The plentiful disulfide bonds in wool keratin overcame the limitations of conventional gas&#8208;phase S&#8208;ligand etching process and realized one&#8208;step formation of S&#8208;bridged sites. The S&#8208;bridged sites facilitate the charge redistribution of Cu and Ni during CO2RR, resulting in high CO selectivity.








Abstract
Double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) with asymmetric coordination are crucial for enhancing the benefits of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction and advancing sustainable development, however, the rational design of DACs is still challenging. Herein, this work synthesizes atomically dispersed catalysts with novel sulfur&#8208;bridged Cu&#8208;S&#8208;Ni sites (named Cu&#8208;S&#8208;Ni/SNC), utilizing biomass wool keratin as precursor. The plentiful disulfide bonds in wool keratin overcome the limitations of traditional gas&#8208;phase S ligand etching process and enable the one&#8208;step formation of S&#8208;bridged sites. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms the existence of bimetallic sites with N2Cu&#8208;S&#8208;NiN2 moiety. In H&#8208;cell, Cu&#8208;S&#8208;Ni/SNC shows high CO Faraday efficiency of 98.1% at &#8722;0.65&#160;V versus RHE. Benefiting from the charge tuning effect between the metal site and bridged sulfur atoms, a large current density of 550&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 can be achieved at &#8722;1.00&#160;V in flow cell. Additionally, in situ XAS, attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show Cu as the main adsorption site is dual&#8208;regulated by Ni and S atoms, which enhances CO2 activation and accelerates the formation of *COOH intermediates. This kind of asymmetric bimetallic atom catalysts may open new pathways for precision preparation and performance regulation of atomic materials toward energy applications.

         <title>Ultrahigh Electrobending Deformation in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectric Ceramics via Defect Concentration Gradient Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh electrobending deformation is obtained in lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramics by defect dipoles&#8217; gradient design. The contributions of electrostrain and electrobending to the measured apparent strain are distinguished for the first time. In cantilever structure, monolayer piezoelectric ceramic can generate large displacement of &#177;1.5 mm, highlighting its promising potential for practical application like vibration control.








Abstract
Recent breakthroughs in defect&#8208;engineered lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramics have reported remarkable electrostrain values, surpassing the limit of lattice distortion. This has aroused wide concern on bending deformation and the associated underlying mechanism. Herein, via designing lead&#8208;free piezoelectric ceramics with varying volatilization characteristics, it is uncovered that the ultrahigh electrobending deformation is primarily attributed to a large strain gradient induced by unevenly distributed defect dipoles. In 0.5 mm thick Sr/Sn co&#8208;doped potassium sodium niobate ceramics featuring volatile K/Na elements, the inherent bipolar electrostrain value can reach 0.3% at 20&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 due to the existence of defect dipoles, while the gradient distribution of defect dipole generates significant bending displacement, amplifying apparent electrostrain value to 1.1%. Notably, nonvolatile Ba0.99TiO2.99 ceramic with homogeneous defect dipole distribution does not present electrobending. Of particular interest is that the electrobending phenomenon can be observed through introducing a defect dipole gradient into barium titanate ceramic. A monolayer ceramic with defect dipole gradient can generate large tip displacement (&#177;1.5&#160;mm) in cantilever structure, demonstrating its promising potential in precise positioning. This study delves into the underlying mechanism driving electrobending deformation and its impact on the apparent electrostrain measurement in defect&#8208;engineered piezoelectric ceramics, providing fresh perspectives for the development of piezoelectric bending actuators.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Aligned All&#8208;Fiber Actuator with Asymmetric Photothermal&#8208;Humidity Response and Autonomous Perceptivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric highly aligned all&#8208;fiber membrane (HAFM) is created, exhibiting a hierarchical micro&#8208;nano structure and excellent mechanical toughness. It shows dual&#8208;directional thermal&#8208;induced moisture&#8208;responsive actuation with huge bending curvature (&#8764;7.23 cm&#8722;1) and fast response (0.60 cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). Integrating the actuation&#8208;triggered triboelectric effect, programmable micromanipulators, walking robots with self&#8208;powered perceptivity, and plant robots with autonomous environment interactions are demonstrated.








Abstract
Soft robots adapt to complex environments for autonomous locomotion, manipulation, and perception are attractive for robot&#8208;environment interactions. Strategies to reconcile environment&#8208;triggered actuation and self&#8208;powered sensing responses to different stimuli remain challenging. By tuning the in situ vapor phase solvent exchange effect in continuous electrospinning, an asymmetric highly&#8208;aligned all&#8208;fiber membrane (HAFM) with a hierarchical &#8220;grape&#8208;like&#8221; nanosphere&#8208;assembled microfiber structure (specific surface area of 13.6&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and excellent mechanical toughness (tensile stress of 5.5&#160;MPa, and fracture toughness of 798&#160;KJ&#160;m&#8722;3) is developed, which shows efficient asymmetric actuation to both photothermal and humidity stimuli. The HAFM consists of a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;enhanced moisture&#8208;responsive layer and an MXene&#8208;improved photothermal&#8208;responsive layer, which achieves substantial actuation with a bending curvature up to &#8776;7.23&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a fast response of 0.60&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. By tailoring the fiber alignment and bi&#8208;layer thickness ratio, different types of micromanipulators, automatic walking robots, and plant robots with programmable structures are demonstrated, which are realized for self&#8208;powered information perception of material type, object moisture, and temperature by integrating the autonomous triboelectric effect induced by photothermal&#8208;moisture actuation. This work presents fiber materials with programable hierarchical asymmetries and inspires a common strategy for self&#8208;powered organism&#8208;interface robots to interact with complex environments.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum core&#8211;liquid metal shell microparticles (Al@LM&#8208;MPs) exhibit a distinctive capability to react to water molecules in the air to generate heat, exhibiting remarkable sensitivity across a broad temperature range. This ability leads to the creation of intelligent clothing capable of autonomously responding to extreme cold and wet weather conditions, providing both enduring heat retention and insulation capabilities.








Abstract
High humidity in extremely cold weather can undermine the insulation capability of the clothing, imposing serious life risks. Current clothing insulation technologies have inherent deficiencies in terms of insulation efficiency and humidity adaptability. Here, humidity&#8208;stimulated self&#8208;heating clothing using aluminum core&#8211;liquid metal shell microparticles (Al@LM&#8208;MPs) as the filler is reported. Al@LM&#8208;MPs exhibit a distinctive capability to react to water molecules in the air to generate heat, exhibiting remarkable sensitivity across a broad temperature range. This ability leads to the creation of intelligent clothing capable of autonomously responding to extreme cold and wet weather conditions, providing both enduring heat retention and insulation capabilities.

         <title>Printed On&#8208;Chip Perovskite Heterostructure Arrays for Optical Switchable Logic Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical&#8208;controlled &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221; logic gates are demonstrated based on the on&#8208;chip MAPbBr3&#8211;MAPbI3 heterostructures fabricated via a template&#8208;assisted sequential printing strategy. Different regions of the heterostructures exhibit distinguishable photoresponse to varied wavelengths, thereby enabling optical switchable logic states. &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221; logic operations are achieved with 100% accuracy, which is advantageous to efficiently build compact optoelectronic integrated circuits.








Abstract
The use of optoelectronic devices for high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power data transmission and computing is considered in the next&#8208;generation logic circuits. Heterostructures, which can generate and transmit photoresponse signals dealing with different input lights, are highly desirable for optoelectronic logic gates. Here, the printed on&#8208;chip perovskite heterostructures are demonstrated to achieve optical&#8208;controlled &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221; optoelectronic logic gates. Perovskite heterostructures are printed with a high degree of control over composition, site, and crystallization. Different regions of the printed perovskite heterostructures exhibit distinguishable photoresponse to varied wavelengths of input lights, which can be utilized to achieve optical&#8208;controlled logic functions. Correspondingly, parallel operations of the two logic gates (&#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;) by way of choosing the output electrodes under the single perovskite heterostructure. Benefiting from the uniform crystallization and strict alignment of the printed perovskite heterostructures, the integrated 3 &#215; 3 pixels all exhibit 100% logic operation accuracy. Finally, optical&#8208;controlled logic gates responding to multiwavelength light can be printed on the predesigned microelectrodes as the on&#8208;chip integrated circuits. This printing strategy allows for integrating heterostructure&#8208;based optical and electronic devices from a unit&#8208;scale device to a system&#8208;scale device.

         <title>An Injectable Hydrogel with Ultrahigh Burst Pressure and Innate Antibacterial Activity for Emergency Hemostasis and Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable hydrogel with excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, inherent antibacterial activity, and on&#8208;demand removability is developed using &#949;&#8208;polylysine and tetra&#8208;armed poly(ethylene glycol) succinimidyl succinate. The optimized hydrogel gelatinizes rapidly, sustains ultrahigh burst pressure, and effectively stops lethal hemorrhage in anticoagulated large animals. Furthermore, it facilitates sutureless repair of liver defects, skin incisions, and infected full&#8208;thickness skin wounds in rat models.








Abstract
Uncontrolled bleeding and wound infections following severe trauma pose significant challenges for existing tissue adhesives, primarily due to their weak wet adhesion, slow adhesion formation, cytotoxicity concerns, and lack of antibacterial properties. Herein, an injectable hydrogel (denoted as ES gel) with rapid, robust adhesive sealing and inherent antibacterial activity based on &#949;&#8208;polylysine and a poly(ethylene glycol) derivative is developed. The engineered hydrogel exhibits rapid gelation behavior, high mechanical strength, strong adhesion to various tissues, and can sustain an ultrahigh burst pressure of 450&#160;mmHg. It also presents excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, antibacterial properties, and on&#8208;demand removability. Significantly improved hemostatic efficacy of ES gel compared to fibrin glue is demonstrated using various injury models in rats and rabbits. Remarkably, the adhesive hydrogel can effectively halt lethal non&#8208;compressible hemorrhages in visceral organs (liver, spleen, and heart) and femoral artery injury models in fully anticoagulated pigs. Furthermore, the hydrogel outperforms commercial products in sutureless wound closure and repair in the rat liver defect, skin incision, and infected full&#8208;thickness skin wound models. Overall, this study highlights the promising clinical applications of ES gel for managing uncontrolled hemorrhage, sutureless wound closure, and infected wound repair.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive &#946;&#8208;Glucans&#8208;Complexed mRNA in LNPs as an Oral Vaccine for Enhancing Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon oral administration of &#946;Glus/mRNA@LNPs, the pH&#8208;responsive partial dissociation/reassociation behavior of &#946;Glus/mRNA complexes within LNPs effectively shields mRNA from degradation in the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment. &#946;Glus serve as both a protective agent and an adjuvant, facilitating stable delivery into GI&#8208;resident dendritic cells and non&#8208;antigen presenting cells for translation into tumor&#8208;associated antigens. This process initiates antigen&#8208;specific immune responses against tumors.








Abstract
mRNA vaccines for cancer immunotherapy are commonly delivered using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which, when administered intravenously, may accumulate in the liver, potentially limiting their therapeutic efficacy. To overcome this challenge, the study introduces an oral mRNA vaccine formulation tailored for efficient uptake by immune cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, known for its high concentration of immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs). This formulation comprises mRNA complexed with &#946;&#8208;glucans (&#946;Glus), a potential adjuvant for vaccines, encapsulated within LNPs (&#946;Glus/mRNA@LNPs). The &#946;Glus/mRNA complexes within the small compartments of LNPs demonstrate a distinctive ability to partially dissociate and reassociate, responding to pH changes, effectively shielding mRNA from degradation in the harsh GI environment. Upon oral administration to tumor&#8208;bearing mice, &#946;Glus/mRNA@LNPs are effectively taken up by intestinal DCs and local nonimmune cells, bypassing potential liver accumulation. This initiates antigen&#8208;specific immune responses through successful mRNA translation, followed by drainage into the mesenteric lymph nodes to stimulate T cells and trigger specific adaptive immune responses, ultimately enhancing antitumor effects. Importantly, the vaccine demonstrates safety, with no significant inflammatory reactions observed. In conclusion, the potential of oral &#946;Glus/mRNA@LNPs delivery presents a promising avenue in cancer immunotherapy, offering needle&#8208;free and user&#8208;friendly administration for widespread adoption and self&#8208;administration.

         <title>Filter&#8208;Less Color&#8208;Selective Photodetector Derived from Integration of Parallel Perovskite Photoelectric Response Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The color&#8208;selective photodetector is fabricated through integrating three units with different photoresponse on one chip, which is modulated by varying the electron transportation layer SnS2 through ultrasonic treatment, modulating the photogenerated carrier rate distribution and energy band alignment. Based on differences in spectral response, integrated three units can identify colors in polychromatic light to achieve color imaging.








Abstract
Color&#8208;selective photodetectors (PDs) play an indispensable role in spectral recognition, image sensing, and other fields. Nevertheless, complex filters and delicate optical paths in such devices significantly increase their complexity and size, which subsequently impede their integration in smart optoelectronic chips for universal applications. This work demonstrates the successful fabrication of filter&#8208;less color&#8208;selective perovskite PDs by integrating three perovskite units with different photoresponse on a single chip. The variation in photoresponse is attributed to different quantities of SnO2 nanoparticles, synthesized through controlled ultrasonic treatment on the surface of the electron transportation layer SnS2, which selectively absorb short&#8208;wavelength light, thus increasing the relative transmittance of long&#8208;wavelength light and enhancing the photoresponse of the units to long wavelengths. By integrating any two units and deriving the formula for the wavelength to the responsivity ratio, a wavelength sensor is developed which can accurately identify incident light in the range of 400&#8211;700&#160;nm with a minimum error &lt;3&#160;nm. Furthermore, the device integrating three units with different photoresponse can identify red, green and blue in polychromatic light to achieve color imaging with a relative error &lt;6%. This work provides valuable insights into wavelength identification and color imaging of perovskite PDs.

Organic ferromagnetic/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructures are fabricated in which the localized spin couples with dipole to realize the photon&#8211;dipole&#8211;spin interaction. The aligned dipoles in poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE))&#160;with an external electric field can effectively affect the magnetization of metal(tetracyanoethylene) (M(TCNE))x. Meanwhile, the external light field can control the electric polarization of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE). The organic multiferroic heterostructure provides the possibility of realizing bimodal memory.








Abstract
Organic multiferroic heterostructure is one of the most promising structures for the future design of high&#8208;density flexible energy&#8208;efficient data storage. Here, organic ferromagnetic metal(tetracyanoethylene) (M(TCNE))x/ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) multiferroic heterostructures are fabricated, where the excited state in M(TCNE)x interacted with localized dipole in P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) provides a key link for the interfacial coupling. Thus, aligned dipoles in P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) by external electric field can affect the magnetization of Fe(TCNE)x effectively to result in a pronounced magnetization&#8211;voltage (M&#8211;V) hysteresis loop. Moreover, light&#8208;induced electron&#8208;hole pairs in Fe(TCNE)x with long lifetime effectively interact with the dipoles in P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) to lead to an effect in external light control of electric polarization of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE). Overall, the organic multiferroic heterostructure provides the possibility of realizing two storage modes, light control of dipole as well as electric field control of spin, which can broaden multifunctional applications of organic multiferroic materials in the area of multistate storage.

         <title>Phonon Engineering in Solid Polymer Electrolyte toward High Safety for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work focuses on the influence of phonon scattering on solid&#8208;state&#8208;polymer electrolytes (SPEs), and designs an ultrathin PPIL electrolyte with high thermal stability by phonon engineering to optimize the high&#8208;safety of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs). Herein, a new way to enable SSLBs with high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density is shown, and the importance of phonon engineering in high&#8208;safety of SSLBs is highlighted.








Abstract
Extensively&#8208;used rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) face challenges in achieving high safety and long cycle life. To address such challenges, ultrathin solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) is fabricated with reduced phonon scattering by depositing the composites of ionic&#8208;liquid (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium dicyamide, EMIM:DCA), polyurethane (PU) and lithium salt on the polyethylene separator. The robust and flexible separator matrix not only reduces the electrolyte thickness and improves the mobility of Li+, but more importantly provides a relatively regular thermal diffusion channel for SPE and reduces the external phonon scattering. Moreover, the introduction of EMIM:DCA successfully breaks the random intermolecular attraction of the PU polymer chain and significantly decreases phonon scattering to enhance the internal thermal conductivity of the polymer. Thus, the thermal conductivity of the as&#8208;obtained SPE increases by approximately six times, and the thermal runaway (TR) of the battery is effectively inhibited. This work demonstrates that optimizing thermal safety of the battery by phonon engineering sheds a new light on the design principle for high&#8208;safety Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Development of Bio&#8208;Voltage Operated Humidity&#8208;Sensory Neurons Comprising Self&#8208;Assembled Peptide Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports low&#8208;power humidity&#8208;sensing neurons comprising biomimetic peptide memristors in which self&#8208;assembled nanowire promotes proton&#8208;coupled Ag+ transport, ultralow&#8208;power operation, and humidity&#8208;dependent conductance control. This bioinspired design encodes humidity into neural spikes, showing 92.68% accuracy in lung&#8208;disease diagnosis using a spiking neural network.








Abstract
Biomimetic humidity sensors offer a low&#8208;power approach for respiratory monitoring in early lung&#8208;disease diagnosis. However, balancing miniaturization and energy efficiency remains challenging. This study addresses this issue by introducing a bioinspired humidity&#8208;sensing neuron comprising a self&#8208;assembled peptide nanowire (NW) memristor with unique proton&#8208;coupled ion transport. The proposed neuron shows a low Ag+ activation energy owing to the NW and redox activity of the tyrosine (Tyr)&#8208;rich peptide in the system, facilitating ultralow electric&#8208;field&#8211;driven threshold switching and a high energy efficiency. Additionally, Ag+ migration in the system can be controlled by a proton source owing to the hydrophilic nature of the phenolic hydroxyl group in Tyr, enabling the humidity&#8208;based control of the conductance state of the memristor. Furthermore, a memristor&#8208;based neuromorphic perception neuron that can encode humidity signals into spikes is proposed. The spiking characteristics of this neuron can be modulated to emulate the strength&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;frequency characteristics of biological neurons. A three&#8208;layer spiking neural network with input neurons comprising these highly tunable humidity perception neurons shows an accuracy of 92.68% in lung&#8208;disease diagnosis. This study paves the way for developing bioinspired self&#8208;assembly strategies to construct neuromorphic perception systems, bridging the gap between artificial and biological sensing and processing paradigms.

         <title>An Active Halide Catholyte Boosts the Extra Capacity for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemical active halide electrolyte, Li3VCl6, exhibiting both a decent ionic conductivity and a high reversible Li+&#8208;storage capacity, is proposed for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The incorporation of this active electrolyte leads to a significant increase in the energy density of the composite cathode compared to traditional inactive electrolyte, advancing its multifunctionality and practicability.








Abstract
Replacing flammable organic liquid electrolytes with nonflammable solid electrolytes (SEs) in lithium batteries is crucial for enhancing safety across various applications, including portable electronics, electric vehicles, and scalable energy storage. Since typical cathode materials do not possess superionic conductivity, Li&#8208;ion conduction in the cathode predominantly relies on incorporating a significant number of SEs as additives to form a composite cathode, which substantially compromises the energy density of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. Here, a halide SE, Li3VCl6 is demonstrated, which not only exhibits a decent Li+ conductivity, but more importantly, delivers a highly reversible capacity of approximately 80 mAh g&#8722;1 with an average voltage of 3&#160;V versus Li+/Li. The ionic conductivity of Li3VCl6 experiences marginal fluctuations upon electrochemical lithiation/delithiation, as its prototypical solid&#8208;solution reaction results solely in a reduction of lithium vacancy. When combined with the traditional LiFePO4 cathode, the active Li3VCl6 catholyte enables an impressive capacity of 217.1 mAh g&#8722;1LFP and about 50% increase in energy density compared with inactive catholytes. Harnessing the integrated mass of the catholyte&#8212;which can serve as an active material&#8212;presents an opportunity to boost the extra capacity, rendering it feasible in applications.

Lithium hydride (LiH) has been widely recognized as the critical component of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) in Li batteries. Although the formation mechanism and structural model of LiH in SEI have been extensively reported, the role in electro&#8208;performance of LiH in SEI is still&#160;ambiguous and has proven challenging to explored due to the complicated structure SEI and the lack of advanced in situ experimental technology. In this study, the isotopic exchange experiments combined with isotopic tracer experiments is applied to solidly illustrate the superior conductivity and Li+ conduction behavior of the LiH in natural SEI. Importantly, in situ transmission electron microscopy analysis is utilized to visualize the self&#8208;electrochemical decomposition of LiH, which is significantly distinctive from LiF and Li2O. The critical experimental evidence discovered by the work demonstrates ion transport behaviors of key components in the SEI, which is imperative for designing novel SEI and augurs a new area in optimizing the performance of lithium batteries.

         <title>Strong&#8208;Yet&#8208;Ductile Eutectic Alloys Employing Cocoon&#8208;Like Nanometer&#8208;Sized Dislocation Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong&#8208;yet&#8208;ductile alloys require effective microstructural mechanisms for regulating dislocation evolution, to constantly impart strengthening and strain hardening while suppressing damage during tensile deformation. All these are achieved simultaneously in this work, by invoking a novel cocoon&#8208;like nano&#8208;meshed structure, an unusual arrangement of accumulated dislocations anchored by dense pre&#8208;existing nanoprecipitates into nanometer&#8208;scale thin&#8208;walled cells, thereby leading to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art eutectic alloys.








Abstract
Eutectic alloys (EAs) with superior fluidity are known to be the easiest to cast into high&#8208;quality ingots, making them the alloys of choice for making large&#8208;sized structural parts. However, conventional EAs (CEAs) have never reached strength&#8211;ductility combinations on par with the best in other alloy categories. Via thermomechanical processing of cast Ni&#8208;32.88wt%Fe&#8208;9.53wt%Al CEAs, a cocoon&#8208;like nano&#8208;meshed (as fine as 26&#8201;nm) network of dislocations (CNN&#8208;D) is produced via recovery annealing, through the rearrangement of cold&#8208;work&#8208;accumulated dislocations anchored by dense pre&#8208;existing nanoprecipitates. In lieu of traditional plasticity mechanisms, such as TWIP and TRIP, the CNN&#8208;D is particularly effective in eutectic lamellae with alternating phases, as it instigates nanometer&#8208;spaced planar slip bands that not only dynamically refine the microstructure but also transmit from the FCC (face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic) layers into the otherwise brittle B2 layers. These additional mechanisms for strengthening and strain hardening sustain stable tensile flow, resulting in a striking elevation of both strength and ductility to outrank not only all previous CEAs, but also the state of the art&#8212;additively manufactured eutectic high&#8208;entropy alloys. The CNN&#8208;D thus adds a novel microstructural strategy for performance enhancement, especially for compositionally complex alloys that increasingly make use of nanoprecipitates or local chemical order.

         <title>Nitric Oxide&#8208;Activated Bioorthogonal Codelivery Nanoassembly for In Situ Synthesis of Photothermal Agent for Precise and Safe Anticancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal codelivery nanosystem (TTB&#8208;NH2@PArg) is composed of a precursor (TTB&#8208;NH2) and amphipathic polyarginine (PArg). PArg serves as a self&#8208;assembled nanocarrier for TTB&#8208;NH2 and also a NO generator. In tumor microenvironment, high H2O2 concentration triggers sustainable NO generation, which converts TTB&#8208;NH2 into a photothermal agent TTB&#8208;AZO for precise and safe anticancer treatment.








Abstract
The development of bioorthogonal activation in drug release represents a promising avenue for precise and safe anticancer treatment. However, two significant limitations currently hinder their clinical application: i) the necessity for separate administration of the drug precursor and its corresponding activator, leading to poor drug accumulation and potential side effects; ii) the reliance on exogenous metal or organic activators for triggering bioorthogonal activation, which often exhibit low efficiency and systemic toxicity when extending to living animals. To overcome these limitations, a nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal codelivery nanoassembly, termed TTB&#8208;NH2@PArg, which comprises a precursor molecular (TTB&#8208;NH2) and amphipathic polyarginine (PArg) is developed. In TTB&#8208;NH2@PArg, PArg serves as both self&#8208;assembled nanocarrier for TTB&#8208;NH2 and a NO generator. In tumor microenvironment (TME), the TME&#8208;specific generation of NO acts as a gas activator, triggering in situ bioorthogonal bond formation that transforms TTB&#8208;NH2 into TTB&#8208;AZO. This tumor&#8208;specific generation of TTB&#8208;AZO not only serves as a potential photothermal agent for effective tumor inhibition but also induces fluorescence change that enables real&#8208;time monitoring of bioorthogonal activation. This study presents a drug codelivery approach that enables precise and safe control of bioorthogonal activation for anticancer treatment, improving cancer therapy efficacy while minimizing side effects.

         <title>Robust Transient Semi&#8208;Glue Tape: Ultrastrong Adhesion Empowered by Water Activation and Self&#8208;Locking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel adhesive material, which combines the advantageous features of both glues and tapes, is termed as transient semi&#8208;glue tape (TSGT). With aid of water droplets, TSGT surface is activated and turns glue&#8208;like, following by a robust self&#8208;locking on the target adherend. This facile yet universal approach achieves the highest adhesion strength to date for tape&#8208;type adhesives.








Abstract
In adhesive industry, tapes are renowned for their superior flexibility, repeatability, and ease of storage compared to glues. However, conventional adhesive tapes often suffer from low adhesion strength (&lt;500&#160;kPa). This work introduces an innovative adhesive tape composed of an amphiphilic copolymer and a hydrophobic ionic liquid, achieving an ultrahigh adhesion strength of up to 3.1&#160;MPa on various substrates, making a record&#8208;high strength to date for tape&#8208;type adhesives. This exceptional adhesion performance is facilitated by water droplets applied at the bonding interface, transforming the adhesive surface into a glue&#8208;like property without the need for curing treatments or additional auxiliary equipment. By combining the advantageous features of both glues and tapes, these adhesives are termed as transient semi&#8208;glue tapes (TSGT). The mechanism behind such water activation and self&#8208;locking process is elucidated, and a general preparation approach is developed. Furthermore, the repeatability and recyclability of TSGT are demonstrated, offering an ingenious solution to this long&#8208;standing engineering challenge.

         <title>Ferrocene&#8208;Based Polymer Organic Cathode for Extreme Fast Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Ultralong Lifespans</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion and electron transport issues in active materials must be smoothed out to build fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. Fast ion transport in the Fc&#8208;SO3Li electrode is achieved through careful structural design. The Fc&#8208;SO3Li&#8208;CNTX is prepared by insitu polymerization with carbon nanotube, which further improves the electron transport. Fc&#8208;SO3Li and Fc&#8208;SO3Li&#8208;CNT50 can achieve high energy density and ultralong cycles under ultrafast charging.








Abstract
To meet the growing demand for energy storage, lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with fast charging capabilities has emerged as a critical technology. The electrode materials affect the rate performance significantly. Organic electrodes with structural flexibility support fast lithium&#8208;ion transport and are considered promising candidates for fast&#8208;charging LIBs. However, it is a challenge to create organic electrodes that can cycle steadily and reach high energy density in a few minutes. To solve this issue, accelerating the transport of electrons and lithium ions in the electrode is the key. Here, it is demonstrated that a ferrocene&#8208;based polymer electrode (Fc&#8208;SO3Li) can be used as a fast&#8208;charging organic electrode for LIBs. Thanks to its molecular architecture, LIBs with Fc&#8208;SO3Li show exceptional cycling stability (99.99% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles) and reach an energy density of 183&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in 72 seconds. Moreover, the composite material through in&#160;situ polymerization with Fc&#8208;SO3Li and 50 wt % carbon nanotube (denoted as Fc&#8208;SO3Li&#8208;CNT50) achieved optimized electron and ion transport pathways. After 10&#160;000 cycles at a high current density of 50C, it delivered a high energy density of 304&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;Ion and electron transport issues in active materials must be smoothed out to build fast-charging lithium-ion battery cathodes. Fast ion transport in the Fc-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li electrode is achieved through careful structural design. The Fc-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li-CNTX is prepared by insitu polymerization with carbon nanotube, which further improves the electron transport. Fc-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li and Fc-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li-CNT50 can achieve high energy density and ultralong cycles under ultrafast charging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To meet the growing demand for energy storage, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) with fast charging capabilities has emerged as a critical technology. The electrode materials affect the rate performance significantly. Organic electrodes with structural flexibility support fast lithium-ion transport and are considered promising candidates for fast-charging LIBs. However, it is a challenge to create organic electrodes that can cycle steadily and reach high energy density in a few minutes. To solve this issue, accelerating the transport of electrons and lithium ions in the electrode is the key. Here, it is demonstrated that a ferrocene-based polymer electrode (Fc-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li) can be used as a fast-charging organic electrode for LIBs. Thanks to its molecular architecture, LIBs with Fc-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li show exceptional cycling stability (99.99% capacity retention after 10 000 cycles) and reach an energy density of 183&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 72 seconds. Moreover, the composite material through in&#160;situ polymerization with Fc-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li and 50 wt % carbon nanotube (denoted as Fc-SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li-CNT50) achieved optimized electron and ion transport pathways. After 10&#160;000 cycles at a high current density of 50C, it delivered a high energy density of 304&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study provides valuable insights into designing cathode materials for LIBs that combine high power and ultralong cycle life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Targeting, Multi&#8208;Faceted Biocompatible Nanodrug Optimizes the Microenvironment to Ameliorate Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm</title>

         <dc:description>
By incorporating a hepatitis B virus core protein monomer with an RGD peptide modification and integrating the therapeutic drug EVMS through self&#8208;assembly, the EVMS@R&#8208;HNC construct specifically targets and facilitates the conversion of pro&#8208;inflammatory M1&#8208;like macrophages into anti&#8208;inflammatory M2&#8208;like macrophages, thereby suppressing the secretion of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines and ameliorating the inflammatory microenvironment.








Abstract
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a highly lethal cardiovascular disease that currently lacks effective pharmacological treatment given the complex pathophysiology of the disease. Here, single&#8208;cell RNA&#8208;sequencing data from patients with AAA and a mouse model are analyzed, which reveals pivotal pathological changes, including the M1&#8208;like polarization of macrophages and the loss of contractile function in smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Both cell types express the integrin &#945;v&#946;3, allowing for their dual targeting with a single rationally designed molecule. To this end, a biocompatible nanodrug, which is termed EVMS@R&#8208;HNC, that consists of the multifunctional drug everolimus (EVMS) encapsulated by the hepatitis B virus core protein modifies to contain the RGD sequence to specifically bind to integrin &#945;v&#946;3 is designed. Both in vitro and in vivo results show that EVMS@R&#8208;HNC can target macrophages as well as SMCs. Upon binding of the nanodrug, the EVMS is released intracellularly where it exhibits multiple functions, including inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization, thereby suppressing the self&#8208;propagating inflammatory cascade and immune microenvironment imbalance, while preserving the normal contractile function of SMCs. Collectively, these results suggest that EVMS@R&#8208;HNC presents a highly promising therapeutic approach for the management of AAA.

         <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance in Vacancy&#8208;Filling Heuslers due to Kondo&#8208;Like Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrate that intrinsic magnetic&#8208;electrical&#8208;thermal coupling can enhance the thermoelectric performance. The vacancy&#8208;filling Heusler alloy Nb0.75Ti0.25FeCrxSb shows a Kondo&#8208;like effect, which not only increases the effective mass but also reduces the thermal conductivity. As a result, a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of 1.21 is achieved at 973 K in Nb0.75Ti0.25FeCr0.1Sb.








Abstract
To improve thermoelectric efficiency, various tactics have been employed with considerable success to decouple intertwined material attributes. However, the integration of magnetism, derived from the unique spin characteristic that other methods cannot replicate, has been comparatively underexplored and presents an ongoing intellectual challenge. A previous research has shown that vacancy&#8208;filling Heuslers offer a highly adaptable framework for modulating thermoelectric properties. Here, it is demonstrated how intrinsic magnetic&#8208;electrical&#8208;thermal coupling can enhance the thermoelectric performance of vacancy&#8208;filling Heusler alloys. The materials, Nb0.75Ti0.25FeCrxSb with 0 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.1, feature a fraction of magnetic Cr ions that randomly occupy the vacancy sites of the Nb0.75Ti0.25FeSb half&#8208;Heusler matrix. These alloys achieve a remarkable thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of 1.21 at 973 K, owing to increased Seebeck coefficient and decreased thermal conductivity. The mechanism is primarily due to the introduction of magnetism, which increases the density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass (reaching levels up to 15 times that of a free electron's mass) and simultaneously reduces the electronic thermal conductivity. Mass and strain&#8208;field fluctuations further reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Even higher zT values can potentially be achieved by carefully balancing electron mobility and effective mass. This work underscores the substantial prospects for exploiting magnetic&#8208;electrical&#8208;thermal synergies in cutting&#8208;edge thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Decoration of Ag Species into Reduced Graphene Oxide Foam as a Superelastic and Robust Host toward Stable Zn Metal Anodes under Dwell&#8208;Fatigue Condition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag decorated reduced graphene oxide foam (AGF) is designed as a Zn host for Zn metal anodes under dwell&#8208;fatigue condition through a wet&#8208;press dual&#8208;templating assembly strategy. Owing to high mechanical strength and strong synergetic effect, the AGF host demonstrates remarkable superelasticity and robustness. As a result, the AGF@Zn enables stable Zn plating/stripping under normal condition and varying pressures.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;sea equipment usually operates under dwell&#8208;fatigue condition, which means the equipped energy storage devices must survive under the changing pressure. Special mechanical designs should be considered to maintain the electrochemical performance of electrodes under this extreme condition. In this work, an effective assembly strategy is proposed to accommodate the dwell&#8208;fatigue loading using Ag decorated reduced graphene oxide (rGO) foam (denoted as AGF) as a superelastic and robust Zn host. The wet&#8208;press assembly process enables the formation of highly porous and robust framework. The strong synergetic effect between rGO and Ag further guarantees AGF's superelasticity and ultrahigh mechanical strength. Meanwhile, the homogeneously distributed Ag species on the rGO sheets act as zincophilic sites to effectively facilitate Zn plating. Furthermore, AGF offers enough space to address the expansion during the charge and discharge cycles. As expected, the symmetrical cell using this AGF@Zn host demonstrates a long lifespan over 400&#160;h at a depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge of 50%. It is worth mentioning that the superelastic AGF host realizes stable Zn plating/stripping under varying pressures.

The 2D&#8208;ACG strategy is developed to control the nucleation and crystallization of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite films. This involves utilizing in situ generated and embedded 2D perovskite as a template, thereby inducing perovskite growth. Consequently, the PSCs based on this strategy achieved an impressive efficiency of 26.16% (certified at 25.84%) along with superior film and device stability.








Abstract
Enhancing stability while maintaining high efficiency is among the primary challenges in the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a crystal growth technique assisted by in situ generated 2D perovskite phases has been developed to construct high&#8208;quality 2D/3D perovskite films. The in situ generated 2D perovskite serve as templates for regulating the nucleation and oriented crystal growth in the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;rich film. This led to a high film quality with much reduced trap density and an ultralong carrier lifetime. The obtained perovskite film shows excellent stability under extreme environment conditions (T = 200 &#176;C, RH = 75 &#177; 5%). The corresponding PSC achieved an efficiency of 26.16% (certified 25.84%), along with excellent operational stability (T93 &gt; 1300 h, T &#8773; 50&#160;&#176;C) as well as outstanding high and low temperature cycle stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhancing stability while maintaining high efficiency is among the primary challenges in the commercialization of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a crystal growth technique assisted by in situ generated 2D perovskite phases has been developed to construct high-quality 2D/3D perovskite films. The in situ generated 2D perovskite serve as templates for regulating the nucleation and oriented crystal growth in the &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-rich film. This led to a high film quality with much reduced trap density and an ultralong carrier lifetime. The obtained perovskite film shows excellent stability under extreme environment conditions (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; = 200 &#176;C, RH = 75 &#177; 5%). The corresponding PSC achieved an efficiency of 26.16% (certified 25.84%), along with excellent operational stability (T93 &amp;gt; 1300 h, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; &#8773; 50&#160;&#176;C) as well as outstanding high and low temperature cycle stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electroactive Ionic Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity for High&#8208;Performance Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling the higher&#8208;order structure of ionic polymers is a promising method to achieve high energy densities, long&#8208;term cycling stability, and straightforward processing in energy storage devices. A solution&#8208;processable viologen&#8208;based polymer of intrinsic microporosity (200 m2 g&#8722;1) hosts a 315 F g&#8722;1 gravimetric and 193 mF cm&#8722;2 areal capacitance that is maintained at &gt;90% over 10,000 charging&#8211;discharging cycles in a prototype device.








Abstract
Here, an ionic polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) as a high&#8208;functioning supercapacitor electrode without the need for conductive additives or binders is reported. The performance of this material is directly related to its large accessible surface area. By comparing electrochemical performance between a porous viologen PIM and a nonporous viologen polymer, it is revealed that the high energy and power density are both due to the ability of ions to rapidly access the ionic PIM. In 0.1&#160;m H2SO4 electrolyte, a pseudocapacitve energy of 315 F g&#8722;1 is observed, whereas in 0.1&#160;m Na2SO4, a capacitive energy density of 250 F g&#8722;1 is obtained. In both cases, this capacity is retained over 10&#160;000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles, without the need for stabilizing binders or conductive additives even at moderate loadings (5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). This desirable performance is maintained in a prototype symmetric two&#8208;electrode capacitor device, which has &gt;99% Coloumbic efficiency and a &lt;10 mF capacity drop over 2000 cycles. These results demonstrate that ionic PIMs function well as standalone supercapacitor electrodes and suggest ionic PIMs may perform well in other electrochemical devices such as sensors, ion&#8208;separation membranes, or displays.

         <title>Hofmeister Effects in Supramolecular Chemistry for Anion&#8208;Modulation to Stabilize Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The modulation of anions in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) is reported, showing that the right&#8208;side anions in the Hofmeister series that have strong interactions with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) can enhance the stability of Zn anodes and the addition of &#946;&#8208;CD in such electrolytes has a further positive effect, while the left&#8208;side anions show worse rate performance after the addition of &#946;&#8208;CD.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are considered as promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage, which, however, is facing the challenge of instable Zn anodes. The anion is pivotal in the stability of anodes, which are not being paid enough attention to. Herein, the modulation of anions is reported using the Hofmeister series in supramolecular chemistry to boost the stability of Zn anodes. It is found that the right&#8208;side anions in the Hofmeister series (e.g., OTf&#8722;) can enhance the Zn2+ transference number, increase the Coulombic efficiency, facilitate uniform Zn deposition, reduce the freezing point of electrolytes, and thereby stabilize the Zn anodes. More importantly, the right&#8208;side anions can form strong interaction with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD) compared to the left&#8208;side anions, and hence the addition of &#946;&#8208;CD can further enhance the stability of Zn anodes in OTf&#8722;&#8208;based electrolytes, showing enhancement of cycling lifespan in the Zn//Zn symmetric cells more than 45.5 times with &#946;&#8208;CD compared with those without &#946;&#8208;CD. On the contrary, the left&#8208;side anions show worse rate performance after the addition of &#946;&#8208;CD. These results provide an effective and novel approach for choosing anions and matching additives to stabilize the anodes and achieve high&#8208;performance AZIBs through the Hofmeister effect.

         <title>Lattice Strain with Stabilized Oxygen Vacancies Boosts Ceria for Robust Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Outperforming Benchmark Pt</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heavy rare earth (Y) and transition metal (Co) dual&#8208;doping induced lattice strain and oxygen vacancy stabilization strategy, synergistically improve H2O dissociation and hydrogen adsorption, is reported to boost CeO2 for alkaline hydrogen evolution outperforming benchmark Pt. Meanwhile, Y doping stabilized oxygen vacancies due to the stronger Y&#9472;O bond than Ce&#9472;O, endowing the Y,Co&#8208;CeO2 with excellent stability.








Abstract
Earth&#8208;abundant metal oxides are usually considered as stable but catalytically inert toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their unfavorable hydrogen intermediate adsorption performance. Herein, a heavy rare earth (Y) and transition metal (Co) dual&#8208;doping induced lattice strain and oxygen vacancy stabilization strategy is proposed to boost CeO2 toward robust alkaline HER. The induced lattice compression and increased oxygen vacancy (Ov) concentration in CeO2 synergistically improve the water dissociation on Ov&#160;sites and sequential hydrogen adsorption at activated Ov&#8208;neighboring sites, leading to significantly enhanced HER kinetics. Meanwhile, Y doping offers stabilization effect on Ov by its stronger Y&#9472;O bonding over Ce&#9472;O, which endows the catalyst with excellent stability. The Y,Co&#8208;CeO2 electrocatalyst exhibits an ultra&#8208;low HER overpotential (27&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and Tafel slope (48&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), outperforming the benchmark Pt electrocatalyst. Moreover, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer incorporated with Y,Co&#8208;CeO2 achieves excellent stability of 500&#160;h under 600&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This synergistic lattice strain and oxygen vacancy stabilization strategy sheds new light on the rational development of efficient and stable oxide&#8208;based HER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Fabrication of Isotope&#8208;Enriched Nanostructures Using Ultrafast Laser Pulses under Ambient Conditions for Biomolecular Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser&#8208;induced isotope enrichment at nanoscale (LIIEN) is a novel approach that revolutionizes lab&#8208;scale synthesis of stable isotope&#8208;enriched nanostructures using high&#8208;intensity laser pulses. Achieving a remarkable 5000&#8208;fold isotope enrichment in light atomic mass elements, LIIEN produces nanostructures that deliver exceptional SERS (Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering) signal enhancement, making them ideal for advanced biomolecule sensing.








Abstract
Recent advances in the use of stable isotopes necessitate novel synthesis techniques for isotope separation and enrichment that are scalable and offer high throughput. Stable&#8208;isotope&#8208;enriched nanostructures can offer unique advantages as nanomedicines, safe tracers, and labels and are critical for applications in various industrial processes, metabolic research, and medicine. So far, there exists no method to synthesize miniature isotope&#8208;enriched materials at the nanoscale. In this study, an ultrafast Laser&#8208;induced isotope enrichment at nanoscale (LIIEN) is put forward to synthesize isotope&#8208;enriched nanostructures, eliminating the need for large equipment and expenses, thereby demonstrating a lab&#8208;scale isotope enrichment process. A significant isotope enrichment for Carbon nanostructures is observed. The isotope enrichment can be attributed to the redistribution of isotope ions in the plasma plume explained by the plasma centrifuge model. The LIIEN synthesized structures exhibit excellent Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)&#160;signal enhancement and reproducibility, making them potential candidates for SERS&#8208;based biomolecule sensing. This technique is an efficient method to fabricate nanosized isotope&#8208;enriched structures of characteristic properties by carefully tuning laser parameters at ambient conditions.

In this study, an ultrafast Laser-induced isotope enrichment at nanoscale (LIIEN) is put forward to synthesize isotope-enriched nanostructures, eliminating the need for large equipment and expenses, thereby demonstrating a lab-scale isotope enrichment process. A significant isotope enrichment for Carbon nanostructures is observed. The isotope enrichment can be attributed to the redistribution of isotope ions in the plasma plume explained by the plasma centrifuge model. The LIIEN synthesized structures exhibit excellent Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS)&#160;signal enhancement and reproducibility, making them potential candidates for SERS-based biomolecule sensing. This technique is an efficient method to fabricate nanosized isotope-enriched structures of characteristic properties by carefully tuning laser parameters at ambient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring Multi&#8208;Phenyl Ring Cation for Stable Scalable Hybrid Bismuth Iodide Amorphous Film: Enabling Record Sensitivity and High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Array Imaging</title>

Here, a new multi&#8208;phenyl ring methyltriphenylphosphonium (MTP) is designed to optimize the energy band structure. For the first time, the coupling between the A&#8208;site cation and [Bi2X9]3&#8722; is realized, making it the main contributor to the conduction band minimum (CBM). Further, the preparation of MTP3Bi2I9 amorphous large&#8208;area wafer is achieved by a melt&#8208;quenching method, and further applies to X&#8208;ray array imaging.








Abstract
The 329&#8208;type bismuth (Bi)&#8208;based metal halide (MH) polycrystalline films have potential to be applied in the new generation of X&#8208;ray imaging technology owing to high X&#8208;ray absorption coefficients and excellent detection properties. However, the mutually independent [Bi2X9]3&#8722; units and numerous grain boundaries in the material lead to low carrier transport and collection capabilities, severe ion migration, large dark currents, and poor response uniformity. Here, a new multi&#8208;phenyl ring methyltriphenylphosphonium (MTP) is designed to optimize the energy band structure. For the first time, the coupling between the A&#8208;site cation and [Bi2X9]3&#8722; is realized, making it the main contributor to the conduction band minimum (CBM), getting rid of dilemma that carrier transport is confined to [Bi2X9]3&#8722;. Further, the preparation of MTP3Bi2I9 amorphous large&#8208;area wafer is achieved by melt&#8208;quenching; the steric hindrance effect improves stability, increases ion migration energy, and promotes response uniformity (14%). Moreover, the amorphous structure takes advantage of A&#8208;site cation participation in the conductivity, achieving a record sensitivity (7601 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and low dark current (&#8776;0.11 nA) in the field of amorphous X&#8208;ray detection, and features low&#8208;temperature large&#8208;area preparation. Ultimately, designing amorphous array imaging devices that exhibit excellent response uniformity and potential imaging capabilities is succeeded here.

         <title>Functional Covalent Organic Frameworks&#8217; Microspheres Synthesized by Self&#8208;Limited Dynamic Linker Exchange for Stationary Phases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A morphology&#8208;retain &#8220;self&#8208;limited dynamic linker exchange&#8221; strategy is developed to prepare uniform functionalized covalent organic framework (COF) microspheres by in situ linker exchange, in which six COF microspheres with different functional groups are constructed, showing the universality and superiority of the strategy. Further, the chiral functional COF microspheres are used as stationary phases of chiral chromatography and realized effective enantioseparation.








Abstract
Synthesizing uniform functional covalent organic framework (COF) microspheres is the prerequisite of applying COFs as novel stationary phases for liquid chromatography. However, the synthesis of functionalized COF microspheres is challenging due to the difficulty in maintaining microspheric morphology when conferring functions. Here, a facile and universal &#8220;self&#8208;limited dynamic linker exchange&#8221; strategy is developed to achieve surface functionalization of uniform COF microspheres. Six different types of COF microspheres are constructed, showing the universality and superiority of the strategy. The library of COF microspheres&#8217; stationary phases can be further enriched on demand by varying different functional building blocks. The &#8220;self&#8208;limited dynamic linker exchange&#8221; is attributed to the result of a delicate balance of reaction thermodynamics and molecular diffusion energy barrier. As a demonstration, the chiral functional COF microspheres are used as stationary phases of chiral chromatography and realized effective enantioseparation.

         <title>Interfacial Biomacromolecular Engineering Toward Stable Ah&#8208;Level Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trace amount of Fucoidan is introduced into the aqueous electrolyte to reshape the electric double layer structure of zinc anode via its specific adsorption, which effectively homogenizes the interfacial concentration field and enables a hybrid nucleation and growth mode characterized as nuclei&#8208;rich and space&#8208;confined dense plating. Curbed corrosion and by&#8208;products also contribute to the dendrite&#8208;free Zn chemistry.








Abstract
Interfacial instability within aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) spurs technical obstacles including parasitic side reactions and dendrite failure to reach the practical application standards. Here, an interfacial engineering is showcased by employing a bio&#8208; derived zincophilic macromolecule as the electrolyte additive (0.037 wt%), which features a long&#8208;chain configuration with laterally distributed hydroxyl and sulfate anion groups, and has the propensity to remodel the electric double layer of Zn anodes. Tailored Zn2+&#8208;rich compact layer is the result of their adaptive adsorption that effectively homogenizes the interfacial concentration field, while enabling a hybrid nucleation and growth mode characterized as nuclei&#8208;rich and space&#8208;confined dense plating. Further resonated with curbed corrosion and by&#8208;products, a dendrite&#8208;free deposition morphology is achieved. Consequently, the macromolecule&#8208;modified zinc anode delivers over 1250 times of reversible plating/stripping at a practical area capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8722;2, as well as a high zinc utilization rate of 85%. The Zn//NH4V4O10 pouch cell with the maximum capacity of 1.02 Ah can be steadily operated at 71.4&#160;mA g&#8722;1 (0.25 C) with 98.7% capacity retained after 50 cycles, which demonstrates the scale&#8208;up capability and highlights a &#8220;low input and high return&#8221; interfacial strategy toward practical AZBs.

         <title>A Universal Coulombic Efficiency Compensation Strategy for Zinc&#8208;Based Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal CE compensation strategy is proposed for alkaline Zn/Fe flow batteries (AZIFBs) by triggering the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathodic side. The strategy effectively mitigates the gradual accumulation of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; in catholyte by consuming the extra OH&#8722; during continuous cycling process. As a result, AZIFBs demonstrate exceptional cycling performance with extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.0005%/cycle).








Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow batteries (AZIFBs) are well suited for energy storage because of their good safety, high cell voltage, and low cost. However, the occurrence of irreversible anodic parasitic reactions results in a diminished coulombic efficiency (CE), unbalanced charge state of catholyte/anolyte and subsequently, a poor cycling performance. Here, a universal CE compensation strategy centered around the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathodic side, is reported. This strategy aims to equalize the charge state of the [Fe(CN)6]3&#8208;/4&#8722;&#8208;based catholyte and counteract pH fluctuations. The OER process can be implemented either directly on the electrode through electrochemical reaction or in an external catalytic reactor column via a redox&#8208;mediated process. This innovative approach effectively mitigates the gradual accumulation of [Fe(CN)6]3&#8722; in discharged catholyte and [Zn(OH)4]2&#8722; in charged anolyte by consuming the extra OH&#8722; during a continuous cycling process. As a result, AZIFBs demonstrate exceptional cycling performance with an extremely low capacity fading rate of 0.0128%/day (or 0.0005%/cycle) over 600 cycles at 80% state of charge (SOC). The proposed CE compensation strategy not only provides an effective way to address the CE loss issue for AZIFBs, but also can be applied to diverse battery technologies encountering CE loss caused by water/oxygen&#8208;induced parasitic reactions.

The proposed CE compensation strategy not only provides an effective way to address the CE loss issue for AZIFBs, but also can be applied to diverse battery technologies encountering CE loss caused by water/oxygen-induced parasitic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>UV&#8208;Permeable 3D Li Anodes for In Situ Fabrication of Interface&#8208;Gapless Flexible Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial gaps between the electrodes and the electrolyte of solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are eliminated by using a 3D UV&#8208;permeable Li metal anode (UVp&#8208;Li) and a facile UV&#8208;induced in situ polymerization method. The as&#8208;fabricated SSLMBs based on UVp&#8208;Li present excellent electrochemical stability, long&#8208;term cycling lifetime, and good mechanical flexibility.








Abstract
Flexible solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are highly desirable for future wearable electronics because of their high energy density and safety. However, flexible SSLMBs face serious challenges not only in regulating the Li plating/stripping behaviors but also in enabling the mechanical flexibility of the cell. Both challenges are largely associated with the interfacial gaps between the solid electrolytes and the electrodes. Here, a UV&#8208;permeable and flexible composited Li metal anode (UVp&#8208;Li), which possesses a unique light&#8208;penetrating interwoven structure similar to textiles is reported. UVp&#8208;Li allows one&#8208;step bonding of the cathode, anode, and solid electrolyte via an in situ UV&#8208;initiated polymerization method to achieve the gapless SSLMBs. The gapless structure not only effectively stabilizes the plating/stripping of Li metal during cycling, but also ensures the integrity of the cell during mechanical bending. UVp&#8208;Li symmetric cell presents a stable cycling over 1000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. LiFePO4||UVp&#8208;Li full cells (areal capacity ranging from 0.5 to 3 mAh cm&#8722;2) show outstanding capacity retention of over 84% after 500 charge/discharge cycles at room temperature. Large pouch cells using high&#8208;loading cathodes maintain stable electrochemical performance during 1000 times of dynamic bending.

         <title>Universal Formation of Single Atoms from Molten Salt for Facilitating Selective CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molten&#8208;salt atomization strategy is developed for temperature&#8208;universal synthesis of Zn single&#8208;atom catalysts with tunable coordination environments. In a strongly acidic medium (pH&#160;=&#160;1), the single&#8208;atom Zn sites with Zn&#8208;N4 coordination exhibits nearly 100% FECO in a wide current density range of 100&#8211;600&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Clarifying the formation mechanism of single&#8208;atom sites guides the design of emerging single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and facilitates the identification of the active sites at atomic scale. Herein, a molten&#8208;salt atomization strategy is developed for synthesizing zinc (Zn) SACs with temperature universality from 400 to 1000/1100&#160;&#176;C and an evolved coordination from Zn&#8208;N2Cl2 to Zn&#8208;N4. The electrochemical tests and in situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy confirm that the Zn&#8208;N4 atomic sites are active for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion to carbon monoxide (CO). In a strongly acidic medium (0.2&#160;m K2SO4, pH = 1), the Zn SAC formed at 1000&#160;&#176;C (Zn1NC) containing Zn&#8208;N4 sites enables highly selective CO2 electroreduction to CO, with nearly 100% selectivity toward CO product in a wide current density range of 100&#8211;600&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. During a 50 h continuous electrolysis at the industrial current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, Zn1NC achieves Faradaic efficiencies greater than 95% for CO product. The work presents a temperature&#8208;universal formation of single&#8208;atom sites, which provides a novel platform for unraveling the active sites in Zn SACs for CO2 electroreduction and extends the synthesis of SACs with controllable coordination sites.

         <title>Discovering Pyramidal Treasures: Multi&#8208;Scale Design of High Strength&#8211;Ductility Titanium Alloys</title>

         <dc:description>
The strength&#8208;ductility synergy of (&#945; + &#946;) titanium alloys is often limited by the hexagonal close&#8208;packed structure of the &#945;&#8208;phase. This work shows a facile route to a bimodal (&#945;+&#946;) titanium alloy with gigapascal&#8208;level strength and &gt;20 % tensile ductility via integrated lattice&#8208;scale and polycrystal&#8208;scale design conceptions. 








Abstract
Mechanical properties of titanium alloys, one of humankind's most essential structural materials, suffer from the lack of &#12296;c + a&#12297; dislocations on pyramidal slip planes, failing homogeneous plastic strain accommodation. This mechanical treasure is not easily accessible in titanium alloys because of the required excessively high stress levels. The present work demonstrates that such a dilemma may be overcome by meticulously tuning the c/a ratio, the simplest crystallographic parameter of the hexagonal close&#8208;packed lattice, through Sn alloying. Combining this lattice&#8208;scale design concept with a cross&#8208;rolling based polycrystal&#8208;scale design solution, this study showcases a facile route to bimodal (&#945; + &#946;) titanium alloys with exceptional strength&#8211;ductility synergy.

         <title>Quantifying Asymmetric Zinc Deposition: A Guide Factor for Designing Durable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new indicator (fD) is proposed to specifically evaluate dendrite growth. As proof of concept, triethylenetetramine, as an electrolyte additive, featured uniform zinc deposition and a corroborating low fD factor. Demonstrated zinc electrodes sustain over 2500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 400&#160;h at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and long&#8208;term cycling in Zn||MnO2 batteries.








Abstract
Zinc metal is recognized as the most promising anode for aqueous energy storage but suffers from severe dendrite growth and poor reversibility. However, the coulombic efficiency lacks specificity for zinc dendrite growth, particularly in Zn||Zn symmetric cells. Herein, a novel indicator (fD) based on the characteristic crystallization peaks is proposed to evaluate the growth and distribution of zinc dendrites. As a proof of concept, triethylenetetramine (TETA) is adopted as an electrolyte additive to manipulate the zinc flux for uniform deposition, with a corroborating low fD value. A highly durable zinc symmetric cell is achieved, lasting over 2500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 400&#160;h at a large discharge of depth (10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2). Supported by the low fD value, the Zn||TETA&#8208;ZnSO4||MnO2 batteries overcome the sudden short circuit and fast capacity fading. The study provides a feasible method to evaluate zinc dendrites and sheds light on the design of highly reversible zinc anodes.

A highly durable zinc symmetric cell is achieved, lasting over 2500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 400&#160;h at a large discharge of depth (10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 10&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Supported by the low &lt;i&gt;f&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; value, the Zn||TETA-ZnSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries overcome the sudden short circuit and fast capacity fading. The study provides a feasible method to evaluate zinc dendrites and sheds light on the design of highly reversible zinc anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Hole&#8208;Selective Contact Enables Highly Efficient and Stable FAPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Semitransparent Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) of iodine&#8208;equipped&#8208;2PACz (I&#8208;2PACz) is employed to achieve high&#8208;performance FAPbBr3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The I&#8208;2PACz as the hole&#8208;selective contact can improve the perovskite crystallization through halogen&#8208;halogen bond, and optimize the interfacial energy levels alignment to facilitate hole extraction. A record efficiency of 11.14% for FAPbBr3&#8208;based solar cells and 6.23% for semitransparent modules are achieved.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as the hole&#8208;selective contact have achieved remarkable success in iodine&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), while their impact on bromine&#8208;based PSCs is limited due to the poor perovskite crystallization behavior and mismatched energy level alignment. Here, a highly efficient SAM of (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;diiodo&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid (I&#8208;2PACz) is employed to address these challenges in FAPbBr3&#8208;based PSCs. The incorporation of I atoms into I&#8208;2PACz not only releases tensile stress within FAPbBr3 perovskite, promoting oriented crystallization and minimizing defects through halogen&#8208;halogen bond, but also optimizes the energy levels alignment at hole&#8208;selective interface for enhanced hole extraction. Ultimately, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.14% is achieved, which stands among the highest reported value for FAPbBr3 PSCs. Furthermore, the semitransparent devices/modules exhibit impressive PCEs of 8.19% and 6.23% with average visible transmittance of 41.98% and 38.99%. Remarkably, after operating at maximum power point for 1000 h, the encapsulated device maintains 93% of its initial PCE. These results demonstrate an effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance bromine&#8208;based PSCs toward further applications.

         <title>Evolution of Naturally Dried MXene&#8208;Based Composite Aerogels with Flash Joule Annealing for Large&#8208;Scale Production of Highly Sensitive Customized Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the naturally dried MXene&#8208;based aerogels and their applications in highly sensitive piezoresistive sensors, where a systematic drying strategy is explored in detail, including the improvement of MXene sheet stiffness, control of hydrophobicity, and optimization of pore structure. Further combined with laser engraving, customized multifunctional sensors are developed.








Abstract
MXene aerogels, known for good electrical properties, offer immense potential for the development of high&#8208;sensitivity pressure sensors. However, the intrinsic challenges stemming from the poor self&#8208;assembly capability and high hydrophilicity of MXene impede the natural drying process of MXene&#8208;based hydrogels, thereby constraining their application on a large scale in sensor technology. Herein, a graphene&#8208;assisted approach aimed at modulating the hydrophobicity and enhancing framework strength of MXene through a well&#8208;designed prefreezing technique incorporating 3D spherical macroporous structures is proposed. This synergistic strategy enables the fabrication of naturally dried MXene aerogels across various size scales. Moreover, the integration of 3D spherical macroporous structures improves elasticity and electrical responsiveness of aerogels. Consequently, the aerogel sensor exhibits great performances, including high sensitivity (1250 kPa&#8722;1), low detection limit (0.4&#160;Pa), wide frequency response range (0.1&#8211;8&#160;Hz), and excellent stability (1000 cycles). This sensor proves adept at monitoring pressure signals ranging from lightweight paper to human motion. Additionally, the application of customized laser engraving endows aerogels with unique functionalities, such as compressibility and immunity to strain, stretchability and resistance to compression, as well as wind detection. Thus, the proposed approach holds significant promise as a scalable method for the mass production of aerogels with versatile applications.

         <title>Zirconium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Free Hydroxy Groups for Enhanced Perfluorooctanoic Acid Uptake in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8210;organic frameworks bearing free ortho&#8208;hydroxy sites, namely noninterpenetrated PCN&#8208;1001 and twofold interpenetrated PCN&#8208;1002, are reported. Compared to PCN&#8208;1001, PCN&#8208;1002 displays higher chemical stability, thereby exhibiting a remarkable perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) uptake (632&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1). Mechanism study reveals that multiple hydrogen bonds between free ortho&#8208;hydroxy sites and PFOA and Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction work collaboratively to enhance PFOA adsorption.








Abstract
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a highly recalcitrant organic pollutant, and its bioaccumulation severely endangers human health. While various methods are developed for PFOA removal, the targeted design of adsorbents with high efficiency and reusability remains largely unexplored. Here the rational design and synthesis of two novel zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8210;organic frameworks (MOFs) bearing free ortho&#8208;hydroxy sites, namely noninterpenetrated PCN&#8208;1001 and twofold interpenetrated PCN&#8208;1002,&#160;are presented. Single crystal analysis of the pure ligand reveals that intramolecular hydrogen bonding plays a pivotal role in directing the formation of MOFs with free hydroxy groups. Furthermore, the transformation from PCN&#8208;1001 to PCN&#8208;1002 is realized. Compared to PCN&#8208;1001, PCN&#8208;1002 displays higher chemical stability due to interpenetration, thereby demonstrating an exceptional PFOA adsorption capacity of up to 632&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 (1.53&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1), which is comparable to the reported record values. Moreover, PCN&#8208;1002 shows rapid kinetics, high selectivity, and long&#8208;life cycles in PFOA removal tests. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance results and density functional theory calculations reveal that multiple hydrogen bonds between the free ortho&#8208;hydroxy sites and PFOA, along with Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction, work collaboratively to enhance PFOA adsorption.

         <title>Ultrafast Photoexcitation Induced Passivation for Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under lower photoexcitation level, the dimensionality reduction process dominates to form low n&#8208;phase 2D perovskite in surface. And the higher photoexcitation level can induce the oxygen doping to fill the vacancies in bulk. In the best synergistic level, this technique can passivate surface defects to inhibit the immersion of moisture and passivate bulk defects to improve carrier transfer, simultaneously.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites exhibit great potential in photodetectors due to their exceptional optoelectronic responsivity and stability, compared to their 3D counterparts. However, the defects are detrimental to the responsivity, response speed, and stability of perovskite photodetectors. Herein, an ultrafast photoexcitation&#8208;induced passivation technique is proposed to synergistically reduce the dimensionality at the surface and induce oxygen doping in the bulk, via tuning the photoexcitation intensity. At the optimal photoexcitation level, the excited electrons and holes generate stretching force on the Pb&#9472;I bonds at the interlayered [PbI6]&#8722;, resulting in low dimensional perovskite formation, and the absorptive oxygen is combined with I vacancies at the same time. These two induced processes synergistically boost the carrier transport and interface contact performance. The most outstanding device exhibits a fast response speed with rise/decay time of 201/627&#160;ns, with a peak responsivity/detectivity of 163 mA W&#8722;1/4.52 &#215; 1010 Jones at 325&#160;nm and the enhanced cycling stability. This work suggests the possibility of a new passivation technique for high performance 2D perovskite optoelectronics.

Herein, an ultrafast photoexcitation-induced passivation technique is proposed to synergistically reduce the dimensionality at the surface and induce oxygen doping in the bulk, via tuning the photoexcitation intensity. At the optimal photoexcitation level, the excited electrons and holes generate stretching force on the Pb&#9472;I bonds at the interlayered [PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in low dimensional perovskite formation, and the absorptive oxygen is combined with I vacancies at the same time. These two induced processes synergistically boost the carrier transport and interface contact performance. The most outstanding device exhibits a fast response speed with rise/decay time of 201/627&#160;ns, with a peak responsivity/detectivity of 163 mA W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;/4.52 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at 325&#160;nm and the enhanced cycling stability. This work suggests the possibility of a new passivation technique for high performance 2D perovskite optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultralight Composite Current Collector Enabling High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density and High&#8208;Rate Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries with high energy and power densities, high safety, and excellent flexibility are achieved by using an ultralight composite current collector, which opens a new avenue to pursue high&#8208;performance and high&#8208;safety energy storage.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium (Li) metal batteries are promising alternatives to current Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their advantages such as high energy density, low cost, and convenient production. However, the copper (Cu) current collector accounts for more than 25 wt% of the total weight of the anode&#8208;free battery without capacity contribution, which severely reduces the energy and power densities. Here, a new family of ultralight composite current collectors with a low areal density of 0.78&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, representing significant weight reduction of 49%&#8208;91% compared with the Cu&#8208;based current collectors for high&#8208;energy Li batteries, is presented. Rational molecular engineering of the polyacylsemicarbazide substrate enables enhanced interfacial interaction with the sputtered Cu layer, which results in excellent interfacial stability, flexibility, and safety for the obtained anode&#8208;free batteries. The battery&#8208;level energy density has been significantly improved by 36%&#8211;61%, and a maximum rate capability reaches 5 C (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) attributed to the homogeneous Li+ flux and smooth Li deposition on the nanostructured Cu layer. The results not only open a new avenue to improve the energy and power densities of anode&#8208;free batteries via composite current collector innovation but, in a broader context, provide a new paradigm to pursue high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;safety, and flexible batteries.

         <title>Tunable Phonon Polariton Hybridization in a Van der Waals Hetero&#8208;Bicrystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals heterostructures provide unique opportunities for controlling light at the nanoscale. Here, hetero&#8208;bicrystals composed of molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are studied. These bicrystals feature phonon polaritons, the hybrid quasiparticles resulting from the coupling of photons and lattice vibrations, which show a dispersion tailorable via avoided polariton mode crossings.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons, the hybrid quasiparticles resulting from the coupling of photons and lattice vibrations, have gained significant attention in the field of layered van der Waals heterostructures. Particular interest has been paid to hetero&#8208;bicrystals composed of molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which feature polariton dispersion tailorable via avoided polariton mode crossings. In this work, the polariton eigenmodes in MoO3&#8208;hBN hetero&#8208;bicrystals self&#8208;assembled on ultrasmooth gold are systematically studied using synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy. It is experimentally demonstrated that the spectral gap in bicrystal dispersion and corresponding regimes of negative refraction can be tuned by material layer thickness, and these results are quantitatively matched with a simple analytic model. Polaritonic cavity modes and polariton propagation along &#8220;forbidden&#8221; directions are also investigated in microscale bicrystals, which arise from the finite in&#8208;plane dimension of the synthesized MoO3 micro&#8208;ribbons. The findings shed light on the unique dispersion properties of polaritons in van der Waals heterostructures and pave the way for applications leveraging deeply sub&#8208;wavelength mid&#8208;infrared light&#8208;matter interactions.

         <title>Switching Hydrophobic Interface with Ionic Valves for Reversible Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric field&#8208;triggered ionic valve strategy is proposed to construct an adaptive hydrophobic interface, which can accommodate the varying demands for interfacial H2O during zinc (Zn) plating/stripping, thereby achieving highly reversible Zn batteries.








Abstract
Developing hydrophobic interface has proven effective in addressing dendrite growth and side reactions during zinc (Zn) plating in aqueous Zn batteries. However, this solution inadvertently impedes the solvation of Zn2+ with H2O and subsequent ionic transport during Zn stripping, leading to insufficient reversibility. Herein, an adaptive hydrophobic interface that can be switched &#8220;on&#8221; and &#8220;off&#8221; by ionic valves to accommodate the varying demands for interfacial H2O during both the Zn plating and stripping processes, is proposed. This concept is validated using octyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (C8TAB) as the ionic valve, which can initiatively establish and remove a hydrophobic interface in response to distinct electric&#8208;field directions during Zn plating and stripping, respectively. Consequently, the Zn anode exhibits an extended cycling life of over 2500 h with a high Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.8%. The full cells also show impressive capacity retention of over 85% after 1&#160;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. These findings provide a new insight into interface design for aqueous metal batteries.

         <title>Isomerization Engineering of Solid Additives Enables Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells via Manipulating Molecular Stacking and Aggregation of Active Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomerization engineering is applied to design and synthesize solid additives. Benefiting from optimized molecular stacking and aggregation by isomeric solid additives, M1&#8208;treated binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule and polymer organic solar cells (OSCs) yield champion efficiencies of 17.57% and 19.70%, respectively, among the highest power conversion efficiencies of OSCs.









Abstract
Morphology control is crucial in achieving high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) and remains a major challenge in the field of OSC. Solid additive is an effective strategy to fine&#8208;tune morphology, however, the mechanism underlying isomeric solid additives on blend morphology and OSC performance is still vague and urgently requires further investigation. Herein, two solid additives based on pyridazine or pyrimidine as core units, M1 and M2, are designed and synthesized to explore working mechanism of the isomeric solid additives in OSCs. The smaller steric hindrance and larger dipole moment facilitate better &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and aggregation in M1&#8208;based active layer. The M1&#8208;treated all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule OSCs (ASM OSCs) obtain an impressive efficiency of 17.57%, ranking among the highest values for binary ASM OSCs, with 16.70% for M2&#8208;treated counterparts. Moreover, it is imperative to investigate whether the isomerization engineering of solid additives works in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymer OSCs. M1&#8208;treated D18&#8208;Cl:PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based devices achieve an exceptional efficiency of 19.70% (certified as 19.34%), among the highest values for OSCs. The work provides deep insights into the design of solid additives and clarifies the potential working mechanism for optimizing the morphology and device performance through isomerization engineering of solid additives.

         <title>20.2% Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics Employing a &#960;&#8208;Extension Quinoxaline&#8208;Based Acceptor with Ordered Arrangement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#960;&#8208;extended quinoxaline&#8208;based acceptor, SMA, is designed and synthesized successfully. SMA possesses highly ordered face&#8208;on orientation and strong aggregation propensity. After addition of 10% SMA into the host materials of PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9, the ternary devices realize a champion efficiency of 20.22% with optimized morphology, suppressed charge recombination and reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination.








Abstract
Organic solar cells, as a cutting&#8208;edge sustainable renewable energy technology, possess a myriad of potential applications, while the bottleneck problem of less than 20% efficiency limits the further development. Simultaneously achieving an ordered molecular arrangement, appropriate crystalline domain size, and reduced nonradiative recombination poses a significant challenge and is pivotal for overcoming efficiency limitations. This study employs a dual strategy involving the development of a novel acceptor and ternary blending to address this challenge. A novel non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, SMA, characterized by a highly ordered arrangement and high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level, is synthesized. By incorporating SMA as a guest acceptor in the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 system, it is observed that SMA staggered the liquid&#8208;solid transition of donor and acceptor, facilitating acceptor crystallization and ordering while maintaining a suitable domain size. Furthermore, SMA optimized the vertical morphology and reduced bimolecular recombination. As a result, the ternary device achieved a champion efficiency of 20.22%, accompanied by increased voltage, short&#8208;circuit current density, and fill factor. Notably, a stabilized efficiency of 18.42% is attained for flexible devices. This study underscores the significant potential of a synergistic approach integrating acceptor material innovation and ternary blending techniques for optimizing bulk heterojunction morphology and photovoltaic performance.

On&#8208;Surface Synthesis
Carbon geminal&#8208;polyhalides are functional groups in which a carbon atom is functionalized by two or more halogen atoms. In article number 2402467, Nazario Mart&#237;n, David &#201;cija, and co&#8208;workers review their versatile capabilities for generating &#960;&#8208;conjugated products on surfaces under distinct stimuli. The frontispiece illustrates the formation of different reaction products by depositing the very same molecular precursor on a substrate held at room temperature and subsequently annealed giving rise to molecular wires, or, alternatively, sublimated on a hot substrate affording unique non&#8208;benzenoid compounds.

Zinc&#8208;Based Flow Batteries
In article number 2406366, Qing Wang and co&#8208;workers propose a general strategy using oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to compensate the coulombic efficiency loss caused by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of zinc&#8208;based flow batteries. The OER process can be implemented either directly on the electrode through electrochemical reaction or in an external catalytic reactor column via a redox&#8208;mediated process. Such a process effectively mitigates the gradual accumulation of unresponsive redox species by consuming the extra OH&#8722; during continuous cycling process and enhances cycling stability.

Nonequivalent Atomic Vibrations
In article number 2402925, Eric R. Hoglund, Sokrates T. Pantelides, Patrick E. Hopkins, Jordan A. Hachtel, and co&#8208;workers describe how the choices made in the experimental setup make a difference in what atomic vibrations are probed at the material heterostructure's interfaces. They illustrate this along the theme of &#8220;roads not taken&#8221; by an atomic scale resolution image splitting into two paths, with the two interfaces diverging into a light and dark path.

3D Printing of Composite Radiation Shielding
Exposure to radiation disrupts the operation of electronic systems. In article number 2403822, Bradley Duncan and co&#8208;workers describe an additive manufacturing approach to augment commercial electronics with radiation resiliency. The direct ink writing&#8208;based process conformally deposits multimaterial composite shielding onto only the vulnerable components of electronic assemblies providing a significant size, weight, power, and cost advantage over traditional shielding methods.

Cocoon&#8208;Like Nano&#8208;Meshed Network of Dislocation
Strong&#8208;yet&#8208;ductile alloys require effective microstructural mechanisms for regulating dislocation evolution, to constantly impart strengthening and strain&#8208;hardening while suppressing damage during deformation. All these have been achieved simultaneously in Yunbo Zhong, Evan Ma, and co&#8208;workers' work, by invoking a novel cocoon&#8208;like nano&#8208;meshed structure, an unusual arrangement of accumulated dislocations anchored by dense pre&#8208;existing nanoprecipitates into nanometer&#8208;scale thin&#8208;walled cells, thereby creating state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art eutectic alloys. More details can be found in article number 2405459.

         <title>Challenges and Advancements in the Electrochemical Utilization of Ammonia Using Solid Oxide Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review is expected to provide an up&#8208;to&#8208;date and fair overview of how catalysts and electrodes affect electrochemical activity and durability, offering critical insights for improving performance and mechanistic understanding, as well as laying the scientific groundwork for the discovery and design of electrodes for NH3&#8208;SOFCs or other relevant fields.








Abstract
Solid oxide fuel cells utilized with NH3 (NH3&#8722;SOFCs) have great potential to be environmentally friendly devices with high efficiency and energy density. The advancement of this technology is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of chemical or electrochemical processes occurring on anodes/catalysts. Extensive efforts have been devoted to developing efficient and durable anode/catalysts in recent decades. Although modifications to the structure, composition, and morphology of anodes or catalysts are effective, the mechanistic understandings of performance improvements or degradations remain incompletely understood. This review informatively commences by summarizing existing reports on the progress of NH3&#8722;SOFCs. It subsequently outlines the influence of factors on the performance of NH3&#8722;SOFCs. The degradation mechanisms of the cells/systems are also reviewed. Lastly, the persistent challenges in designing highly efficient electrodes/catalysts for low&#8208;temperature NH3&#8722;SOFCs, and future perspectives derived from SOFCs are discussed. Notably, durability, thermal cycling stability, and power density are identified as crucial indicators for enhancing low&#8208;temperature (550&#160;&#176;C or below) NH3&#8722;SOFCs. This review aims to offer an updated overview of how catalysts/electrodes affect electrochemical activity and durability, offering critical insights for improving performance and mechanistic understanding, as well as establishing the scientific foundation for the design of electrodes for NH3&#8722;SOFCs.

Abstract
The incorporation of functionalized nanofillers into polymers via photopolymerization approach has gained significant attention in recent years due to the unique properties of the resulting composite materials. Surface modification of nanofillers plays a crucial role in their compatibility and polymerization behavior within the polymer matrix during photopolymerization. This review focuses on the recent developments in surface modification of various nanofillers, enabling their integration into polymer systems through photopolymerization. The review discusses the key aspects of surface modification of nanofillers, including the selection of suitable surface modifiers, such as photoinitiators and polymerizable groups, as well as the optimization of modification conditions to achieve desired surface properties. The influence of surface modification on the interfacial interactions between nanofillers and the polymer matrix is also explored, as it directly impacts the final properties of the nanocomposites. Furthermore, the review highlights the applications of nanocomposites prepared by photopolymerization, such as sensors, gas separation membranes, purification systems, optical devices, and biomedical materials. By providing a comprehensive overview of the surface modification strategies and their impact on the photopolymerization process and the resulting nanocomposite properties, this review aims to inspire new research directions and innovative ideas in the development of high&#8208;performance polymer nanocomposites for diverse applications.

         <dc:description>
Injectable pre&#8208;formed scaffolds are revolutionizing regenerative medicine, offering targeted, minimally invasive therapeutic delivery. This review discusses their fabrication, biomaterial advancements, and functionalization strategies, highlighting significant successes in treating age&#8208;related conditions and broadening biomedical applications. Emerging trends and potential impacts in tissue engineering are explored.








Abstract
The growing aging population, with its associated chronic diseases, underscores the urgency for effective tissue regeneration strategies. Biomaterials play a pivotal role in the realm of tissue reconstruction and regeneration, with a distinct shift toward minimally invasive (MI) treatments. This transition, fueled by engineered biomaterials, steers away from invasive surgical procedures to embrace approaches offering reduced trauma, accelerated recovery, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. In the realm of MI tissue repair and cargo delivery, various techniques are explored. While in situ polymerization is prominent, it is not without its challenges. This narrative review explores diverse biomaterials, fabrication methods, and biofunctionalization for injectable pre&#8208;formed scaffolds, focusing on their unique advantages. The injectable pre&#8208;formed scaffolds, exhibiting compressibility, controlled injection, and maintained mechanical integrity, emerge as promising alternative solutions to in situ polymerization challenges. The conclusion of this review emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary design facilitated by synergizing fields of materials science, advanced 3D biomanufacturing, mechanobiological studies, and innovative approaches for effective MI tissue regeneration.

         <title>Small Additives Make Big Differences: A Review on Advanced Additives for High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries are believed to renovate energy storage devices; however, solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSE) still confront numerous critical issues that must be solved. Incorporating additives in the SSE is a facile, straightforward, and feasible method to resolve the difficulties. This review introduces various additive materials for SSE and comprehensively discusses its working principles.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries, represent a significant advancement in energy storage technology, offering higher energy densities and enhanced safety over traditional Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) face critical challenges such as lower ionic conductivity, poor stability at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, and dendrite formation, potentially leading to short circuits and battery failure. The introduction of additives into SSEs has emerged as a transformative approach to address these challenges. A small amount of additives, encompassing a range from inorganic and organic materials to nanostructures, effectively improve ionic conductivity, drawing it nearer to that of their liquid counterparts, and strengthen mechanical properties to prevent cracking of SSEs and maintain stable interfaces. Importantly, they also play a critical role in inhibiting the growth of dendritic Li, thereby enhancing the safety and extending the lifespan of the batteries. In this review, the wide variety of additives that have been investigated, is comprehensively explored, emphasizing how they can be effectively incorporated into SSEs. By dissecting the operational mechanisms of these additives, the review hopes to provide valuable insights that can help researchers in developing more effective SSEs, leading to the creation of more efficient and reliable solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports on the application of gem&#8208;polyhalides as functional groups to guide on&#8208;surface synthesis through distinct growth protocols, illustrating the formation of carbon nanomaterials with varying dimensionality ranging from discrete molecules to extended polymers.








Abstract
The design of innovative carbon&#8208;based nanostructures stands at the forefront of both chemistry and materials science. In this context, &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds are of great interest due to their impact in a variety of fields, including optoelectronics, spintronics, energy storage, sensing and catalysis. Despite extensive research efforts, substantial knowledge gaps persist in the synthesis and characterization of new &#960;&#8208;conjugated compounds with potential implications for science and technology. On&#8208;surface synthesis has emerged as a powerful discipline to overcome limitations associated with conventional solution chemistry methods, offering advanced tools to characterize the resulting nanomaterials. This review specifically highlights recent achievements in the utilization of molecular precursors incorporating carbon geminal (gem)&#8208;polyhalides as functional groups to guide the formation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated 0D species, as well as 1D, quasi&#8208;1D &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers, and 2D nanoarchitectures. By delving into reaction pathways, novel structural designs, and the electronic, magnetic, and topological features of the resulting products, the review provides fundamental insights for a new generation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated materials.

         <title>Spin Gapless Quantum Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic representation of conventional (spin&#8208;FET and 3D spin&#8208;valve based on bulk transport) and a topological spintronic logic device (2D spin&#8208;valve) where topological switching of edge state conductance in a topological Rashba type spin gapless quantum material is implemented via bulk&#8208;boundary&#160;correspondence.








Abstract
Quantum materials, with nontrivial quantum phenomena and mechanisms, promise efficient quantum technologies with enhanced functionalities. Quantum technology is held back because a gap between fundamental science and its implementation is not fully understood yet. In order to capitalize the quantum advantage, a new perspective is required to figure&#160;out and close this gap. In this review, spin gapless quantum materials, featured by fully spin&#8208;polarized bands and the electron/hole transport, are discussed from the perspective of fundamental understanding and device applications. Spin gapless quantum materials can be simulated by minimal two&#8208;band models and could help to understand band structure engineering in various topological quantum materials discovered so far. It is explicitly highlighted that various types of spin gapless band dispersion are fundamental ingredients to understand quantum anomalous Hall effect. Based on conventional transport in the bulk and topological transport on the boundaries, various spintronic device aspects of spin gapless quantum materials as well as their advantages in different models for topological field effect transistors are&#160;reviewed.

         <title>Nanozybiotics: Advancing Antimicrobial Strategies Through Biomimetic Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozybiotics have emerged as a new generation of antimicrobial candidates based on nanozymes that mimic the catalytic killing mode of the innate immune defense system against infectious pathogens. This review provides a comprehensive overview of their development and application, including classification, antimicrobial mechanisms, recent advancements in antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal treatments, potential translational applications, critical challenges, and future prospects.








Abstract
Infectious diseases caused by bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens present significant global health challenges. The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance exacerbates this issue, leading to a scenario where effective antibiotics are increasingly scarce. Traditional antibiotic development strategies are proving inadequate against the swift evolution of microbial resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel antimicrobial strategies with mechanisms distinct from those of existing antibiotics. Nanozybiotics, which are nanozyme&#8208;based antimicrobials, mimic the catalytic action of lysosomal enzymes in innate immune cells to kill infectious pathogens. This review reinforces the concept of nanozymes and provides a comprehensive summary of recent research advancements on potential antimicrobial candidates. Initially, nanozybiotics are categorized based on their activities, mimicking either oxidoreductase&#8208;like or hydrolase&#8208;like functions, thereby highlighting their superior mechanisms in combating antimicrobial resistance. The review then discusses the progress of nanozybiotics in treating bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, confirming their potential as novel antimicrobial candidates. The translational potential of nanozybiotic&#8208;based products, including hydrogels, nanorobots, sprays, bandages, masks, and protective clothing, is also considered.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infectious diseases caused by bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens present significant global health challenges. The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance exacerbates this issue, leading to a scenario where effective antibiotics are increasingly scarce. Traditional antibiotic development strategies are proving inadequate against the swift evolution of microbial resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel antimicrobial strategies with mechanisms distinct from those of existing antibiotics. Nanozybiotics, which are nanozyme-based antimicrobials, mimic the catalytic action of lysosomal enzymes in innate immune cells to kill infectious pathogens. This review reinforces the concept of nanozymes and provides a comprehensive summary of recent research advancements on potential antimicrobial candidates. Initially, nanozybiotics are categorized based on their activities, mimicking either oxidoreductase-like or hydrolase-like functions, thereby highlighting their superior mechanisms in combating antimicrobial resistance. The review then discusses the progress of nanozybiotics in treating bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, confirming their potential as novel antimicrobial candidates. The translational potential of nanozybiotic-based products, including hydrogels, nanorobots, sprays, bandages, masks, and protective clothing, is also considered. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of nanozybiotic-related products are explored, emphasizing the design and antimicrobial capabilities of nanozybiotics for future applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Specifically, innovations in plastics synthesis techniques, optimization of polymer processing methodologies, and breakthroughs in recycling technologies are crucial to advancing sustainable plastics use and lessening its environmental footprint.








Abstract
Plastics, renowned for their outstanding properties and extensive applications, assume an indispensable and irreplaceable role in modern society. However, the ubiquitous consumption of plastic items has led to a growing accumulation of plastic waste. Unreasonable practices in the production, utilization, and recycling of plastics have led to substantial energy resource depletion and environmental pollution. Herein, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements in the lifecycle management of plastics are timely reviewed. Unlike typical reviews focused on plastic recycling, this work presents an in&#8208;depth analysis of the entire lifecycle of plastics, covering the whole process from synthesis, processing, to ultimate disposal. The primary emphasis lies on selecting judicious strategies and methodologies at each lifecycle stage to mitigate the adverse environmental impact of waste plastics. Specifically, the article delineates the rationale, methods, and advancements realized in various lifecycle stages through both physical and chemical recycling pathways. The focal point is the attainment of optimal recycling rates for waste plastics, thereby alleviating the ecological burden of plastic pollution. By scrutinizing the entire lifecycle of plastics, the article aims to furnish comprehensive solutions for reducing plastic pollution and fostering sustainability across all facets of plastic production, utilization, and disposal.

The molecular design concepts, relationships between the molecular structure and optoelectronic properties, intrinsic mechanisms of device performance are discussed in detail. At the end, the advantages of this kind of materials are summed up, the molecular develop direction is prospected, the challenges faced by QxNFAs are given, and constructive solutions to the existing problems are advised. Overall, this review presents unique viewpoints to conquer the challenge of QxNFAs and thus boost OSCs development further toward commercial applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the advancements in covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for precious metal (PM) recovery, organizing design and synthesis strategies for three types of COF&#8208;based materials. It highlights the selectivity of COFs due to strong interactions with PMs. Importantly, it notes limited research on platinum group elements and real wastewater applications, suggesting future research directions.








Abstract
The recovery of precious metals (PMs) from secondary resources has garnered significant attention due to environmental and economic considerations. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising adsorbents for this purpose, owing to their tunable pore size, facile functionalization, exceptional chemical stability, and large specific surface area. This review provides an overview of the latest research progress in utilizing COFs to recover PMs. Firstly, the design and synthesis strategies of chemically stable COF&#8208;based materials, including pristine COFs, functionalized COFs, and COF&#8208;based composites, are delineated. Furthermore, the application of COFs in the recovery of gold, silver, and platinum group elements is delved into, emphasizing their high adsorption capacity and selectivity as well as recycling ability. Additionally, various interaction mechanisms between COFs and PM ions are analyzed. Finally, the current challenges faced by COFs in the field of PM recovery are discussed, and potential directions for future development are proposed, including enhancing the recyclability and reusability of COF materials and realizing the high recovery of PMs from actual acidic wastewater. With the targeted development of COF&#8208;based materials, the recovery of PMs can be realized more economically and efficiently in the future.

         <title>The Rise of Xene Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rise of Xene hybrids as an emerging new class of materials systems is reviewed for their experimental realization strategies, salient properties, and frontier applications in electronics, optoelectronics, energy storage, catalysis, and water filtration.








Abstract
Xenes, mono&#8208;elemental atomic sheets, exhibit Dirac/Dirac&#8208;like quantum behavior. When interfaced with other 2D materials such as boron nitride, transition metal dichalcogenides, and metal carbides/nitrides/carbonitrides, it enables them with unique physicochemical properties, including structural stability, desirable bandgap, efficient charge carrier injection, flexibility/breaking stress, thermal conductivity, chemical reactivity, catalytic efficiency, molecular adsorption, and wettability. For example, BN acts as an anti&#8208;oxidative shield, MoS2 injects electrons upon laser excitation, and MXene provides mechanical flexibility. Beyond precise compositional modulations, stacking sequences, and inter&#8208;layer coupling controlled by parameters, achieving scalability and reproducibility in hybridization is crucial for implementing these quantum materials in consumer applications. However, realizing the full potential of these hybrid materials faces challenges such as air gaps, uneven interfaces, and the formation of defects and functional groups. Advanced synthesis techniques, a deep understanding of quantum behaviors, precise control over interfacial interactions, and awareness of cross&#8208;correlations among these factors are essential. Xene&#8208;based hybrids show immense promise for groundbreaking applications in quantum computing, flexible electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. In this timely perspective, recent discoveries of novel Xenes and their hybrids are highlighted, emphasizing correlations among synthetic parameters, structure, properties, and applications. It is anticipated that these insights will revolutionize diverse industries and technologies.

         <title>Designer Anions for Better Rechargeable Lithium Batteries and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamental considerations on the structural design and modifications of robust salt anions for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries are comprehensively discussed, and recent achievements in this domain are briefly outlined. Particular attention are paid to the different cell chemistries imposed by electroactive materials and electrolyte systems, and their impact on the selection of suitable salt anions.








Abstract
Non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes, generally consisting of metal salts and solvating media, are indispensable elements for building rechargeable batteries. As the major sources of ionic charges, the intrinsic characters of salt anions are of particular importance in determining the fundamental properties of bulk electrolyte, as well as the features of the resulting electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases/interfaces. To cope with the increasing demand for better rechargeable batteries requested by emerging application domains, the structural design and modifications of salt anions are highly desired. Here, salt anions for lithium and other monovalent (e.g., sodium and potassium) and multivalent (e.g., magnesium, calcium, zinc, and aluminum) rechargeable batteries are outlined. Fundamental considerations on the design of salt anions are provided, particularly involving specific requirements imposed by different cell chemistries. Historical evolution and possible synthetic methodologies for metal salts with representative salt anions are reviewed. Recent advances in tailoring the anionic structures for rechargeable batteries are scrutinized, and due attention is paid to the paradigm shift from liquid to solid electrolytes, from intercalation to conversion/alloying&#8208;type electrodes, from lithium to other kinds of rechargeable batteries. The remaining challenges and key research directions in the development of robust salt anions are also discussed.

Surface topography and material chemistry are significant extracellular stimuli that influence neural cell behavior to facilitate tissue integration and augment therapeutic outcomes. This review characterizes topographical modifications and surface chemistry on neural cell signaling to improve interface outcomes. The impact of extracellular mediated cues on intracellular signaling cascades provides perspective on the manipulation of neural microenvironments to drive therapeutic success.








Abstract
Nanomaterial advancements have driven progress in central and peripheral nervous system applications such as tissue regeneration and brain&#8211;machine interfacing. Ideally, neural interfaces with native tissue shall seamlessly integrate, a process that is often mediated by the interfacial material properties. Surface topography and material chemistry are significant extracellular stimuli that can influence neural cell behavior to facilitate tissue integration and augment therapeutic outcomes. This review characterizes topographical modifications, including micropillars, microchannels, surface roughness, and porosity, implemented on regenerative scaffolding and brain&#8211;machine interfaces. Their impact on neural cell response is summarized through neurogenic outcome and mechanistic analysis. The effects of surface chemistry on neural cell signaling with common interfacing compounds like carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials, conductive polymers, and biologically inspired matrices are also reviewed. Finally, the impact of these extracellular mediated neural cues on intracellular signaling cascades is discussed to provide perspective on the manipulation of neuron and neuroglia cell microenvironments to drive therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Colloidal Quantum Dots: Progress and Opportunities in Solar Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 33, August 15, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) show potential in solar technologies due to their photostability and adjustable properties. However, high&#8208;performing QDs often contain hazardous metals like Cd and Pb. Heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free QDs are reviewed for solar applications, analyzing synthetic strategies to optimize optical properties and improve charge dynamics. Structure&#8208;property relationships and future challenges like machine learning&#8208;based design and sustainable synthesis are also discussed.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) hold great promise as building blocks in solar technologies owing to their remarkable photostability and adjustable properties through the rationale involving size, atomic composition of core and shell, shapes, and surface states. However, most high&#8208;performing QDs in solar conversion contain hazardous metal elements, including Cd and Pb, posing significant environmental risks. Here, a comprehensive review of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free colloidal QDs for solar technologies, including photovoltaic (PV) devices, solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical fuel conversion, and luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), is presented. Emerging synthetic strategies to optimize the optical properties by tuning the energy band structure and manipulating charge dynamics within the QDs and at the QDs/charge acceptors interfaces, are analyzed. A comparative analysis of different synthetic methods is provided, structure&#8208;property relationships in these materials are discussed, and they are correlated with the performance of solar devices. This work is concluded with an outlook on challenges and opportunities for future work, including machine learning&#8208;based design, sustainable synthesis, and new surface/interface engineering.

         <title>Robust Field&#8208;Free Switching Using Large Unconventional Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque in an All&#8208;Van der Waals Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study uses the low&#8208;symmetry Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 and above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 to achieve the field&#8208;free magnetization switching. The unconventional SOT effective field efficiency is determined to be 0.37, and the switching&#8208;polarity&#8208;change magnetic field is as high as 252&#160;mT, indicating a robust field&#8208;free switching against the external magnetic field.








Abstract
The emerging all&#8208;van der Waals (vdW) magnetic heterostructure provides a new platform to control the magnetization by the electric field beyond the traditional spintronics devices. One promising strategy is using unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) exerted by the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current to enable deterministic magnetization switching and enhance the switching efficiency. However, in all&#8208;vdW heterostructures, large unconventional SOT remains elusive and the robustness of the field&#8208;free switching against external magnetic field has not been examined, which hinders further applications. Here, the study demonstrates the field&#8208;free switching in an all&#8208;vdW heterostructure combining a type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4 and above&#8208;room&#8208;temperature ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. The fully field&#8208;free switching can be achieved at 2.56 &#215; 1010 A&#160;m&#8722;2 at 300&#160;K and a large SOT effective field efficiency of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current generated by TaIrTe4 is determined to be 0.37. Moreover, it is found that the switching polarity cannot be changed until the external in&#8208;plane magnetic field reaches 252&#160;mT, indicating a robust switching against the magnetic field. The numerical simulation suggests the large unconventional SOT reduces the switching current density and enhances the robustness of the switching. The work shows that all&#8208;vdW heterostructures are promising candidates for future highly efficient and stable SOT&#8208;based devices.

The unconventional SOT effective field efficiency is determined to be 0.37, and the switching-polarity-change magnetic field is as high as 252&#160;mT, indicating a robust field-free switching against the external magnetic field.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via In Situ Passivation Directed Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ passivation (ISP) method is introduced to adjust the crystal growth kinetics and obtain the (111)&#8208;orientated perovskite films with the passivated boundaries and interfaces, leading to high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 26.7% (certified as 26.09% at a 5.97 square millimeters active area).








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as one of the influential photovoltaic technologies with promising cost&#8208;effectiveness. Though with mild processabilities to massive production, inverted PSCs have long suffered from inferior photovoltaic performances due to intractable defective states at boundaries and interfaces. Herein, an in situ passivation (ISP) method is presented to effectively adjust crystal growth kinetics and obtain the well&#8208;orientated perovskite films with the passivated boundaries and interfaces, successfully enabled the new access of high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs. The study unravels that the strong yet anisotropic ISP additive adsorption between different facets and the accompanied additive engineering yield the high&#8208;quality (111)&#8208;orientated perovskite crystallites with superior photovoltaic properties. The ISP&#8208;derived inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 26.7% (certified as 26.09% at a 5.97 mm2 active area) and 24.5% (certified as 23.53% at a 1.28 cm2 active area), along with decent operational stabilities.

         <title>Human Circulatory/Respiratory&#8208;Inspired Comprehensive Air Purification System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circulatory/respiratory&#8208;inspired air purification system (CAPS) is reported, a novel bioinspired approach that integrates microbubble&#8208;based gas exchange and circulating liquid (water) mechanisms akin to alveoli, capillary beds, and the bloodstream. By incorporating waste removal, CAPS ensures continuous particulate matter removal and gas exchange between indoor and outdoor spaces, with the potential for networked integration across various internal and external environments.








Abstract
The circulatory and respiratory systems in humans are marvels of biological engineering that exhibit competence in maintaining homeostasis. These systems not only shield the organism from external contaminants but also orchestrate the vital gases via the bloodstream to sustain cellular respiration and metabolic processes across diverse tissues. It is noticed that spaces inhabited encounter challenges akin to those of the human body: protecting the indoor air from external pollutants while removing anthropogenic byproducts like carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matters (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) tooutside. A biomimetic approach, composed of a microbubble&#8208;based gas exchanger and circulating liquid inspired by alveoli, capillary beds, and bloodstream of the human circulatory/respiratory system, offer an innovative solution for comprehensive air purification of hermetic spaces. Circulatory/respiratory&#8208;inspired air purification system (CAPS) ensure both continuous removal of PM and exchange of gas species between indoor and outdoor environments to maintain homeostasis. The effectiveness of this system is also supported by animal behavior experiments with and without CAPS, showing an effect of reducing CO2 concentration by 30% and increasing mice locomotor activity by 53%. CAPS is expected to evolve into robust and comprehensive air purification schemes through the networked integration of plural internal and external environments.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Enzymatic Microgels for Precise Hydrogel Sculpturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;enzymatic microgels, consisting of collagenase and magnetic nanoparticles, are used to sculpt internal channels within biomimetic hydrogels through the synergy of enzymatic degradation and remote magnetic guidance. This approach enhances cell viability by optimizing nutrient and oxygen distribution beyond conventional methods. Wireless control enables intricate hydrogel topographies, advancing vascularization and targeted drug delivery, marking a notable achievement in biofabrication.








Abstract
The inclusion of hollow channels in tissue&#8208;engineered hydrogels is crucial for mimicking the natural physiological conditions and facilitating the delivery of nutrients and oxygen to cells. Although bio&#8208;fabrication techniques provide diverse strategies to create these channels, many require sophisticated equipment and time&#8208;consuming protocols. Herein, collagenase, a degrading agent for methacrylated gelatin hydrogels, and magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are combined and processed into enzymatically active spherical structures using a straightforward oil bath emulsion methodology. The generated microgels are then used to microfabricate channels within biomimetic hydrogels via a novel sculpturing approach that relied on the precise coupling of protein&#8208;enzyme pairs (for controlled local degradation) and magnetic actuation (for directional control). Results show that the sculpting velocity can be tailored by adjusting the magnetic field intensity or concentration of MNPs within the microgels. Additionally, varying the magnetic field position or microgel size generated diverse trajectories and channels of different widths. This innovative technology improves the viability of encapsulated cells through enhanced medium transport, outperforming non&#8208;sculpted hydrogels and offering new perspectives for hydrogel vascularization and drug/biomolecule administration. Ultimately, this novel concept can help design fully controlled channels in hydrogels or soft materials, even those with complex tortuosity, in a single wireless top&#8208;down biocompatible step.

         <title>Approaching 20% Efficiency in Ortho&#8208;Xylene Processed Organic Solar Cells by a Benzo[a]phenazine&#8208;Core&#8208;Based 3D Network Acceptor with Large Electronic Coupling and Long Exciton Diffusion Length</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of benzo[a]phenazine (BP)&#8208;based acceptors achieved through an isomerization chlorination strategy is presented, namely NA1, NA2, NA3, and NA4. The ortho&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) processed binary organic solar cells (OSCs) based on PM6:NA3 yields an efficiency of 18.94%. Importantly, the o&#8208;XY processed ternary OSC device based on PM6:D18&#8208;Cl:NA3 exhibits an efficiency as high as 19.75%.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance organic solar cells often rely on halogen&#8208;containing solvents, which restrict the photovoltaic industry. Therefore, it is imperative to develop efficient organic photovoltaic materials compatible with halogen&#8208;free solvents. Herein, a series of benzo[a]phenazine (BP)&#8208;core&#8208;based small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) achieved through an isomerization chlorination strategy is presented, comprising unchlorinated NA1, 10&#8208;chlorine substituted NA2, 8&#8208;chlorine substituted NA3, and 7&#8208;chlorine substituted NA4. Theoretical simulations highlight NA3's superior orbit overlap length and tight molecular packing, attributed to interactions between the end group and BP unit. Furthermore, NA3 demonstrates dense 3D network structures and a record electronic coupling of 104.5 meV. These characteristics empower the ortho&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY) processed PM6:NA3 device with superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.94%, surpassing PM6:NA1 (15.34%), PM6:NA2 (7.18%), and PM6:NA4 (16.02%). Notably, the significantly lower PCE in the PM6:NA2 device is attributed to excessive self&#8208;aggregation characteristics of NA2 in o&#8208;XY. Importantly, the incorporation of D18&#8208;Cl into the PM6:NA3 binary blend enhances crystallographic ordering and increases the exciton diffusion length of the donor phase, resulting in a ternary device efficiency of 19.75% (certified as 19.39%). These findings underscore the significance of incorporating new electron&#8208;deficient units in the design of efficient SMAs tailored for environmentally benign solvent processing of OSCs.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Carbon Co&#8208;Catalysts for Up&#8208;Conversion Photo&#8208;Induced Catalytic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed metal&#8208;free GQD/P&#8208;C3N4 hybrid carbon catalyst with GQD to upconvert the NIR light to visible light to activate P&#8208;C3N4 for photocatalytic oxidation of glucose into H2O2, followed by GQD&#8208;induced ROS generation from H2O2 for efficient catalytic cancer therapy through the cascade reactions, as demonstrated by experimental results and therapeutic outcomes.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive metal&#8208;free carbon co&#8208;catalysts that convert glucose into H2O2 to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) are developed from phosphorus&#8208;doped carbon nitride (P&#8208;C3N4) and graphene quantum dots (GQD) composites, for enhanced photocatalytic cancer therapy by light exposure in the targeted tumor microenvironment. Upon irradiation, the NIR light is converted by GQD with up&#8208;conversion function into visible light to excite P&#8208;C3N4 for photocatalytic conversion of glucose into H2O2, which subsequently decomposes into ROS. ROS thus generated exhibits an excellent anticancer efficacy for efficient cancer therapy with minimal side effects, as evidenced by both in vitro and in vivo studies. This study demonstrates, for the first time, a cancer therapeutic of GQD/P&#8208;C3N4 composite that utilizes a two&#8208;step cascade effect using initially NIR&#8208;triggered GQD nanoparticles to activate P&#8208;C3N4 to photocatalytically generate ROS for effective and targeted cancer therapy.

         <title>Bioinspired Capillary Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric re&#8208;entrant structures with long overhangs and connected forward/lateral microchannels are 3D printed to promote the unidirectional capillary rise, whose capillary heights have approached the theoretical limits. Capillary transistors based on asymmetric and symmetric re&#8208;entrant structures are proposed to provide a new strategy for microfluidic devices in 3D space.








Abstract
Inspired by the unidirectional liquid spreading on Nepenthes peristome, Araucaria leaf, butterfly wings, etc., various microfluidic devices have been developed for water collection, irrigation, physical/chemical reaction, and oil&#8211;water separation. Despite extensive progress, most natural and artificial structures fail to enhance the Laplace pressure difference or capillary force, thus suffering from a low unidirectional capillary height (&lt;30&#160;mm). In this work, asymmetric re&#8208;entrant structures with long overhangs and connected forward/lateral microchannels are fabricated by 3D printing, resulting in a significantly increased unidirectional capillary height of 102.3&#160;mm for water, which approximately corresponds to the theoretical limit. The overhangs can partially overlap the forward microchannels of the front structures without direct contact, thus enhancing the Laplace pressure difference and capillary force simultaneously. Based on asymmetric and symmetric re&#8208;entrant structures, capillary transistors are proposed and realized to programmably adjust the capillary direction, height, and width, which are envisioned to function as switches/valves and amplifiers/attenuators for highly efficient liquid patterning, desalination, and biochemical microreaction in 3D space.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Magnetic Polarization by Charge Localization in a Chiral Supramolecular Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect is a fascinating phenomenon that correlates the molecular structure with electron spin&#8208;polarization. In this work, chiral crystals of imide&#8208;substituted coronene bisimide ((S)&#8208;CBI&#8208;GCH) are studied to show that current flows dynamically, controlled by the voltage sweep rate. This observation is crucial for redox group molecules, and sheds light on the possible origin of spin&#8208;polarization in chiral molecules. 








Abstract
The chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect is a fascinating phenomenon that correlates the molecular structure with electron spin&#8208;polarization (SP). Experimental procedures to quantify the spin&#8208;filtering magnitude have extensively used magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent conductive AFM. In this work chiral crystals of imide&#8208;substituted coronene bisimide ((S)&#8208;CBI&#8208;GCH) are studied to explain the dynamics of the current&#8211;voltage I &#8722; V spectra and the origin of superimposed peaks are investigated. A dynamic voltage&#8208;sweep rate&#8208;dependent phenomenon can give rise to complex I &#8722; V curves. The redox group, capable of localization of charge, acts as a localized state that interferes with the continuum of the &#960; &#8211; &#960; stacking, giving rise to Fano resonances. A novel mechanism for dynamic transport is introduced, which provides insight into the origin of spin&#8208;polarized charge in crystallized CBI&#8208;GCH molecules after absorption on a metallic substrate, guided by transient charge polarization. Crucially, interference between charge localization and delocalization during transport may be important properties in understanding the magnetochiral phenomena observed by electrostatic force microscopy. Finally, it is observed that charge trapping sensitively modifies the injection barrier from direct tunneling to Fowler&#8211;Nordheim tunneling transport supporting nonlinearity in CISS for this class of molecules.

         <title>A Strategy of Killing Two Birds With One Stone for Blocking Drug Resistance Spread With Engineered Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living Bdello is engineered with polydopamine and a multinuclear cerium (IV) complex to construct Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello for blocking the spread of drug resistance. Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello exhibits synergistic functions in penetrating biofilms, killing bacteria and degrading drug&#8208;resistant genes, rendering it a versatile therapeutic for treating P. aeruginosa (KanR) infected scald/burn&#160;wounds by simultaneously eliminating resistant pathogens and blocking bacterial drug&#8208;resistance dissemination.








Abstract
Drug&#8208;resistant pathogens significantly threaten human health and life. Simply killing drug&#8208;resistant pathogens cannot effectively eliminate their threat since the drug&#8208;resistant genes (DRGs) released from dead drug&#8208;resistant pathogens are difficult to eliminate and can further spread via horizontal gene transfer, leading to the spread of drug resistance. The development of antibacterial materials with sterilization and DRGs cleavage activities is highly crucial. Herein, a living system, Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello, is fabricated with bacterial killing and DRGs cleavage activities for blocking bacterial drug resistance dissemination by engineered Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus (Bdello). Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello is obtained by engineering Bdello with dopamine and a multinuclear cerium (IV) complex. Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello can penetrate and eliminate kanamycin&#8208;resistant P. aeruginosa (KanR) biofilms via the synergistic effect of predatory Bdello and photothermal polydopamine under near&#8208;infrared light. Additionally, the DNase&#8208;mimicking ability of Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello endows it with genome and plasmid DNA cleavage ability. An in vivo study reveals that Ce&#8208;PEA@Bdello can eliminate P. aeruginosa (KanR) and cleave DRGs in scald/burn infected wounds to block the spread of drug resistance and accelerate wound healing. This bioactive system constructed from natural living materials offers a promising means for blocking the spread of drug resistance.

         <title>Materials, Structure, and Interface of Stretchable Interconnects for Wearable Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable interconnects are one of the fundamental components in achieving robust wearable devices, but their importance is often overlooked. This review highlights their importance and provides insightful information on various materials, configurations, and manufacturing approaches being studied for interconnects. Their practical potentials for wearable bioelectronics are also discussed for future research opportunities.








Abstract
Since wearable technologies for telemedicine have emerged to tackle global health concerns, the demand for well&#8208;attested wearable healthcare devices with high user comfort also arises. Skin&#8208;wearables for health monitoring require mechanical flexibility and stretchability for not only high compatibility with the skin's dynamic nature but also a robust collection of fine health signals from within. Stretchable electrical interconnects, which determine the device's overall integrity, are one of the fundamental units being understated in wearable bioelectronics.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Regulated Motion and Energy Conversion of Polyelectrolyte Membrane Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the shape&#8208;dependent motion and adaptive rotation of self&#8208;powered Marangoni actuators on the water surface. Among them, circular actuators show regular motion and passage properties that enable energy harvesting and wireless sensing for obstruction location in closed pipes.








Abstract
Smart actuators hold great potential in soft robotics and sensors, but their movement at the fluid interface is less understood and controlled, hindering their performances and applications in complicated fluids. Here an ethanol&#8208;containing polyelectrolyte actuator is prepared that demonstrates excellent actuating performance via the Marangoni effect. These actuators exhibit enduring (17&#160;min), repeatable (50 cycles), and autonomous motion on the water surface. More importantly, the motion of actuators are dependent on their shapes. Polygonal actuators with more edges exhibit round motion attached to walls of containers, while the actuators with few edges move randomly. On the basis of this property, the circular actuators can pass through pipe bends with S&#8208;shaped complex geometry. These unique advantages lend the actuators to successful applications in wireless sensing (standard 0&#8211;5&#160;V level signals) for locating obstructions inside invisible pipes and continuous energy harvesting (7700&#160;nC per cycle) for micro mechanical energy.

         <title>Aggregate&#8208;Dominated Dilute Electrolytes with Low&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Resistant Ion&#8208;Conducting Channels for Highly Reversible Na Plating/Stripping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran&#8208;based electrolyte is designed with weak dissociation of Na+&#8208;PF6&#8722; ion pairs and a highly efficient network for ultrafast Na+ hopping, which breaks through the LT ion&#8208;conducting limitation of conventional electrolytes. The methyl&#8208;regulated electronic structure induces gradient decomposition toward an inorganic&#8208;organic bilayer SEI with high Na+ mobility. A record&#8208;high CE beyond 99.9% is achieved even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Developing rechargeable batteries with high power delivery at low temperatures (LT) below 0&#160;&#176;C is significant for cold&#8208;climate applications. Initial anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) promise high LT performances because of the low de&#8208;solvation energy and smaller Stokes radius of Na+, nondiffusion&#8208;limited plating/stripping electrochemistry, and maximized energy density. However, the severe reduction in electrolyte ionic conductivity and formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) hinder their practical applications at LT. In this study, a 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran&#8208;based dilute electrolyte is designed to concurrently achieve an anion&#8208;coordinated solvation structure and impressive ionic conductivity of 3.58&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The dominant aggregate solvates enable the formation of highly efficient and LT&#8208;resistant Na+ hopping channels in the electrolyte. Moreover, the methyl&#8208;regulated electronic structure in 2&#8208;methyltetrahydrofuran induces gradient decomposition toward an inorganic&#8208;organic bilayer SEI with high Na+ mobility, composition homogeneity, and mechanical robustness. As such, a record&#8208;high Coulombic efficiency beyond 99.9% is achieved even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. The as&#8208;constructed AFSMBs sustain 300 cycles with 80% capacity maintained, and a 0.5&#8208;Ah level pouch cell delivers 85% capacity over 180 cycles at &#8722;25&#160;&#176;C. This study affords new insights into electrolyte formulation for fast ionic conduction and superior Na reversibility at ultralow temperatures.

         <title>Fourier Surfaces Reaching Full&#8208;Color Diffraction Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rising demand for transformative optical devices derives the importance of optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs) minimizing optical loss of diffraction. To address the current&#160;challenges of OFSs regarding scalability and full&#8208;color diffraction, an integrative manufacturing strategy is presented for the first realization of scalable and fully transparent OFSs reaching the fundamental diffraction limits at the full&#8208;visible regimes.








Abstract
Optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs), characterized by sinusoidally profiled diffractive optical elements, can outperform traditional binary&#8208;type counterparts by minimizing optical noise through selectively driving diffraction at desired frequencies. While scanning probe lithography (SPL), gray&#8208;scale electron beam lithography (EBL), and holographic inscriptions are effective for fabricating OFSs, achieving full&#8208;color diffractions at fundamental efficiency limits is challenging. Here, an integrated manufacturing process is presented, validated theoretically and experimentally, for fully transparent OFSs reaching the fundamental limit of diffraction efficiency. Leveraging holographic inscriptions and soft nanoimprinting, this approach effectively addresses challenges in conventional OFS manufacturing, enabling scalable production of noise&#8208;free and maximally efficient OFSs with record&#8208;high throughput (1010&#8211;1012 &#181;m2&#160;h&#8722;1), surpassing SPL and EBL by 1010 times. Toward this end, a wafer&#8208;scale OFSs array is demonstrated consisting of full&#8208;color diffractive gratings, color graphics, and microlenses by the one&#8208;step nanoimprinting, which is readily compatible with rapid prototyping of OFSs even on curved panels, demanding for transformative optical devices such as augmented and virtual reality displays.

         <title>Ternary Logic Circuit and Neural Network Integration via Small Molecule&#8208;Based Antiambipolar Vertical Electrochemical Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiambipolar behavior is observed in a small molecule&#8208;based vertical organic electrochemical transistor with a current density &gt; 30&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, and low driving voltage (0.6&#160;V). Consequently, a vertically stacked ternary inverter (VSTI) is fabricated with three distinguishable logic states, along with the demonstration for image recognition tasks based on ternary neural networks with such VSTI array.








Abstract
Circuits based on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have great potential in the fields of biosensors and artificial neural computation due to their biocompatibility and neural similarity. However, the integration of OECT&#8208;based circuits lags far behind other emerging electronics. Here, ternary inverters based on antiambipolar vertical OECTs (vOECTs) and their integration with the establishment of neural networks are demonstrated. Specifically, by adopting a small molecule (t&#8208;gdiPDI) as the channel of vOECT, high antiambipolar performance, with current density&#160;of 33.9&#160;&#177;&#160;2.1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 under drain voltage of 0.1&#160;V, peak voltage &#8776;0&#160;V, low driving voltage &lt; &#177; 0.6&#160;V, and current on/off ratio&#160;&gt;&#160;106, are realized. Consequently, vertically stacked ternary circuits based solely on OECTs are constructed for the first time, showing three distinct logical states and high integration density. By further developing inverter array as the internal fundamental units of ternary weight network hardware circuits for ternary processing and computation, it demonstrates excellent data classification and recognition capabilities. This work demonstrates the possibility of constructing multi&#8208;valued logic circuits by OECTs and promotes a new strategy for high&#8208;density integration and multivalued computing systems based on organic circuits.

         <dc:description>
A novel percolative metal microweb&#8208;based flexible electrode using electrohydrodynamic processes is developed. This lightweight and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electrode enhances the electrochemical and mechanical performances of the resultant lithium&#8208;ion batteries with improved energy density, lithium&#8208;ion diffusion, and electron transfer. As a result, the lithium&#8208;ion battery developed here exhibits exceptional energy and power densities of 110 and 1048&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, respectively.








Abstract
Flexible and high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) encounter challenges due to the inherent trade&#8208;offs in conventional electrode designs, particularly concerning mechanical flexibility and high energy density. Here, a novel percolative metal microweb&#8208;based electrode, fabricated via electrohydrodynamic processes, yielding a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) network structure with exceptional electrical properties and mechanical durability is introduced. This lightweight electrode design addresses the need for improved energy density by reducing the weight of the current collector, which typically accounts for more than 10% of the battery's weight. The 3D architecture of the electrode enhances the contact area with the electrolyte, thereby minimizing polarization voltage and improving lithium&#8208;ion diffusion. Furthermore, the low coating thickness&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio promotes electron transfer and mitigates capacity fade at high current densities. The microweb&#8208;based full cell exhibits energy and power densities of 110 and 1,048&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 10 C, respectively, which are the highest reported values among LIBs utilizing similar materials. The design of the electrode proposed in this study is expected to significantly contribute to the development of wearable and flexible electronics.

         <title>Facilitating Oriented Dense Deposition: Utilizing Crystal Plane End&#8208;Capping Reagent to Construct Dendrite&#8208;Free and Highly Corrosion&#8208;Resistant (100) Crystal Plane Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oriented dense Zn anodes with high corrosion resistance are fabricated by introducing a Zn (100) crystal plane end&#8208;capping reagent into the electrolyte, which mitigates the dendrite growth and corrosive behavior of Zn anodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries and improves their durability. This study deepens the understanding of diverse Zn crystal planes and broadens the choice of crystal plane modulation.








Abstract
Dendrite growth and corrosion issues have significantly hindered the usability of Zn anodes, which further restricts the development of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). In this study, a zinc&#8208;philic and hydrophobic Zn (100) crystal plane end&#8208;capping reagent (ECR) is introduced into the electrolyte to address these challenges in AZIBs. Specifically, under the mediation of 100&#8208;ECR, the electroplated Zn configures oriented dense deposition of (100) crystal plane texture, which slows down the formation of dendrites. Furthermore, owing to the high corrosion resistance of the (100) crystal plane and the hydrophobic protective interface formed by the adsorbed ECR on the electrode surface, the Zn anode demonstrates enhanced reversibility and higher Coulombic efficiency in the modified electrolyte. Consequently, superior electrochemical performance is achieved through this novel crystal plane control strategy and interface protection technology. The Zn//VO2 cells based on the modified electrolyte maintained a high&#8208;capacity retention of &#8776;80.6% after 1350 cycles, corresponding to a low&#8208;capacity loss rate of only 0.014% per cycle. This study underscores the importance of deposition uniformity and corrosion resistance of crystal planes over their type. And through crystal plane engineering, a high&#8208;quality (100) crystal plane is constructed, thereby expanding the range of options for viable Zn anodes.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Au&#8208;Pt Bimetallic Aerogels for Catalyzing the Glucose Cascade Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work leverages the structural versatility of aerogels to regulate the Au&#8211;Pt bimetallic system into three representative structures, including segregated, alloy, and core&#8211;shell configurations and investigates the structure&#8211;activity relationship toward glucose cascade catalysis. Among them, the Au&#8211;Pt segregated structure exhibits the optimal enzyme&#8208;mimic catalytic performances, which is ascribed to the synergistic effect and abundant grain boundaries.








Abstract
Bimetallic nanostructures are promising candidates for the development of enzyme&#8208;mimics, yet the deciphering of the structural impact on their catalytic properties poses significant challenges. By leveraging the structural versatility of nanocrystal aerogels, this study reports a precise control of Au&#8211;Pt bimetallic structures in three representative structural configurations, including segregated, alloy, and core&#8211;shell structures. Benefiting from a synergistic effect, these bimetallic aerogels demonstrate improved peroxidase&#8208; and glucose oxidase&#8208;like catalytic performances compared to their monometallic counterparts, unleashing tremendous potential in catalyzing the glucose cascade reaction. Notably, the segregated Au&#8211;Pt aerogel shows optimal catalytic activity, which is 2.80 and 3.35 times higher than that of the alloy and core&#8211;shell variants, respectively. This enhanced activity is attributed to the high&#8208;density Au&#8211;Pt interface boundaries within the segregated structure, which foster greater substrate affinity and superior catalytic efficiency. This work not only sheds light on the structure&#8211;property relationship of bimetallic catalysts but also broadens the application scope of aerogels in biosensing and biological detections.

         <title>Bubble&#8208;Guidance Breaking Gas Shield for Highly Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to break the gas shield by an anisotropic groove&#8208;micro/nanostructured porous electrode (GMPE) is demonstrated for achieving high&#8208;efficiency electrolytic water splitting. Gradient groove&#8208;micro/nanostructures on the GMPE serve as high&#8208;speed bubble form, transport, and detach channels, and exhibit superior bubble&#8208;guidance capabilities, which cooperatively improve mass transfer.








Abstract
Overall water splitting is a promising technology for sustainable hydrogen production, but the primary challenge is removing bubbles from the electrode surface quickly to increase hydrogen production. Inspired by the directional fluid transport properties of natural biological surfaces like Nepenthes peristome and Morpho butterfly's wings, here a strategy is demonstrated to achieve highly efficient overall water splitting by a bubble&#8208;guidance electrode, that is, an anisotropic groove&#8208;micro/nanostructured porous electrode (GMPE). Gradient groove micro/nanostructures on the GMPE serve as high&#8208;speed bubble transmission channels and exhibit superior bubble&#8208;guidance capabilities. The synergistic effect of the asymmetric Laplace pressure generated between microscale porous structure and groove patterns and the buoyancy along the groove patterns pushes the produced bubbles directionally to spread, transport, and detach from the electrode surface in time. Moreover, the low adhesive nanosheet arrays are beneficial to reduce bubble size and increase bubble release frequency, which cooperatively improve mass transfer with the microscale structure. Notably, GMPE outperforms planar&#8208;micro/nanostructured porous electrode (PMPE) in hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions, with GMPE||GMPE showing better water splitting performance than commercially available RuO2||20 wt.% Pt/C. This work improves electrodes for better mass transfer and kinetics in electrochemical reactions at solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;gas interfaces, offering insight for designing and preparing gas&#8208;involved photoelectrochemical electrodes.

This work improves electrodes for better mass transfer and kinetics in electrochemical reactions at solid-liquid-gas interfaces, offering insight for designing and preparing gas-involved photoelectrochemical electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Antimony Selenide Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review reports recent advances in Sb2Se3 photodetectors (PDs), focusing on fundamental characteristics, nanostructure tuning, applications in heart rate monitoring, and monolithic integrated matrix imaging. The challenges, including the broadening of the detection range, the reduction of dark current, and the potential applications of flexible devices are highlighted, which provide a valuable reference for Sb2Se3 PDs and expand application areas.








Abstract
Photodetectors (PDs) rapidly capture optical signals and convert them into electrical signals, making them indispensable in a variety of applications including imaging, optical communication, remote sensing, and biological detection. Recently, antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) has achieved remarkable progress due to its earth&#8208;abundant, low toxicity, low price, suitable bandgap width, high absorption coefficient, and unique structural characteristics. Sb2Se3 has been extensively studied in solar cells, but there's a lack of timely updates in the field of PDs. A literature review based on Sb2Se3 PDs is urgently warranted. This review aims to provide a concise understanding of the latest progress in Sb2Se3 PDs, with a focus on the basic characteristics and the performance optimization for Sb2Se3 photoconductive&#8208;type and photodiode&#8208;type detectors, including nanostructure regulation, process optimization, and stability improvement of flexible devices. Furthermore, the application progresses of Sb2Se3 PDs in heart rate monitoring, and monolithic&#8208;integrated matrix images are introduced. Finally, this review presents various strategies with potential and feasibility to address challenges for the rapid development and commercial application of Sb2Se3 PDs.

         <title>Exciton Dissociation and Recombination Afford Narrowband Organic Afterglow Through Efficient FRET</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is proposed for achieving narrow&#8208;band, long&#8208;lived, and full&#8208;color organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) by isolating multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent fluorophores in a steroid&#8208;type host capable of exciton dissociation and recombination. Through efficient FRET, the LPL exhibits a small full&#8208;width at a half&#8208;maximum of 33&#160;nm, persistent time exceeding 10&#160;s, and tunable color among 414&#8211;600&#160;nm.








Abstract
Organic afterglow with long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) after photoexcitation is highly attractive, but the realization of narrowband afterglow with small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) is a huge challenge since it is intrinsically contradictory to the triplet&#8208; and solid&#8208;state emission nature of organic afterglow. Here, narrow&#8208;band, long&#8208;lived, and full&#8208;color organic LPL is realized by isolating multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR&#8208;TADF) fluorophores in a glassy steroid&#8208;type host through a facile melt&#8208;cooling treatment. Such prepared host becomes capable of exciton dissociation and recombination (EDR) upon photoirradiation for both long&#8208;lived fluorescence and phosphorescence; and, the efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the host to various MR&#8208;TADF emitters leads to high&#8208;performance LPL, exhibiting small FWHM of 33&#160;nm, long persistent time over 10&#160;s, and facile color&#8208;tuning in a wide range from deep&#8208;blue to orange (414&#8211;600&#160;nm). Moreover, with the extraordinary narrowband LPL and easy processability of the material, centimeter&#8208;scale flexible optical waveguide fibers and integrated FWHM/color/lifetime&#8208;resolved multilevel encryption/decryption devices have been designed and fabricated. This novel EDR and singlet/triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet FRET strategy to achieve excellent LPL performances illustrates a promising way for constructing flexible organic afterglow with easy preparation methods, shedding valuable scientific insights into the design of narrow&#8208;band emission in organic afterglow.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Enabled Tomographic Imaging of Chemical Short&#8208;Range Atomic Ordering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning enhanced approach is introduced to break the inherent resolution limitation of atom probe tomography, and precisely image multiple arrangements of atoms associated with (non&#8208;) statistical chemical short&#8208;range order, in three dimensions, in CoCrNi medium&#8208;entropy alloys with no prior knowledge of the presence of chemical short&#8208;range order or which type.








Abstract
In solids, chemical short&#8208;range order (CSRO) refers to the self&#8208;organization of atoms of certain species occupying specific crystal sites. CSRO is increasingly being envisaged as a lever to tailor the mechanical and functional properties of materials. Yet quantitative relationships between properties and the morphology, number density, and atomic configurations of CSRO domains remain elusive. Herein, it is showcased how machine learning&#8208;enhanced atom probe tomography (APT) can mine the near&#8208;atomically resolved APT data and jointly exploit the technique's high elemental sensitivity to provide a 3D quantitative analysis of CSRO in a CoCrNi medium&#8208;entropy alloy. Multiple CSRO configurations are revealed, with their formation supported by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations. Quantitative analysis of these CSROs allows establishing relationships between processing parameters and physical properties. The unambiguous characterization of CSRO will help refine strategies for designing advanced materials by manipulating atomic&#8208;scale architectures.

         <title>Asymmetric Wettability Hydrogel Surfaces for Enduring Electromyographic Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversal wettability inducing strategy based on hydrophobic interaction is proposed to integrally synthesize Janus hydrogel without affecting the mechanical elasticity and electrical properties. This interfacial engineering successfully realizes the optional inducing on the hydrogel surfaces. A combination of asymmetric wettability surfaces, excellent elasticity, and compatible conductivity endows the hydrogel electrode patch with a high&#8208;fidelity EMG signal in a perspiration environment.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrode interfaces have shown tremendous promise in the acquisition of surface electromyography (EMG) signals. However, the perspiration or moisture environments will trigger the deadhesion between hydrogel electrodes and human skin. Despite the hydrophobic/hydrophilic surfaces can perform the anti&#8208;moisture or adhesion respectively, it remains a challenge to integrally form a Janus hydrogel with homogeneous mechanical elasticity and electronic performance. Herein, a surface induction strategy is proposed to approach the hydrophobic/hydrophilic hydrogel surfaces. The hydrophobic interaction between surfactants and molds regulates the distribution of hydrophobic/hydrophilic monomers on the surface. The hydrophobic molds induce a hydrophilic hydrogel surface, while the hydrophilic molds induce a hydrophobic surface. It presents a new phenomenon of reversal wettability inducing and optional hydrogel surfaces. The integral Janus hydrogel can be easily obtained by the hydrophilic molds. Balance of adhesion, elasticity, and conductivity endows the hydrogel electrode patch with durable conformal adhesion and high&#8208;fidelity EMG signals even in the sweaty epidermis due to the asymmetric wettability surfaces. This hydrogel performs the quantitative description of muscle strength and accurate fatigue assessment. It offers a reliable candidate for future practical applications in continuous digital healthcare and intelligent human&#8211;machine interaction, even the Metaverse.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Weak Polarization&#8208;Strain Coupling Effect Boosts Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the service electric field for MLCCs in pulsed circuit systems increases, electrostrain&#8208;induced vibration has become a critical failure mechanism. By employing a polarization&#8208;strain weak coupling strategy, the electrostriction coefficient of the relaxor dielectrics is significantly suppressed. This mitigation reduces the breakdown risk, enhancing the stability, performance, and lifespan of MLCCs.








Abstract
In pulse power systems, multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) encounter significant challenges due to the heightened loading electric field (E), which can lead to fatigue damage and ultrasonic concussion caused by electrostrictive strain. To address these issues, an innovative strategy focused on achieving an ultra&#8208;weak polarization&#8208;strain coupling effect is proposed, which effectively reduces strain in MLCCs. Remarkably, an ultra&#8208;low electrostrictive coefficient (Q33) of 0.012 m4 C&#8722;2 is achieved in the composition 0.55(Bi0.5Na0.5)TiO3&#8208;0.45Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3, resulting in a significantly reduced strain of 0.118% at 330&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. At the atomic scale, the local structural heterogeneity leads to an expanded and loose lattice structure, providing ample space for large ionic displacement polarization instead of lattice stretching when subjected to the applied E. This unique behavior not only promotes energy storage performance (ESP) but also accounts for the observed ultra&#8208;low Q33 and strain. Consequently, the MLCC device exhibits an impressive energy storage density of 14.6 J cm&#8722;3 and an ultrahigh efficiency of 93% at 720&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the superior ESP of the MLCC demonstrates excellent fatigue resistance and temperature stability, making it a promising solution for practical applications. Overall, this pivotal strategy offers a cost&#8208;effective solution for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MLCCs with ultra&#8208;low strain&#8208;vibration in pulse power systems.

     alt="Ultra-Weak Polarization-Strain Coupling Effect Boosts Capacitive Energy Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the service electric field for MLCCs in pulsed circuit systems increases, electrostrain-induced vibration has become a critical failure mechanism. By employing a polarization-strain weak coupling strategy, the electrostriction coefficient of the relaxor dielectrics is significantly suppressed. This mitigation reduces the breakdown risk, enhancing the stability, performance, and lifespan of MLCCs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pulse power systems, multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) encounter significant challenges due to the heightened loading electric field (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;), which can lead to fatigue damage and ultrasonic concussion caused by electrostrictive strain. To address these issues, an innovative strategy focused on achieving an ultra-weak polarization-strain coupling effect is proposed, which effectively reduces strain in MLCCs. Remarkably, an ultra-low electrostrictive coefficient (&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;) of 0.012 m&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in the composition 0.55(Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;)TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-0.45Pb(Mg&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in a significantly reduced strain of 0.118% at 330&#160;kV cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. At the atomic scale, the local structural heterogeneity leads to an expanded and loose lattice structure, providing ample space for large ionic displacement polarization instead of lattice stretching when subjected to the applied &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. This unique behavior not only promotes energy storage performance (ESP) but also accounts for the observed ultra-low &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; and strain. Consequently, the MLCC device exhibits an impressive energy storage density of 14.6 J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and an ultrahigh efficiency of 93% at 720&#160;kV cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, the superior ESP of the MLCC demonstrates excellent fatigue resistance and temperature stability, making it a promising solution for practical applications. Overall, this pivotal strategy offers a cost-effective solution for state-of-the-art MLCCs with ultra-low strain-vibration in pulse power systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Dipole Modulation Toward High Fill Factor in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local dipole modulation in organic solar cells can significantly enhance device performance. By adjusting molecular asymmetries, two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, AA&#8208;1 and AA&#8208;2 are synthesized. The unidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;2 led to an improved balanced charge transport, resulting in an exceptional fill factor of 0.830 and a power conversion efficiency of 18.3%.








Abstract
Dipole moment arrangement in organic semiconductors plays a critical role in affecting the intermolecular packing, determining optoelectronic properties and device performance. Here, to get the desired fill factor (FF) values in organic solar cells (OSCs), the local dipole of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) is modulated by changing the molecular asymmetries. Two NFAs, AA&#8208;1 and AA&#8208;2 are designed and synthesized, which have different substitutions of alkyl and alkoxyl groups. The unidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;2 creates distinct local dipoles, while the bidirectional asymmetry in AA&#8208;1 mitigates dipole variation. Despite the minimal impact on monomolecular properties, the local dipole moment significantly influences terminal group packing modes in the film state. This, in turn, enhances the relative dielectric constant, prolongs exciton lifetime, and reduces sub&#8208;bandgap defect states. Consequently, PBDB&#8208;TF:AA&#8208;2&#8208;based OSCs achieve an exceptional FF of 0.830 and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.3%, with a ternary device reaching a PCE of 19.3%. This work highlights the potential of dipole modulation in material design to get ideal FF values for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Compliant Lattice Modulations Enable Anomalous Elasticity in Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga Martensite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike any other crystalline metal, modulated Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga can achieve large reversible strains under mechanical loads comparable to a fingertip grip force. Dedicated laser&#8208;ultrasonic measurements on this material reveal that it has locally nearly zero elastic stiffness with respect to shear loads that modify the lattice modulations. This anomalous compliance makes Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga crystal one of the most elastically anisotropic materials ever reported, and is the key for understanding its peculiar mechanical instability and for searching for new materials with similar functionality.








Abstract
High mobility of twin boundaries in modulated martensites of Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga&#8208;based ferromagnetic shape memory alloys holds a promise for unique magnetomechanical applications. This feature has not been fully understood so far, and in particular, it has yet not been unveiled what makes the lattice mechanics of modulated Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga specifically different from other martensitic alloys. Here, results of dedicated laser&#8208;ultrasonic measurements on hierarchically twinned five&#8208;layer modulated (10M) crystals fill this gap. Using a combination of transient grating spectroscopy and laser&#8208;based resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, it is confirmed that there is a shear elastic instability in the lattice, being significantly stronger than in any other martensitic material and also than what the first&#8208;principles calculations for Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga predict. The experimental results reveal that the instability is directly related to the lattice modulations. A lattice&#8208;scale mechanism of dynamic faulting of the modulation sequence that explains this behavior is proposed; this mechanism can explain the extraordinary mobility of twin boundaries in 10M.

         <title>Photocatalytic Carbon Dots&#8208;Triggered Pyroptosis for Whole Cancer Cell Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;induced pyroptotic cancer cells (PCIP), as a potential candidate for whole cancer cell vaccines (WCCV), can be used for effective tumor immunoprevention. In vivo, assessments reveal that PCIP induced specific immune&#8208;preventive effects through anticancer immune memory, demonstrating effective WCCV. This study provides a facile strategy that utilized photocatalytic CDs to induce pyroptosis of cancer cells for fabricating WCCV.








Abstract
Manufacturing whole cancer cell vaccines (WCCV) with both biosafety and efficacy is crucial for tumor immunotherapy. Pyroptotic cancer cells, due to their highly immunogenic properties, present a promising avenue for the development of WCCV. However, the successful development of WCCV based on pyroptotic cancer cells is yet to be accomplished. Here, a facile strategy that utilized photocatalytic carbon dots (CDs) to induce pyroptosis of cancer cells for fabricating WCCV is reported. Photocatalytic CDs are capable of generating substantial amounts of hydroxyl radicals and can effectively decrease cytoplasmic pH values under white light irradiation. This process efficiently triggers cancer cell pyroptosis through the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mitochondria&#8208;caspase 3&#8208;gasdermin E pathway and the proton motive force&#8208;driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis pathway. Moreover, in vitro, these photocatalytic CDs&#8208;induced pyroptotic cancer cells (PCIP) can hyperactivate macrophage (M0&#8211;M1) with upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II expression. In vivo, PCIP induced specific immune&#8208;preventive effects in melanoma and breast cancer mouse models through anticancer immune memory, demonstrating effective WCCV. This work provides novel insights for inducing cancer cell pyroptosis and bridges the gap in the fabrication of WCCV based on pyroptotic cancer cells.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Biased Bionic Fingertip E&#8208;Skin with Multimodal Tactile Perception and Artificial Intelligence for Augmented Touch Awareness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an intelligent E&#8208;skin featuring a minimalist design and versatile functions. Based on zero&#8208;biased triboelectric&#8208;based and ionic hydrogel&#8208;based artificial neurons, it realizes high&#8208;accuracy perception of surface texture, roughness, hardness, material, and temperature with only a single sensing unit, empowered by multimodal tactile sensing capability and artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Electronic skins (E&#8208;Skins) are crucial for future robotics and wearable devices to interact with and perceive the real world. Prior research faces challenges in achieving comprehensive tactile perception and versatile functionality while keeping system simplicity for lack of multimodal sensing capability in a single sensor. Two kinds of tactile sensors, transient voltage artificial neuron (TVAN) and sustained potential artificial neuron (SPAN), featuring self&#8208;generated zero&#8208;biased signals are developed to realize synergistic sensing of multimodal information (vibration, material, texture, pressure, and temperature) in a single device instead of complex sensor arrays. Simultaneously, machine learning with feature fusion is applied to fully decode their output information and compensate for the inevitable instability of applied force, speed, etc, in real applications. Integrating TVAN and SPAN, the formed E&#8208;Skin achieves holistic touch awareness in only a single unit. It can thoroughly perceive an object through a simple touch without strictly controlled testing conditions, realize the capability to discern surface roughness from 0.8 to 1600&#160;&#181;m, hardness from 6HA to 85HD, and correctly distinguish 16 objects with temperature variance from 0 to 80&#160;&#176;C. The E&#8208;skin also features a simple and scalable fabrication process, which can be integrated into various devices for broad applications.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magneto&#8208;Photoresponse in All&#8208;2D Optoelectronic Devices for In&#8208;Sensor Vision Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In 2D optoelectronic devices with the electrodes of 2D ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 and channel of WSe2, the photoresponse is effectively controlled by magnetic fields at room temperature. This room&#8208;temperature magneto&#8208;photoresponse, achieved by the 2D magneto&#8208;band structure, lays the groundwork for multidimensional responsive optoelectronic devices. It holds promise for the development of robust in&#8208;sensor machine vision systems with gate&#8208;free architectures.








Abstract
Interplay between magnetism and photoelectric properties introduces the effective control of photoresponse in optoelectronic devices via magnetic field, termed as magneto&#8208;photoresponse. It enriches the application scenarios and shows potential to construct in&#8208;sensor vision systems for artificial intelligence with gate&#8208;free architecture. However, achieving a simultaneous existence of room&#8208;temperature magnetism and notable photoelectric properties in semiconductors is a great challenge. Here, the room&#8208;temperature magneto&#8208;photoresponse is accomplished in all&#8208;2D optoelectronic devices, employing 2D ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 as the source and drain, with WSe2 forming the channel. The interplay between room&#8208;temperature magnetism and photoelectric properties is realized by introducing the unique magneto&#8208;band structure effect from 2D interface, resulting in magneto&#8208;tunable charge transfer between Fe3GaTe2 and WSe2. The photocurrent in this 2D optoelectronic device exhibits robust response to both the direction and amplitude of external magnetic fields. Utilizing constructed 2D optoelectronic devices with magneto&#8208;photoresponse, traditional gate&#8208;controlled phototransistors are replaced and a prototype in&#8208;sensor vision system with visual adaptation, significantly improving the recognition accuracy to over four times in low&#8208;contrast environments is established. These findings pave a way for achieving high&#8208;temperature magneto&#8208;photoresponse, thereby guiding the construction of robust in&#8208;sensor vision systems toward high performance and broad applications.

         <title>A Porous Li&#8211;Al Alloy Anode toward High&#8208;Performance Sulfide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>

A porous Li&#8211;Al alloy anode exhibits a record critical current density of 6.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5000&#160;h cycling in symmetric cells, and 1800 cycles (83% retention) and the highest areal capacity of 11.9 mAh cm&#8722;2 in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#8208;based full cells at room temperature.








Abstract
Compared to lithium (Li) anode, the alloy/Li&#8208;alloy anodes show more compatible with sulfide solid electrolytes (SSEs), and are promising candidates for practical SSE&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSLBs). In this work, a porous Li&#8211;Al alloy (LiAl&#8208;p) anode is crafted using a straightforward mechanical pressing method. Various characterizations confirm the porous nature of such anode, as well as rich oxygen species on its surface. To the best knowledge, such LiAl&#8208;p anode demonstrates the best room temperature cell performance in comparison with reported Li and alloy/Li&#8208;alloy anodes in SSE&#8208;based ASSLBs. For example, the LiAl&#8208;p symmetric cells deliver a record critical current density of 6.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an ultralong cycling of 5000&#160;h; the LiAl&#8208;p|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells achieve a high areal capacity of 11.9 mAh cm&#8722;2 and excellent durability of 1800 cycles. Further in situ and ex situ experiments reveal that the porous structure can accommodate volume changes of LiAl&#8208;p and ensure its integrity during cycling; and moreover, a robust Li inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase can be formed originated from the reaction between SSE and surface oxygen species of LiAl&#8208;p. This study offers inspiration for designing high&#8208;performance alloy anodes by focusing on designing special architecture to alleviate volume change and constructing stable interphase.

         <title>Highly Conductive and Stretchable Hydrogel Nanocomposite Using Whiskered Gold Nanosheets for Soft Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High electrical conductivity (&#8776;520&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1) and high stretchability (&#8776;300%) are achieved simultaneously for conductive hydrogel nanocomposite, through a sequential formation method using whiskered gold nanosheets. The maximum conductivity reaches 3304&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. The conductive hydrogel nanocomposite functionalized with tissue adhesive property realizes robust integration with living organs, demonstrating high&#8208;performance bioelectronics in vivo.








Abstract
The low electrical conductivity of conductive hydrogels limits their applications as soft conductors in bioelectronics. This low conductivity originates from the high water content of hydrogels, which impedes facile carrier transport between conductive fillers. This study presents a highly conductive and stretchable hydrogel nanocomposite comprising whiskered gold nanosheets. A dry network of whiskered gold nanosheets is fabricated and then incorporated into the wet hydrogel matrices. The whiskered gold nanosheets preserve their tight interconnection in hydrogels despite the high water content, providing a high&#8208;quality percolation network even under stretched states. Regardless of the type of hydrogel matrix, the gold&#8208;hydrogel nanocomposites exhibit a conductivity of &#8776;520&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a stretchability of &#8776;300% without requiring a dehydration process. The conductivity reaches a maximum of &#8776;3304&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 when the density of the dry gold network is controlled. A gold&#8208;adhesive hydrogel nanocomposite, which can achieve conformal adhesion to moving organ surfaces, is fabricated for bioelectronics demonstrations. The adhesive hydrogel electrode outperforms elastomer&#8208;based electrodes in in vivo epicardial electrogram recording, epicardial pacing, and sciatic nerve stimulation.

         <title>Unraveling the Capacitive Behaviors in Nanoconfined Ionophilic Carbon Pores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compressed micropore&#8208;rich carbon framework is synthesized with tailored monolayer and bilayer confinement pores. With compatible ionophilic interfaces, they accommodate both cations and anions in ionic liquid electrolytes. A voltage&#8208;induced gradient pore&#8208;filling process has been proposed to explain the capacitive storage mechanism.








Abstract
Intensifying the synergy between confined carbon nanopores and ionic liquids (ILs) and a deep comprehension of the ion behavior is required for enhancing the capacitive storage performance. Despite many theoretical insights on the storage mechanism, experimental verification has remained lacking due to the intricate nature of pore texture. Here, a compressed micropore&#8208;rich carbon framework (CMCF) with tailored monolayer and bilayer confinement pores is synthesized, which exhibits a compatible ionophilic interface to accommodate the IL [EMIM][BF4]. By deploying in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, the effect of the pore textures on ions storage behaviors is elucidated. A voltage&#8208;induced ion gradient filling process in these ionophilic pores is proposed, in which ion exchange and co&#8208;ion desorption dominate the charge storage process. Moreover, it is established that the monolayer confinement of ions enhances the capacity, and bilayer confinement facilitates the charging dynamics. This work may guide the design of nanoconfinement carbon for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors and deepen the understanding of the charge storage mechanism in ionophilic pores.

         <title>Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Single Crystalline Biomolecular Nano&#8208;Arrays for Responsive Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating dip&#8208;pen nanolithography with solvent vapor annealing, a novel strategy is reported for synthesizing libraries of nanoscale amino acid (AA) single crystals with control over size, anisotropy, and polymorphism. Importantly, these nanocrystals exhibit second harmonic generation (SHG), piezoelectric, and ferroelectric properties due to their non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures, making them potentially useful for sustainable electronics.








Abstract
Herein, a novel strategy is reported for synthesizing libraries of single crystalline amino acid (AA) nanocrystals with control over size, anisotropy, and polymorphism by leveraging dip&#8208;pen nanolithography (DPN) and recrystallization via solvent vapor annealing. The crystals are prepared by first depositing nanoreactors consisting of a solvent with AAs, followed by water vapor&#8208;induced recrystallization. This leads to isotropic structures that are non&#8208;centrosymmetric with strong piezoelectric (g33 coefficients &gt;1000&#160;mVm&#160;N&#8722;1), ferroelectric, and non&#8208;linear optical properties. However, recrystallizing arrays of isotropic DL&#8208;alanine nanodot features with a binary solvent (water and ethanol) leads to arrays of 1D piezoelectric nanorods with their long axis coincident with the polar axis.

&lt;p&gt;By integrating dip-pen nanolithography with solvent vapor annealing, a novel strategy is reported for synthesizing libraries of nanoscale amino acid (AA) single crystals with control over size, anisotropy, and polymorphism. Importantly, these nanocrystals exhibit second harmonic generation (SHG), piezoelectric, and ferroelectric properties due to their non-centrosymmetric structures, making them potentially useful for sustainable electronics.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a novel strategy is reported for synthesizing libraries of single crystalline amino acid (AA) nanocrystals with control over size, anisotropy, and polymorphism by leveraging dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) and recrystallization via solvent vapor annealing. The crystals are prepared by first depositing nanoreactors consisting of a solvent with AAs, followed by water vapor-induced recrystallization. This leads to isotropic structures that are non-centrosymmetric with strong piezoelectric (g&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; coefficients &amp;gt;1000&#160;mVm&#160;N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), ferroelectric, and non-linear optical properties. However, recrystallizing arrays of isotropic DL-alanine nanodot features with a binary solvent (water and ethanol) leads to arrays of 1D piezoelectric nanorods with their long axis coincident with the polar axis. Moreover, positioning nanoreactors containing AAs (the nanodot features) between micro electrodes leads to capillary formation, making the reactors anisotropic and facilitating piezoelectric nanorod formation between the electrodes. This offers a facile route to device fabrication. These as-fabricated devices respond to ultrasonic stimulation in the form of a piezoelectric response. The technique described herein is significant as it provides a rapid way of investigating non-centrosymmetric nanoscale biocrystals, potentially pivotal for fabricating a new class of stimuli-responsive devices such as sensors, energy harvesters, and stimulators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Half&#8208;metallization Atom&#8208;Fingerprints Achieved at Ultrafast Oxygen&#8208;Evaporated Pyrochlores for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing ultrafast oxygen evaporation technology is proposed in the high&#8208;entropy Bi1Pb0.5Y0.5Ir1.5Sn0.5O7 pyrochlores to realize a controllable half&#8208;metallization atom&#8208;fingerprints at pyrochlore catalysts, in which the coexistence of metallic bonds and covalent bonds can reconfigure the spin electron occupation. This spin renormalization from low&#8208;spin state to high&#8208;spin state facilitates the spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interaction between catalysts and intermediates, leading to spin&#8208;dependent reaction kinetics.








Abstract
The stability and catalytic activity of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are strongly determined by the coordination states and spatial symmetry among metal sites at catalysts. Herein, an ultrafast oxygen evaporation technology to rapidly soften the intrinsic covalent bonds using ultrahigh electrical pulses is suggested, in which prospective charged excited states at this extreme avalanche condition can generate a strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling to rapidly evaporate some coordinated oxygen (O) atoms, finally leading to a controllable half&#8208;metallization feature. Simultaneously, the relative metal (M) site arrays can be orderly locked to delineate some intriguing atom&#8208;fingerprints at pyrochlore catalysts, where the coexistence of metallic bonds (M&#9472;M) and covalent bonds (M&#9472;O) at this symmetry&#8208;breaking configuration can partially restrain crystal field effect to generate a particular high&#8208;spin occupied state. This half&#8208;metallization catalyst can effectively optimize the spin&#8208;related reaction kinetics in acidic OER, giving rise to 10.3 times (at 188&#160;mV overpotential) reactive activity than pristine pyrochlores. This work provides a new understanding of half&#8208;metallization atom&#8208;fingerprints at catalyst surfaces to accelerate acidic water oxidation.

         <title>Composition Modulation&#8208;Mediated Band Alignment Engineering from Type I to Type III in 2D vdW Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The band alignment of 1L&#8208;WSe2/5L&#8208;Bi2Te3&#8208;xSex vdWHs can be continuously modulated from Type I (x = 0) to Type III (x = 3) by increasing Se mole fraction, which is crucial for promoting charge separation and transfer in optoelectronic devices, ultimately determining the behavior of photodetectors and LEDs based on vdWHs.








Abstract
Band alignment engineering is crucial for facilitating charge separation and transfer in optoelectronic devices, which ultimately dictates the behavior of Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWH)&#8208;based photodetectors and light emitting diode (LEDs). However, the impact of the band offset in vdWHs on important figures of merit in optoelectronic devices has not yet been systematically analyzed. Herein, the regulation of band alignment in WSe2/Bi2Te3&#8208;xSex vdWHs (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 3) is demonstrated through the implementation of chemical vapor deposition (CVD). A combination of experimental and theoretical results proved that the synthesized vdWHs can be gradually tuned from Type I (WSe2/Bi2Te3) to Type III (WSe2/Bi2Se3). As the band alignment changes from Type I to Type III, a remarkable responsivity of 58.12 A&#160;W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 2.91&#215;1012 Jones (in Type I) decrease in the vdWHs&#8208;based photodetector, and the ultrafast photoresponse time is 3.2 &#181;s (in Type III). Additionally, Type III vdWH&#8208;based LEDs exhibit the highest luminance and electroluminescence (EL) external quantum efficiencies (EQE) among p&#8208;n diodes based on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) at room temperature, which is attributed to band alignment&#8208;induced distinct interfacial charge injection. This work serves as a valuable reference for the application and expansion of fundamental band alignment principles in the design and fabrication of future optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Self&#8208;Anchored Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Stacking Growth of Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenide Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;anchored van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals stacking growth mechanism is developed to produce transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide nanoplates with desired lateral size and locations. As such, WSe2 and MoSe2 nanoplate arrays are produced for the subsequent fabrication of nanoplate&#8208;based optoelectronics.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (TMDs) nanoplates exhibit unique properties different from their monolayer counterparts. Controllable nucleation and growth are prerequisite and highly desirable for their practical applications. Here, a self&#8208;anchored van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals stacking growth method is developed, by which the substrate pit induced by precursor etching anchors the source material, impedes the lateral spreading of source droplets and facilitates the in situ stacking growth of high&#8208;quality TMD nanoplates with a thickness of tens to hundreds of nanometers at well&#8208;defined locations. As such, an array of TMD nanoplates with controlled lateral dimensions are produced and applied in arrayed photodetectors. This study solves the problem of controllable preparation of TMD nanoplates, holding promise for applications in electronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Disordered High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Engineered by Thermal Dezincification for Improved Catalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This summarizes a novel approach (i.e. thermal diffusion scattering) to the characterization of lattice disordered high entropy alloys produced by thermal dezincification favorable for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. This work provides a new route toward exploring and developing the catalytic activities of materials benefiting from asymmetrically disordered lattices.








Abstract
A disordered crystal structure is an asymmetrical atomic lattice resulting from the missing atoms (vacancies) or the lattice misarrangement in a solid&#8208;state material. It has been widely proven to improve the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. In the present work, due to the special physical properties (the low evaporation temperature of below 900 &#176;C), Zn is utilized as a sacrificial component to create senary PtIrNiCoFeZn high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) with highly disordered lattices. The structure of the lattice&#8208;disordered PtIrNiCoFeZn HEA is characterized by the thermal diffusion scattering (TDS) in transmission electron microscope. Density functional theory calculations reveal that lattice disorder not only accelerates both the Volmer step and Tafel step during the HER process but also optimizes the intensity and distribution of projected density of states near the Fermi energy after the H2O and H adsorption. Anomalously high alkaline HER activity and stability are proven by experimental measurements. This work introduces a novel approach to preparing irregular lattices offering highly efficient HEA and a TDS characterization method to reveal the disordered lattice in materials. It provides a new route toward exploring and developing the catalytic activities of materials with asymmetrically disordered lattices.

         <title>Design Principles of Quinone Redox Systems for Advanced Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Organic Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designing criterion for quinone redox compounds integration into Li6PS5Cl&#8208;based solid&#8208;state organic lithium metal batteries is developed through a combination of DFT calculations and experimental analysis. Following this criterion, 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone and 2,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone are successfully validated and effectively utilized as active electrode materials in solid&#8208;state organic lithium metal batteries, displaying exceptional material utilization and high specific energy density.








Abstract
The emergence of solid&#8208;state battery technology presents a potential solution to the dissolution challenges of high&#8208;capacity small molecule quinone redox systems. Nonetheless, the successful integration of argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5Cl, the most promising solid&#8208;state electrolyte system,&#160;and quinone redox systems remains elusive due to their inherent reactivity. Here, a library of quinone derivatives is selected as model electrode materials to ascertain the critical descriptors governing the (electro)chemical compatibility and subsequently the performances of Li6PS5Cl&#8208;based solid&#8208;state organic lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Compatibility is attained if the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level of the quinone derivative is sufficiently higher than the highest occupied molecular orbital level of Li6PS5Cl. The energy difference is demonstrated to be critical in ensuring chemical compatibility during composite electrode preparation and enable high&#8208;efficiency operation of solid&#8208;state organic LMBs. Considering these findings, a general principle is proposed for the selection of quinone derivatives to be integrated with Li6PS5Cl, and two solid&#8208;state organic LMBs, based on 2,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone, are successfully developed and tested for the first time. Validating critical factors for the design of organic battery electrode materials is expected to pave the way for advancing the development of high&#8208;efficiency and long cycle life solid&#8208;state organic batteries based on sulfides electrolytes.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Enhanced UV&#8208;C LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene directly grown on a UV&#8208;C LED by plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition provides a disruptive approach for tackling the light&#8208;extraction challenge in UV&#8208;C LEDs. Graphene is used as a current spreading layer for top&#8208;emitting UV&#8208;C LEDs in standard geometry, while it acts as a contact interlayer in UV&#8208;C LEDs in flip&#8208;chip geometry enabling a turn&#8208;on voltage &lt;5&#160;V.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes in the UV&#8208;C spectral range (UV&#8208;C LEDs) can potentially replace bulky and toxic mercury lamps in a wide range of applications including sterilization and water purification. Several obstacles still limit the efficiencies of UV&#8208;C LEDs. Devices in flip&#8208;chip geometry suffer from a huge difference in the work functions between the p&#8208;AlGaN and high&#8208;reflective Al mirrors, whereas the absence of UV&#8208;C transparent current spreading layers limits the development of UV&#8208;C LEDs in standard geometry. Here it is demonstrated that transfer&#8208;free graphene implemented directly onto the p&#8208;AlGaN top layer by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition approach enables highly efficient 275&#160;nm UV&#8208;C LEDs in both, flip&#8208;chip and standard geometry. In flip&#8208;chip geometry, the graphene acts as a contact interlayer between the Al&#8208;mirror and the p&#8208;AlGaN enabling an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.5% and a wall&#8208;plug efficiency (WPE) of 5.5% at 8&#160;V. Graphene combined with a &#8776;1&#160;nm NiOx support layer allows a turn&#8208;on voltage &lt;5&#160;V. In standard geometry graphene acts as a current spreading layer on a length scale up to 1&#160;mm. These top&#8208;emitting devices exhibit a EQE of 2.1% at 8.7&#160;V and a WPE of 1.1%.

         <title>Adaptive Processing Enabled by Sodium Alginate Based Complementary Memristor for Neuromorphic Sensory System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functions of desensitization and sensitivity changing with background intensity are biorealistically demonstated in Ag nanowire (NW)&#8208;embedded sodium alginate (SA) based complementary memristor. The scotopic and photopic adaptation functions are reproduced for image enhancement under dark and bright backgrounds. The neuromorphic sensory system (NSS) with multisensory integration function is demonstrated, in which the accuracy of pattern recognition can be obviously enhanced.








Abstract
Adaptive processing allows sensory systems to autonomically adjust their sensitivity with exposure to a constant sensory stimulus and thus organisms to adapt to environmental variations. Bioinspired&#160;electronics with adaptive functions are highly desirable for the development of neuromorphic sensory systems (NSSs). Herein, the functions of desensitization and sensitivity changing with background intensity (i.e., Weber's law), as two fundamental cues of sensory adaptation, are biorealistically demonstrated in an Ag nanowire (NW)&#8208;embedded sodium alginate (SA) based complementary memristor. In particular, Weber's law is experimentally emulated in a single complementary memristor. Furthermore, three types of adaptive NSS unit are constructed to realize a multiple perceptual capability that processes the stimuli of illuminance, temperature, and pressure signals. Taking neuromorphic vision as an example, scotopic and photopic adaptation functions are well reproduced for image enhancement against dark and bright backgrounds. Importantly, an NSS system with multisensory integration function is demonstrated by combining light and pressure spikes, where the accuracy of pattern recognition is obviously enhanced relative to that of an individual sense. This work offers a new strategy for developing neuromorphic electronics with adaptive functions and paves the way toward developing a highly efficient NSS.

Yang et&#160;al. introduce a reversible cohesive interface made of thermoplastic elastomer that allows for strong attachment and easy detachment of distributed soft robot modules without direct human handling. The reversible joint boasts a modulus similar to materials commonly used in soft robotics and can be distributed throughout soft robot bodies without introducing mechanical incongruities.








Abstract
Biological organisms exhibit phenomenal adaptation through morphology&#8208;shifting mechanisms including self&#8208;amputation, regeneration, and collective behavior. For example, reptiles, crustaceans, and insects amputate their own appendages in response to threats. Temporary fusion between individuals enables collective behaviors, such as in ants that temporarily fuse to build bridges. The concept of morphological editing often involves the addition and subtraction of mass and can be linked to modular robotics, wherein synthetic body morphology may be revised by rearranging parts. This work describes a reversible cohesive interface made of thermoplastic elastomer that allows for strong attachment and easy detachment of distributed soft robot modules without direct human handling. The reversible joint boasts a modulus similar to materials commonly used in soft robotics, and can thus be distributed throughout soft robot bodies without introducing mechanical incongruities. To demonstrate utility, the reversible joint is implemented in two embodiments: a soft quadruped robot that self&#8208;amputates a limb when stuck, and a cluster of three soft&#8208;crawling robots that fuse to cross a land gap. This work points toward future robots capable of radical shape&#8208;shifting via changes in mass through autotomy and interfusion, as well as highlights the crucial role that interfacial stiffness change plays in autotomizable biological and artificial systems.

LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4&#8212;a high&#8208;voltage cathode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries&#8212;often suffers from poor cycling stability&#8212;a challenge frequently addressed through cationic substitution. Bridging experimental testing&#160;and computational modeling, this research&#160;delves into the intricacies of Fe&#8208; and Mg&#8208;substituted LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, exploring the effects on [Mn3+], [Ni3+], oxygen vacancies, defects, and impurity phases. The correlation between Li&#8208;site defects and Li&#8208;rich impurity phases is revealed.








Abstract
An understanding of the structural properties that allow for optimal cathode performance, and their origin, is necessary for devising advanced cathode design strategies and accelerating the commercialization of next&#8208;generation cathodes. High&#8208;voltage, Fe&#8208; and Mg&#8208;substituted LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathodes offer a low&#8208;cost, cobalt&#8208;free, yet energy&#8208;dense alternative to commercial cathodes. In this work, the effect of substitution on several important structure properties is explored, including Ni/Mn ordering, charge distribution, and extrinsic defects. In the cation&#8208;disordered samples studied, a correlation is observed between increased Fe/Mg substitution, Li&#8208;site defects, and Li&#8208;rich impurity phase formation&#8212;the concentrations of which are greater for Mg&#8208;substituted samples. This is attributed to the lower formation energy of MgLi defects when compared to FeLi defects. Li&#8208;site defect&#8208;induced impurity phases consequently alter the charge distribution of the system, resulting in increased [Mn3+] with Fe/Mg substitution. In addition to impurity phases, other charge compensators are also investigated to explain the origin of Mn3+ (extrinsic defects, [Ni3+], oxygen vacancies and intrinsic off&#8208;stoichiometry), although their effects are found to be negligible.

         <title>Engineering an Organic Nanoplatform for Augmented Pyroeletroimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance organic nanoplatform, tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs, is rationally engineered for the effective pyroelectroimmunotherapy of tumor metastasis. In vivo assessments reveal that tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs and NIR laser exposure significantly inhibit the proliferation of primary and distant tumors and prominently retarded lung metastasis. This study provides a strategy for designing organic pyroelectric nanoplatforms to effectively cure tumor metastasis and overcome the inherent shortcomings of photothermal immunotherapy.








Abstract
Photothermal immunotherapy has shown great promise in the treatment of tumor metastasis. However, the thermal resistance of tumor cells substantially compromises the treatment effect of photothermal immunotherapy. Herein, a high&#8208;performance organic pyroelectric nanoplatform, tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 nanoparticles (NPs), is rationally engineered for the effective pyroelectroimmunotherapy of tumor metastasis. Biocompatible tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs with excellent pyroelectric and photothermal conversion properties are constructed by assembling organic, low&#8208;bandgap pyroelectric molecules with amphiphilic polymers. After internalization by tumor cells, treatment with tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs causes an apparent temperature elevation upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, inducing potent immunogenic cell death (ICD). Additionally, the temperature variations under alternating NIR laser irradiation facilitate reactive oxygen species production for pyroelectric therapy, thus promoting ICD activation and lowering thermal resistance. Importantly, in vivo assessments illustrate that tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs in combination with NIR laser exposure notably inhibit primary and distant tumor proliferation and prominently retarded lung metastasis. RNA profiling reveals that treatment with tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs markedly suppresses metastasis under NIR laser illumination by downregulating metastasis&#8208;related genes and upregulating immune response&#8208;associated pathways. Therefore, this study provides a strategy for designing high&#8208;performance pyroelectric nanoplatforms to effectively cure tumor metastasis, thereby overcoming the inherent shortcomings of photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Optically Actuated Soft Microrobot Family for Single&#8208;Cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of cell manipulators is presented, which are deformable by optical tweezers and rely on their elasticity to hold single, nonadherent cells. The structures, prepared with multiphoton polymerization, provide high spatial and temporal control over the manipulation of the cells enabling single cell movement with 6&#176; of freedom and cell&#8211;cell interactions.








Abstract
Precisely controlled manipulation of nonadherent single cells is often a pre&#8208;requisite for their detailed investigation. Optical trapping provides a versatile means for positioning cells with submicrometer precision or measuring forces with femto&#8208;Newton resolution. A variant of the technique, called indirect optical trapping, enables single&#8208;cell manipulation with no photodamage and superior spatial control and stability by relying on optically trapped microtools biochemically bound to the cell. High&#8208;resolution 3D lithography enables to prepare such cell manipulators with any predefined shape, greatly extending the number of achievable manipulation tasks. Here, it is presented for the first time a novel family of cell manipulators that are deformable by optical tweezers and rely on their elasticity to hold cells. This provides a more straightforward approach to indirect optical trapping by avoiding biochemical functionalization for cell attachment, and consequently by enabling the manipulated cells to be released at any time. Using the photoresist Ormocomp, the deformations achievable with optical forces in the tens of pN range and present three modes of single&#8208;cell manipulation as examples to showcase the possible applications such soft microrobotic tools can offer are characterized. The applications describe here include cell collection, 3D cell imaging, and spatially and temporally controlled cell&#8211;cell interaction.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Engineered Cobalt Catalysts for Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions: Synergy of Single Atom Metal Sites and Nonmetal&#8208;Bonded Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of single&#8208;atom Co catalysts with different types of nitrogen species are synthesized to study the roles of metal&#8208; and nonmetal&#8208;bonded functionalities in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Co&#9472;N coordination is optimal for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) adsorption to trigger electron transfer pathway, while graphitic N helps adsorb target micropollutant and acts as a secondary PMS adsorption site, synergistically promoting the degradation efficiency.








Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) are atomic&#8208;level&#8208;engineered materials with high intrinsic activity. Catalytic centers of SACs are typically the transition metal (TM)&#8211;nonmetal coordination sites, while the functions of coexisting non&#8208;TM&#8208;bonded functionalities are usually overlooked in catalysis. Herein, the scalable preparation of carbon&#8208;supported cobalt&#8208;anchored SACs (CoCN) with controlled Co&#9472;N sites and free functional N species is reported. The role of metal&#8208; and nonmetal&#8208;bonded functionalities in the SACs for peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;driven Fenton&#8208;like reactions is first systematically studied, revealing their contribution to performance improvement and pathway steering. Experiments and computations demonstrate that the Co&#9472;N3C coordination plays a vital role in the formation of a surface&#8208;confined PMS* complex to trigger the electron transfer pathway and promote kinetics because of the optimized electronic state of Co centers, while the nonmetal&#8208;coordinated graphitic N sites act as preferable pollutant adsorption sites and additional PMS activation sites to accelerate electron transfer. Synergistically, CoCN exhibits ultrahigh activity in PMS activation for p&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid oxidation, achieving complete degradation within 10&#160;min with an ultrahigh turnover frequency of 0.38&#160;min&#8722;1, surpassing most reported materials. These findings offer new insights into the versatile functions of N species in SACs and inspire rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts in complicated heterogeneous systems.

         <title>Achieving Planar Zn Electroplating in Aqueous Zinc Batteries with Cathode&#8208;Compatible Current Densities by Cycling under Pressure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Applying pressure to aqueous zinc battery cells during operation improves the metal anode cycling performance, particularly when cycled at the lower current densities necessary for compatibility with current cathode materials. This low&#8208;rate stable inter&#8208;cycle coulombic efficiency is achieved due to the pressure encouraging planar plating, and thereby inhibiting dead Zn detachment.








Abstract
The value of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion rechargeable batteries is held back by the degradation of the Zn metal anode with repeated cycling. While raising the operating current density is shown to alleviate this anode degradation, such high cycling rates are not compatible with full cells, as they cause Zn&#8208;host cathodes to undergo capacity decay. A simple approach that improves anode performance while using more modest cathode&#8208;compatible current densities is required. This work reports reversible planar Zn deposition under cathode&#8208;compatible current densities can instead be achieved by applying external pressure to the cell. Employing multiscale characterization, this work illustrates how cycling under pressure results in denser and more uniform Zn deposition, analogous to that achieved under high cycling rates, even at low areal current densities of 1 to 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Microstructural mechanical measurements reveal that Zn structures plated under lower current densities are particularly susceptible to pressure&#8208;induced compression. The ability to achieve planar Zn plating at cathode&#8208;compatible current densities holds significant promise for enabling high&#8208;capacity Zn&#8208;ion battery full cells.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Biodegradable Molybdenum &#8211; From Powder to Vascular Stent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic diagram showing the additive manufacturing of Mo&#8208;based bioresorbable vascular stents from Mo powder and their potential applications within intravascular and extravascular conditions. The SLMed thin&#8208;wall (&#8804; 100 &#181;m) Mo owns comparable strength to its Mg and Zn based counterparts, while, it exhibits remarkable biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Magnesium, iron, and zinc&#8208;based biodegradable metals are widely recognized as promising candidate materials for the next generation of bioresorbable stent (BVS). However, none of those metal BVSs are perfect at this stage. Here, a brand&#8208;new BVS based on a novel biodegradable metal (Molybdenum, Mo) through additive manufacturing is developed. Nearly full&#8208;dense and crack&#8208;free thin&#8208;wall Mo is directly manufactured through selective laser melting (SLM) with fine Mo powder. Systemic analyses considering the forming quality, wall&#8208;thickness, microstructure, mechanical properties, and in vitro degradation behaviors are performed. Then, Mo&#8208;based thin&#8208;strut (&#8804; 100&#160;&#181;m) stents are successfully obtained through an optimized single&#8208;track laser melting route. The SLMed thin&#8208;wall Mo owns comparable strength to its Mg and Zn based counterparts (as&#8208;drawn), while, it exhibits remarkable biocompatibility in vitro. Vessel related cells are well adhered and spread on SLMed Mo, and it exhibits a low risk of hemolysis and thrombus. The SLMed stent is compatible to vessel tissues in rat abdominal aorta, and it can provide sufficient support in an animal model as an extravascular stent. This work possibly opens a new era of manufacturing Mo&#8208;based stents through additive manufacturing.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;&#8220;In Situ&#8221; Analysis of the Reactive Liquid&#8208;Solid Interface during Magnesium Corrosion Using Cryo&#8208;Atom Probe Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach is demonstrated, which has the potential to study liquid&#8208;solid interfaces quasi&#8208;&#8220;in situ&#8221; at the near&#8208;atomic level with high chemical sensitivity using a fully cryo&#8208;enabled workflow. Using the new method&#160;in the early&#8208;stages of Mg corrosion, observed the inward growth of an intermediate corrosion layer with different compositions at the reactive interface under these conditions.








Abstract
The early stages of corrosion occurring at liquid&#8208;solid interfaces control the evolution of the material's degradation process, yet due to their transient state, their analysis remains a formidable challenge. Here corrosion tests are performed on a MgCa alloy, a candidate material for biodegradable implants using pure water as a model system. The corrosion reaction is suspended by plunge freezing into liquid nitrogen. The evolution of the early&#8208;stage corrosion process on the nanoscale by correlating cryo&#8208;atom probe tomography (APT) with transmission&#8208;electron microscopy (TEM) and spectroscopy, is studied. The outward growth of Mg hydroxide Mg(OH)2 and the inward growth of an intermediate corrosion layer consisting of hydrloxides of different compositions, mostly monohydroxide Mg(OH) instead of the expected MgO layer, are observed. In addition, Ca partitions to these newly formed hydroxides and oxides. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations suggest a domain of stability for this previously experimental unreported Mg(OH) phase. This new approach and these new findings advance the understanding of the early stages of magnesium corrosion, and in general reactions and processes at liquid&#8208;solid interfaces, which can further facilitate the development of corrosion&#8208;resistant materials or better control of the biodegradation rate of future implants.

         <title>Mucus&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogels: A Protective Barrier for Cells against Viral Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work reports a scalable synthetic approach to prepare mucus&#8208;mimetic hydrogels with tuneable rheological properties and microstructures. The synthesized hydrogels are characterized at several length scales by macrorheology, single particle tracking microrheology, cryo&#8208;scanning electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;SEM), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. The synthesized hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;healing properties and protect the underlying cells from viral infection tested in a transwell.








Abstract
Mucus is a dynamic biological hydrogel, composed primarily of the glycoprotein mucin, exhibits unique biophysical properties and forms a barrier protecting cells against a broad&#8208;spectrum of viruses. Here, this work develops a polyglycerol sulfate&#8208;based dendronized mucin&#8208;inspired copolymer (MICP&#8208;1) with &#8776;10% repeating units of activated disulfide as cross&#8208;linking sites. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM)&#160;analysis of MICP&#8208;1 reveals an elongated single&#8208;chain fiber morphology. MICP&#8208;1 shows potential inhibitory activity against many viruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV&#8208;1) and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (including variants such as Delta and Omicron). MICP&#8208;1 produces hydrogels with viscoelastic properties similar to healthy human sputum and with tuneable microstructures using linear and branched polyethylene glycol&#8208;thiol (PEG&#8208;thiol) as cross&#8208;linkers. Single particle tracking microrheology, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and cryo&#8208;scanning electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;SEM) are used to characterize the network structures. The synthesized hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;healing properties, along with viscoelastic properties that are tuneable through reduction. A transwell assay is used to investigate the hydrogel's protective properties against viral infection against HSV&#8208;1. Live&#8208;cell microscopy confirms that these hydrogels can protect underlying cells from infection by trapping the virus, due to both network morphology and anionic multivalent effects. Overall, this novel mucin&#8208;inspired copolymer generates mucus&#8208;mimetic hydrogels on a multi&#8208;gram scale. These hydrogels can be used as models for disulfide&#8208;rich airway mucus research, and as biomaterials.

         <title>Multifunctional Dopamine&#8208;Based Hydrogel Microneedle Electrode for Continuous Ketone Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogel microneedle continuous ketone monitoring (HMN&#8208;CKM) sensor utilizes the dopamine's catechol&#8211;quinone chemistry to monitor ketone bodies in interstitial fluid and facilitate formation of a crosslinked hydrogel network for stable entrapment of sensing components. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the HMN&#8208;CKM can track ketone levels of type 1 diabetes (T1D)&#160;rat models in real&#8208;time in conjunction with a data&#8208;driven machine learning model.









Abstract
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a severe complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D), is triggered by production of large quantities of ketone bodies, requiring patients with T1D to constantly monitor their ketone levels. Here, a skin&#8208;compatible hydrogel microneedle (HMN)&#8208;continuous ketone monitoring (HMN&#8208;CKM) device is reported. The sensing mechanism relies on the catechol&#8211;quinone chemistry inherent to&#160;the dopamine (DA) molecules that are covalently linked to the polymer structure of the HMN patch. The DA serves the dual&#8208;purpose of acting as a redox mediator for measuring the byproduct of oxidation of 3&#8208;beta&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (&#946;&#8208;HB), the primary ketone bodies; while, also facilitating the formation of a crosslinked HMN patch. A universal approach involving pre&#8208;oxidation and detection of the generated catechol compounds is introduced to correlate the sensor response to the &#946;&#8208;HB concentrations. It is further shown that real&#8208;time tracking of a decrease in ketone levels of T1D rat model is possible using the HMN&#8208;CKM device, in conjunction with a data&#8208;driven machine learning model that considers potential time delays.

&lt;p&gt;The hydrogel microneedle continuous ketone monitoring (HMN-CKM) sensor utilizes the dopamine's catechol&#8211;quinone chemistry to monitor ketone bodies in interstitial fluid and facilitate formation of a crosslinked hydrogel network for stable entrapment of sensing components. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the HMN-CKM can track ketone levels of type 1 diabetes (T1D)&#160;rat models in real-time in conjunction with a data-driven machine learning model.

         <title>Electromechanically Reconfigurable Terahertz Stereo Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The massive strain change associated with the phase transition in VO2 is harnessed to achieve structurally reconfigurable metadevices that can be reversibly switched between 3D and planar geometries. Accessing the third dimension with complete dynamic control holds the potential to unlock exotic light&#8211;matter interactions, paving the way for novel and high&#8208;performance electromagnetic devices.








Abstract
Dynamic terahertz devices are vital for the next generation of wireless communication, sensing, and non&#8208;destructive imaging technologies. Metasurfaces have emerged as a paradigm&#8208;shifting platform, offering varied functionalities, miniaturization, and simplified fabrication compared to their 3D counterparts. However, the presence of in&#8208;plane mirror symmetry and reduced degree of freedom impose fundamental limitations on achieving advanced chiral response, beamforming, and reconfiguration capabilities. In this work, a platform composed of electrically actuated resonators that can be colossally reconfigured between planar and 3D geometries is demonstrated. To illustrate the platform, metadevices with 3D Split Ring Resonators are fabricated, wherein two counteracting driving forces are combined: i) folding induced by stress mismatch, which enables non&#8208;volatile state design and ii) unfolding triggered by the strain associated with insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition in VO2, which facilitates volatile structural reconfiguration. This large structural reconfiguration space allows for resonance mode switching, widely tunable magnetic and electric polarizabilities, and increased frequency agility. Moreover, the unique properties of VO2, such as the hysteretic nature of its phase transition is harnessed to demonstrate a multi&#8208;state memory. Therefore, these VO2 integrated metadevices are highly attractive for the realization of 6G communication devices such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, holographic beam formers, and spatial light modulators.

         <title>Floating Bimetallic Catalysts for Growing 30&#160;cm&#8208;Long Carbon Nanotube Arrays with High Yields and Uniformity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Floating bimetallic catalysts are developed in this work to grow ultralong CNT arrays with high yields and uniformity. With optimized FeCu catalysts, 30&#8208;centimeters&#8208;long ultralong CNT arrays with a record&#8208;breaking areal density of &#8776;8100&#160;CNTs&#160;mm&#8722;1 and significantly improved uniformity can be synthesized, which can be attributed to balancing the tradeoff between catalyst fluidity and carbon solubility.








Abstract
Ultralong carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as promising candidates for many cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, restricted by the extremely low yields of ultralong CNTs, their practical applications can hardly be realized. Therefore, new methodologies shall be developed to boost the growth efficiency of ultralong CNTs and alleviate their areal density decay at the macroscale level. Herein, a facile, universal, and controllable method for the in situ synthesis of floating bimetallic catalysts (FBCs) is proposed to grow ultralong CNT arrays with high yields and uniformity. Ferrocene and metal acetylacetonates serve as catalyst precursors, affording the successful synthesis of a series of FBCs with controllable compositions. Among these FBCs, the optimized FeCu catalyst increases the areal density of ultralong CNT arrays to a record&#8208;breaking value of &#8776;8100&#160;CNTs&#160;mm&#8722;1 and exhibits a lifetime 3.40 times longer than that of Fe, thus achieving both high yields and uniformity. A 30&#8208;centimeters&#8208;long and high&#8208;density ultralong CNT array is also successfully grown with the assistance of FeCu catalysts. As evidenced by this kinetic model and molecular dynamics simulations, the introduction of Cu into Fe can simultaneously improve the catalyst fluidity and decrease carbon solubility, and an optimal catalytic performance will be achieved by balancing this tradeoff.

An innovative SEB based on high&#8208;permittivity P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) nanocomposites is designed to provide autonomous and effective electrical treatment that accelerates wound healing by leveraging body&#8208;coupled energy harvesting from ambient 60&#8208;Hz EM waves. Combining human&#8208;centered energy solution and flexible, skin&#8208;conformable design, this work suggests the potential of the SEB as a straightforward, convenient, and practical wound care apparatus.








Abstract
Self&#8208;powered electrical bandages (SEBs), integrated with wearable energy harvesters, can provide an effective and autonomous electrical stimulation (ES) solution for rapid and scarless wound healing. A continuously operating, wireless, and applicable&#8208;to&#8208;comprehensive&#8208;wound ES device is essential for the quick restoration of wounds and convenience. This work illustrates a SEB powered by body&#8208;coupled energy harvesting. The SEB continuously treats the wound with 60&#8208;Hz sinusoidal electrical potential gained from the coupling of the human body and ambient electrical waves. It is demonstrated that enough level of electrical potential can be applied to the wound, further enhanced by strong capacitive coupling arising from the use of high&#8208;permittivity poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene):CaCu3Ti4O12 (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE):CCTO) nanocomposite. The potential clinical efficacy of the SEB is illustrated by preclinical analysis of human fibroblasts and mouse wound model, thus confirming the successful expedition of wound recovery. This work suggests a new class of wearable devices to provide ES events and its potential for extension to other conventional wound care materials and device technology.

         <title>Engineering a Hierarchy of Disorder: A New Route to Synthesize High&#8208;Performance 3D Nanoporous All&#8208;Carbon Materials**</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous amorphous carbon achieves an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength and conductivity by incorporating three amorphous sp2, sp3, and graphitic phases. The unique core&#8211;shell architecture: sp3 core for strength, sp2 shell for conductivity, surpasses existing porous materials in both strength and conductivity, opening doors for new high&#8208;performance material design.








Abstract
A new nanoporous amorphous carbon (NAC) structure that achieves both ultrahigh strength and high electrical conductivity, which are usually incompatible in porous materials is reported. By using modified spark plasma sintering, three amorphous carbon phases with different atomic bonding configurations are created. The composite consisted of an amorphous sp2&#8208;carbon matrix mixed with amorphous sp3&#8208;carbon and amorphous graphitic motif. NAC structure has an isotropic electrical conductivity of up to 12&#160;000&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1, Young's modulus of up to &#8776;5&#160;GPa, and Vickers hardness of over 900&#160;MPa. These properties are superior to those of existing conductive nanoporous materials. Direct investigation of the multiscale structure of this material through transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and machine learning&#8208;based electron tomography revealed that the origin of the remarkable material properties is the well&#8208;organized sp2/sp3 amorphous carbon phases with a core&#8211;shell&#8208;like architecture, where the sp3&#8208;rich carbon forms a resilient core surrounded by a conductive sp2&#8208;rich layer. This research not only introduces novel materials with exceptional properties but also opens new opportunities for exploring amorphous structures and designing high&#8208;performance materials.

&lt;p&gt;A new nanoporous amorphous carbon (NAC) structure that achieves both ultrahigh strength and high electrical conductivity, which are usually incompatible in porous materials is reported. By using modified spark plasma sintering, three amorphous carbon phases with different atomic bonding configurations are created. The composite consisted of an amorphous sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon matrix mixed with amorphous sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-carbon and amorphous graphitic motif. NAC structure has an isotropic electrical conductivity of up to 12&#160;000&#160;S&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, Young's modulus of up to &#8776;5&#160;GPa, and Vickers hardness of over 900&#160;MPa. These properties are superior to those of existing conductive nanoporous materials. Direct investigation of the multiscale structure of this material through transmission electron microscopy, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and machine learning-based electron tomography revealed that the origin of the remarkable material properties is the well-organized sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; amorphous carbon phases with a core&#8211;shell-like architecture, where the sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-rich carbon forms a resilient core surrounded by a conductive sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-rich layer. This research not only introduces novel materials with exceptional properties but also opens new opportunities for exploring amorphous structures and designing high-performance materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Field&#8208;Effect Thermoelectric Hotspot in Monolayer Graphene Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field&#8208;effect thermoelectrics in monolayer graphene transistor is reported. Spatially localized hotspot is observed at Dirac point and arises from both Joule and Peltier heating, characterized by scanning thermal microscopy and analyzed through simulation. The position of the observed Dirac hotspot can shift in the gated region, highly controllable by the gate bias.








Abstract
Graphene is a promising candidate for the thermal management of downscaled microelectronic devices owing to its exceptional electrical and thermal properties. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate electrical and thermal interconversions at a nanoscale, particularly in field&#8208;effect transistors with prevalent gate operations, remains elusive. In this study, nanothermometric imaging is used to examine a current&#8208;carrying monolayer graphene channel sandwiched between hexagonal boron nitride dielectrics. It is revealed for the first time that beyond the expected Joule heating, the thermoelectric Peltier effect actively plays a significant role in generating hotspots beneath the gated region. With gate&#8208;controlled charge redistribution and a shift in the Dirac point position, an unprecedented systematic evolution of thermoelectric hotspots, underscoring their remarkable tenability is demonstrated. This study reveals the field&#8208;effect Peltier contribution in a single graphene&#8208;material channel of transistors, offering valuable insights into field&#8208;effect thermoelectrics and future on&#8208;chip energy management.

         <title>Eagle&#8208;Eye Inspired Meta&#8208;Device for Phase Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eagle's eyes, equipped with bifocals, demonstrate the ability to capture the bear, analogous to the authors&#8217; designed meta&#8208;device with two focal lengths, which enables the capture of phase information from the &#8220;transparent bear.&#8221;








Abstract
The dual&#8208;focus vision observed in eagles' eyes is an intriguing phenomenon captivates scientists since a long time. Inspired by this natural occurrence, the authors&#8217; research introduces a novel bifocal meta&#8208;device incorporating a polarized camera capable of simultaneously capturing images for two different polarizations with slightly different focal distances. This innovative approach facilitates the concurrent acquisition of underfocused and overfocused images in a single snapshot, enabling the effective extraction of quantitative phase information from the object using the transport of intensity equation. Experimental demonstrations showcase the application of quantitative phase imaging to artificial objects and human embryonic kidney cells, particularly emphasizing the meta&#8208;device's relevance in dynamic scenarios such as laser&#8208;induced ablation in human embryonic kidney cells. Moreover, it provides a solution for the quantification during the dynamic process at the cellular level. Notably, the proposed eagle&#8208;eye inspired meta&#8208;device for phase imaging (EIMPI), due to its simplicity and compact nature, holds promise for significant applications in fields such as endoscopy and headsets, where a lightweight and compact setup is essential.

         <title>Site&#8208;Selective Growth of fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Copper on Unconventional Phase Metal Nanomaterials for Highly Efficient Tandem CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through site&#8208;selective growth of Cu on unusual phase Au nanorods, three kinds of heterophase fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8211;Cu heteronanostructures are obtained, among which fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8211;Cu JNSs exhibit the best CO2RR performance, with FEC2+ of 84.3%. It is revealed that co&#8208;exposure of 2H&#8208;Au and 2H&#8208;Cu domains in Au&#8211;Cu JNSs diversifies CO* adsorption configurations, promoting CO* spillover and subsequent C&#8211;C coupling for multi&#8208;carbon production.








Abstract
Copper (Cu) nanomaterials are a unique kind of electrocatalysts for high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon production in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), which holds enormous potential in attaining carbon neutrality. However, phase engineering of Cu nanomaterials remains challenging, especially for the construction of unconventional phase Cu&#8208;based asymmetric heteronanostructures. Here the site&#8208;selective growth of Cu on unusual phase gold (Au) nanorods, obtaining three kinds of heterophase fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8211;Cu heteronanostructures is reported. Significantly, the resultant fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8211;Cu Janus nanostructures (JNSs) break the symmetric growth mode of Cu on Au. In electrocatalytic CO2RR, the fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8211;Cu JNSs exhibit excellent performance in both H&#8208;type and flow cells, with Faradaic efficiencies of 55.5% and 84.3% for ethylene and multi&#8208;carbon products, respectively. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal the co&#8208;exposure of 2H&#8208;Au and 2H&#8208;Cu domains in Au&#8211;Cu JNSs diversifies the CO* adsorption configurations and promotes the CO* spillover and subsequent C&#8211;C coupling toward ethylene generation with reduced energy barriers.

         <title>Balancing Polarization and Breakdown for High Capacitive Energy Storage by Microstructure Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Balancing polarization and breakdown by microstructure control&#8212;amorphous for breakdown, crystalline for polarization&#8212;is key to energy storage. Phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that small grains with moderate crystallinity optimize both, leading to high energy density. This approach yielded a 131 J cm&#8722;3 energy density with 81.6% efficiency in Bi3NdTi4O12 films, offering a strategy for advanced dielectric energy storage through microstructure design.








Abstract
The compromise of contradictive parameters, polarization, and breakdown strength, is necessary to achieve a high energy storage performance. The two can be tuned, regardless of material types, by controlling microstructures: amorphous states possess higher breakdown strength, while crystalline states have larger polarization. However, how to achieve a balance of amorphous and crystalline phases requires systematic and quantitative investigations. Herein, the trade&#8208;off between polarization and breakdown field is comprehensively evaluated with the evolution of microstructure, i.e., grain size and crystallinity, by phase&#8208;field simulations. The results indicate small grain size (&#8776;10&#8211;35&#160;nm) with moderate crystallinity (&#8776;60&#8211;80%) is more beneficial to maintain relatively high polarization and breakdown field simultaneously, consequently contributing to a high overall energy storage performance. Experimentally, therefore an ultrahigh energy density of 131 J cm&#8722;3 is achieved with a high efficiency of 81.6% in the microcrystal&#8208;amorphous dual&#8208;phase Bi3NdTi4O12 films. This work provides a guidance to substantially enhance dielectric energy storage by a simple and effective microstructure design.

         <title>Thermal Shock Synthesis for Loading Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm Ru Nanoclusters on Titanium Nitride as a Remarkable Electrocatalyst toward Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct dechlorination of the adsorbed RuCl3, ultrafast nucleation process, and short coalescence duration under high&#8208;temperature shock conditions give rise to Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm Ru nanocrystals (NCs) on TiN support (HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN) via the specific Ru&#8211;Ti interaction. The accelerated water dissociation kinetics at the Ru&#8211;Ti interfacial perimeters predominantly account for the encouraging electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction activity in alkaline.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts embracing metal entities on suitable supports are profound in catalyzing various chemical reactions, and substantial synthetic endeavors in metal&#8211;support interaction modulation are made to enhance catalytic performance. Here, it is reported the loading of sub&#8208;2&#160;nm Ru nanocrystals (NCs) on titanium nitride support (HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN) via a special Ru&#8211;Ti interaction using the high&#8208;temperature shock (HTS) method. Direct dechlorination of the adsorbed RuCl3, ultrafast nucleation process, and short coalescence duration at ultrahigh temperatures contribute to the immobilization of Ru NCs on TiN support via producing the Ru&#8211;Ti interfacial perimeter. HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN shows remarkable activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution, yielding ultralow overpotentials of 16.3 and 86.6&#160;mV to achieve 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The alkaline and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers assembled using HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN yield 1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.65 and 1.67&#160;V, respectively, which validate its applicability in the hydrogen production industry. Theoretical simulations reveal the favorable formation of Ru&#9472;O and Ti&#9472;H bonds at the interfacial perimeters between Ru NCs and TiN, which accelerates the prerequisite water dissociation kinetics for enhanced HER activity. This exemplified work motivates the design of specific interfacial perimeters via the HTS strategy to improve the performance of diverse catalysis.

Abstract
The electrical conductivity of blood is a crucial physiological parameter with diverse applications in medical diagnostics. Here, a novel approach utilizing a portable millifluidic nanogenerator lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip device for measuring blood conductivity at low frequencies, is introduced. The proposed device employs blood as a conductive substance within its built&#8208;in triboelectric nanogenerator system. The voltage generated by this blood&#8208;based nanogenerator device is analyzed to determine the electrical conductivity of the blood sample. The self&#8208;powering functionality of the device eliminates the need for complex embedded electronics and external electrodes. Experimental results using simulated body fluid and human blood plasma demonstrate the device's efficacy in detecting variations in conductivity related to changes in electrolyte concentrations. Furthermore, artificial intelligence models are used to analyze the generated voltage patterns and to estimate the blood electrical conductivity. The models exhibit high accuracy in predicting conductivity based solely on the device&#8208;generated voltage. The 3D&#8208;printed, disposable design of the device enhances portability and usability, providing a point&#8208;of&#8208;care solution for rapid blood conductivity assessment. A comparative analysis with traditional conductivity measurement methods highlights the advantages of the proposed device in terms of simplicity, portability, and adaptability for various applications beyond blood analysis.

         <title>Spontaneous Supercrystal Formation During a Strain&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a thin epitaxially strained film of a Mott insulator, a hierarchical anisotropic supercrystal is found below metal&#8211;insulator transition temperature (top). A different anisotropic structure is observed at temperatures above (bottom). An electronic anisotropy correlated with the supercrystal is discovered, switching preferential conductivity direction by 90&#176;.








Abstract
Mott metal&#8211;insulator transitions possess electronic, magnetic, and structural degrees of freedom promising next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;efficient electronics. A previously unknown, hierarchically ordered, and anisotropic supercrystal state is reported and its intrinsic formation characterized&#160;in&#8208;situ during a Mott transition in a Ca2RuO4 thin film. Machine learning&#8208;assisted X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction together with cryogenic electron microscopy reveal multi&#8208;scale periodic domain formation at and below the film transition temperature (TFilm&#160;&#8776;&#160;200&#8211;250&#160;K) and a separate anisotropic spatial structure at and above TFilm. Local resistivity measurements imply an intrinsic coupling of the supercrystal orientation to the material's anisotropic conductivity. These findings add a new degree of complexity to the physical understanding of Mott transitions, opening opportunities for designing materials with tunable electronic properties.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Curing of Liquid Crystal Thermosets Enabled by End&#8208;Groups Regulation and In Situ Monitoring by Triboelectric Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly designed end&#8208;group endows liquid crystal polyarylate thermoset with relatively mild curing condition (300&#160;&#176;C) and high curing efficiency (1&#160;min) while maintaining excellent thermomechanical properties. The chemical information extracted from the triboelectric output performance enables a new nondestructive and sensitive tool to estimate the process of curing reaction based on the variation of crosslinked networks.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance polymer is crucial for the fabrication of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) used in extreme conditions. Liquid crystal polyarylate thermosets (LCTs) demonstrate great potential as triboelectric material by virtue of exceptional comprehensive properties. However, there are only a few specific end&#8208;groups like phenylethynyl matching the LCT polycondensation temperature (above 300&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the excellent properties of LCTs rely on the crosslinked network formed with long curing time at high temperature, restricting their further application in triboelectric material. Herein, a fast&#8208;curing LCT is designed by terminating with 4&#8208;maleimidophenol possessing appropriate reactivity. The resultant LCT (MA&#8208;LC&#8208;MA) exhibits much lower polycondensation temperature (250&#8211;270&#160;&#176;C) and curing temperature of 300&#160;&#176;C within only 1&#160;min compared to typical LCTs (cured at 370&#160;&#176;C for 1&#160;h). Furthermore, the cured MA&#8208;LC&#8208;MA retains a high glass transition temperature of 135&#160;&#176;C, storage modulus of 6&#160;MPa even at 350&#160;&#176;C, and great electrical output performance. Additionally, triboelectric measurement related to the dielectric properties that vary with crosslinked network is innovatively utilized as an analysis technique of curing progress. This work provides a new strategy to design high&#8208;performance TENGs and promotes the development of next generation thermosets in extreme conditions.

Organic heterojunction transistors are designed to integrate light intensity&#8208;adaptive threshold sliding and second&#8208;order adaptive metaplasticity. The unique dual adaptability enables the highlighting of 0.4% low&#8208;contrast images, and the efficient recognition can be achieved benefiting from the learning rate changes in the backpropagation process.








Abstract
Photoadaptive synaptic devices enable in&#8208;sensor processing of complex illumination scenes, while second&#8208;order adaptive synaptic plasticity improves learning efficiency by modifying the learning rate in a given environment. The integration of above adaptations in one phototransistor device will provide opportunities for developing high&#8208;efficient machine vision system. Here, a dually adaptable organic heterojunction transistor as a working unit in the system, which facilitates precise contrast enhancement and improves convergence rate under harsh lighting conditions, is reported. The photoadaptive threshold sliding originates from the bidirectional photoconductivity caused by the light intensity&#8208;dependent photogating effect. Metaplasticity is successfully implemented owing to the combination of ambipolar behavior and charge trapping effect. By utilizing the transistor array in a machine vision system, the details and edges can be highlighted in the 0.4% low&#8208;contrast images, and a high recognition accuracy of 93.8% with a significantly promoted convergence rate by about 5 times are also achieved. These results open a strategy to fully implement metaplasticity in optoelectronic devices and suggest their vision processing applications in complex lighting scenes.

         <title>Hybrid Surface Modification and Bulk Doping Enable Spent LiCoO2 Cathodes for High&#8208;Voltage Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive bulk and surface commodification strategy including bulk Mn doping, near&#8208;surface P gradient doping, and Li3PO4/CoP coating is proposed to enable spent LiCoO2 cathodes for high&#8208;voltage operation. Li+&#8208;conductive Li3PO4 and electron conductive CoP facilitate mitigation of electrode/electrolyte interfacial side reactions, Li&#8208;ion diffusion, and electron transport; thus, boosting the cycling stability and rate performance of upcycled LiCoO2 at 4.6 V.








Abstract
The emerging market demand for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density of energy storage devices is pushing the disposal of end&#8208;of&#8208;life LiCoO2 (LCO) to shift toward sustainable upgrading into structurally stable high&#8208;voltage cathode materials. Herein, an integrated bulk and surface commodification strategy is proposed to render spent LCO (S&#8208;LCO) to operate at high voltages, involving bulk Mn doping, near surface P gradient doping, and Li3PO4/CoP (LPO/CP) coating on the LCO surface to yield upcycled LCO (defined as MP&#8208;LCO@LPO/CP). Benefiting from hybrid surface coating with Li+&#8208;conductive Li3PO4 (LPO) and electron conductive CoP (CP) coupled with Mn and P co&#8208;doping, the optimized MP&#8208;LCO@LPO/CP cathode exhibits enhanced high&#8208;voltage performance, delivering an initial discharge capacity of 218.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C with excellent capacity retention of 80.9% (0.5 C) after 200 cycles at a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V, along with 96.3% of capacity retention over 100 cycles at 4.5&#160;V. These findings may afford meaningful construction for the upcycling of commercial S&#8208;LCO into next&#8208;generation upmarket cathode materials through the elaborate surface and bulk modification design.

         <title>Dynamic Cleavage&#8208;Remodeling of Covalent Organic Networks into Multidimensional Superstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of covalent organic network&#8208;based superstructures, including 0D hollow supraparticles and 2D films is shown. Based on the thermal cleavage&#8208;remodeling strategy, the reversible and controlled preparation of superstructures with multiple morphologies and species is realized and successfully demonstrates the structural excellence of the multilayered superstructures through the study of the mass transfer kinetics of iodine.








Abstract
Superstructures with complex hierarchical spatial configurations exhibit broader structural depth than single hierarchical structures and the associated broader application prospects. However, current preparation methods are greatly constrained by cumbersome steps and harsh conditions. Here, for the first time, a concise and efficient thermally responsive dynamic synthesis strategy for the preparation of multidimensional complex superstructures within soluble covalent organic networks (SCONs) with tunable morphology from 0D hollow supraparticles to 2D films is presented. Mechanism study reveals the thermally responsive dynamic &#8220;cleavage&#8208;remodeling&#8221; characteristics of SCONs, synthesized based on the unique bilayer structure of (2.2)paracyclophane, and the temperature control facilitates the process from reversible solubility to reorganization and construction of superstructures. Specifically, during the process, the oil&#8211;water&#8208;emulsion two&#8208;phase interface can be generated through droplet jetting, leading to the preparation of 0D hollow supraparticles and other bowl&#8208;like complex superstructures with high yield. Additionally, by modulating the volatility and solubility of exogenous solvents, defect&#8208;free 2D films are prepared relying on an air&#8211;liquid interface. Expanded experiments further confirm the generalizability and scalability of the proposed dynamic &#8220;cleavage&#8208;remodeling&#8221; strategy. Research on the enrichment mechanism of guest iodine highlights the superior kinetic mass transfer performance of superstructural products compared to single&#8208;hierarchical materials.

         <title>3D Laser Writing of Low&#8208;Loss Cross&#8208;Section&#8208;Variable Type&#8208;I Optical Waveguide Passive/Active Integrated Devices in Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal femtosecond laser direct&#8208;writing technique to fabricate low&#8208;loss high&#8208;gain Type&#8208;I optical waveguide in single crystals, enables precise control of waveguide shape, size, mode&#8208;field, and refractive index distribution, with high spatial resolution of &gt;700&#160;nm and positive refractive index variation of &gt;10&#8722;2, introducing new degrees of freedom to design and fabricate passive/active optical waveguide devices.








Abstract
Optical waveguides fabricated in single crystals offer crucial passive/active optical components for photonic integrated circuits. Single crystals possess inherent advantages over their amorphous counterpart, such as lower optical losses in visible&#8208;to&#8208;mid&#8208;infrared band, larger peak emission cross&#8208;section, higher doping concentration. However, the writing of Type&#8208;I positive refractive index modified waveguides in single crystals using femtosecond laser technology presents significant challenges. Herein, this work introduces a novel femtosecond laser direct writing technique that combines slit&#8208;shaping with an immersion oil objective to fabricate low&#8208;loss Type&#8208;I waveguides in single crystals. This approach allows for precise control of waveguide shape, size, mode&#8208;field, and refractive index distribution, with a spatial resolution as high as 700&#160;nm and a high positive refractive index variation on the order of 10&#8722;2, introducing new degrees of freedom to design and fabricate passive/active optical waveguide devices. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this work successfully produces a 7&#160;mm&#8208;long circular&#8208;shaped gain waveguide (&#8776;10&#160;&#181;m in diameter) in an Er3+&#8208;doped YAG single crystal, exhibiting a propagation loss as low as 0.23&#160;dB&#160;cm&#8722;1, a net gain of &#8776;3&#160;dB and a polarization&#8208;insensitive character. The newly&#8208;developed technique is theoretically applicable to arbitrary single crystals, holding promising potential for various applications in integrated optics, optical communication, and photonic quantum circuits.

         <title>Active Fabrics With Controllable Stiffness for Robotic Assistive Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the biological protective organisms combining hard and soft phases, active fabrics consisting of architectured rigid tiles interconnected with flexible actuated fibers are developed. They achieve rapid transitions between soft compliant configurations and rigid states conformable to the body (&gt;350 times stiffness change). Applications including exosuits for tremor suppression, lifting assistance, and impact&#8208;mitigating body armors are presented.








Abstract
Assistive interfaces enable collaborative interactions between humans and robots. In contrast to traditional rigid devices, conformable fabrics with tunable mechanical properties have emerged as compelling alternatives. However, existing assistive fabrics actuated by fluidic or thermal stimuli struggle to adapt to complex body contours and are hindered by challenges such as large volumes after actuation and slow response rates.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the biological protective organisms combining hard and soft phases, active fabrics consisting of architectured rigid tiles interconnected with flexible actuated fibers are developed. They achieve rapid transitions between soft compliant configurations and rigid states conformable to the body (&amp;gt;350 times stiffness change). Applications including exosuits for tremor suppression, lifting assistance, and impact-mitigating body armors are presented.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistive interfaces enable collaborative interactions between humans and robots. In contrast to traditional rigid devices, conformable fabrics with tunable mechanical properties have emerged as compelling alternatives. However, existing assistive fabrics actuated by fluidic or thermal stimuli struggle to adapt to complex body contours and are hindered by challenges such as large volumes after actuation and slow response rates. To overcome these limitations, inspiration is drawn from biological protective organisms combining hard and soft phases, and active assistive fabrics consisting of architectured rigid tiles interconnected with flexible actuated fibers are proposed. Through programmable tessellation of target body shapes into architectured tiles and controlling their interactions by the actuated fibers, the active fabrics can rapidly transition between soft compliant configurations and rigid states conformable to the body (&amp;gt;350 times stiffness change) while minimizing the device volume after actuation. The versatility of these active fabrics is demonstrated as exosuits for tremor suppression and lifting assistance,&#160;as body armors for impact mitigation, and integration with&#160;electrothermal actuators for smart actuation with convenient folding capabilities. This work offers a practical framework for designing customizable active fabrics with shape adaptivity and controllable stiffness, suitable for applications in wearable exosuits, haptic devices, and medical rehabilitation systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Evolving Hierarchical Hydrogel Fibers with Circadian Rhythms and Memory Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical hydrogel fibers spontaneously form through in situ hierarchy evolution, resulting in a hierarchical structure of interface fusion. Water transport occurs in the angstrom&#8208;scale channels within the fibers by direct Coulomb knock&#8208;on, similar to Newton's cradle, which serves as a master clock controlling the multi&#8208;response behaviors of the fibers.








Abstract
The fusion of hierarchical tissues at interfaces, incorporating ultrafast selective transport channels, enables efficient matter exchange and energy transfer across multiscale structures in living organisms. However, achieving these characteristics simultaneously in an artificial multimaterial system is challenging. Here, this work presents a multimaterial hydrogel fiber with a hierarchical structure of interface fusion, which forms spontaneously through in situ hierarchy evolution induced by ionic cross&#8208;linking and molecular shear flow. Water transport occurs in the angstrom&#8208;scale confined slits created by aligned cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) by direct Coulomb knock&#8208;on, resembling Newton's cradle motion. The fusion of interfaces enables high&#8208;efficiency water transport across multiscale layers, combined with Newton's cradle&#8208;like collective water motion, creating a highly sensitive negative feedback loop within the fiber. These fibers exhibit integrated behaviors of time&#8208;space perception, short&#8208;term memory and adaptive changes in shape. Additionally, they demonstrate rhythm characteristics, changing periodically in a 24&#8208;h day&#8208;night cycle. Composed of natural building blocks, these hierarchical hydrogel fibers exhibit a memristor effect similar to that of an elementary neuron, making them promising for applications in seamless on&#8208;skin and implantable bioelectronics.

         <title>Tandem Fields Facilitating Directional Carrier Migration in Van der Waals Heterojunction for Efficient Overall Piezo&#8208;Synthesis of H2O2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezo&#8208;catalytic dual&#8208;channel H2O2 synthesis system based on 2D/2D BIO/CN van der Waals heterojunction is successfully constructed. Under the joint promotion of an interfacial electric field and robust bulk polarization field, the electron transfer rapidly follows a Z&#8208;scheme route, realizing highly efficient 2e&#8722; WOR and 2e&#8722; ORR at space&#8208;separated active sites.








Abstract
Piezo&#8208;synthesis of H2O2 utilizing sustainable mechanical energy as well as earth&#8208;abundant water and oxygen is a green, cost&#8208;effective, and promising approach. However, achieving simultaneous two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) and two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) faces huge challenges due to insufficient synergistic active sites and slow/messy carrier transfer. Herein, a novel 2D/2D van der Waals heterojunction consisting of BiOIO3 and carbon nitride (BIO/CN) is elaborately designed for highly efficient overall H2O2 piezo&#8208;synthesis. Theoretical/experimental results reveal that a Z&#8208;scheme electron transfer is formed and facilitated by the tandem interfacial electric field and the bulk piezo&#8208;polarization field. On this basis, the carriers are efficiently separated while the oxidation/reduction capacity is preserved, thus providing the strong driving force for the 2e&#8722; WOR and 2e&#8722; ORR on BIO and CN, respectively. Furthermore, the kinetic and thermodynamic processes of WOR and ORR for H2O2 synthesis improve remarkably. Therefore, BIO/CN exhibits an excellent H2O2 yield of 259.8&#160;&#181;M within 30&#160;min in pure water and air atmosphere (without any sacrificial agents and aeration). This study provides a new idea on strategically controlling electron transfer toward high&#8208;efficiency H2O2 piezo&#8208;synthesis and expands the avenue for developing effective environmental purification materials.

         <title>Extreme Fast Charging of Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by a Molten&#8208;Salt&#8208;Derived Nanocrystal Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces a preformed inorganic nanocrystal&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase on lithium metal surface by the developed molten salt immersion approach, which balances high surface modulus and fast Li+ diffusivity. It improves the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for long&#8208;term cycling of lithium metal batteries (up to 500 cycles) under service conditions that include high loadings (up to 3.0 mAh cm&#8722;2) and extreme fast charging rates (up to 6 C).








Abstract
The extreme fast charging performance of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with a long life is an important focus in the development of next&#8208;generation battery technologies. The friable solid electrolyte interphase and dendritic lithium growth are major problems. The formation of an inorganic nanocrystal&#8208;dominant interphase produced by preimmersing the Li in molten lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide that suppresses the overgrowth of the usual interphase is reported. Its high surface modulus combined with fast Li+ diffusivity enables a reversible dendrite&#8208;proof deposition under ultrahigh&#8208;rate conditions. It gives a record&#8208;breaking cumulative plating/stripping capacity of &gt;240&#160;000 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2@30 mAh cm&#8722;2 for a symmetric cell and an extreme fast charging performance at 6 C for 500 cycles for a Li||LiCoO2 full cell with a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity, thus expanding the use of LMBs to high&#8208;loading and power&#8208;intensive scenarios. Its usability both in roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll production and in different electrolytes indicating the scalable and industrial potential of this process for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Intercalation&#8208;Induced Localized Conversion Reaction in h&#8208;CuSe for Ultrafast&#8208;Rechargeable and Long&#8208;Cycling Sodium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the intercalation induced localized conversion reaction mechanism in the hexagonal CuSe under the guidance of theoretical calculation and in situ techniques. High rate performance and excellent cycling stability are achieved by forming a localized anchoring phase of Cu7Se4 and adjusting the near&#8208;edge coordination state of Cu sites to stabilize the sodium storage structure.









Abstract
Cathode materials of sodium&#8208;based batteries with high specific capacity and fast charge&#8211;discharge mode, as well as ultralong reversible cycles at wide applied temperatures, are essential for future development of advanced energy storage system. Developing transition metal selenides with intercalation features provides a new strategy for realizing the above cathode materials. Herein, this work reports a storage mechanism of sodium ion in hexagonal CuSe (h&#8208;CuSe) based on the density functional theory (DFT) guidance. This work reveals that the two&#8208;dimensional ion intercalation triggers localized redox reaction in the h&#8208;CuSe bulk phase, termed intercalation&#8208;induced localized conversion (ILC) mechanism, to stabilize the sodium storage structure by forming localized Cu7Se4 transition phase and adjusting the near&#8208;edge coordination state of the Cu sites to achieve high reversible capacity and ultra&#8208;long cycling life, while allowing rapid charge&#8211;discharge cycling over a wide temperature range.

This work reveals that the two-dimensional ion intercalation triggers localized redox reaction in the &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-CuSe bulk phase, termed intercalation-induced localized conversion (ILC) mechanism, to stabilize the sodium storage structure by forming localized Cu&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; transition phase and adjusting the near-edge coordination state of the Cu sites to achieve high reversible capacity and ultra-long cycling life, while allowing rapid charge&#8211;discharge cycling over a wide temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Machine Learning Accelerated Discovery of Nanoporous Inorganic Crystals as Non&#8208;Absorbable Oral Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic machine learning accelerates the discovery of high&#8208;capacity, high&#8208;selectivity, and stable inorganic nanoporous crystals as non&#8208;absorbable oral drugs (NODs). NODs can remove unwanted molecules or ions from the gastrointestinal tract of the human body without directly entering the bloodstream. NH4&#8208;form merlinoite (NH4&#8208;MER) discovered by synergistic machine learning can prevent the Na+ release from ZS&#8208;9 in the treatment of hyperkalemia.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has taken drug discovery to new heights, where effective ML training requires vast quantities of high&#8208;quality experimental data as input. Non&#8208;absorbable oral drugs (NODs) have unique safety advantage for chronic diseases due to their zero systemic exposure, but their empirical discovery is still time&#8208;consuming and costly. Here, a synergistic ML method, integrating small data&#8208;driven multi&#8208;layer unsupervised learning, in silico quantum&#8208;mechanical computations, and minimal wet&#8208;lab experiments is devised to identify the finest NODs from massive inorganic materials to achieve multi&#8208;objective function (high selectivity, large capacity, and stability). Based on this method, a NH4&#8208;form nanoporous zeolite with merlinoite (MER) framework (NH4&#8208;MER) is discovered for the treatment of hyperkalemia. In three different animal models, NH4&#8208;MER shows a superior safety and efficacy profile in reducing blood K+ without Na+ release, which is an unmet clinical need in chronic kidney disease and Gordon's syndrome. This work provides a synergistic ML method to accelerate the discovery of NODs and other shape&#8208;selective materials.

         <title>Broadband Negative Photoconductive Response in Carbon Nanodots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The broadband response from the negative photoconductive carbon dots (CDs)&#160;are utilized to achieve the optoelectronic logic gates and optical imaging for the first time. The large specific surface area and abundant hydrophilic groups of the mcu&#8208;CDs endow abundant sites to naturally adsorb and desorb H2O molecules, contributing to the novel negative photoconductivity effect. 








Abstract
Due to the broadband response and low selectivity of external light, negative photoconductivity (NPC) effect holds great potential applications in photoelectric devices. Herein, different photoresponsive carbon nanodots (CDs) are prepared from diverse precursors and the broadband response from the NPC CDs are utilized to achieve the optoelectronic logic gates and optical imaging for the first time. In detail, the mcu&#8208;CDs which are prepared by the microwave&#8208;assisted polymerization of citric acid and urea possess the large specific surface area and abundant hydrophilic groups as sites for the adsorption of H2O molecules and thereby present a high conductivity in dark. Meanwhile, the low affinity of mcu&#8208;CDs to H2O molecules permits the light&#8208;induced desorption of H2O molecules by heat effect and thus endow the mcu&#8208;CDs with a low conductivity under illumination. The easy absorption and desorption of H2O molecules contribute to the extraordinary NPC of mcu&#8208;CDs. With the broadband NPC response in CDs, the optoelectronic logic gates and flexible optical imaging system are established, achieving the applications of &#8220;NOR&#8221; or &#8220;NAND&#8221; logic operations and high&#8208;quality optical images. These findings unveil the unique optoelectronic properties of CDs, and have the potential to advance the applications of CDs in optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Scribed Battery Electrodes for Ultrafast Zinc&#8208;Ion Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a simple, one&#8208;step laser&#8208;scribing synthesis approach to produce a vanadium&#8208;based cathode material for zinc&#8208;ion energy storage with high specific capacity, ultrafast charging, and cycling stability. The underlying mechanism of charge storage to be the co&#8208;insertion of zinc and hydronium ions with minimal lattice change upon cycling, which facilitates the observed gains in performance, is further revealed.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage but are plagued by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathode materials that enable high specific capacity, ultrafast charging, and outstanding cycling stability. Here, a laser&#8208;scribed nano&#8208;vanadium oxide (LNVO) cathode is designed that can simultaneously achieve these properties. The material stores charge through Faradaic redox reactions on/near the surface at fast rates owing to the small grain size of vanadium oxide and interpenetrating 3D graphene network, displaying a surface&#8208;controlled capacity contribution (90%&#8211;98%). Multiple characterization techniques unambiguously reveal that zinc and hydronium ions co&#8208;insert with minimal lattice change upon cycling. It is demonstrated that a high specific capacity of 553 mAh g&#8722;1 is achieved at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, and an impressive 264 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity is retained at 100 A g&#8722;1 within 10 s, showing excellent rate capability. The LNVO/Zn can also reach &gt;90% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at a high rate of 30 A g&#8722;1, as well as achieving both high energy (369 Wh kg&#8722;1) and power densities (56306 W kg&#8722;1). Moreover, the LNVO cathode retains its excellent cycling performance when integrated into quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, further demonstrating mechanical stability and its potential for practical application in wearable and grid&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Black Ultrathin Single&#8208;Crystalline Flakes of CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6 for Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black materials of CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6, with a narrow bandgap of &#8776;1.0&#160;eV, are developed as the new photocatalysts, which display high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) activity, far exceeding current layered metal phospho&#8211;sulfides and other materials. They even show&#160; near&#8208;infrared&#8208;driven PHE rates of 0.66 and 0.20&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, respectively.








Abstract
The development of new near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive photocatalysts is a fascinating and challenging approach to acquire high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance. Herein, near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive black CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6 flakes, as well as CuInP2S6 flakes, are designed and constructed for PHE. Atom&#8208;resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy images and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure evidence the formation of ultrathin single&#8208;crystalline sheet&#8208;like structure of CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6. The synthetic CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6, with a narrow bandgap of &#8776;1.0&#160;eV, shows the high light&#8208;absorption edge exceeding 1100&#160;nm. Moreover, through the femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, CuCrP2S6 displays the efficient charge transfer and long charge lifetime (18318.1&#160;ps), which is nearly 3 and 29 times longer than that of CuVP2S6 and CuInP2S6, respectively. In addition, CuCrP2S6, with the appropriate d&#8208;band and p&#8208;band, is thermodynamically favorable for the H+ adsorption and H2 desorption by contrast with CuVP2S6 and CuInP2S6. As a result, CuCrP2S6 exhibits high PHE rates of 9.12 and 0.66&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 under simulated sunlight and near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, respectively, far exceeding other layered metal phospho&#8211;sulfides. This work offers a distinctive perspective for the development of new near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive photocatalysts.

The synthetic CuVP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and CuCrP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, with a narrow bandgap of &#8776;1.0&#160;eV, shows the high light-absorption edge exceeding 1100&#160;nm. Moreover, through the femtosecond-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, CuCrP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; displays the efficient charge transfer and long charge lifetime (18318.1&#160;ps), which is nearly 3 and 29 times longer than that of CuVP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. In addition, CuCrP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, with the appropriate d-band and p-band, is thermodynamically favorable for the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; desorption by contrast with CuVP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, CuCrP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits high PHE rates of 9.12 and 0.66&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under simulated sunlight and near-infrared light irradiation, respectively, far exceeding other layered metal phospho&#8211;sulfides. This work offers a distinctive perspective for the development of new near-infrared-responsive photocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of High&#8208;Loading Single Metallic Atom Catalysts by a Metal Coordination Route</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel and robust metal coordination route is proposed to synthesize single metallic atom catalysts. Such strategy can achieve double records of large&#8208;scale production (3.565 kg) and single metallic atom loading (16.03 mol%) at one batch. Moreover, the obtained catalysts show efficient photocatalytic activity toward CO2 reduction to formic acid.








Abstract
Single atom catalyst (SAC) is one of the most efficient and versatile catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites. However, its facile and large&#8208;scale preparation, the prerequisite of industrial applications, has been very challenging. This dilemma originates&#160;from the Gibbs&#8211;Thomson effect, which renders it rather difficult to achieve high single atom loading (&lt; 3 mol%). Further, most synthesizing procedures are quite&#160;complex, resulting in significant mass loss and thus low yields. Herein, a novel metal coordination route is developed to address these issues simultaneously, which is realized owing to the rapid complexation between ligands (e.g., biuret) and metal ions in aqueous solutions and subsequent in situ polymerization of the formed complexes to yield SACs. The whole preparation process involves only one heating step operated in air without any special protecting atmospheres, showing general applicability for diverse transition metals. Take Cu SAC for an example, a record yield of up to 3.565&#160;kg in one pot and an ultrahigh metal loading 16.03 mol% on carbon nitride (Cu/CN) are approached. The as&#8208;prepared SACs are demonstrated to possess high activity, outstanding selectivity, and robust cyclicity for CO2 photoreduction to HCOOH. This research explores a robust route toward cost&#8208;effective, massive production of SACs for potential industrial applications.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Ultralow Voltage Organic Transistors With Sharp Switching for Adaptive Visual Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired synaptic transistor based on organic crystal&#8211;electret stacks is developed, which presents visual adaption with highly localized modulation and over 98.2% recognition accuracy. By manipulating the charge dynamics of the trapping centers, organic transistors can operate below 1&#160;V with record high on/off ratio close to 108 and sharp switching of a subthreshold swing of 59.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Neuromorphic visual systems can emulate biological retinal systems to perceive visual information under different levels of illumination, making them have considerable potential for future intelligent vehicles and vision automation. However, the complex circuits and high operating voltages of conventional artificial vision systems present great challenges for device integration and power consumption. Here, bioinspired synaptic transistors based on organic single crystal phototransistors are reported, which exhibit excitation and inhibition synaptic plasticity with time&#8208;varying. By manipulating the charge dynamics of the trapping centers of organic crystal&#8211;electret vertical stacks, organic transistors can operate below 1&#160;V with record high on/off ratios close to 108 and sharp switching with a subthreshold swing of 59.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. Moreover, the approach offers visual adaptation with highly localized modulation and over 98.2% recognition accuracy under different illumination levels. These bioinspired visual adaptation transistors offer great potential for simplifying the circuitry of artificial vision systems and will contribute to the development of machine vision applications.

         <title>3D Nanoprinting of Heterogeneous Metal Oxides with High Shape Fidelity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a 3D nanoprinting method for various metal oxides with high shape fidelity. This method enables 3D nanoprinting and heterogeneous integration of metal oxides with water&#8208;soluble precursor salts, addressing issues of limited material applicability, serious&#160;shape distortion, and challenges of heterogeneous integration in the field of metal oxide 3D microfabrication.








Abstract
3D nanoprinting can significantly enhance the performance of sensors, batteries, optoelectronic/microelectronic devices, etc. However, current 3D nanoprinting methods for metal oxides are suffering from three key issues including limited material applicability, serious shape distortion, and the difficulty of heterogeneous integration. This paper discovers a mechanism in which imidazole and acrylic acid synergistically coordinate with metal ions in water. Using the mechanism, this work develops a series of metal ion synergistic coordination water&#8208;soluble (MISCWS) resins for 3D nanoprinting of various metal oxides, including MnO2, Cr2O3, Co3O4, and ZnO, as well as heterogeneous structures of MnO2/NiO, Cr2O3/Al2O3, and ZnO/MgO. Besides, the synergistic coordination effect results in a 2.54&#8208;fold increase in inorganic mass fraction within the polymer, compared with previous works, which effectively mitigates the shape distortion of metal oxide microstructures. Based on this method, this work also demonstrates a 3D ZnO microsensor with a high sensitivity (1.113 million at 200&#160;ppm NO2), surpassing the conventional 2D ZnO sensors by tenfold. The method yields high&#8208;fidelity 3D structures of heterogeneous metal oxides with nanoscale resolution, paving the way for applications such as sensing, micro&#8208;optics, energy storage, and microsystems.

         <title>Interface Design beyond Epitaxy: Oxide Heterostructures Comprising Symmetry&#8208;Forbidden Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work showcases a breakthrough in fabricating atomically sharp interfaces between 3D oxide materials with completely different crystal lattice symmetries. These interfaces show a hitherto unknown interfacial reconstruction dictated by the moir&#233; patterns provided by abutting crystals of different symmetries. This novel category of interfaces between 3D materials vastly expands the space of interfaces available for research and applications.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth of thin&#8208;film heterostructures is generally considered the most successful procedure to obtain interfaces of excellent structural and electronic quality between 3D materials. However, these interfaces can only join material systems with crystal lattices of matching symmetries and lattice constants. This article presents a novel category of interfaces, the fabrication of which is membrane&#8208;based and does not require epitaxial growth. These interfaces therefore overcome the limitations imposed by epitaxy. Leveraging the additional degrees of freedom gained, atomically clean interfaces are demonstrated between threefold symmetric sapphire and fourfold symmetric SrTiO3. Atomic&#8208;resolution imaging reveals structurally well&#8208;defined interfaces with a novel moir&#233;&#8208;type reconstruction.

An artificial intelligence agent for enhancing organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) performance by combining generative pre&#8208;trained transformer 4 (GPT&#8208;4) with advanced machine learning algorithms is presented. It efficiently extracts OFET experimental data from extensive literature and gives intelligent suggestions for OFET fabrication. This work showcases the application of large language models in organic optoelectronics, enhancing the development process in this field.









Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention recently, however, their application in specialized scientific fields still requires deep adaptation. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent for organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) is designed by integrating the generative pre&#8208;trained transformer 4 (GPT&#8208;4)&#160;model with well&#8208;trained machine learning (ML) algorithms. It can efficiently extract the experimental parameters of OFETs from scientific literature and reshape them into a structured database, achieving precision and recall rates both exceeding 92%. Combined with well&#8208;trained ML models, this AI agent can further provide targeted guidance and suggestions for device design. With prompt engineering and human&#8208;in&#8208;loop strategies, the agent extracts sufficient information of 709 OFETs from 277 research articles across different publishers and gathers them into a standardized database containing more than 10&#160;000 device parameters. Using this database, a ML model based on Extreme Gradient Boosting is trained for device performance judgment. Combined with the interpretation of the high&#8208;precision model, the agent has provided a feasible optimization scheme that has tripled the charge transport properties of 2,6&#8208;diphenyldithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene OFETs. This work is an effective practice of LLMs in the field of organic optoelectronic devices and expands the research paradigm of organic optoelectronic materials and devices.

         <title>Bioinspired Adaptive Microdrugs Enhance the Chemotherapy of Malignant Glioma: Beyond Their Nanodrugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired adaptive microdrugs can efficiently cross blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier when endowed with good adaptive deformation capacity. Different from the traditional concept, these adaptive microdrugs are more efficient than their nanodrugs in bringing drugs into the glioblastoma tissues, allowing efficient accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization, thus greatly enhancing the antitumor efficacy of malignant glioma.








Abstract
Solid nanoparticle&#8208;mediated drug delivery systems are usually confined to nanoscale due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect. However, they remain a great challenge for malignant glioma chemotherapy because of poor drug delivery efficiency and insufficient tumor penetration resulting from the blood&#8211;brain barrier/blood&#8211;brain tumor barrier (BBB/BBTB). Inspired by biological microparticles (e.g., cells) with excellent adaptive deformation, it is demonstrated that the adaptive microdrugs (even up to 3.0&#160;&#181;m in size) are more efficient than their nanodrugs (less than 200&#160;nm in size) to cross BBB/BBTB and penetrate into tumor tissues, achieving highly efficient chemotherapy of malignant glioma. The distinct delivery of the adaptive microdrugs is mainly attributed to the enhanced interfacial binding and endocytosis via adaptive deformation. As expected, the obtained adaptive microdrugs exhibit enhanced accumulation, deep penetration, and cellular internalization into tumor tissues in comparison with nanodrugs, significantly improving the survival rate of glioblastoma mice. It is believed that the bioinspired adaptive microdrugs enable them to efficiently cross physiological barriers and deeply penetrate tumor tissues for drug delivery, providing an avenue for the treatment of solid tumors.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Transition Metal Phosphorus Trichalcogenides for Rapid Sodium Ion Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The entropy&#8208;induced strain soliton boundaries (SSBs) and aperiodic stacking together with corresponding electric field distribution within FeMnNiVZnPS3 are atomically resolved. The correlation of such unique atomic/electronic structures and the sodium ion diffusion dynamics inside high&#8208;entropy FeMnNiVZnPS3 is established. These insights are expected to be extended to a wide range of high&#8208;entropy systems.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy strategies are regarded as a powerful means to enhance performance in energy storage fields. The improved properties are invariably ascribed to entropy stabilization or synergistic cocktail effect. Therefore, the manifested properties in such multicomponent materials are usually unpredictable. Elucidating the precise correlations between atomic structures and properties remains a challenge in high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs). Herein, atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy annular dark field (STEM&#8208;ADF) imaging and four dimensions (4D)&#8208;STEM are combined to directly visualize atomic&#8208;scale structural and electric information in high&#8208;entropy FeMnNiVZnPS3. Aperiodic stacking is found in FeMnNiVZnPS3 accompanied by high&#8208;density strain soliton boundaries (SSBs). Theoretical calculation suggests that the formation of such structures is attributed to the imbalanced stress of distinct metal&#8208;sulfur bonds in FeMnNiVZnPS3. Interestingly, the electric field concentrates along the two sides of SSBs and gradually diminishes toward the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) plane to generate a unique electric field gradient, strongly promoting the ion&#8208;diffusion rate. Accordingly, high&#8208;entropy FeMnNiVZnPS3 demonstrates superior ion&#8208;diffusion coefficients of 10&#8722;9.7&#8208;10&#8722;8.3 cm2 s&#8722;1 and high&#8208;rate performance (311.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 A g&#8722;1). This work provides an alternative way for the atomic&#8208;scale understanding and design of sophisticated HEMs, paving the way for property engineering in multi&#8208;component materials.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Solvating Electrolyte Enables Mechanically Stable and Inorganic&#8208;Rich Cathode Electrolyte Interphase for High&#8208;Performing Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries are promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries but limited by the sophisticated interfacial chemistry at the cathode/electrolyte interface. Herein, an electrolyte design strategy is proposed with the optimized coordination environment to form an ultrathin and mechanically stable cathode electrolyte interphase, which is beneficial to the electrochemical performance of potassium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) is crucial for the reversibility of rechargeable batteries, yet receives less attention compared to solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI). The prevalent weakly&#8208;solvating electrolyte is usually proposed from the standing point of obtaining robust SEI, however, the resultant weak ion&#8208;solvent interaction gives rise to excessive free solvents and forms thick CEI with high kinetic barriers, which is disadvantageous for interfacial stability at the high working voltage. Herein, a highly&#8208;solvating electrolyte is reported to immobilize free solvents by generating stable ternary complexes and facilitate the growth of homogeneous and ultrathin CEI to boost the electrochemical performances of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs). Through time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, It is revealed that the deliberately coordinated complexes are the key to forming mechanically stable and inorganic&#8208;rich CEI with superior diffusion kinetics for high&#8208;performing PIBs. Coupling with a K0.5MnO2 cathode and a soft carbon (SC) anode, a high energy density (202.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1) is achieved with an exceptional cycle lifespan (92.5% capacity retention after 500 cycles) in a SC||K0.5MnO2 full cell, setting new performance benchmarks for PIBs.

         <title>Targeted SERS Imaging and Intraoperative Real&#8208;Time Elimination of Microscopic Tumors for Improved Breast&#8208;Conserving Surgery</title>

A surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) surgical strategy is reported for guiding the breast&#8208;conserving surgery and intraoperative real&#8208;time elimination of microscopic tumor foci in a HER2+ breast tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model. This strategy is demonstrated with remarkable outcome improvement of the breast&#8208;conserving surgery without local recurrence and delivers a 100% tumor&#8208;free survival after the treatment with the SERS surgical strategy.








Abstract
Breast&#8208;conserving surgery is the favorable option for breast cancer patients owing to its advantages of less aggressiveness and better cosmetic outcomes over mastectomy. However, it often suffers from postsurgical lethal recurrence due to the incomplete removal of microscopic tumors. Here, a surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) surgical strategy is reported for precise delineation of tumor margins and intraoperative real&#8208;time elimination of microscopic tumor foci, which is capable of complete surgical removal of breast tumors and significantly improve the outcomes of breast&#8208;conserving surgery without local tumor recurrence. The technique is chiefly based on the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeting SERS probes with integrated multifunctionalities of ultrahigh sensitive detection, significant HER2 expression suppression, cell proliferation inhibition, and superior photothermal ablation. In a HER2+ breast tumor mouse model, the remarkable capability of the SERS surgical strategy for complete removal of HER2+ breast tumors through SERS&#8208;guided surgical resection and intraoperative real&#8208;time photothermal elimination is demonstrated. The results show complete eradiation of HER2+ breast tumors without local recurrence, consequently delivering a 100% tumor&#8208;free survival. Expectedly, this SERS surgical strategy holds great promise for clinical treatment of HER2+ breast cancer with improved patients&#8217; survival.

         <title>Mechanochemically Robust LiCoO2 with Ultrahigh Capacity and Prolonged Cyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance LCO&#160;cathode is developed with a gradient disordering structure design, enabling it to reach the capacity limit (up to 93% of Li utilization) while maintaining high cyclability and rate capability. Comprehensive analysis reveals this innovative structure fundamentally addresses the anisotropic lattice strain issue and exhibits remarkable fatigue resistance, even under harsh operating voltages.








Abstract
Pushing intercalation&#8208;type cathode materials to their theoretical capacity often suffers from fragile Li&#8208;deficient frameworks and severe lattice strain, leading to mechanical failure issues within the crystal structure and fast capacity fading. This is particularly pronounced in layered oxide cathodes because the intrinsic nature of their structures is susceptible to structural degradation with excessive Li extraction, which remains unsolved yet despite attempts involving elemental doping and surface coating strategies. Herein, a mechanochemical strengthening strategy is developed through a gradient disordering structure to address these challenges and push the LiCoO2 (LCO) layered cathode approaching the capacity limit (256&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, up to 93% of Li utilization). This innovative approach also demonstrates exceptional cyclability and rate capability, as validated in practical Ah&#8208;level pouch full cells, surpassing the current performance benchmarks. Comprehensive characterizations with multiscale X&#8208;ray, electron diffraction, and imaging techniques unveil that the gradient disordering structure notably diminishes the anisotropic lattice strain and exhibits high fatigue resistance, even under extreme delithiation states and harsh operating voltages. Consequently, this designed LCO cathode impedes the growth and propagation of particle cracks, and mitigates irreversible phase transitions. This work sheds light on promising directions toward next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery materials through structural chemistry design.

         <title>A Thermo&#8208;Responsive MOFs for X&#8208;Ray Scintillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy toward designing thermo&#8208;responsive scintillators based on lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) is developed through integrating various radio&#8208;luminescent functional building units and utilizing the energy transfer reasonably. The resulting ratiometric X&#8208;ray excited luminescent thermometer with the self&#8208;calibration function, high sensitivity, excellent luminescence stability, and visible temperature response, is reported for the first time.








Abstract
Thermo&#8208;responsive smart materials have aroused extensive interest due to the particular significance of temperature sensing. Although various photoluminescent materials are explored in thermal detection, it is not applicable enough in X&#8208;ray radiation environment where the accuracy and reliability will be influenced. Here, a strategy is proposed by introducing the concept of radio&#8208;luminescent functional building units (RBUs) to construct thermo&#8208;responsive lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) scintillators for self&#8208;calibrating thermometry. The rational designs of RBUs (including organic ligand and Tb3+/Eu3+) with appropriate energy levels lead to high&#8208;performance radio&#8208;luminescence. Ln&#8208;MOFs scintillators exhibit perfect linear response to X&#8208;ray, presenting low dose rate detection limit (min &#8776;156.1 nGyairs&#8208;1). Self&#8208;calibrating detection based on ratiometric XEL intensities is achieved with good absolute and relative sensitivities of 6.74 and 8.1%K&#8208;1, respectively. High relative light yield (max &#8776;39000 photons MeV&#8722;1), imaging spatial resolution (max &#8776;18 lp&#160;mm&#8208;1), irradiation stability (intensity &#8776;100% at 368 K in total dose up to 215 Gyair), and giant color transformation visualization benefit the applications, especially the in situ thermo&#8208;responsive X&#8208;ray imaging. Such strategy provides a promising way to develop the novel smart photonic materials with excellent scintillator performances.

         <title>An Equalized Flow Velocity Strategy for Perovskite Colloidal Particles in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecular encapsulation structure is form colloidal particles and glycerol monostearate in perovskite precursor inks ensuring their consistent response to shear forces. The uniform size of colloidal particles ensures consistent solute deposition during the printing process. The flexible perovskite solar cells achieve a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 24.45% (1.01 cm2) and 15.87% (100 cm2) with minor efficiency discrepancy.








Abstract
The non&#8208;uniform distribution of colloidal particles in perovskite precursor results in an imbalanced response to the shear force during flexible printing process. Herein, it is observed that the continuous disordered migration occurring in perovskite inks significantly contributes to the enlargement of colloidal particles size and diminishes the crystallization activity of the inks. Therefore, a molecular encapsulation architecture by glycerol monostearate to mitigate colloidal particles collisions in the precursor ink, while simultaneously homogenizing the size distribution of perovskite colloids to minimize their diffusion disparities, is devised. The utilization of colloidal particles with a molecular encapsulation structure enables the achievement of uniform deposition during the printing process, thereby effectively balancing the crystallization rate and phase transition in the film and facilitating homogeneous crystallization of perovskite films. The large&#8208;area flexible perovskite device (1.01 cm2 and 100 cm2) fabricated through printing processes, achieves an efficiency of 24.45% and 15.87%, respectively, and manifests superior environmental stability, maintaining an initial efficiency of 91% after being stored in atmospheric ambiences for 150 days (unencapsulated). This work demonstrates that the dynamic evolution process of colloidal particles in both the precursor ink and printing process represents a crucial stride toward achieving uniform crystallization of perovskite films.

         <title>Invoking Interfacial Engineering Boosts Structural Stability Empowering Exceptional Cyclability of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Se&#8208;NCM811//FeSe2//Fe2O3 self&#8208;assembled electric field activates and improves interfacial charge transfer and coupling. Furthermore, Se2&#8722; selectively adsorbs within oxygen vacancies to form O&#9472;TM&#9472;Se bonds, while FeSe2 reacts with oxygen to form Fe2O3 and SeO2. The Fe2O3 coating mitigates hydrofluoric acid erosion and acts as an electrostatic shield layer, effectively stabilizing lattice oxygen and suppressing structural distortion.








Abstract
The cycling stability of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 under high voltages is hindered by the occurrence of hybrid anion&#8208; and cation&#8208;redox processes, leading to oxygen escape and uncontrolled phase collapse. In this study, an interfacial engineering strategy involving a straightforward mechanical ball milling and low&#8208;temperature calcination, employing a Se&#8208;doped and FeSe2&amp;Fe2O3&#8208;modified approach is proposed to design a stable Ni&#8208;rich cathode. Se2&#8722; are selectively adsorbed within oxygen vacancies to form O&#9472;TM&#9472;Se bond, effectively stabilizing lattice oxygen, and preventing structural distortion. Simultaneously, the Se&#8208;NCM811//FeSe2//Fe2O3 self&#8208;assembled electric field is activated, improving interfacial charge transfer and coupling. Furthermore, FeSe2 accelerates Li+ diffusion and reacts with oxygen to form Fe2O3 and SeO2. The Fe2O3 coating mitigates hydrofluoric acid erosion and acts as an electrostatic shield layer, limiting the outward migration of oxygen anions. Impressively, the modified materials exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance, with a capacity retention of 79.7% after 500 cycles at 1C under 4.5&#160;V. Furthermore, it provides an extraordinary capacity retention of 94.6% in 3&#8211;4.25&#160;V after 550 cycles in pouch&#8208;type full battery. This dual&#8208;modification approach demonstrates its feasibility and opens new perspective for the development of stable lithium&#8208;ion batteries operating at high voltages.

         <title>Porous Polypyrrolidines for Highly Efficient Recovery of Precious Metals through Reductive Adsorption Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly porous poly&#8208;pyrrolidines (e.g. BIT&#8208;POP&#8208;17) with isolated alkene linkers can recover precious metal ions such as Au3+ very efficiently. The high adsorption capacity toward Au3+ exceeds the theoretical values, as a reductive adsorption mechanism works through the synergistic interplay of redox&#8208;active N&#8208;phenyl&#8208;pyrrolidine subunit and flexible porous backbone with hierarchical pores.








Abstract
The recycling and utilization of precious metals have emerged as a critical research focus in advancing the development of the circular economy. Among numerous methods for recovering precious metals such as gold, adsorbents with both high adsorption selectivity and capacity have become key technologies. This article incorporated the N&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine into a flexible porous polynorbornene backbone to create a class of distinctive porous organic polymers, named BIT&#8208;POP&#8208;14&#8211;BIT&#8208;POP&#8208;17. Through a reductive capture mechanism, the reductive adsorption sites of N&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine coordinate selectively with precious metals, the reduced metal is captured by the hierarchically porous polymers with flexible backbone. This approach leads to remarkable gold recovery efficiency, achieving a record of 2321&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 at ambient conditions, and 3020&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 under UV light, surpassing the theoretical limit. The porous polymers are filled in a column for a continuous uptake of gold from waste printed circuit boards (PCBs), showing recovery efficiency toward gold as high as 95% after 84&#160;h. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on designing novel adsorbents for precious metal recovery, providing inspiration for researchers to explore novel adsorption modes and contribute to the advancement of the circular economy.

         <title>Ultrafast Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembly toward Bioderived Polyester COF Membranes with Microstructure Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strengthening monomer transfer and constructing perfect membrane via positive electrostatic field strategy are presented. A positive electrostatic field strategy arises from the flying behavior of spiders in nature. Spiders can fly because negatively charged spider silk is attracted to the positive charge of ionosphere. A positive electrostatic field is constructed, as it is hoped that monomers can &#8220;fly&#8221; like spiders.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of the microstructure (pore size, free volume distribution, and connectivity of the free&#8208;volume elements), thickness, and mechanical characteristics of membranes holds paramount significance in facilitating the effective utilization of self&#8208;standing membranes. In this contribution, the synthesis of two innovative ester&#8208;linked covalent&#8211;organic framework (COF) membranes is first reported, which are generated through the selection of plant&#8208;derived ellagic acid and quercetin phenolic monomers in conjunction with terephthaloyl chloride as a building block. The optimization of the microstructure of these two COF membranes is systematically achieved through the application of three different interfacial electric field systems: electric neutrality, positive electricity, and negative electricity. It is observed that the positively charged system facilitates a record increase in the rate of membrane formation, resulting in a denser membrane with a uniform pore size and enhanced flexibility. In addition, a correlation is identified wherein an increase in the alkyl chain length of the surfactants leads to a more uniform pore size and a decrease in the molecular weight cutoff of the COF membrane. The resulting COF membrane exhibits an unprecedented combination of high water permeance, superior sieving capability, robust mechanical strength, chemical robustness for promising membrane&#8208;based separation science and technology.

         <title>Coupling Antisite Defect and Lattice Tensile Stimulates Facile Isotropic Li&#8208;Ion Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs ultrafast nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature shock technology to controllably introduce Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects and lattice strain into the lattice of LiFePO4. The unique multiscale coupling structure promotes isotropic 2D interchannel Li+ hopping, leading to excellent fast charging performance and cycling stability. The new mechanism of Li+ diffusion kinetics accelerated by multiscale coupling can guide the design of high&#8208;rate electrodes.








Abstract
Despite widely used as a commercial cathode, the anisotropic 1D channel hopping of lithium ions along the [010] direction in LiFePO4 prevents its application in fast charging conditions. Herein, an ultrafast nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature shock technology is employed to controllably introduce the Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects and tensile strain into the lattice of LiFePO4. This design makes the study of the effect of the strain field on the performance further extended from the theoretical calculation to the experimental perspective. The existence of Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects makes it feasible for Li+ to move from the 4a site of the edge&#8208;sharing octahedra across the ab plane to 4c site of corner&#8208;sharing octahedra, producing a new diffusion channel different from [010]. Meanwhile, the presence of a tensile strain field reduces the energy barrier of the new 2D diffusion path. In the combination of electrochemical experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations, the unique multiscale coupling structure of Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects and lattice strain promotes isotropic 2D interchannel Li+ hopping, leading to excellent fast charging performance and cycling stability (high&#8208;capacity retention of 84.4% after 2000 cycles at 10 C). The new mechanism of Li+ diffusion kinetics accelerated by multiscale coupling can guide the design of high&#8208;rate electrodes.

         <title>Multiphase Symbiotic Engineered Elastic Ceramic&#8208;Carbon Aerogels with Advanced Thermal Protection in Extreme Oxidative Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiphase sequence and multiscale structural engineering strategy is proposed to obtain elastic mullite&#8208;carbon hybrid nanofibrous aerogels, achieving extraordinary thermomechanical stability up to 1600&#160;&#176;C in oxidative environments and low thermal conductivity (50.58&#160;mW m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at 300 &#176;C). This innovation provides a new thermal protection material system for future space exploration.








Abstract
Elastic aerogels can dissipate aerodynamic forces and thermal stresses by reversible slipping or deforming to avoid sudden failure caused by stress concentration, making them the most promising candidates for thermal protection in aerospace applications. However, existing elastic aerogels face difficulties achieving reliable protection above 1500&#160;&#176;C in aerobic environments due to their poor thermomechanical stability and significantly increased thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures. Here, a multiphase sequence and multiscale structural engineering strategy is proposed to synthesize mullite&#8208;carbon hybrid nanofibrous aerogels. The heterogeneous symbiotic effect between components simultaneously inhibits ceramic crystalline coarsening and carbon thermal etching, thus ensuring the thermal stability of the nanofiber building blocks. Efficient load transfer and high interfacial thermal resistance at crystalline&#8208;amorphous phase boundaries on the microscopic scale, coupled with mesoscale lamellar cellular and locally closed&#8208;pore structures, achieve rapid stress dissipation and thermal energy attenuation in aerogels. This robust thermal protection material system is compatible with ultralight density (30&#160;mg cm&#8211;3), reversible compression strain of 60%, extraordinary thermomechanical stability (up to 1600&#160;&#176;C in oxidative environments), and ultralow thermal conductivity (50.58&#160;mW m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at 300 &#176;C), offering new options and possibilities to cope with the harsh operating environments faced by space exploration.

         <title>Efficient and Robust Dynamic Crosslinking for Compatibilizing Immiscible Mixed Plastics through In Situ Generated Singlet Nitrenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bis&#8208;aromatic sulfonyl azide crosslinkers decompose at typical polymer melt&#8208;processing temperatures, forming reactive singlet nitrene intermediates for dynamic covalent crosslinking via direct C&#9472;H insertion. This solvent&#8208;free, melt&#8208;extrusion process efficiently installs dynamic siloxane crosslinks in polymer blends, reducing phase separation and enhancing mechanical performance, providing a robust and practical method for compatibilizing mixed plastics.








Abstract
Creating a sustainable economy for plastics demands the exploration of new strategies for efficient management of mixed plastic waste. The inherent incompatibility of different plastics poses a major challenge in plastic mechanical recycling, resulting in phase&#8208;separated materials with inferior mechanical properties. Here, this study presents a robust and efficient dynamic crosslinking chemistry that effectively compatibilizes mixed plastics. Composed of aromatic sulfonyl azides, the dynamic crosslinker shows high thermal stability and generates singlet nitrene species in situ during solvent&#8208;free melt&#8208;extrusion, effectively promoting C&#9472;H insertion across diverse plastics. This new method demonstrates successful compatibilization of binary polymer blends and model mixed plastics, enhancing mechanical performance and improving phase morphology. It holds promise for managing mixed plastic waste, supporting a more sustainable lifecycle for plastics.

         <title>Flat&#8208;Knit, Flexible, Textile Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a lightweight, flexible metasurface platform based on flat&#8208;knit textiles and operating in the cm&#8208;wave spectral range. By using a colorwork knitting approach called float&#8208;jacquard knitting to directly integrate an array of resonant metallic antennas into a textile, two textile devices are realized, a metasurface lens and a metasurface vortex&#8208;beam generator.








Abstract
Lightweight, low&#8208;cost metasurfaces and reflectarrays that are easy to stow and deploy are desirable for many terrestrial and space&#8208;based communications and sensing applications. This work demonstrates a lightweight, flexible metasurface platform based on flat&#8208;knit textiles operating in the cm&#8208;wave spectral range. By using a colorwork knitting approach called float&#8208;jacquard knitting to directly integrate an array of resonant metallic antennas into a textile, two textile reflectarray devices, a metasurface lens (metalens), and a vortex&#8208;beam generator are realized. Operating as a receiving antenna, the metalens focuses a collimated normal&#8208;incidence beam to a diffraction&#8208;limited, off&#8208;broadside focal spot. Operating as a transmitting antenna, the metalens converts the divergent emission from a horn antenna into a collimated beam with peak measured directivity, gain, and efficiency of 21.30, 15.30, and &#8722;6.00 dB (25.12%), respectively. The vortex&#8208;beam generating metasurface produces a focused vortex beam with a topological charge of m&#160;=&#160;1 over a wide frequency range of 4.1&#8211;5.8&#160;GHz. Strong specular reflection is observed for the textile reflectarrays, caused by wavy yarn floats on the backside of the float&#8208;jacquard textiles. This work demonstrates a novel approach for the scalable production of flexible metasurfaces by leveraging commercially available yarns and well&#8208;established knitting machinery and techniques.

         <title>Implanted Carbon Nanotubes Harvest Electrical Energy from Heartbeat for Medical Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel &#8220;Twistron energy cell harvester&#8221; (TECH), consisting of coiled carbon nanotube yarn, produces electrical energy from mechanical contraction. The TECH device is applied to an artificial heartbeat system and in a second step to a porcine heart and is able continuously generated electrical energy from cardiac contraction. This energy can potentially be used for medical implants.








Abstract
Reliability of power supply for current implantable electronic devices is a critical issue for longevity and for reducing the risk of device failure. Energy harvesting is an emerging technology, representing a strategy for establishing autonomous power supply by utilizing biomechanical movements in human body. Here, a novel &#8220;Twistron energy cell harvester&#8221; (TECH), consisting of coiled carbon nanotube yarn that converts mechanical energy of the beating heart into electrical energy, is presented. The performance of TECH is evaluated in an in vitro artificial heartbeat system which simulates the deformation pattern of the cardiac surface, reaching a maximum peak power of 1.42&#160;W kg&#8722;1 and average power of 0.39&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 60 beats per minute. In vivo implantation of TECH onto the left ventricular surface in a porcine model continuously generates electrical energy from cardiac contraction. The generated electrical energy is used for direct pacing of the heart as documented by extensive electrophysiology mapping. Implanted modified carbon nanotubes are applicable as a source for harvesting biomechanical energy from cardiac motion for power supply or cardiac pacing.

         <title>Enhanced Ocular Delivery of Beva via Ultra&#8208;Small Polymeric Micelles for Noninvasive Anti&#8208;VEGF Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small polymeric micelles are developed for noninvasive delivery of Beva to treat oxygen&#8208;induced retinal (OIR) neovascularization model in mice. It can penetrate through the cornea and sclera&#8208;conjunctiva&#8208;choroid to reach the retina, producing the same therapeutic effect as intravitreal injection. This innovative protein nanocarrier platform offers a potential alternative to invasive intravitreal injections, improving patient experience and outcomes.








Abstract
Pathological ocular neovascularization resulting from retinal ischemia constitutes a major cause of vision loss. Current anti&#8208;VEGF therapies rely on burdensome intravitreal injections of Bevacizumab (Beva). Herein ultrasmall polymeric micelles encapsulating Beva (P@Beva) are developed for noninvasive topical delivery to posterior eye tissues. Beva is efficiently loaded into 11&#160;nm micelles fabricated via self&#8208;assembly of hyperbranched amphiphilic copolymers. The neutral, brush&#8208;like micelles demonstrate excellent drug encapsulation and colloidal stability. In vitro, P@Beva enhances intracellular delivery of Beva in ocular cells versus free drug. Ex vivo corneal and conjunctival&#8208;sclera&#8208;choroidal tissues transport after eye drops are improved 23&#8208;fold and 7.9&#8208;fold, respectively. Anti&#8208;angiogenic bioactivity is retained with P@Beva eliciting greater inhibition of endothelial tube formation and choroid sprouting over Beva alone. Remarkably, in an oxygen&#8208;induced retinopathy (OIR) model, topical P@Beva matching efficacy of intravitreal Beva injection, is the clinical standard. Comprehensive biocompatibility verifies safety. Overall, this pioneering protein delivery platform holds promise to shift paradigms from invasive intravitreal injections toward simplified, noninvasive administration of biotherapeutics targeting posterior eye diseases.

         <title>An Engineered Nanoplatform with Tropism Toward Irradiated Glioblastoma Augments Its Radioimmunotherapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To meet the challenges of inadequate efficacy and severe immune&#8208;related adverse events in immune checkpoint blockade therapy of glioblastomas, a biomimetic nanoplatform that combines radiation&#8208;mediated tropism and radiosensitization is tailored to deliver immune checkpoint blockers with radiation&#8208;responsive release. The current study provides a promising strategy for high&#8208;efficient and low&#8208;toxic radio&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Combining radiotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade therapy offers a promising approach to treat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), yet challenges such as limited effectiveness and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) persist. These issues are largely due to the failure in targeting immunomodulators directly to the tumor microenvironment. To address this, a biomimetic nanoplatform that combines a genetically modified mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) membrane with a bioactive nanoparticle core for chemokine&#8208;directed radioimmunotherapy of GBM is developed. The CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)&#8208;overexpressing MSC membrane acts as a tactical tentacle to achieve radiation&#8208;induced tropism toward the abundant chemokine (CC motif)&#160;ligand 2 (CCL2) in irradiated gliomas. The nanoparticle core, comprising diselenide&#8208;bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and PD&#8208;L1 antibodies (&#945;PD&#8208;L1), enables X&#8208;ray&#8208;responsive drug release and radiosensitization. In two murine models with orthotopic GBM tumors, this nanoplatform reinvigorated immunogenic cell death, and augmented the efficacy and specificity of GBM radioimmunotherapy, with reduced occurrence of irAEs. This study suggests a promising radiation&#8208;induced tropism strategy for targeted drug delivery, and presents a potent nanoplatform that enhances the efficacy and safety of radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Injectable 2D Material&#8208;Based Sensor Array for Minimally Invasive Neural Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene and MoS2&#8208;based implantable multi&#8208;modal sensor array is developed, presenting a minimally invasive implantation process for neural monitoring apparatus. The sensor array is injected via syringe and air pressure through a small hole in the skull and spreads out to conformally cover the cortical surface. The sensors detect epileptic discharges and monitor intracranial temperature and pressure.








Abstract
Intracranial implants for diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases have been developed over the past few decades. However, the platform of conventional implantable devices still relies on invasive probes and bulky sensors in conjunction with large&#8208;area craniotomy and provides only limited biometric information. Here, an implantable multi&#8208;modal sensor array that can be injected through a small hole in the skull and inherently spread out for conformal contact with the cortical surface is reported. The injectable sensor array, composed of graphene multi&#8208;channel electrodes for neural recording and electrical stimulation and MoS2&#8208;based sensors for monitoring intracranial temperature and pressure, is designed based on a mesh structure whose elastic&#160;restoring&#160;force enables the contracted device to spread out. It is demonstrated that the sensor array injected into a rabbit's head can detect epileptic discharges on the surface of the cortex and mitigate it by electrical stimulation while monitoring both intracranial temperature and pressure. This method provides&#160;good&#160;potential&#160;for implanting a variety of functional devices via minimally invasive surgery.

         <title>Vapor Deposition of Bilayer 3R MoS2 with Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, van der Waals (vdW) sliding ferroelectricity is confirmed in twisted 2D materials by artificially stack design. Here, controllable vapor deposition growth of bilayer 3R MoS2 is achieved. The ferroelectricity of as&#8208;grown bilayer 3R MoS2 is investigated via in situ atomic force probe technique. This work can be a big step toward industrial applications of 2D vdW ferroelectric memory.









Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional ultrathin ferroelectrics have attracted much interest due to their potential application in high&#8208;density integration of non&#8208;volatile memory devices. Recently, 2D van der Waals ferroelectric based on interlayer translation has been reported in twisted bilayer h&#8208;BN and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, sliding ferroelectricity is not well studied in non&#8208;twisted homo&#8208;bilayer TMD grown directly by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this paper, for the first time, experimental observation of a room&#8208;temperature out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric switch in semiconducting bilayer 3R MoS2 synthesized by reverse&#8208;flow CVD is reported. Piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) hysteretic loops and first principle calculations demonstrate that the ferroelectric nature and polarization switching processes are based on interlayer sliding. The vertical Au/3R MoS2/Pt device exhibits a switchable diode effect. Polarization modulated Schottky barrier height and polarization coupling of interfacial deep states trapping/detrapping may serve in coordination to determine switchable diode effect. The room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity of CVD&#8208;grown MoS2 will proceed with the potential wafer&#8208;scale integration of 2D TMDs in the logic circuit.

         <title>Ceramic Meta&#8208;Aerogel with Thermal Superinsulation up to 1700&#160;&#176;C Constructed by Self&#8208;Crosslinked Nanofibrous Network via Reaction Electrospinning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;free reaction electrospinning strategy is proposed to prepare a ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel constructed from a cross&#8208;linked nanofiber network, whose cold surface is only 303&#160;&#176;C in a 1700&#160;&#176;C environment, laying a basis for developing advanced oxide ceramic aerogels for reliable thermal protection in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
Thermal insulation under extreme conditions requires the materials to be capable of withstanding complex thermo&#8208;mechanical stress, significant gradient temperature transition, and high&#8208;frequency thermal shock. The excellent structural and functional properties of ceramic aerogels make them attractive for thermal insulation. However, in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments (above 1500&#160;&#176;C), they typically exhibit limited insulation capacity and thermo&#8208;mechanical stability, which may lead to catastrophic accidents, and this problem is never effectively addressed. Here, a novel ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel constructed from a crosslinked nanofiber network using a reaction electrospinning strategy, which ensures excellent thermo&#8208;mechanical stability and superinsulation under extreme conditions, is designed. The ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel has an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.027&#160;W m&#8211;1 k&#8211;1, and the cold surface temperature is only 303&#160;&#176;C in a 1700&#160;&#176;C high&#8208;temperature environment. After undergoing a significant gradient temperature transition from liquid nitrogen to 1700&#160;&#176;C flame burning, the ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel can still withstand thousands of shears, flexures, compressions, and other complex forms of mechanical action without structural collapse. This work provides a new insight for developing ceramic aerogels that can be used for a long period in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Stem Cell&#8208;Derived Nanovesicles Embedded in Dual&#8208;Layered Hydrogel for Programmed ROS Regulation and Comprehensive Tissue Regeneration in Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanovesicle embedded programable dual&#8208;layered hydrogel is designed for burn wound tissue repair. The inner layer hydrogel first responsively delivers aggregation&#8208;induced emission functionalized stem cell nanovesicles to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for antibiosis. Then, the tissue regeneration can be enhanced consequently though ROS elimination of outer layer hydrogel as well as the nutrients supply and tissue mobilizing effects of stem cell nanovesicles.








Abstract
Burn wounds often bring high risks of delayed healing process and even death. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in burn wound repair. However, the dynamic process in wound healing requires both the generation of ROS to inhibit bacteria and the subsequent reduction of ROS levels to initiate and promote tissue regeneration, which calls for a more intelligent ROS regulation dressing system. Hence, a dual&#8208;layered hydrogel (Dual&#8208;Gel) tailored to the process of burn wound repair is designed: the inner layer hydrogel (Gel 2) first responds to bacterial hyaluronidase (Hyal) to deliver aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer functionalized adipose&#8208;derived stem cell nanovesicles, which generate ROS upon light irradiation to eliminate bacteria; then the outer layer hydrogel (Gel 1) continuously starts a long&#8208;lasting consumption of excess ROS at the wound site to accelerate tissue regeneration. Simultaneously, the stem cell nanovesicles trapped in the burns wound also provide nutrients and mobilize neighboring tissues to thoroughly assist in inflammation regulation, cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. In summary, this study develops an intelligent treatment approach on burn wounds by programmatically regulating ROS and facilitating comprehensive wound tissue repair.

         <title>Instantaneous Thermal Energy for Swift Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Unparalleled Performance in Metal&#8211;Air Batteries and Fuel Cells</title>

This research presents an innovative method, using a 2.5&#8208;min heat treatment, to create highly efficient iron single&#8208;atom catalysts supported by graphene oxide.








Abstract
Based on experimental and computational evidence, phthalocyanine (Pc) compounds in the form of quaternary&#8208;bound metal&#8208;nitrogen (N) atoms are the most effective catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the heat treatment process used in their synthesis may compromise the ideal structure, causing the agglomeration of transition metals. To overcome this issue, a novel method is developed for synthesizing iron (Fe) single&#8208;atom catalysts with ideal structures supported by thermally exfoliated graphene oxide (GO). This is achieved through a short heat treatment of only 2.5&#160;min involving FePc and N, N&#8208;dimethylformamide in the presence of GO. According to the synthesis mechanism revealed by this study, carbon monoxide acts as a strong linker between the single Fe atoms and graphene. It facilitates the formation of a structure containing oxygen species between FeN4 and graphene, which provides high activity and stability for the ORR. These catalysts possess an enormous number of active sites and exhibit enhanced activity toward the alkaline ORR. They demonstrate excellent performance when applied to real electrochemical devices, such as zinc&#8211;air batteries and anion exchange membrane fuel cells. It is expected that the instantaneous heat treatment method developed in this study will aid in the development of high&#8208;performing single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Sub&#8208;2 nm Microstrained High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Nanoparticles Boost Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of IrRhRhMoW high&#8208;entropy alloys with distinct local microstrain caused by the lattice distortion effect is reported for superior hydrogen electrocatalysis. This work demonstrates that a weakened hydrogen adsorption binding energy and enhanced hydroxyl adsorption energy on microstrain&#8208;modulated IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs catalyst collectively contribute to efficient hydrogen electrocatalytic performance in alkaline.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) confine multifarious elements into the same lattice, leading to intense lattice distortion effect. The lattice distortion tends to induce local microstrain at atomic level and thus affect surface adsorptions toward different adsorbates in various electrocatalytic reactions, yet remains unexplored. Herein, this work reports a class of sub&#8208;2&#160;nm IrRuRhMoW HEA nanoparticles (NPs) with distinct local microstrain induced by lattice distortion for boosting alkaline hydrogen oxidation (HOR) and evolution reactions (HER). This work demonstrates that the distortion&#8208;rich HEA catalysts with optimized electronic structure can downshift the d&#8208;band center and generate uncoordinated oxygen sites to enhance the surface oxophilicity. As a result, the IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs show a remarkable HOR kinetic current density of 8.09&#160;mA &#181;g&#8722;1PGM at 50&#160;mV versus RHE, 8.89, 22.47 times higher than those of IrRuRh NPs without internal strain and commercial Pt/C, respectively, which is the best value among all the reported non&#8208;Pt based catalysts. IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs also display great HER performances with a turnover frequency (TOF) value of 5.93 H2 s&#8722;1 at 70&#160;mV versus RHE, 4.6&#8208;fold higher than that of Pt/C catalyst, exceeding most noble metal&#8208;based catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical studies collectively confirm that weakened hydrogen (Had) and enhanced hydroxyl (OHad) adsorption are achieved by simultaneously modulating the hydrogen adsorption binding energy and surface oxophilicity originated from intensified ligand effect and microstrain effect over IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs, which guarantees the remarkable performances toward HOR/HER.

         <title>In Vivo Polymer Mechanochemistry with Polynucleotides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a mechanochemically&#8208;responsive polynucleotide platform that leverages medical imaging ultrasound for the binding and release of therapeutic oligonucleotides and small molecules. It demonstrates that high molar mass, colloidal assembly and distinct mechanochemical mechanisms facilitate force&#8208;induced cargo release and subsequent activation of biological functions in vitro and in vivo, thereby pioneering novel mechanochemical strategies for sonopharmacology and sonogenetics applications. 








Abstract
Polymer mechanochemistry utilizes mechanical force to activate latent functionalities in macromolecules and widely relies on ultrasonication techniques. Fundamental constraints of frequency and power intensity have prohibited the application of the polymer mechanochemistry principles in a biomedical context up to now, although medical ultrasound is a clinically established modality. Here, a universal polynucleotide framework is presented that allows the binding and release of therapeutic oligonucleotides, both DNA&#8208; and RNA&#8208;based, as cargo by biocompatible medical imaging ultrasound. It is shown that the high molar mass, colloidal assembly, and a distinct mechanochemical mechanism enable the force&#8208;induced release of cargo and subsequent activation of biological function in vitro and in vivo. Thereby, this work introduces a platform for the exploration of biological questions and therapeutics development steered by mechanical force.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Drum&#8208;Type Atmospheric Water Harvester Based on Bio&#8208;Based Gels with Fast Adsorption/Desorption Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar&#8208;driven, fast moisture adsorbing and desorbing gel (cellulose/alginate/lignin gel) exhibits a water capture rate of 1.74&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (at 30% relative humidity) and a desorption rate of 1.98&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. The switching frequency of the developed drum&#8208;type harvester can be flexibly optimized to achieve the highest efficiency of atmospheric water harvesting within a brief time.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting is an attractive technology for exploiting unconventional water sources. A critical challenge is how to facilitate fast and continuous collection of potable water from air. Here, a bio&#8208;based gel (cellulose/alginate/lignin gel, CAL gel), resulting from the integration of a whole biomass&#8208;derived polymer network with lithium chloride is reported. A fast adsorption/desorption kinetics, with a water capture rate of 1.74&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at 30% relative humidity and a desorption rate of 1.98&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, is simultaneously realized in one piece of CAL gel, because of its strong hygroscopicity, hydrophilic network, abundant water transport channels, photothermal conversion ability, and &#8776;200&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick self&#8208;supporting bulky structure caused by multicomponent synergy. A solar&#8208;driven, drum&#8208;type, tunable, and portable harvester is designed that can harvest atmospheric water within a brief time. Under outdoor conditions, the harvester with CAL gels operates 36 switches (180&#176;) per day realizes a water yield of 8.96&#160;kg kggel&#8722;1 (18.87&#160;g kgdevice&#8722;1). This portable harvester highlights the potential for fast and scalable atmospheric water harvesting in extreme environments.

Here, a bio-based gel (cellulose/alginate/lignin gel, CAL gel), resulting from the integration of a whole biomass-derived polymer network with lithium chloride is reported. A fast adsorption/desorption kinetics, with a water capture rate of 1.74&#160;kg kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 30% relative humidity and a desorption rate of 1.98&#160;kg kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, is simultaneously realized in one piece of CAL gel, because of its strong hygroscopicity, hydrophilic network, abundant water transport channels, photothermal conversion ability, and &#8776;200-&#181;m-thick self-supporting bulky structure caused by multicomponent synergy. A solar-driven, drum-type, tunable, and portable harvester is designed that can harvest atmospheric water within a brief time. Under outdoor conditions, the harvester with CAL gels operates 36 switches (180&#176;) per day realizes a water yield of 8.96&#160;kg kg&lt;sub&gt;gel&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (18.87&#160;g kg&lt;sub&gt;device&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This portable harvester highlights the potential for fast and scalable atmospheric water harvesting in extreme environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surfactant Self&#8208;Assembly Enhances Tribopositivity of Stretchable Ionic Conductors for Wearable Energy Harvesting and Motion Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surfactant self&#8208;assembled stretchable solid&#8208;state water polyurethane (WPU), which avoids the negative impact of high salt dissociation, is developed. Compared to pristine WPU, the surfactant self&#8208;assembled WPU exhibits high ionic conductivity, relative permittivity, and tribopositivity. The fabricated device shows high electric output and can be efficiently employed in wearable electronics.








Abstract
Boosting stretchability and electric output is critical for high&#8208;performance wearable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). Herein, for the first time, a new approach for tuning the composition of surface functional groups through surfactant self&#8208;assembly to improve the tribopositivity, where the assembly increases the transferred charge density and the relative permittivity of water polyurethane (WPU). Incorporating bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8722;) and alkali metal ions into a mixture of WPU and the surfactant forms a stretchable film that simultaneously functions as positive tribolayer and electrode, preventing the conventional detachment of tribolayer and electrode in long term usage. Further, the conductivity of the crosslinked film reaches 3.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 mS cm&#8722;1 while the elongation at break reaches 362%. Moreover, the surfactant self&#8208;assembly impedes the adverse impact of the fluorine&#8208;containing groups on tribopositivity. Consequently, the charge density reaches 155 &#181;C m&#8722;2, being the highest recorded for WPU and stretchable ionic conductor based TENG. This work introduces a novel approach for boosting the output charge density while avoiding the adverse effect of ionic salts in solid conductors through a universal surfactant self&#8208;assembly strategy, which can be extended to other materials. Further, the device is used to monitor and harvest the kinetic energy of human body motion.

         <title>Synergistic Bulk and Surface Engineering for Expeditious and Durable Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells Air Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To expedite the electrocatalytic activity in the air electrodes with triple (O2&#8211;, H+, e&#8211;) conductivity, a facile approach of simultaneously optimizing the bulk metal&#8208;oxygen bonds and in situ forming metal oxide nano&#8208;catalysts on the surface is proposed, leading to accelerated surface and bulk ion generation and migration kinetics.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) offer the potential for high&#8208;efficiency power generation and green hydrogen production at intermediate temperatures. However, the commercial viability of R&#8208;PCECs is hampered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within conventional air electrodes operating at reduced temperatures. To address this challenge, this work introduces a novel approach based on the simultaneous optimization of bulk&#8208;phase metal&#8208;oxygen bonds and in&#8208;situ formation of a metal oxide nano&#8208;catalyst surface modification. This strategy is designed to expedite the ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity of air electrodes exhibiting triple (O2&#8722;, H+, e&#8722;) conductivity. Specifically, this engineered air electrode nanocomposite&#8208;Ba(Co0.4Fe0.4Zr0.1Y0.1)0.95Ni0.05F0.1O2.9&#8208;&#948; demonstrates remarkable ORR/OER catalytic activity and exceptional durability in R&#8208;PCECs. This is evidenced by significantly improved peak power density from 626 to 996&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and highly stable reversibility over a 100&#8208;h cycling period. This research offers a rational design strategy to achieve high&#8208;performance R&#8208;PCEC air electrodes with superior operational activity and stability for efficient and sustainable energy conversion and storage.

         <title>A Zero&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Writing Artificial Nervous System Based on Biosensor Integrated on Ferroelectric Tunnel Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a zero&#8208;voltage&#8208;writing artificial nervous system (ZANS) that integrates a bio&#8208;source&#8208;sensing device (BSSD) for ion&#8208;based sensing and power generation with a hafnium&#8208;zirconium oxide&#8208;ferroelectric tunnel junction (HZO&#8208;FTJ) for the continuously adjustable resistance state. Moreover, by connecting it to the sciatic nerve of the rabbit's leg, precise control of the rabbit's leg muscles with zero&#8208;voltage&#8208;writing capability is successfully realized.








Abstract
The artificial nervous system proves the great potential for the emulation of complex neural signal transduction. However, a more bionic system design for bio&#8208;signal transduction still lags behind that of physical signals, and relies on additional external sources. Here, this work presents a zero&#8208;voltage&#8208;writing artificial nervous system (ZANS) that integrates a bio&#8208;source&#8208;sensing device (BSSD) for ion&#8208;based sensing and power generation with a hafnium&#8208;zirconium oxide&#8208;ferroelectric tunnel junction (HZO&#8208;FTJ) for the continuously adjustable resistance state. The BSSD can use ion bio&#8208;source as both perception and energy source, and then output voltage signals varied with the change of ion concentrations to the HZO&#8208;FTJ, which completes the zero&#8208;voltage&#8208;writing neuromorphic bio&#8208;signal modulation. In view of in/ex vivo biocompatibility, this work shows the precise muscle control of a rabbit leg by integrating the ZANS with a flexible nerve stimulation electrode. The independence on external source enhances the application potential of ZANS in robotics and prosthetics.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Polarized Solar&#8208;Blind Ultraviolet Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet photodetectors, with a dichroic ratio close to 4.26, are demonstrated. Stable and efficient detection of polarized light is attributed to the intrinsic anisotropy of the transition dipole moment in the bc crystal plane. Finally, high&#8208;contrast polarimetric imaging and anti&#8208;interference imaging are successfully demonstrated based on photodetectors, highlighting the potential of organic semiconductors for polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive ultraviolet photodetectors is crucial for their application in military remote sensing, detection, bio&#8208;inspired navigation, and machine vision. However, the significant absorption in the visible light range severely limits the application of polarization&#8208;sensitive ultraviolet photodetectors, such as high&#8208;quality anti&#8208;interference imaging. Here, based on a wide&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductor single crystal (trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(5&#8208;phenyldithieno[2,3&#8208;b:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene, BPTTE), high&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet photodetectors with a dichroic ratio close to 4.26 are demonstrated. The strong anisotropy of 2D grown BPTTE single crystals in molecular vibration and optical absorption is characterized by various techniques. Under voltage modulation, stable and efficient detection of polarized light is demonstrated, attributed to the intrinsic anisotropy of transition dipole moment in the bc crystal plane, rather than other factors. Finally, high&#8208;contrast polarimetric imaging and anti&#8208;interference imaging are successfully demonstrated based on BPTTE single crystal photodetectors, highlighting the potential of organic semiconductors for polarization&#8208;sensitive solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet photodetectors.

         <title>Artificial Phages with Biocatalytic Spikes for Synergistically Eradicating Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial phages (Ir@Co3O4 (S)) with biocatalytic spikes are constructed for synergistically eradicating antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilms. Benefiting from the distinctive nanospiky structures and superior biofilm microenvironment&#8208;adaptive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capacity, the spiky Ir@Co3O4 (S) can efficiently eradicate methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilms through a synergistic &#8220;penetrate and eradicate&#8221; strategy, thus expediting wound healing without notable inflammation and toxicity.









Abstract
Antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens have become a global public health crisis, especially biofilm&#8208;induced refractory infections. Efficient, safe, and biofilm microenvironment (BME)&#8208;adaptive therapeutic strategies are urgently demanded to combat antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilms. Here, inspired by the fascinating biological structures and functions of phages, the de novo design of a spiky Ir@Co3O4 particle is proposed to serve as an artificial phage for synergistically eradicating antibiotic&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Benefiting from the abundant nanospikes and highly active Ir sites, the synthesized artificial phage can simultaneously achieve efficient biofilm accumulation, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) penetration, and superior BME&#8208;adaptive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, thus facilitating the in situ ROS delivery and enhancing the biofilm eradication. Moreover, transcriptomics found that the artificial phage obstructs the bacterial attachment to EPS, disrupts the maintenance of the BME, and fosters the dispersion and eradication of biofilms by down&#8208;regulating the associated genes for the biosynthesis and preservation of both intra&#8208; and extracellular environments. The in vivo results demonstrate that the artificial phage can treat the biofilm&#8208;induced recalcitrant infected wounds equivalent to vancomycin. It is suggested that the design of this spiky artificial phage with synergistic &#8220;penetrate and eradicate&#8221; capability to treat antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilms offers a new pathway for bionic and nonantibiotic disinfection.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Fabrication of Stable Silicon Anode in Air for Sulfide Solid State Batteries via Ionic&#8208;Electronic Dual Conductive Binder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon&#8208;based sulfide solid&#8208;state batteries have received extensive attention around the world due to their low cost and high energy density. In this work, an ionic&#8211;electronic dual conductive binder for the fabrication of robust silicon anode under ambient air conditions in the absence of high&#8208;cost and air&#8208;sensitive sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolyte for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is reported.








Abstract
The construction of a continuous ionic/electronic pathway is critical for Si&#8208;based sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with the advantages of high&#8208;energy density and high&#8208;cycle stability. However, a significant impediment arises from the parasitic reaction occurring between the ionic sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolyte and electronic carbon additive, posing a formidable challenge. Additionally, the fabrication of electrodes necessitates stringent operational conditions, further limiting practical applicability. Herein, an ionic&#8211;electronic dual conductive binder for the fabrication of robust silicon anode under ambient air conditions in the absence of high&#8208;cost and air&#8208;sensitive sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolyte for ASSBs is reported. This binder incorporates in situ reduced silver nanoparticles into a high&#8208;strength polymer rich in ether bonds, establishing a conductive pathway for lithium ions and electrons. With the binder&#8208;composited Si anode, the half&#8208;cell exhibits a remarkable capacity of 1906.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and stable cycling for 500 cycles at a current density of 2&#160;C (4.4&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) under a low stack pressure of 5&#160;MPa. The full cell using Ni0.9Co0.075Mn0.025O2 (NCM90) exhibits a remark cycling stability within 2000 cycles at 5&#160;C (8&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). This work presents an inspired design of functional binders for large&#8208;scale manufacture and mild operation in a low&#8208;cost way for Si anodes in ASSBs.

         <title>Precisely Controlling Polymer Acceptors with Weak Intramolecular Charge Transfer Effect and Superior Coplanarity for Efficient Indoor All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with over 27% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a successful design strategy of medium&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptor, PYFO&#8208;V, is presented for indoor all&#8208;polymer solar cell operation. By the synergy of alkoxy chains and vinylene spacers onto Y&#8208;series polymer acceptors, PYFO&#8208;V exhibits blue&#8208;shifted absorption and upshifted energy levels. The binary devices realize an impressive efficiency of 27.1% under indoor illumination with great photostability, beneficial for the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things application.









Abstract
Indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) are garnering increasing attention from both the academic and industrial communities due to the pressing demand of the ecosystem of Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things. All&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs), emerging as a sub&#8208;type of organic photovoltaics, with the merits of great film&#8208;forming properties, remarkable morphological and light stability, hold great promise to simultaneously achieve high efficiency and long&#8208;term operation in IPV's application. However, the dearth of polymer acceptors with medium&#8208;bandgap has impeded the rapid development of indoor all&#8208;PSCs. Herein, a highly efficient medium&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptor (PYFO&#8208;V) is reported through the synergistic effects of side chain engineering and linkage modulation and applied for indoor all&#8208;PSCs operation. As a result, the PM6:PYFO&#8208;V&#8208;based indoor all&#8208;PSC yields the highest efficiency of 27.1% under LED light condition, marking the highest value for reported binary indoor all&#8208;PSCs to date. More importantly, the blade&#8208;coated devices using non&#8208;halogenated solvent (o&#8208;xylene) maintain an efficiency of over 23%, demonstrating the potential for industry&#8208;scale fabrication. This work not only highlights the importance of fine&#8208;tuning intramolecular charge transfer effect and intrachain coplanarity in developing high&#8208;performance medium&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptors but also provides a highly efficient strategy for indoor all&#8208;PSC application.

         <title>Exciton Dissociation into Charge Carriers in Porphyrinic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Light&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks with regulated metal&#8208;oxygen clusters are reported for light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The enhanced ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal cluster charge transfer drives exciton dissociation into charge carriers and ensures reduced singlet oxygen and prolonged carrier lifetime for Li&#8208;O2 batteries with low overvoltages and stable cycling.








Abstract
Light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries exhibit a high round&#8208;trip efficiency attributable to the assistance of light&#8208;generated electrons and holes in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Nonetheless, the excitonic effect arising from Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes impedes carrier separation, thus hindering efficient utilization of photo&#8208;energy. Herein, porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks with (Fe2Ni)O(COO)6 clusters are used as photocathodes to accelerate exciton dissociation into charge carriers for light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The coupling of Ni 3d and Fe 3d orbitals boosts ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal cluster charge transfer, and hence drives exciton dissociation and activates O2 for superoxide (&#8226;O2&#8722;) radicals, rather than singlet oxygen (1O2) under photoexcitation. These enable the light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries with a low total overvoltage of 0.28&#160;V and round&#8208;trip efficiency of 92% under light irradiation of 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work highlights the excitonic effect in photoelectrochemical processes and provides insights into photocathode design for light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

These enable the light-assisted Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries with a low total overvoltage of 0.28&#160;V and round-trip efficiency of 92% under light irradiation of 100&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work highlights the excitonic effect in photoelectrochemical processes and provides insights into photocathode design for light-assisted Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibiting the Jahn&#8211;Teller Effect of Manganese Hexacyanoferrate via Ni and Cu Codoping for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>

The nickel&#8208; and copper&#8208;doped manganese&#8208;based Prussian blue cathode undergoes a reversible phase transition from monoclinic to cubic phase during the charge and discharge process, which exhibits excellent cycling stability as cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Manganese (Mn)&#8208;based Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are of great interest as a prospective cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high redox potential, easy synthesis, and low cost. However, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and low electrical conductivity of Mn&#8208;based PBA cause poor structure stability and unsatisfactory performance during the cycling. Herein, a novel nickel&#8208; and copper&#8208;codoped K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode is developed via a simple coprecipitation strategy. The doping elements improve the electrical conductivity of Mn&#8208;based PBA by reducing the bandgap, as well as suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect by stabilizing the framework, as verified by the density functional theory calculations. Simultaneously, the substitution of sodium with potassium in the lattice is beneficial for filling vacancies in the PBA framework, leading to higher average operating voltages and superior structural stability. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Mn&#8208;based cathode exhibits excellent reversible capacity (116.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.01 A g&#8722;1) and superior cycling stability (81.8% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a profitable doping strategy to inhibit the Jahn&#8211;Teller structural deformation for designing stable cathode material of SIBs.

         <title>Aqueous Electrolyte With Weak Hydrogen Bonds for Four&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8211;Iodine Battery Operates in a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first four&#8208;electron zinc&#8211;iodine batteries with wide&#8208;temperature range (&#8722;40&#8201;&#160;&#176;C to 40&#160;&#8201;&#176;C) are successfully fabricated using polyethylene glycol (PEG 200) as a co&#8208;solvent in 2 m ZnCl2 aqueous solution. The hybrid electrolyte substantially reduces water activity to restrain the I+ hydrolysis, facilitating I&#8722;/I2/I+ redox kinetics, mitigating I3&#8722; formation, and smoothening Zn deposition.








Abstract
In the pursuit of high&#8208;performance energy storage systems, four&#8208;electron zinc&#8211;iodine aqueous batteries (4eZIBs) with successive I&#8722;/I2/I+ redox couples are appealing for their potential to deliver high energy density and resource abundance. However, susceptibility of positive valence I+ to hydrolysis and instability of Zn plating/stripping in conventional aqueous electrolyte pose significant challenges. In response, polyethylene glycol (PEG 200) is introduced as co&#8208;solvent in 2 m ZnCl2 aqueous solution to design a wide temperature electrolyte. Through a comprehensive investigation combining spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical simulations, it is elucidated that PEG disrupts the intrinsic strong H&#8208;bonds of water by global weak PEG&#8211;H2O interaction, which strengthens the O&#9472;H covalent bond of water and intensifies the coordination with Zn2+. This synergistic effect substantially reduces water activity to restrain the I+ hydrolysis, facilitating I&#8722;/I2/I+ redox kinetics, mitigating I3&#8722; formation and smoothening Zn deposition. The 4eZIBs in the optimized hybrid electrolyte not only deliver superior cyclability with a low fading rate of 0.0009% per cycle over 20&#160;000 cycles and a close&#8208;to&#8208;unit coulombic efficiency but also exhibit stable performance in a wide temperature range from 40&#160;&#176;C to &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This study offers valuable insights into the rational design of electrolytes for 4eZIBs.

The iodide/iodate redox and precisely engineered Fe&#8211;Co dual&#8208;atom catalyst (FeCo&#8208;DACs) are introduced in Zn&#8211;air batteries to solve the high charging voltages and low energy efficiency. The precisely constructed FeCo&#8208;DACs with strongly coupled d&#8208;orbitals exhibit excellent catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction/evolution reaction and iodide/iodate redox by mitigating overly strong adsorption of intermediates at the active sites.








Abstract
Rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) are promising for energy storage and conversion. However, the high charging voltage and low energy efficiency hinder their commercialization. Herein, these challenges are addressed by employing precisely constructed multifunctional Fe&#8211;Co diatomic site catalysts (FeCo&#8208;DACs) and integrating iodide/iodate redox into ZABs to create Zinc&#8211;air/iodide hybrid batteries (ZAIHBs) with highly efficient multifunctional catalyst. The strong coupling between the 3d orbitals of Fe and Co weakens the excessively strong binding strength between active sites and intermediates, enhancing the catalytic activities for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction and iodide/iodate redox. Consequently, FeCo&#8208;DACs exhibit outstanding bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity with a small potential gap (&#916;E&#160;=&#160;0.66&#160;V) and outstanding stability. Moreover, an outstanding catalytic performance toward iodide/iodate redox is obtained. Therefore, FeCo&#8208;DAC&#8208;based ZAIHBs exhibit high energy efficiency of up to 75% at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and excellent cycling stability (72% after 500&#160;h). This research offers critical insights into the rational design of DACs and paves the way for high&#8208;energy efficiency energy storage devices.

         <title>Inhibiting Demetalation of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C via Mn Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>

Mn acts as an electron donor to reduce the oxidation state of Fe by increasing the electron density at the Fe&#9472;N4 site, thereby strengthening the Fe&#9472;N bond and inhibiting the electrochemical dissolution of Fe. As a result, FeMn&#9472;N&#9472;C exhibits excellent discharge performance and stability in Zn&#8208;air batteries.








Abstract
Demetalation caused by the electrochemical dissolution of metallic Fe atoms is a major challenge for the practical application of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalysts. Herein, an efficient single metallic Mn active site is constructed to improve the strength of the Fe&#9472;N bond, inhibiting the demetalation effect of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C. Mn acts as an electron donor inducing more delocalized electrons to reduce the oxidation state of Fe by increasing the electron density, thereby enhancing the Fe&#9472;N bond and inhibiting the electrochemical dissolution of Fe. The oxygen reduction reaction pathway for the dissociation of Fe&#9472;Mn dual sites can overcome the high energy barriers to direct O&#9472;O bond dissociation and modulate the electronic states of Fe&#9472;N4 sites. The resulting FeMn&#9472;N&#9472;C exhibits excellent ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#160;V in alkaline electrolytes. FeMn&#9472;N&#9472;C as a cathode catalyst for Zn&#8208;air batteries has a cycle stability of 700&#160;h at 25&#160;&#176;C and a long cycle stability of more than 210&#160;h under extremely cold conditions at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. These findings contribute to the development of efficient and stable metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts for various energy devices.

&lt;p&gt;Demetalation caused by the electrochemical dissolution of metallic Fe atoms is a major challenge for the practical application of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalysts. Herein, an efficient single metallic Mn active site is constructed to improve the strength of the Fe&#9472;N bond, inhibiting the demetalation effect of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C. Mn acts as an electron donor inducing more delocalized electrons to reduce the oxidation state of Fe by increasing the electron density, thereby enhancing the Fe&#9472;N bond and inhibiting the electrochemical dissolution of Fe. The oxygen reduction reaction pathway for the dissociation of Fe&#9472;Mn dual sites can overcome the high energy barriers to direct O&#9472;O bond dissociation and modulate the electronic states of Fe&#9472;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites. The resulting FeMn&#9472;N&#9472;C exhibits excellent ORR activity with a high half-wave potential of 0.92&#160;V in alkaline electrolytes. FeMn&#9472;N&#9472;C as a cathode catalyst for Zn-air batteries has a cycle stability of 700&#160;h at 25&#160;&#176;C and a long cycle stability of more than 210&#160;h under extremely cold conditions at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. These findings contribute to the development of efficient and stable metal-nitrogen-carbon catalysts for various energy devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aerogel&#8208;Involved Triple&#8208;State Gels Resemble Natural Living Leaves in Structure and Multi&#8208;Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerogel&#8208;evolved artificial leaf with the same structural and functional features as natural living leaves is successfully synthesized by in situ embedding hydrophobic silica aerogel microparticles in PVA hydrogel matrix in the presence of hygroscopic salt and chlorophyllin copper sodium. The as&#8208;prepared living leaves may represent a significant advancement in the field of bionic science, and open up new possibilities for the development and application of bionic engineering in the future.








Abstract
Natural plant leaves with multiple functions, for example, spectral features, transpiration, photosynthesis, etc., have played a significant role in the ecosystem, and artificial synthesis of plant leaves with multiple functions of natural ones is still a great challenge. Herein, this work presents an aerogel&#8208;involved living leaf (AL), most similar to natural ones so far, by embedding super&#8208;hydrophobic SiO2 aerogel microparticles in polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel in the presence of hygroscopic salt and chlorophyllin copper sodium to form solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;vapor triple&#8208;state gel. The AL shows a high spectral similarity with all sampled 15 species of natural leaves and exhibits &#8776;4&#8211;7 times transpiration speed higher than natural leaves. More importantly, AL can achieve several times higher photosynthesis than natural leaves without the energy provided by the respiratory action of natural ones. This work demonstrates the feasibility of creating ALs with natural leaf&#8208;like triple&#8208;state gel structures and multiple functions, opening up new avenues for energy conversion, environmental engineering, and biomimetic applications.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Reconfiguration Induced Multifunctional Triple&#8208;Gradient Artificial Interfacial Layer toward Long&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step in situ self&#8208;reconfiguration strategy is demonstrated to induce triple&#8208;gradient (PDDA&#8208;TFSI)&#8208;Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#183;H2O&#8208;Sn (PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;Sn) artificial interface on the Zn anode surface. The triple&#8208;gradient interface consists of the top layer PT with cation confinement and H2O inhibition, the dense interlayer ZHC with Zn2+ conduction and electron shielding, and the bottom Znophilic layer Sn. The resulting PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;Sn@Zn symmetric cell achieves an ultra&#8208;long lifetime over 6500&#160;h.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries&#160;featuring with intrinsic safety and low cost are highly desirable for large&#8208;scale energy storage, but the unstable Zn&#8208;metal anode resulting from uncontrollable dendrite growth and grievous hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) shortens their cycle life. Herein, a feasible in situ self&#8208;reconfiguration strategy is developed to generate triple&#8208;gradient poly(diallyldimethylammonium) bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PDDA&#8208;TFSI)&#8208;Zn5(OH)8Cl2&#183;H2O&#8208;Sn (PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;Sn) artificial layer. The resulting triple&#8208;gradient interface consists of the spherical top layer PT with cation confinement and H2O inhibition, the dense intermediate layer ZHC nanosheet with Zn2+ conduction and electron shielding, and the bottom layer Znophilic Sn metal. The well&#8208;designed triple&#8208;gradient artificial interfacial layer synergistically facilitates rapid Zn2+ diffusion to regulate uniform Zn deposition and accelerates the desolvation process while suppressing HER. Consequently, the PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;Sn@Zn symmetric cell achieves an ultralong lifespan over 6500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 0.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a full battery coupling with MnO2 cathode exhibits a 17.2% increase in capacity retention compared with bare Zn anode after 1000 cycles. The in situ self&#8208;reconfiguration strategy is also applied to prepare triple&#8208;gradient PT&#8208;ZHC&#8208;In, and the assembled Zn//Cu cell operates steadily for over 8400&#160;h while maintaining Coulombic efficiency of 99.6%. This work paves the way to designing multicomponent gradient interface for stable Zn&#8208;metal anodes.

This study is based on a dual&#8208;ligand synthesis strategy to design nickel&#8208;based complexes with structural changes through thermodynamic modulation. Thiols induce electron&#8208;rich nickel structures around the competitive coordination between the host/guest molecules, thus increasing the electron density of the central atom. The work provides a new perspective on coordination transformations and offers ideas for the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.








Abstract
Uniquely functional nanocomplexes with rich coordination environments are critical in energy storage. However, the construction of structurally versatile nanocomplexes remains challenging. In this study, a nickel&#8208;based complex with structural variations is designed via thermodynamic modulation using a dual&#8208;ligand synthesis strategy. A nickel&#8208;based nanomaterial (NiSA&#8208;SSA&#8208;160) with a large specific surface area is synthesized around the competing coordination of the host and guest molecules that differ in terms of the chemical properties of the O and S elements. Concurrently, the coordination environment of NiSA&#8208;SSA&#8208;160 is investigated via X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The thiol functional groups synergistically induced an electron&#8208;rich Ni structure, thus increasing the electron density of the central atom. The electrochemical performance of an assembled NiSA&#8208;SSA&#8208;160//Zn@CC battery is shown to improve significantly, with a maximum energy density of 0.54 mWh cm&#8722;2 and a peak power density of 49.49&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This study provides a new perspective regarding coordination transformations and offers an idea for the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.

         <title>Plasmonic Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Response S&#8208;Scheme ZnO/CuInS2 Photocatalyst for H2O2 Production Coupled with Glycerin Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZnO/CuInS2 heterojunction facilitates interfacial charge transfer, enriching carrier concentration in CuInS2. This amplifies localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and enhances near&#8208;infrared (NIR) response that are crucial for solar fuel synthesis. Through H2O2 production and glycerin oxidation, this innovation underscores the significance of NIR utilization, advancing solar energy harvesting technologies.








Abstract
Solar fuel synthesis is intriguing because solar energy is abundant and this method compensates for its intermittency. However, most photocatalysts can only absorb UV&#8208;to&#8208;visible light, while near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light remains unexploited. Surprisingly, the charge transfer between ZnO and CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) can transform a NIR&#8208;inactive ZnO into a NIR&#8208;active composite. This strong response is attributed to the increased concentration of free charge carriers in the p&#8208;type semiconductor at the interface after the charge migration between ZnO and CuInS2, enhancing the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and the NIR response of CuInS2. As a paradigm, this ZnO/CuInS2 heterojunction is used for H2O2 production coupled with glycerin oxidation and demonstrates supreme performance, corroborating the importance of NIR response and efficient charge transfer. Mechanistic studies through contact potential difference (CPD), Hall effect test, and finite element method (FEM) calculation allow for the direct correlation between the NIR response and charge transfer. This approach bypasses the general light response issues, thereby stepping forward to the ambitious goal of harnessing the entire solar spectrum.

This strong response is attributed to the increased concentration of free charge carriers in the p-type semiconductor at the interface after the charge migration between ZnO and CuInS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, enhancing the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and the NIR response of CuInS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. As a paradigm, this ZnO/CuInS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction is used for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production coupled with glycerin oxidation and demonstrates supreme performance, corroborating the importance of NIR response and efficient charge transfer. Mechanistic studies through contact potential difference (CPD), Hall effect test, and finite element method (FEM) calculation allow for the direct correlation between the NIR response and charge transfer. This approach bypasses the general light response issues, thereby stepping forward to the ambitious goal of harnessing the entire solar spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Atmospheric Water Harvester
In article number 2403876, Lin Dai, Chenyu Li, Wenshuai Chen, Chuanling Si, and co&#8208;workers report a solar&#8208;powered gel that can rapidly adsorb and release moisture, created by integrating a whole biomass&#8208;derived polymer network with lithium chloride. Next, a drum&#8208;type, tunable, and portable harvester is assembled that can collect atmospheric water within a brief time. This approach provides new insights for fast atmospheric water harvesting in extreme environments.

Energy Harvesting
This novel &#8220;Twistron energy cell harvester&#8221; (TECH) produces electrical energy from mechanical contraction. In vivo implantation of TECH onto the left ventricular surface in a porcine model continuously generates electrical energy from cardiac contraction. The generated electrical energy is used for direct pacing of the heart as documented by electrophysiology mapping. This energy can potentially be used for medical implants. More details can be found in article number 2313688 by Seon Jeong Kim and co&#8208;workers.

Spontaneous Supercrystal Formation
In article number 2403873, Oleg Yu. Gorobtsov and co&#8208;workers discover a new anisotropic structural hierarchy over multiple length scales forming spontaneously in thin films of a Mott insulator Ca2RuO4. The anisotropy of structure correlates to a switchable anisotropy of electrical properties, providing new device design opportunities.

Abstract
Tissue ablation techniques have emerged as a critical component of modern medical practice and biomedical research, offering versatile solutions for treating various diseases and disorders. Percutaneous ablation is minimally invasive and offers numerous advantages over traditional surgery, such as shorter recovery times, reduced hospital stays, and decreased healthcare costs. Intra&#8208;procedural imaging during ablation also allows precise visualization of the treated tissue while minimizing injury to the surrounding normal tissues, reducing the risk of complications. Here, the mechanisms of tissue ablation and innovative energy delivery systems are explored, highlighting recent advancements that have reshaped the landscape of clinical practice. Current clinical challenges related to tissue ablation are also discussed, underlining unmet clinical needs for more advanced material&#8208;based approaches to improve the delivery of energy and pharmacology&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Photochromic Carbon Nanomaterials: An Emerging Class of Light&#8208;Driven Hybrid Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When carbon nanomaterials are functionalized by photochromic molecules, the resultant hybrids exhibit either new or improved properties and functions that are attractive for diverse device applications. This review summarizes the fabrication methods, properties, and various applications of photochromic carbon nanomaterials.








Abstract
Photochromic molecules have remarkable potential in memory and optical devices, as well as in driving and manipulating molecular motors or actuators and many other systems using light. When photochromic molecules are introduced into carbon nanomaterials (CNMs), the resulting hybrids provide unique advantages and create new functions that can be employed in specific applications and devices. This review highlights the recent developments in diverse photochromic CNMs. Photochromic molecules and CNMs are also introduced. The fundamentals of different photochromic CNMs are discussed, including design principles and the types of interactions between CNMs and photochromic molecules via covalent interactions and non&#8208;covalent bonding such as &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking, amphiphilic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding. Then the properties of photochromic CNMs, e.g., in photopatterning, fluorescence modulation, actuation, and photoinduced surface&#8208;relief gratings, and their applications in energy storage (solar thermal fuels, photothermal batteries, and supercapacitors), nanoelectronics (transistors, molecular junctions, photo&#8208;switchable conductance, and photoinduced electron transfer), sensors, and bioimaging are highlighted. Finally, an outlook on the challenges and opportunities in the future of photochromic CNMs is presented. This review discusses a vibrant interdisciplinary research field and is expected to stimulate further developments in nanoscience, advanced nanotechnology, intelligently responsive materials, and devices.

         <title>Fluid Unidirectional Transport Induced by Structure and Ambient Elements across Porous Materials: From Principles to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces wetting phenomena observed on natural biological surfaces or porous structures. Subsequently, it offers an overview of diverse principles and potential applications in this field, emphasizing various physical and chemical structural designs and ambient elements. Applications encompass moisture&#8208;wicking fabric, sensors, skincare, fog collection, oil&#8211;water separation, electrochemistry, liquid&#8208;based gating, and solar evaporators.








Abstract
Spontaneous or nonspontaneous unidirectional fluid transport across multidimension can occur under specific structural designs and ambient elements for porous materials. While existing reviews have extensively summarized unidirectional fluid transport on surfaces, there is an absence of literature summarizing fluid's unidirectional transport across porous materials. This review introduces wetting phenomena observed on natural biological surfaces or porous structures. Subsequently, it offers an overview of diverse principles and potential applications in this field, emphasizing various physical and chemical structural designs (surface energy, capillary size, topographic curvature) and ambient elements (underwater, under oil, pressure, and solar energy). Applications encompass moisture&#8208;wicking fabric, sensors, skincare, fog collection, oil&#8211;water separation, electrochemistry, liquid&#8208;based gating, and solar evaporators. Additionally, significant principles and formulas from various studies are compelled to offer readers valuable references. Simultaneously, potential advantages and challenges are critically assessed in these applications and the perspectives are presented.

         <title>Heterointerfaces: Unlocking Superior Capacity and Rapid Mass Transfer Dynamics in Energy Storage Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review emphasizes the significance of heterointerfaces, which present new opportunities for enhanced capacity and rapid mass transfer dynamics in energy storage electrodes, attributed to the localized &#8220;space charge effect&#8221;. Fresh insights into fundamental principles, working mechanisms, dynamic evolution mechanisms, and feasible design strategies governing heterointerfaces are systematically discussed.








Abstract
Heterogeneous electrode materials possess abundant heterointerfaces with a localized &#8220;space charge effect&#8221;, which enhances capacity output and accelerates mass/charge transfer dynamics in energy storage devices (ESDs). These promising features open new possibilities for demanding applications such as electric vehicles, grid energy storage, and portable electronics. However, the fundamental principles and working mechanisms that govern heterointerfaces are not yet fully understood, impeding the rational design of electrode materials. In this study, the heterointerface evolution during charging and discharging process as well as the intricate interaction between heterointerfaces and charge/mass transport phenomena, is systematically discussed. Guidelines along with feasible strategies for engineering structural heterointerfaces to address specific challenges encountered in various application scenarios, are also provided. This review offers innovative solutions for the development of heterogeneous electrode materials, enabling more efficient energy storage beyond conventional electrochemistry. Furthermore, it provides fresh insights into the advancement of clean energy conversion and storage technologies. This review contributes to the knowledge and understanding of heterointerfaces, paving the way for the design and optimization of next&#8208;generation energy storage materials for a sustainable future.

Abstract
Citrate&#8208;based biodegradable polymers have emerged as a distinctive biomaterial platform with tremendous potential for diverse medical applications. By harnessing their versatile chemistry, these polymers exhibit a wide range of material and bioactive properties, enabling them to regulate cell metabolism and stem cell differentiation through energy metabolism, metabonegenesis, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation. Moreover, the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of the biodegradable poly(octamethylene citrate) (POC)/hydroxyapatite&#8208;based orthopedic fixation devices represents a translational research milestone for biomaterial science. POC joins a short list of biodegradable synthetic polymers that have ever been authorized by the FDA for use in humans. The clinical success of POC has sparked enthusiasm and accelerated the development of next&#8208;generation citrate&#8208;based biomaterials. This review presents a comprehensive, forward&#8208;thinking discussion on the pivotal role of citrate chemistry and metabolism in various tissue regeneration and on the development of functional citrate&#8208;based metabotissugenic biomaterials for regenerative engineering applications.

         <title>Toward Circular Energy: Exploring Direct Regeneration for Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recycling is crucial for enhancing the sustainability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, alleviating raw material shortages, and reducing carbon emissions. Replenishing lithium at the molecular level can restore its properties and prevent repetitive construction of degraded cathode materials. However, future batteries must also meet sustainability requirements while maintaining exceptional electrochemical performance. Direct upcycling offers an innovative approach to transform battery materials.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are rapidly developing into attractive energy storage technologies. As LIBs gradually enter retirement, their sustainability is starting to come into focus. The utilization of recycled spent LIBs as raw materials for battery manufacturing is imperative for resource and environmental sustainability. The sustainability of spent LIBs depends on the recycling process, whereby the cycling of battery materials must be maximized while minimizing waste emissions and energy consumption. Although LIB recycling technologies (hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy) have been commercialized on a large scale, they have unavoidable limitations. They are incompatible with circular economy principles because they require toxic chemicals, emit hazardous substances, and consume large amounts of energy. The direct regeneration of degraded electrode materials from spent LIBs is a viable alternative to traditional recycling technologies and is a nondestructive repair technology. Furthermore, direct regeneration offers advantages such as maximization of the value of recycled electrode materials, use of sustainable, nontoxic reagents, high potential profitability, and significant application potential. Therefore, this review aims to investigate the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art direct LIB regeneration technologies that can be extended to large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Recent Progress of Fluorinated Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated conjugated polymers, as a thriving field for organic electronics, have received wide&#8208;spread attention. This review summarizes the fluorination strategies of building blocks in conjugated polymers and synthetic methods of fluorinated conjugated polymers. Besides, the applications of fluorinated polymer semiconductors with superior device performances, especially in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic solar cells, organic electrochemical transistors, and thermoelectrics, are also introduced.








Abstract
In recent years, conjugated polymers have received widespread attention due to their characteristic advantages of light weight, favorable solution processability, and structural modifiability. Among various conjugated polymers, fluorinated ones have developed rapidly to achieve high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type or ambipolar polymeric semiconductors. The uniqueness of fluorinated conjugated polymers contains the high coplanarity of their structures, lower frontier molecular orbital energy levels, and strong nonbonding interactions. In this review, first the fluorinated building blocks, including fluorinated benzene and thiophene rings, fluorinated B&#8592;N bridged units, and fluoroalkyl side chains are summarized. Subsequently, different synthetic methods of fluorinated conjugated polymers are described, with a special focus on their respective advantages and disadvantages. Then, with these numerous fluorinated structures and appropriate synthetic methods bear in mind, the properties and applications of the fluorinated conjugated polymers, such as cyclopentadithiophene&#8208;, amide&#8208;, and imide&#8208;based polymers, and B&#8592;N embedded polymers, are systematically discussed. The introduction of fluorine atoms can further enhance the electron&#8208;deficiency of the backbone, influencing the charge carrier transport performance. The promising fluorinated conjugated polymers are applied widely in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic solar cells, organic thermoelectric devices, and other organic opto&#8208;electric devices. Finally, the outlook on the challenges and future development of fluorinated conjugated polymers is systematically discussed.

         <title>Chemically Programmed Hydrogels for Spatiotemporal Modulation of the Cardiac Pathological Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically programmed responsive polymer networks, intelligent micro/nanoplatforms, and biological therapeutic cues contribute to the formation of precisely targeted, spatiotemporally controllable, and on&#8208;demand feedback microenvironment&#8208;modulated hydrogels. Chemically programmed strategies are used to construct oxygen&#8208;generating, antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, provascular, and electrointegrated hydrogels for spatiotemporal modulation of the cardiac pathological microenvironment.








Abstract
After myocardial infarction (MI), sustained ischemic events induce pathological microenvironments characterized by ischemia&#8208;hypoxia, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, matrix remodeling, and fibrous scarring. Conventional clinical therapies lack spatially targeted and temporally responsive modulation of the infarct microenvironment, leading to limited myocardial repair. Engineered hydrogels have a chemically programmed toolbox for minimally invasive localization of the pathological microenvironment and personalized responsive modulation over different pathological periods. Chemically programmed strategies for crosslinking interactions, interfacial binding, and topological microstructures in hydrogels enable minimally invasive implantation and in situ integration tailored to the myocardium. This enhances substance exchange and signal interactions within the infarcted microenvironment. Programmed responsive polymer networks, intelligent micro/nanoplatforms, and biological therapeutic cues contribute to the formation of microenvironment&#8208;modulated hydrogels with precise targeting, spatiotemporal control, and on&#8208;demand feedback. Therefore, this review summarizes the features of the MI microenvironment and chemically programmed schemes for hydrogels to conform, integrate, and modulate the cardiac pathological microenvironment. Chemically programmed strategies for oxygen&#8208;generating, antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, provascular, and electrointegrated hydrogels to stimulate iterative and translational cardiac tissue engineering are discussed.

         <title>Intestinal Delivery of Probiotics: Materials, Strategies, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the progress of intestinal delivery of probiotics for the diagnosis and therapy of various diseases is provided from the aspects of definition, type, action mechanism, encapsulation strategy, therapeutic application, and synthetic biology for probiotics. The current limitations and future research directions in the intestinal delivery of probiotics are also discussed.








Abstract
Probiotics with diverse and crucial properties and functions have attracted broad interest from many researchers, who adopt intestinal delivery of probiotics to modulate the gut microbiota. However, the major problems faced for the therapeutic applications of probiotics are the viability and colonization of probiotics during their processing, oral intake, and subsequent delivery to the gut. The challenges of simple oral delivery (stability, controllability, targeting, etc.) have greatly limited the use of probiotics in clinical therapies. Nanotechnology can endow the probiotics to be delivered to the intestine with improved survival rate and increased resistance to the adverse environment. Additionally, the progress in synthetic biology has created new opportunities for efficiently and purposefully designing and manipulating the probiotics. In this article, a brief overview of the types of probiotics for intestinal delivery, the current progress of different probiotic encapsulation strategies, including the chemical, physical, and genetic strategies and their combinations, and the emerging single&#8208;cell encapsulation strategies using nanocoating methods, is presented. The action mechanisms of probiotics that are responsible for eliciting beneficial effects are also briefly discussed. Finally, the therapeutic applications of engineered probiotics are discussed, and the future trends toward developing engineered probiotics with advanced features and improved health benefits are proposed.

         <title>Mechanisms of the Accelerated Li+ Conduction in MOF&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth summary of the mechanism of accelerated Li+ conduction in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is presented in terms of polymers, MOF, MOF/polymer interface, and solid&#8208;state electrolyte/Li interfaces. In addition, the understanding of the ionic conduction mechanisms is further deepened by summarizing advanced characterisation tools, theoretical calculations, and simulations.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for lithium metal batteries have garnered considerable interests owing to their low cost, flexibility, lightweight, and favorable interfacial compatibility with battery electrodes. Their soft mechanical nature compared to solid inorganic electrolytes give them a large advantage to be used in low pressure solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, which can avoid the cost and weight of the pressure cages. However, the application of SPEs is hindered by their relatively low ionic conductivity. In addressing this limitation, enormous efforts are devoted to the experimental investigation and theoretical calculations/simulation of new polymer classes. Recently, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been shown to be effective in enhancing ion transport in SPEs. However, the mechanisms in enhancing Li+ conductivity have rarely been systematically and comprehensively analyzed. Therefore, this review provides an in&#8208;depth summary of the mechanisms of MOF&#8208;enhanced Li+ transport in MOF&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (MSPEs) in terms of polymer, MOF, MOF/polymer interface, and solid electrolyte interface aspects, respectively. Moreover, the understanding of Li+ conduction mechanisms through employing advanced characterization tools, theoretical calculations, and simulations are also reviewed in this review. Finally, the main challenges in developing MSPEs are deeply analyzed and the corresponding future research directions are also proposed.

         <title>Integration Construction of Hybrid Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 32, August 8, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multidimensional construction of platinum (Pt)&#8208;nanocarbon integrated catalysts enhances the catalytic activity and stability through the joint promotion of abundant active sites, multisite tandem catalysis, optimized oxygen adsorption, reinforced anchoring effect, and robust metal&#8208;support interaction,&#160;while considering both bulk and local mass transport to ensure long&#8208;lasting operation of the fuel cells.








Abstract
There is notable progress in the development of efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalysts, which are crucial components of fuel cells. However, these superior activities are limited by imbalanced mass transport and cannot be fully reflected in actual fuel cell applications. Herein, the design concepts and development tracks of platinum (Pt)&#8208;nanocarbon hybrid catalysts, aiming to enhance the performance of both cathodic electrocatalysts and fuel cells, are presented. This review commences with an introduction to Pt/C catalysts, highlighting the diverse architectures developed to date, with particular emphasis on heteroatom modification and microstructure construction of functionalized nanocarbons based on integrated design concepts. This discussion encompasses the structural evolution, property enhancement, and catalytic mechanisms of Pt/C&#8208;based catalysts, including rational preparation recipes, superior activity, strong stability, robust metal&#8208;support interactions, adsorption regulation, synergistic pathways, confinement strategies, ionomer optimization, mass transport permission, multidimensional construction, and reactor upgrading. Furthermore, this review explores the low&#8208;barrier or barrier&#8208;free mass exchange interfaces and channels achieved through the impressive multidimensional construction of Pt&#8208;nanocarbon integrated catalysts, with the goal of optimizing fuel cell efficiency. In conclusion, this review outlines the challenges associated with Pt&#8208;nanocarbon integrated catalysts and provides perspectives on the future development trends of fuel cells and beyond.

         <title>Advanced Anti&#8208;Icing Strategies and Technologies by Macrostructured Photothermal Storage Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective reviews the cutting&#8208;edge progress of superhydrophobic surfaces in anti&#8208;icing and proposes a unique concept of smart surfaces, termed the macrostructured photothermal storage superhydrophobic (MPSS) surfaces, for all&#8208;day efficient anti&#8208;icing. The MPSS surfaces integrate the functions of macrostructured superhydrophobic surfaces, photothermal materials, and energy storage materials, and shall be applied in diverse anti&#8208;icing scenarios.








Abstract
Water is the source of life and civilization, but water icing causes catastrophic damage to human life and diverse industrial processes. Currently, superhydrophobic surfaces (inspired by the lotus effect) aided anti&#8208;icing attracts intensive attention due to their energy&#8208;free property. Here, recent advances in anti&#8208;icing by design and functionalization of superhydrophobic surfaces are reviewed. The mechanisms and advantages of conventional, macrostructured, and photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces are introduced in turn. Conventional superhydrophobic surfaces, as well as macrostructured ones, easily lose the icephobic property under extreme conditions, while photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces strongly rely on solar illumination. To address the above issues, a potentially smart strategy is found by developing macrostructured photothermal storage superhydrophobic (MPSS) surfaces, which integrate the functions of macrostructured superhydrophobic materials, photothermal materials, and phase change materials (PCMs), and are expected to achieve all&#8208;day anti&#8208;icing in various fields. Finally, the latest achievements in developing MPSS surfaces, showcasing their immense potential, are highlighted. Besides, the perspectives on the future development of MPSS surfaces are provided and the problems that need to be solved in their practical applications are proposed.

         <title>Reprograming Clots for In Vivo Chemical Targeting in Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a novel targeting strategy for traumatic brain injury, R. Kandell, J. Wu, and E. Kwon utilize in vivo click chemistry to reprogram the fibrin clot for secondary targeting of intravenously delivered nanomaterials. Strained cyclooctynes are engineered on the clot for subsequent capture and retention of circulating azide&#8208;modified materials, including a small molecule, 8&#8208;arm PEG nanomaterial, and therapeutic antioxidant protein.








Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a critical public health concern, yet there are no therapeutics available to improve long&#8208;term outcomes. Drug delivery to TBI remains a challenge due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier and increased intracranial pressure. In this work, a chemical targeting approach to improve delivery of materials to the injured brain, is developed. It is hypothesized that the provisional fibrin matrix can be harnessed as an injury&#8208;specific scaffold that can be targeted by materials via click chemistry. To accomplish this, the brain clot is engineered in situ by delivering fibrinogen modified with strained cyclooctyne (SCO) moieties, which incorporated into the injury lesion and is retained there for days. Improved intra&#8208;injury capture and retention of diverse, clickable azide&#8208;materials including a small molecule azide&#8208;dye, 40&#160;kDa azide&#8208;PEG nanomaterial, and a therapeutic azide&#8208;protein in multiple dosing regimens is subsequently observed. To demonstrate therapeutic translation of this approach, a reduction in reactive oxygen species levels in the injured brain after delivery of the antioxidant catalase, is achieved. Further, colocalization between azide and SCO&#8208;fibrinogen is specific to the brain over off&#8208;target organs. Taken together, a chemical targeting strategy leveraging endogenous clot formation is established which can be applied to improve therapeutic delivery after TBI.

         <title>Stable n&#8208;Type Perylene Derivative Ladder Polymer with Antiambipolarity for Electrically Reconfigurable Organic Logic Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type, &#960;&#8208;extended poly(benzimidazoanthradiisoquinolinedione) ladder polymer with good backbone planarity, predominant edge&#8208;on packing, and porous structure exhibits excellent mixed ionic&#8208;electronic transport properties and enables high&#8208;performing organic electrochemical transistor (OECT). Additionally, the OECT shows stable reversible antiambipolar characteristics. Electrically reconfigurable logic gates, with the dynamic capability of realizing AND, NOR, OR, and NAND gates are accomplished with this single polymer.









Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are one of the promising building blocks to realize next&#8208;generation bioelectronics. To date, however, the performance and signal processing capabilities of these devices remain limited by their stability and speed. Herein, the authors demonstrate stable and fast n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors based on a side&#8208;chain&#8208;free ladder polymer, poly(benzimidazoanthradiisoquinolinedione). The device demonstrated fast normalized transient speed of 0.56 &#177; 0.17 ms&#160;um&#8722;2 and excellent long&#8208;term stability in aqueous electrolytes, with no significant drop in its doping current after 50&#8239;000 successive doping/dedoping cycles and 2&#8208;month storage at ambient conditions. These unique characteristics make this polymer especially suitable for bioelectronics, such as being used as a pull&#8208;down channel in a complementary inverter for long&#8208;term stable detection of electrophysiological signals. Moreover, the developed device shows a reversible anti&#8208;ambipolar behavior, enabling reconfigurable electronics to be realized using a single material. These results go beyond the conventional OECT and demonstrate the potential of OECTs to exhibit dynamically configurable functionalities for next&#8208;generation reconfigurable electronics.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Functionalized Microgels as Artificial Antigen&#8208;Presenting Cells to Regulate Expansion of T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microgels are fabricated as artificial antigen&#8208;presenting cells (aAPCs) to present stimulatory ligands specifically on the surface. Surface&#8208;specific functionalization is achieved via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer coatings, forming a thin but dense polymer layer on the surface. Microgels modified with appropriate ligands promote polyclonal and antigen&#8208;specific T cell expansion and regulate T cell phenotype and function.








Abstract
Artificial antigen&#8208;presenting cells (aAPCs) are currently used to manufacture T cells for adoptive therapy in cancer treatment, but a readily tunable and modular system can enable both rapid T cell expansion and control over T cell phenotype. Here, it is shown that microgels with tailored surface biochemical properties can serve as aAPCs to mediate T cell activation and expansion. Surface functionalization of microgels is achieved via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer coating using oppositely charged polymers, forming a thin but dense polymer layer on the surface. This facile and versatile approach is compatible with a variety of coating polymers and allows efficient and flexible surface&#8208;specific conjugation of defined peptides or proteins. The authors demonstrate that tethering appropriate stimulatory ligands on the microgel surface efficiently activates T cells for polyclonal and antigen&#8208;specific expansion. The expansion, phenotype, and functional outcome of primary mouse and human T cells can be regulated by modulating the concentration, ratio, and distribution of stimulatory ligands presented on microgel surfaces as well as the stiffness and viscoelasticity of the microgels.

&lt;p&gt;Microgels are fabricated as artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) to present stimulatory ligands specifically on the surface. Surface-specific functionalization is achieved via layer-by-layer coatings, forming a thin but dense polymer layer on the surface. Microgels modified with appropriate ligands promote polyclonal and antigen-specific T cell expansion and regulate T cell phenotype and function.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) are currently used to manufacture T cells for adoptive therapy in cancer treatment, but a readily tunable and modular system can enable both rapid T cell expansion and control over T cell phenotype. Here, it is shown that microgels with tailored surface biochemical properties can serve as aAPCs to mediate T cell activation and expansion. Surface functionalization of microgels is achieved via layer-by-layer coating using oppositely charged polymers, forming a thin but dense polymer layer on the surface. This facile and versatile approach is compatible with a variety of coating polymers and allows efficient and flexible surface-specific conjugation of defined peptides or proteins. The authors demonstrate that tethering appropriate stimulatory ligands on the microgel surface efficiently activates T cells for polyclonal and antigen-specific expansion. The expansion, phenotype, and functional outcome of primary mouse and human T cells can be regulated by modulating the concentration, ratio, and distribution of stimulatory ligands presented on microgel surfaces as well as the stiffness and viscoelasticity of the microgels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visualizing the Internal Nanocrystallinity of Calcite Due to Nonclassical Crystallization by 3D Coherent X&#8208;Ray Diffraction Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcite particles are synthesized using two approaches and their 3D internal crystalline structure is characterized using coherent X&#8208;ray imaging. A defects&#8217; analysis reveals the existence of multiple domains for the samples synthesized under nonequilibrium conditions with the presence of null electron density regions, while the particles synthesized under near&#8208;equilibrium conditions show a much less defective structure.








Abstract
The internal crystallinity of calcite is investigated for samples synthesized using two approaches: precipitation from solution and the ammonium carbonate diffusion method. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses reveal that the calcite products precipitated using both approaches have a well&#8208;defined rhombohedron shape, consistent with the euhedral crystal habit of the mineral. The internal structure of these calcite crystals is characterized using Bragg coherent diffraction imaging (BCDI) to determine the 3D electron density and the atomic displacement field. BCDI reconstructions for crystals synthesized using the ammonium carbonate diffusion approach have the expected euhedral shape, with internal strain fields and few internal defects. In contrast, the crystals synthesized by precipitation from solution have very complex external shapes and defective internal structures, presenting null electron density regions and pronounced displacement field distributions. These heterogeneities are interpreted as multiple crystalline domains, created by a nonclassical crystallization mechanism, where smaller nanoparticles coalescence into the final euhedral particles. The combined use of SEM, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and BCDI allows for structurally differentiating calcite crystals grown with different approaches, opening new opportunities to understand how grain boundaries and internal defects alter calcite reactivity.

         <title>Microneedle&#8208;Mediated Delivery of Immunomodulators Restores Immune Privilege in Hair Follicles and Reverses Immune&#8208;Mediated Alopecia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alopecia areata is a condition characterized by hair loss due to autoimmunity. Expansion of endogenous regulatory T cells (Tregs) at the site of antigen encounter can restore the skin immune balance. Here, a hydrogel microneedle is utilized to amplify Tregs in a murine model of alopecia leading to sustained hair regrowth without engendering peripheral immunosuppression. This approach could reshape the landscape of autoimmune skin disease management.








Abstract
Disorders in the regulatory arm of the adaptive immune system result in autoimmune&#8208;mediated diseases. While systemic immunosuppression is the prevailing approach to manage them, it fails to achieve long&#8208;lasting remission due to concomitant suppression of the regulatory arm and carries the risk of heightened susceptibility to infections and malignancies. Alopecia areata is a condition characterized by localized hair loss due to autoimmunity. The accessibility of the skin allows&#160;local rather than systemic intervention to avoid broad immunosuppression. It is hypothesized that the expansion of endogenous regulatory T cells (Tregs) at the site of antigen encounter can restore the immune balance and generate a long&#8208;lasting tolerogenic response. A hydrogel microneedle (MN) patch is therefore utilized for delivery of CCL22, a Treg&#8208;chemoattractant, and IL&#8208;2, a Treg&#160;survival factor to amplify them. In an immune&#8208;mediated murine model of alopecia, local bolstering of Treg&#160;numbers is shown, leading to sustained hair regrowth and attenuation of inflammatory pathways. In a humanized skin transplant mouse model, expansion of Tregs within human skin is confirmed without engendering peripheral immunosuppression. The patch offers high&#8208;loading capacity and shelf&#8208;life stability for prospective clinical translation. By harmonizing immune responses locally, the aim is to reshape the landscape of autoimmune skin disease management.

         <title>Antiferroelectric Ceramics for Energy&#8208;Efficient Capacitors by Theory&#8208;Guided Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;perfect charge&#8211;discharge energy efficiency, 98.2%, is observed in a PbZrO3&#8208;based antiferroelectric ceramic. The compositions with such compatible antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase transitions are discovered by theory&#8208;guided high&#8208;throughput synthesis. The almost eliminated electric hysteresis is a result of minimized lattice mismatch strain at the interface during phase transition. The highly energy&#8208;efficient capacitor also exhibits 80 times enhancement in service lifetime.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric ceramics, via the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced antiferroelectric (AFE)&#8211;ferroelectric (FE) phase transitions, show great promise for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors. Yet, currently, only 70&#8211;80% energy release is found during a charge&#8211;discharge cycle. Here, for PbZrO3&#8208;based oxides, geometric nonlinear theory of martensitic phase transitions is applied (first used to guide supercompatible shape&#8208;memory alloys) to predict the reversibility of the AFE&#8211;FE transition by using density&#8208;functional theory to assess AFE/FE interfacial lattice&#8208;mismatch strain that assures ultralow electric hysteresis and extended fatigue lifetime. A good correlation of mismatch strain with electric hysteresis, hence, with energy efficiency of AFE capacitors is observed. Guided by theory, high&#8208;throughput material search is conducted and AFE compositions with a near&#8208;perfect charge&#8211;discharge energy efficiency (98.2%), i.e., near&#8208;zero hysteresis are discovered. And the fatigue life of the capacitor reaches 79.5 million charge&#8211;discharge cycles, a factor of 80 enhancement over AFE ceramics with large electric hysteresis.

         <title>Excited&#8208;State Engineering Enables Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Exhibiting BT.2020 Color Gamut</title>

Here, an effective approach is proposed to design deep&#8208;blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence&#160;molecules based on hybrid long&#8208; and short&#8208;range charge&#8208;transfer by incorporating multiple donor moieties into organoboron multiple resonance acceptors. The resulting molecule exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission, narrow spectra, and high reverse intersystem crossing&#160;rate. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode fabricated with the designed molecule records maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.8% with the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage&#160;coordinates of (0.163, 0.046).








Abstract
Organic luminescent materials that exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) can convert non&#8208;emissive triplet excitons into emissive singlet states through a reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) process. Therefore, they have tremendous potential for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, with the development of ultra&#8208;high definition 4K/8K display technologies, designing efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF materials to achieve the Commission Internationale de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates fulfilling BT.2020 remains a significant challenge. Here, an effective approach is proposed to design deep&#8208;blue TADF molecules based on hybrid long&#8208; and short&#8208;range charge&#8208;transfer by incorporation of multiple donor moieties into organoboron multiple resonance acceptors. The resulting TADF molecule exhibits deep&#8208;blue emission at 414&#160;nm with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29&#160;nm, together with a thousand&#8208;fold increase in RISC rate. OLEDs based on the champion material achieve a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% with CIE coordinates of (0.163, 0.046), approaching the coordinates of the BT.2020 blue standard. Moreover, TADF&#8208;assisted fluorescence devices employing the designed material as a sensitizer exhibit an exceptional EQE of 33.1%. This work thus provides a blueprint for future development of efficient deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters, representing an important milestone towards meeting the blue color gamut standard of BT.2020.

OLEDs based on the champion material achieve a record maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.8% with CIE coordinates of (0.163, 0.046), approaching the coordinates of the BT.2020 blue standard. Moreover, TADF-assisted fluorescence devices employing the designed material as a sensitizer exhibit an exceptional EQE of 33.1%. This work thus provides a blueprint for future development of efficient deep-blue TADF emitters, representing an important milestone towards meeting the blue color gamut standard of BT.2020.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wearable Coaxially&#8208;Shielded Metamaterial for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from commercial coaxial cable, a wireless, flexible, lightweight, and cheap metamaterial with an internal coaxially&#8208;shielded structure, confining electric field within while possessing a predominant magnetic response for magnetic resonance imaging is constructed. The metamaterial is capable of achieving a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio comparable to or surpass that of commercial receive coil arrays in some aspects.








Abstract
Recent advancements in metamaterials have yielded the possibility of a wireless solution to improve signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Unlike traditional closely packed local coil arrays with rigid designs and numerous components, these lightweight, cost&#8208;effective metamaterials eliminate the need for radio frequency cabling, baluns, adapters, and interfaces. However, their clinical adoption is limited by their low sensitivity, bulky physical footprint, and limited, specific use cases. Herein, a wearable metamaterial developed using commercially available coaxial cable, designed for a 3.0&#160;T MRI system is introduced. This metamaterial inherits the coaxially&#8208;shielded structure of its constituent cable, confining the electric field within and mitigating coupling to its surroundings. This ensures safer clinical adoption, lower signal loss, and resistance to frequency shifts. Weighing only 50&#160;g, the metamaterial maximizes its sensitivity by conforming to the anatomical region of interest. MRI images acquired using this metamaterial with various pulse sequences achieve an SNR comparable or even surpass that of a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 16&#8208;channel knee coil. This work introduces a novel paradigm for constructing metamaterials in the MRI environment, paving the way for the development of next&#8208;generation wireless MRI technology.

         <title>Temperature Dependence of Relativistic Valence Band Splitting Induced by an Altermagnetic Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Altermagnets exhibit momentum&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;split states providing new opportunities for spin electronic devices. Through temperature&#8208;dependent angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and disordered local moment calculations, it is demonstrated that the relativistic valence band splitting of the prototypical MnTe altermagnet is of magnetic origin. This is attributed to a novel relativistic spin&#8208;splitting phenomenon concurrent with the establishment of the altermagnetic order below the N&#233;el temperature.








Abstract
Altermagnetic (AM) materials exhibit non&#8208;relativistic, momentum&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;split states, ushering in new opportunities for spin electronic devices. While the characteristics of spin&#8208;splitting are documented within the framework of the non&#8208;relativistic spin group symmetry, there is limited exploration of the inclusion of relativistic symmetry and its impact on the emergence of a novel spin&#8208;splitting in the band structure. This study delves into the intricate relativistic electronic structure of an AM material, &#945;&#8722;MnTe. Employing temperature&#8208;dependent angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy across the AM phase transition, the emergence of a relativistic valence band splitting concurrent with the establishment of magnetic order is elucidated. This discovery is validated through disordered local moment calculations, modeling the influence of magnetic order on the electronic structure and confirming the magnetic origin of the observed splitting. The temperature&#8208;dependent splitting is ascribed to the advent of relativistic spin&#8208;splitting resulting from the strengthening of AM order in &#945;&#8722;MnTe as the temperature decreases. This sheds light on a previously unexplored facet of this intriguing material.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Crack Formation on DNA Film via Organic Solvent&#8208;Induced Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orientation control is possible for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in a hydrated state, and this affects to create cracks induced by drying. A method is for controlled crack generation in oriented DNA films by inducing mechanical fractures through organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration (OSID). The straightforward approach devised for aligning cracks has the potential for use in various patterning applications.








Abstract
Crack is found on the soil when severe drought comes, which inspires the idea to rationalize patterning applications using dried deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) film. DNA is one of the massively produced biomaterials in nature, showing the lyotropic liquid crystal (LC) phase in highly concentrated conditions. DNA nanostructures in the hydrated condition can be orientation controlled, which can be extended to make dryinginduced cracks. The controlled crack generation in oriented DNA films by inducing mechanical fracture through organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration (OSID) using tetrahydrofuran (THF) is explored. The corresponding simulations show a strong correlation between the long axis of DNA due to the shrinkage during the dehydration and in the direction of crack propagation. The cracks are controlled by simple brushing and a 3D printing method. This facile way of aligning cracks will be used in potential patterning applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Ceramics Enhanced Droplet Electricity Generator for Energy Harvesting and Bacterial Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper presents a novel method to enhance output of droplet electricity generator (DEG) by high entropy ceramics. Further development is made in expanding the application scope of high&#8208;output DEG, not only enhancing energy harvesting efficiency but also promoting the development of single&#8208;droplet&#8208;electricity&#8208;generator&#8208;based biosensors.









Abstract
The droplet electricity generator (DEG) is a solid&#8211;liquid triboelectric nanogenerator with transistor&#8208;inspired bulk effect, which is regarded as an effective strategy for raindrop energy harvesting. However, further enhancement of DEG output voltage is necessary to enable its widespread applications. Here, high&#8208;entropy ceramics are integrated into the design of DEG intermediate layer for the first time, achieving a high output voltage of 525 V. High&#8208;entropy ceramics have colossal dielectric constant, which can help to reduce the triboelectric charge decay for DEG. Furthermore, the effect of factors on DEG output performance when employing high&#8208;entropy ceramics as the intermediate layer is extensively analyzed, and the underlying mechanisms and mathematical models are explored. Finally, the enhanced output voltage of DEG not only facilitates faster energy harvesting but also develops a novel method for rapid bacterial detection. This work successfully integrates high&#8208;entropy ceramics into DEG design, significantly enhances the output voltage, and offers a novel direction for DEG development.

         <title>Endothermic Charge Separation Occurs Spontaneously in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor/Polymer Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Endothermic charge separation is found to occur spontaneously in a non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA)&#8208;based bulk heterostructure (PM6:Y6), which can be driven by entropy. This process can produce free carriers even with a small interfacial energy level offset, which can contribute to the high performance found in recent NFA organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency close to 20%. These NFA OPVs can generate free carriers efficiently despite a very small energy level offset at the donor/acceptor interface. Why these NFAs can enable efficient charge separation (CS) with low energy losses remains an open question. Here, the CS process in the PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction is probed by time&#8208;resolved two&#8208;photon photoemission spectroscopy. It is found that the CS, the conversion from bound charge transfer (CT) excitons to free carriers, is an endothermic process with an enthalpy barrier of 0.15&#160;eV. The CS can occur spontaneously despite being an endothermic process, which implies that it is driven by entropy. It is further argued that the morphology of the PM6:Y6 film and the anisotropic electron delocalization restrict the electron and hole wavefunctions within the CT exciton such that they can primarily contact each other through point&#8208;like junctions. This configuration can maximize the entropic driving force.

     alt="Endothermic Charge Separation Occurs Spontaneously in Non-Fullerene Acceptor/Polymer Bulk Heterojunction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endothermic charge separation is found to occur spontaneously in a non-fullerene acceptor (NFA)-based bulk heterostructure (PM6:Y6), which can be driven by entropy. This process can produce free carriers even with a small interfacial energy level offset, which can contribute to the high performance found in recent NFA organic photovoltaics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency close to 20%. These NFA OPVs can generate free carriers efficiently despite a very small energy level offset at the donor/acceptor interface. Why these NFAs can enable efficient charge separation (CS) with low energy losses remains an open question. Here, the CS process in the PM6:Y6 bulk heterojunction is probed by time-resolved two-photon photoemission spectroscopy. It is found that the CS, the conversion from bound charge transfer (CT) excitons to free carriers, is an endothermic process with an enthalpy barrier of 0.15&#160;eV. The CS can occur spontaneously despite being an endothermic process, which implies that it is driven by entropy. It is further argued that the morphology of the PM6:Y6 film and the anisotropic electron delocalization restrict the electron and hole wavefunctions within the CT exciton such that they can primarily contact each other through point-like junctions. This configuration can maximize the entropic driving force.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Elevating Charge Transport Layer for Stable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique nanostructure of elevated hole transport layer between the perovskite grains is introduced to effectively inhibit ion migration in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes, achieving a record operational half&#8208;lifetime of 256 and 1774 h under current densities of 100 and 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#65292; respectively.








Abstract
Ion migration is a major factor affecting the long term stability of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), which limits their commercialization potential. The accumulation of excess halide ions at the grain boundaries of perovskite films is a primary cause of ion migration in these devices. Here, it is demonstrated that the channels of ion migrations can be effectively impeded by elevating the hole transport layer between the perovskite grain boundaries, resulting in highly stable perovskite LEDs. The unique structure is achieved by reducing the wettability of the perovskites, which prevents infiltration of the upper hole&#8208;transporting layer into the spaces of perovskite grain boundaries. Consequently, nanosized gaps are formed between the excess halide ions and the hole transport layer, effectively suppressing ion migration. With this structure, perovskite LEDs with operational half&#8208;lifetimes of 256 and 1774 h under current densities of 100 and 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 respectively are achieved. These lifetimes surpass those of organic LEDs at high brightness. It is further found that this approach can be extended to various perovskite LEDs, showing great promise for promoting perovskite LEDs toward commercial applications.

         <title>Neutrophil Extracellular Traps&#8208;Inhibiting and Fouling&#8208;Resistant Polysulfoxides Potently Prevent Postoperative Adhesion, Tumor Recurrence, and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>

Wang and colleagues have crafted and evaluated a sulfoxide&#8208;containing homopolymer, PMeSEA, distinguished by its pronounced fouling resistance and the capability to inhibit neutrophil extracellular traps. These properties endow PMeSEA with the inherent capacity to simultaneously prevent a spectrum of postoperative complications, including postoperative adhesion, tumor recurrence, and metastasis.








Abstract
Peritoneal metastasis (PM) is considered one of the most dreaded forms of cancer metastases for both patients and physicians. Aggressive cytoreductive surgery (CRS) is the primary treatment for peritoneal metastasis. Unfortunately, this intensive treatment frequently causes clinical complications, such as postoperative recurrence, metastasis, and adhesion formation. Emerging evidence suggests that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by inflammatory neutrophils contribute to these complications. Effective NET&#8208;targeting strategies thus show considerable potential in counteracting these complications but remain challenging. Here, one type of sulfoxide&#8208;containing homopolymer, PMeSEA, with potent fouling&#8208;resistant and NET&#8208;inhibiting capabilities, is synthesized and screened. Hydrating sulfoxide groups endow PMeSEA with superior nonfouling ability, significantly inhibiting protein/cell adhesion. Besides, the polysulfoxides can be selectively oxidized by ClO&#8722; which is required to stabilize the NETs rather than H2O2, and ClO&#8722; scavenging effectively inhibits NETs formation without disturbing redox homeostasis in tumor cells and quiescent neutrophils. As a result, PMeSEA potently prevents postoperative adhesions, significantly suppresses peritoneal metastasis, and shows synergetic antitumor activity with chemotherapeutic 5&#8208;Fluorouracil. Moreover, coupling CRS with PMeSEA potently inhibits CRS&#8208;induced tumor metastatic relapse and postoperative adhesions. Notably, PMeSEA exhibits low in vivo acute and subacute toxicities, implying significant potential for clinical postoperative adjuvant treatment.

         <title>Realization of Fine&#8208;Tuning the Lattice Thermal Conductivity and Anharmonicity in Layered Semiconductors via Entropy Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;range mixing entropy engineering is realized in a series of layered semiconductors. Dominating Umklapp three&#8208;phonon scattering process mechanism is revealed by the linear &#954;&#8208;T&#8722;1 behavior. Fine tuning of lattice thermal conductivity is achieved with an almost linear &#916;Smix dependence. The slope of the &#954;&#8208;T&#8722;1 curve reduces with increasing &#916;Smix, revealing a linear response to the reduced Gr&#252;neisen parameter.








Abstract
Entropy engineering is widely proven to be effective in achieving ultra&#8208;low thermal conductivity for well&#8208;performed thermoelectric and heat management applications. However, no strong correlation between entropy and lattice thermal conductivity is found until now, and the fine&#8208;tuning of thermal conductivity continuously via entropy&#8208;engineering in a wide entropy range is still lacking. Here, a series of high&#8208;entropy layered semiconductors, Ni1&#8722;x(Fe0.25Co0.25Mn0.25Zn0.25)xPS3, where 0 &#8804; x &lt; 1, with low mass/size disorder is designed. High&#8208;purity samples with mixing configuration entropy of metal atomic site in a wide range of 0&#8211;1.61R are achieved. Umklapp phonon&#8208;phonon scattering is found to be the dominating phonon scattering mechanism, as revealed by the linear T&#8722;1 dependence of thermal conductivity. Meanwhile, fine tuning of the lattice thermal conductivity via continuous entropy engineering at metal atomic sites is achieved, in an almost linear dependence in middle&#8208;/high&#8208; entropy range. Moreover, the slope of the &#954;&#160;&#8208; T&#8722;1 curve reduces with the increase in entropy, and a linear response of the reduced Gr&#252;neisen parameter is revealed. This work provides an entropy engineering strategy by choosing multiple metal elements with low mass/size disorder to achieve the fine tuning of the lattice thermal conductivity and the anharmonic effect.

         <title>SHG Assisted Mixed&#8208;Phases Anatomizing in a Molecular Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an advanced molecular ferroelectric with amalgamation of two symmetric phases (phase &#945; and phase &#947;). The mixing profile, as unveiled by Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) polarimetry, is predominantly at the nanoscale, as opposed to mixed grains. The transition process between the two symmetric phases is facilitated through the application of an external electrical field.








Abstract
Anatomizing mixed&#8208;phases, referring to analyzing the mixing profiles and quantifying the phases&#8217; proportions in a material, which is of great significance in the genuine applications. Here, by using second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)&#160;polarimetry and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) techniques, this work elucidates the contributions and distributions of two different symmetric phases mixed in an archetype monoaxial molecular ferroelectric, diisopropylammonium chloride (DIPACl). The two competing phases are preferred in thermodynamics or kinetic process respectively, and this work evidences the switching behavior between the two competing phases facilitated by an external electrical field as opposed to a heating process. This research contributes novel insights into phase engineering in the field of molecular ferroelectrics and is poised to serve as a potent analytical tool for subsequent applications.

The two competing phases are preferred in thermodynamics or kinetic process respectively, and this work evidences the switching behavior between the two competing phases facilitated by an external electrical field as opposed to a heating process. This research contributes novel insights into phase engineering in the field of molecular ferroelectrics and is poised to serve as a potent analytical tool for subsequent applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Directional Assembly of Liquid Crystal Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond laser direct writing technology enables high&#8208;resolution, single&#8208;step programmable 3D assembly of liquid crystal (LC)&#160;molecules. This method utilizes the light field directly to assemble LC molecules in 3D space without additional alignment. In the field of molecular directional assembly, this technology is anticipated to overcome weak intermolecular interactions and facilitate the assembly of molecules into long&#8208;range ordered structures.








Abstract
The precise construction of hierarchically long&#8208;range ordered structures using molecules as fundamental building blocks can fully harness their anisotropy and potential. However, the 3D, high&#8208;precision, and single&#8208;step directional assembly of molecules is a long&#8208;pending challenge. Here, a 3D directional molecular assembly strategy via femtosecond laser direct writing (FsLDW) is proposed and the feasibility of this approach using liquid crystal (LC) molecules as an illustrative example is demonstrated. The physical mechanism for femtosecond (fs) laser&#8208;induced assembly of LC molecules is investigated, and precise 3D arbitrary assembly of LC molecules is achieved by defining the discretized laser scanning pathway. Additionally, an LC&#8208;based Fresnel zone plate array with polarization selection and colorization imaging functions is fabricated to further illustrate the potential of this method. This study not only introduces a 3D high&#8208;resolution alignment method for LC&#8208;based functional devices but also establishes a universal protocol for the precise 3D directional assembly of anisotropic molecules.

         <title>Anisotropic 2D van der Waals Magnets Hosting 1D Spin Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic chains of atoms (&#8220;1D magnets&#8221;) have intriguing properties that illuminate fundamental principles in many&#8208;body physics while also promising applications in magnonics and spintronics. This article describes AgCrP2S6 and its family, layered crystals that host magnetic chains, focusing on their highly anisotropic properties and the additional degrees of freedom that can arise from patterning or stacking to engineer the structure.








Abstract
The exploration of 1D magnetism, frequently portrayed as spin chains, constitutes an actively pursued research field that illuminates fundamental principles in many&#8208;body problems and applications in magnonics and spintronics. The inherent reduction in dimensionality often leads to robust spin fluctuations, impacting magnetic ordering and resulting in novel magnetic phenomena. Here, structural, magnetic, and optical properties of highly anisotropic 2D van der Waals antiferromagnets that uniquely host spin chains are explored. First&#8208;principle calculations reveal that the weakest interaction is interchain, leading to essentially 1D magnetic behavior in each layer. With the additional degree of freedom arising from its anisotropic structure, the structure is engineered by alloying, varying the 1D spin chain lengths using electron beam irradiation, or twisting for localized patterning, and spin textures are calculated, predicting robust stability of the antiferromagnetic ordering. Comparing with other spin chain magnets, these materials are anticipated to bring fresh perspectives on harvesting low&#8208;dimensional magnetism.

         <title>Interfacially Enhanced Superconductivity in Fe(Te,Se)/Bi4Te3 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seeking to understand new routes to control exotic topological superconductors, it is reported that superconductivity can be controlled at an atomically precise, epitaxial interface with the topological insulator Bi4Te3 in comparison to Bi2Te3. This finding, at the clean, low&#8208;Se&#8208;doping regime may be critical for emerging applications in quantum information science.








Abstract
Realizing topological superconductivity by integrating high&#8208;transition&#8208;temperature (TC) superconductors with topological insulators can open new paths for quantum computing applications. Here, a new approach is reported for increasing the superconducting transition temperature (TConset)$( {T_{\mathrm{C}}^{{\mathrm{onset}}}} )$ by interfacing the unconventional superconductor Fe(Te,Se) with the topological insulator Bi&#8211;Te system in the low&#8208;Se doping regime, near where superconductivity vanishes in the bulk. The critical finding is that the TConset$T_{\mathrm{C}}^{{\mathrm{onset}}}$ of Fe(Te,Se) increases from nominally non&#8208;superconducting to as high as 12.5&#160;K when Bi2Te3 is replaced with the topological phase Bi4Te3. Interfacing Fe(Te,Se) with Bi4Te3 is also found to be critical for stabilizing superconductivity in monolayer films where TConset$T_{\mathrm{C}}^{{\mathrm{onset}}}$ can be as high as 6&#160;K. Measurements of the electronic and crystalline structure of the Bi4Te3 layer reveal that a large electron transfer, epitaxial strain, and novel chemical reduction processes are critical factors for the enhancement of superconductivity. This novel route for enhancing TC in an important epitaxial system provides new insight on the nature of interfacial superconductivity and a platform to identify and utilize new electronic phases.

         <title>Ultrauniform Plating of Lithium on 10&#8208;nm&#8208;Scale Ordered Carbon Grids for Long Lifespan Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tailoring the structure of Li plating substrate at a scale down to 10&#160;nm is achieved by decorating graphene with ordered carbon grids. Unlike the situation on flat reduced graphene oxide, where isolated Li nuclei are observed, the nucleation of Li is intrinsically inhibited on such a textile substrate with characteristic size below the thermodynamic critical nucleation size of Li. The continuous, dense, and planar plating on such a carbon thus significantly improves the cycling stability of Li metal anode.








Abstract
Tailorable lithium (Li) nucleation and uniform early&#8208;stage plating is essential for long&#8208;lifespan Li metal batteries. Among factors influencing the early plating of Li anode, the substrate is critical, but a fine control of the substrate structure on a scale of &#8776;10&#160;nm has been rarely achieved. Herein, a carbon consisting of ordered grids is prepared, as a model to investigate the effect of substrate structure on the Li nucleation. In contrast to the individual spherical Li nuclei formed on the flat graphene, an ultrauniform and nuclei&#8208;free Li plating is obtained on the ordered carbon with a grid size smaller than the thermodynamical critical radius of Li nucleation (&#8776;26&#160;nm). Simultaneously, an inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase is promoted by the cross&#8208;sectional carbon layers of such ordered grids which are exposed to the electrolyte. Consequently, the carbon grids with a grid size of &#8776;10&#160;nm show a favorable cycling stability for more than 1100 cycles measured at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a half cell. With LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as cathode, the assembled full cell with a cathode capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2 and a negative/positive ratio of 1.67 demonstrates a stable cycling for over 130 cycles with a capacity retention of 88%.

         <title>Singular Hall Response from a Correlated Ferromagnetic Flat Nodal&#8208;Line Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A singular Hall response arising from a unique band structure of flat topological nodal lines in combination with electron correlation in a layered room&#8208;temperature ferromagnet, Fe3GaTe2 is reported. Exceptionally high anomalous Hall conductivity violating the conventional scaling, resistivity upturn at low temperatures, and a large Sommerfeld coefficient of Fe3GaTe2 imply heavy fermion features in the ferromagnetic topological material.








Abstract
Topological quantum phases are largely understood in weakly correlated systems, which have identified various quantum phenomena, such as the spin Hall effect, protected transport of helical fermions, and topological superconductivity. Robust ferromagnetic order in correlated topological materials particularly attracts attention, as it can provide a versatile platform for novel quantum devices. Here, a singular Hall response arising from a unique band structure of flat topological nodal lines in combination with electron correlation in a van der Waals ferromagnetic semimetal, Fe3GaTe2, with a high Curie temperature of Tc = 347 K is reported. High anomalous Hall conductivity violating the conventional scaling, resistivity upturn at low temperature, and a large Sommerfeld coefficient are observed in Fe3GaTe2, which implies heavy fermion features in this ferromagnetic topological material. The scanning tunneling microscopy, circular dichroism in angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations support the original electronic features of the material. Thus, low&#8208;dimensional Fe3GaTe2 with electronic correlation, topology, and room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic order appears to be a promising candidate for robust quantum devices.

         <title>Tailoring the Electrochemical Responses of MOF&#8208;74 Via Dual&#8208;Defect Engineering for Superior Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;defects engineering of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) is performed to manipulate the electrochemical response. Using&#160;salicylic acid and cobalt doping for defect introduction, the modified MOF exhibits 4.4 times the discharging capacity of the original, resulting in a superior cathode for Ni&#8211;Zn batteries. The comprehensive investigations provide critical insights into the electrochemical reconfiguration mechanism.








Abstract
Rationally designed defects in a crystal can confer unique properties. This study showcases a novel dual&#8208;defects engineering strategy to tailor the electrochemical response of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials used for electrochemical energy storage. Salicylic acid (SA) is identified as an effective modulator to control MOF&#8208;74 growth and induce structural defects, and cobalt cation doping is adopted for introducing a second type of defect. The resulting dual&#8208;defects engineered bimetallic MOF exhibits a discharging capacity of 218.6 mAh g&#8722;1, 4.4 times that of the pristine MOF&#8208;74, and significantly improved cycling stability. Moreover, the engineered MOF&#8208;74(Ni0.675Co0.325)&#8208;8//Zn aqueous battery shows top energy/power density performances for Ni&#8211;Zn batteries (266.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, 17.22&#160;kW kg&#8722;1). Comprehensive investigations reveal that engineered defects modify the local coordination environment and promote the in situ electrochemical reconfiguration during operation to significantly boost the electrochemical activity. This work suggests that rational tailoring of the defects within the MOF crystal is an effective strategy to manipulate the coordination environment of the metal centers and the corresponding electrochemical reconfiguration for electrochemical applications.

         <title>A Naturally Inspired Extrusion&#8208;Based Microfluidic Approach for Manufacturing Tailorable Magnetic Soft Continuum Microrobotic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, microfluidics is leveraged to precisely control reaction&#8208;diffusion (RD) processes for generating multifunctional and compartmentalized alginate&#8208;based microfibers. This nature&#8208;inspired RD process allows for producing sophisticated fibers acting as magnetic soft continuum robots. The method allows for tailoring the stiffness and magnetic responsiveness of the microfibers via customizing the geometry, degree of cross&#8208;linking, and spatial localization of magnetic nanoparticles.








Abstract
Soft materials play a crucial role in small&#8208;scale robotic applications by closely mimicking the complex motion and morphing behavior of organisms. However, conventional fabrication methods face challenges in creating highly integrated small&#8208;scale soft devices. In this study, microfluidics is leveraged to precisely control reaction&#8208;diffusion (RD) processes to generate multifunctional and compartmentalized calcium&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable alginate&#8208;based microfibers. Under RD conditions, sophisticated alginate&#8208;based fibers are produced for magnetic soft continuum robotics applications with customizable features, such as geometry (compact or hollow), degree of cross&#8208;linking, and the precise localization of magnetic nanoparticles (inside the core, surrounding the fiber, or on one side). This fine control allows for tuning the stiffness and magnetic responsiveness of the microfibers. Additionally, chemically cleavable regions within the fibers enable disassembly into smaller robotic units or roll&#8208;up structures under a rotating magnetic field. These findings demonstrate the versatility of microfluidics in processing highly integrated small&#8208;scale devices.

         <title>Unzippable Siamese Nanoparticles for Programmed Two&#8208;Stage Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detachable Siamese nanoparticles (SIANPs) are programmed to separate in responding to abundant extracellular adenosine triphosphate in the tumor microenvironment, conferring two&#8208;pronged delivery of epigenetic drugs and immune modulators to tumor cells and myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), respectively. SIANP treatment prevents MDSC induction driven by epigenetic drugs, enabling epigenetic therapy in solid tumors such as breast and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Epigenetic drugs (epi&#8208;drugs) can destruct cancer cells and initiate both innate and adaptive immunity, yet they have achieved very limited success in solid tumors so far, partly attributing to their concurrent induction of the myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cell (MDSC) population. Here, dissociable Siamese nanoparticles (SIANPs) are developed for tumor cell&#8208;targeted delivery of epi&#8208;drug CM&#8208;272 and MDSC&#8208;targeted delivery of small molecule inhibitor Ibrutinib. The SIANPs are assembled via interparticle DNA annealing and detached via tumor microenvironment&#8208;triggered strand separation. Such binary regulation induces endogenous retrovirus expression and immunogenic cell death in tumor cells while restraining the immunosuppressive effects of MDSCs, and synergistically promotes dendritic cell maturation and CD8+ T cell activation for tumor inhibition. Significantly, immune microenvironment remodeling via SIANPs further overcomes tumor resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. This study represents a two&#8208;pronged approach for orchestrating immune responses, and paves a new way for employing epi&#8208;drugs in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Promotion of Probabilistic Bit Generation in Mott Devices by Embedded Metal Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Randomness of p&#8208;bit streams generated via the pump&#8211;probe pulse inputs can be increased by the deliberate incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NPs), which influence the transient dynamics of switchable domains in VO2 Mott switches. The study presents a novel strategy that exploits nanoscale phase control to maximize the generation of nondeterministic information sources for energy&#8208;efficient probabilistic computing hardware.








Abstract
Considerable attention has been drawn to the use of volatile two&#8208;terminal devices relying on the Mott transition for the stochastic generation of probabilistic bits (p&#8208;bits) in emerging probabilistic computing. To improve randomness and endurance of bit streams provided by these devices, delicate control of the transient evolution of switchable domains is required to enhance stochastic p&#8208;bit generation. Herein, it is demonstrated that the randomness of p&#8208;bit streams generated via the consecutive pulse inputs of pump&#8211;probe protocols can be increased by the deliberate incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NPs), which influence the transient dynamics of the nanoscale metallic phase in VO2 Mott switches. Among the vertically stacked Pt&#8208;NP&#8208;containing VO2 threshold switches, those with higher Pt NP density show a considerably wider range of p&#8208;bit operation (e.g., up to &#8776;300% increase in &#916;Vprobe upon going from (Pt NP/VO2)0 to (Pt NP/VO2)11) and can therefore be operated under the conditions of high speed (400 kbit s&#8722;1), low power consumption (14 nJ per bit), and high stability (&gt;105&#160;200 bits) for p&#8208;bit generation. Thus, the study presents a novel strategy that exploits nanoscale phase control to maximize the generation of nondeterministic information sources for energy&#8208;efficient probabilistic computing hardware.

&lt;p&gt;Randomness of p-bit streams generated via the pump&#8211;probe pulse inputs can be increased by the deliberate incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NPs), which influence the transient dynamics of switchable domains in VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Mott switches. The study presents a novel strategy that exploits nanoscale phase control to maximize the generation of nondeterministic information sources for energy-efficient probabilistic computing hardware.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerable attention has been drawn to the use of volatile two-terminal devices relying on the Mott transition for the stochastic generation of probabilistic bits (p-bits) in emerging probabilistic computing. To improve randomness and endurance of bit streams provided by these devices, delicate control of the transient evolution of switchable domains is required to enhance stochastic p-bit generation. Herein, it is demonstrated that the randomness of p-bit streams generated via the consecutive pulse inputs of pump&#8211;probe protocols can be increased by the deliberate incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NPs), which influence the transient dynamics of the nanoscale metallic phase in VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Mott switches. Among the vertically stacked Pt-NP-containing VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; threshold switches, those with higher Pt NP density show a considerably wider range of p-bit operation (e.g., up to &#8776;300% increase in &#916;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;probe&lt;/sub&gt; upon going from (Pt NP/VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to (Pt NP/VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;) and can therefore be operated under the conditions of high speed (400 kbit s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), low power consumption (14 nJ per bit), and high stability (&amp;gt;105&#160;200 bits) for p-bit generation. Thus, the study presents a novel strategy that exploits nanoscale phase control to maximize the generation of nondeterministic information sources for energy-efficient probabilistic computing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>3D Printed Room Temperature Phosphorescence Materials Enabled by Edible Natural Konjac Glucomannan</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious design strategy is developed to construct sophisticated 3D room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) architectures with high fidelity and mechanical strength via direct ink writing&#8208;based 3D printing and freeze&#8208;drying. Konjac glucomannan with decent rheological properties can anchor arylboronic acid chromophores with various &#960; conjugations via B&#9472;O covalent bonds in pure water to afford 3D&#8208;printable inks.








Abstract
Shaping room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials into 3D bodies is important for stereoscopic optoelectronic displays but remains challenging due to their poor processability and mechanical properties. Here, konjac glucomannan (KGM) is employed to anchor arylboronic acids with various &#960; conjugations via a facile B&#9472;O covalent reaction to afford printable inks, using which full&#8208;color high&#8208;fidelity 3D RTP objects with high mechanical strength can be obtained via direct ink writing&#8208;based 3D printing and freeze&#8208;drying. The doubly rigid structure supplied by the synergy of hydrogen bonding and B&#9472;O covalent bonding can protect the triplet excitons; thus, the prepared 3D RTP object shows a striking lifetime of 2.14 s. The printed counterparts are successfully used for 3D anti&#8208;counterfeiting and can be recycled and reprinted nondestructively by dissolving in water. This success expands the scope of printable 3D luminescent materials, providing an eco&#8208;friendly platform for the additive manufacturing of sophisticated 3D RTP architectures.

         <title>Cultivating High&#8208;Performance Flexible All&#8208;in&#8208;One Supercapacitors With 3D Network Through Continuous Biosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor is cultivated through a continuous biosynthesis, harnessing uninterrupted 3D network during the growth of bacterial cellulose. The design establishes a seamless electrode&#8211;separator&#8211;electrode structure and facilitates stress transfer within and between layers. Thereby, the supercapacitor demonstrates remarkable shear and bending resistance, presenting a promising approach for the integrated development of high&#8208;performance flexible power sources.








Abstract
Flexible supercapacitors can potentially power next&#8208;generation flexible electronics. However, the mechanical and electrochemical stability of flexible supercapacitors under different flexible conditions is limited by the weak bonding between adjacent layers, posing a significant hindrance to their practical applicability. Herein, based on the uninterrupted 3D network during the growth of bacterial cellulose (BC), a flexible all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor is cultivated through a continuous biosynthesis process. This strategy ensures the continuity of the 3D network of BC throughout the material, thereby forming a continuous electrode&#8211;separator&#8211;electrode structure. Benefitting from this bioinspired structure, the all&#8208;in&#8208;one supercapacitor not only achieves a high areal capacitance (3.79 F cm&#8722;2) of electrodes but also demonstrates the integration of high tensile strength (2.15&#160;MPa), high shear strength (more than 54.6&#160;kPa), and high bending resistance, indicating a novel pathway toward high&#8208;performance flexible power sources.

         <title>Enhanced Infrared Vision by Nonlinear Up&#8208;Conversion in Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Imaging of short&#8208;wave infrared (IR) light has essential applications in surveillance and autonomous navigation. However, it typically relies on complex cameras that incorporate narrow&#8208;band semiconductors. This research demonstrates IR imaging using nonlinear up&#8208;conversion to the visible with an ultra&#8208;compact, high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor lithium niobate metasurface. Despite the strong metasurface nonlocality, the method produces high&#8208;quality images with efficient conversion and high resolution.








Abstract
The ability to detect and image short&#8208;wave infrared light has important applications in surveillance, autonomous navigation, and biological imaging. However, the current infrared imaging technologies often pose challenges due to large footprint, large thermal noise and inability to augment infrared and visible imaging. Here, infrared imaging is demonstrated by nonlinear up&#8208;conversion to the visible in an ultra&#8208;compact, high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor lithium niobate resonant metasurface. Images with high conversion efficiency and resolution quality are obtained despite the strong nonlocality of the metasurface. The possibility of edge&#8208;detection image processing augmented with direct up&#8208;conversion imaging for advanced night vision applications is further&#160;shown.

         <title>Heterostructures via a Solution&#8208;Based Anion Exchange in Microcrystalline 2D Layered Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work outlines solution&#8208;based processes to obtain in&#8208;plane heterojunctions in two&#8208;dimensional layered perovskites with different halide composition. The obtained microcrystalline heterostructures have a core&#8208;shell architecture with distinctly different optical properties in the different crystal phases. This work elucidates the underlying reaction mechanisms that depend strongly on the exchange route, leading either to vacancy&#8208;assisted diffusion, or dissolution&#8208;recrystallization processes.








Abstract
Layered perovskites consist of stacks of inorganic semiconducting metal&#8208;halide octahedra lattices sandwiched between organic layers with typically dielectric behavior. The in&#8208;plane confinement of electrical carriers in such two&#8208;dimensional metal halide perovskites drives a large range of appealing electronic properties, such as strong exciton binding, anisotropic charge diffusion, and polarization&#8208;directionality. Heterostructures provide additional control on carrier diffusion and localization, and in&#8208;plane heterojunctions are interesting because of the associated high charge mobility. Here, this work demonstrates a versatile solution&#8208;based approach to fabricate in&#8208;plane heterostructures with different halide composition in two&#8208;dimensional lead&#8208;halide perovskite microcrystals. This leads to spatially separated halide phases with different band gap and light emission. Interestingly, the composition of the exchanged phase and the morphology of the phase boundary depends on the exchange route, which can be related to the preferred localization of the halides at the equatorial or axial octahedra positions that either leads to dissolution and recrystallization of the octahedra lattice (for bromide to iodide), or allows for ion diffusion within the lattice (for iodide to bromide). These detailed insights on the ion exchange processes in layered perovskites will stimulate the development of heterostructures that can be tailored for different applications such as photocatalysis, energy storage, and light emission.

         <title>Immunoregulatory Engineering of Semiconducting Charge&#8208;Reversal Nanoantioxidant for Ameliorating Cancer Radioimmunotheranostics</title>

A versatile X&#8208;ray theranostic nano&#8208;antioxidant (XTN) is developed to prevent normal tissues from oxidative damage and induce systematic and robust anticancer immunity. In the bilateral 4T1 tumor model, XTN plus radiotherapy (RT) remarkably boosts the abscopal effect and induce durable immunological memory against tumor growth.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is a crucial clinical modality for cancer. However, nonselectivity, toxicity to normal tissues, and radio&#8208;resistance severely limit RT applications. This study develops a versatile X&#8208;ray theranostic nano&#8208;antioxidant (XTN) to prevent normal tissues from oxidative damage and induce systematic and robust anticancer immunity. XTN owns NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic (PA) imaging properties for precise discrimination of the tumor margin through, thereby improving the accuracy of RT. Additionally, XTN is a nano&#8208;antioxidant to enhance the cell viability of normal cells after irradiation. Most importantly, XTN scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the TME to preserve the stimulatory activity of released high mobility group protein B1 to dendritic cells (DCs) and recover T cells&#8217; immune function. Meanwhile, XTN achieves charge&#8208;reversal specifically releasing an immunomodulator (demethylcantharidin, DMC) in the acidic TME. Moreover, the specifically released DMC inhibits protein phosphatase&#8208;2A activity and reduces regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation. In the bilateral 4T1 tumor model, XTN&#8208;mediated radioimmunotherapy remarkably boosts a systemic antitumor immune response and induces durable immunological memory against tumor growth.

         <title>Linearly Polarized Broadband Emission and Multiwavelength Lasing in Solution&#8208;Processed Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, by adjusting the structural polarization and energy transfer in quantum dots, linearly polarized broadband emission and multiwavelength lasers in the visible and near&#8208;infrared wavelength ranges are demonstrated by incorporating Er3+&#8208;doped Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.98Bi0.02Cl6 double perovskite quantum dots into solution&#8208;processable silica structure. This work offers a promising light source for future photonic integrated circuits targeted at high&#8208;capacity optical applications.








Abstract
A miniature laser with linear polarization is a long sought&#8208;after component of photonic integrated circuits. In particular, for multiwavelength polarization lasers, it supports simultaneous access to multiple, widely varying laser wavelengths in a small spatial region, which is of great significance for advancing applications such as optical computing, optical storage, and optical sensing. However, there is a trade&#8208;off between the size of small&#8208;scale lasers and laser performance, and multiwavelength co&#8208;gain of laser media and multicavity micromachining in the process of laser miniaturization remain as significant challenges. Herein, room&#8208;temperature linearly polarized multiwavelength lasers in the visible and near&#8208;infrared wavelength ranges are demonstrated, by fabricating random cavities scattered with silica in an Er&#8208;doped Cs2Ag0.4Na0.6In0.98Bi0.02Cl6 double&#8208;perovskite quantum dots gain membrane. By regulating the local symmetry and enabling effective energy transfer in nanocrystals, multiwavelength lasers with ultralow thresholds are achieved at room temperature. The maximum degree of polarization reaches 0.89. With their advantages in terms of miniaturization, ultralow power consumption, and adaptability for integration, these lasers offer a prospective light source for future photonic integrated circuits aimed at high&#8208;capacity optical applications.

         <title>Lead Isolation and Capture in Perovskite Photovoltaics toward Eco&#8208;Friendly Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes the concept of an all&#8208;round detoxification strategy of&#8201; &#8220;lead isolation and capture&#8221; on perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for the first time, and the adequate in vivo experiments in mice reveal that this material has significant inhibitory effect on the toxicity of perovskite. This strategy can further enhance the device performance, achieving an impressive power conversion efficiency of 25.19%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are developed rapidly in efficiency and stability in recent years, which can compete with silicon solar cells. However, an important obstacle to the commercialization of PSCs is the toxicity of lead ions (Pb2+) from water&#8208;soluble perovskites. The entry of free Pb2+ into organisms can cause severe harm to humans, such as blood lead poisoning, organ failure, etc. Therefore, this work reports a &#8220;lead isolation&#8208;capture&#8221; dual detoxification strategy with calcium disodium edetate (EDTA Na&#8208;Ca), which can inhibit lead leakage from PSCs under extreme conditions. More importantly, leaked lead exists in a nontoxic aggregation state chelated by EDTA. For the first time, in vivo experiments are conducted in mice to systematically prove that this material has a significant inhibitory effect on the toxicity of perovskites. In addition, this strategy can further enhance device performance, enabling the optimized devices to achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.19%. This innovative strategy is a major breakthrough in the research on the prevention of lead toxicity in PSCs.

         <title>Room Temperature Reduction of Nitrogen Oxide on Iron Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking a natural enzyme, a sustainable, reducible iron MOF is able to selectively decompose NO
and NO2 into N2 and O2 in ambient conditions, without any reducing agent. This contributes to solve a long&#8208;standing problem in air purification and emissions control, opens new perspectives in heterogeneous catalysis and bridges the gap between homogeneous, enzymatic and heterogeneous catalysis.








Abstract
Nitrogen oxides represent one of the main threats for the environment. Despite decades of intensive research efforts, a sustainable solution for NOx removal under environmental conditions is still undefined. Using theoretical modelling, material design, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art investigation methods and mimicking enzymes, it is found that selected porous hybrid iron(II/III) based MOF material are able to decompose NOx, at room temperature, in the presence of water and oxygen, into N2 and O2 and without reducing agents. This paves the way to the development of new highly sustainable heterogeneous catalysts to improve air quality.

         <title>Structurally Tunable Donor&#8722;Bridge&#8722;Fluorophore Architecture Enables Highly Efficient and Concentration&#8208;Independent Narrowband Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spatial confinement strategy, denoted as donor&#8722;bridge&#8722;fluorophore architecture, has been proposed to construct highly efficient and concentration&#8208;independent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on B&#8211;N&#8208;containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials. The final established compound BN&#8208;PCz&#8208;TPA&#8208;based devices exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.3% at 10&#160;wt% doping concentrations and remain 32.5% at 20&#160;wt% doping concentration with almost unchanged spectray.








Abstract
Luminescent materials with narrowband emission have extraordinary significance for developing ultrahigh&#8208;definition display. B&#8211;N&#8208;containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials are strong contenders. However, their device performances pervasively encounter detrimental aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect that is highly vulnerable to doping concentration, complicating device fabrication. Therefore, constructing highly efficient and concentration&#8208;independent MR&#8208;TADF emitters is of pragmatic importance for improving device controllability and reproducibility, simplifying manufacturing procedures, and conserving production costs. Here, by systematic arrangement of donor triphenylamine and fluorophore BNCz on distinct bridges, a spatial confinement strategy has been developed with a donor&#8722;bridge&#8722;fluorophore architecture. Structurally fine modulation and progressive evolution to construct molecular entities with congested steric hindrance effect that can suppress intermolecular interactions without substantially affecting the luminescence tone of fluorophore BNCz, resulting in highly efficient and concentration&#8208;independent narrowband emitters; through isomer engineering, two isomers BN&#8208;PCz&#8208;TPA and TPA&#8208;PCz&#8208;BN with different crystal stacking patterns are synthesized by altering the connection mode between triphenylamine and BNCz. As a result, BN&#8208;PCz&#8208;TPA&#8208;based device showcases maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.3% with narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 27 nm at 10 wt% doping concentration. Even at 20 wt% doping concentration, the maximum EQE remains at 32.5% and the emission spectrum is almost unchanged.

&lt;p&gt;A spatial confinement strategy, denoted as donor&#8722;bridge&#8722;fluorophore architecture, has been proposed to construct highly efficient and concentration-independent organic light-emitting diodes based on B&#8211;N-containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence materials. The final established compound BN-PCz-TPA-based devices exhibit maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.3% at 10&#160;wt% doping concentrations and remain 32.5% at 20&#160;wt% doping concentration with almost unchanged spectray.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luminescent materials with narrowband emission have extraordinary significance for developing ultrahigh-definition display. B&#8211;N-containing multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR-TADF) materials are strong contenders. However, their device performances pervasively encounter detrimental aggregation-caused quenching effect that is highly vulnerable to doping concentration, complicating device fabrication. Therefore, constructing highly efficient and concentration-independent MR-TADF emitters is of pragmatic importance for improving device controllability and reproducibility, simplifying manufacturing procedures, and conserving production costs. Here, by systematic arrangement of donor triphenylamine and fluorophore BNCz on distinct bridges, a spatial confinement strategy has been developed with a donor&#8722;bridge&#8722;fluorophore architecture. Structurally fine modulation and progressive evolution to construct molecular entities with congested steric hindrance effect that can suppress intermolecular interactions without substantially affecting the luminescence tone of fluorophore BNCz, resulting in highly efficient and concentration-independent narrowband emitters; through isomer engineering, two isomers BN-PCz-TPA and TPA-PCz-BN with different crystal stacking patterns are synthesized by altering the connection mode between triphenylamine and BNCz. As a result, BN-PCz-TPA-based device showcases maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.3% with narrow full-width at half-maximum of 27 nm at 10 wt% doping concentration. Even at 20 wt% doping concentration, the maximum EQE remains at 32.5% and the emission spectrum is almost unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Cationic Pyridine Sites in Covalent Triazine Framework for Boosting Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The abundant cationic pyridine sites of cationic pyridine&#8208;rich covalent triazine framework (CCTF&#8208;TPMB)&#160;can not only significantly suppress the leakage and shuttle of I2 species (I&#8722;, I3&#8722;, and I5&#8722;) and the occurrence of side reactions on the Zn anode, but also accelerate the conversion reaction of I2 species, enabling good reversibility, high electrochemical activity, and fast reaction kinetics for I2 loaded CCTF&#8208;TPMB cathode based Zinc&#8208;iodine batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (ZIBs) are gaining attention as energy storage devices due to their high energy density, low&#8208;cost, and inherent safety. However, the poor cycling performance of these batteries always arises from the severe leakage and shuttle effect of polyiodides (I3&#8211; and I5&#8211;). Herein, a novel cationic pyridine&#8208;rich covalent triazine framework (CCTF&#8208;TPMB) is developed to capture and confine iodine (I2) species via strong electrostatic interaction, making it an attractive host for I2 in ZIBs. The as&#8208;fabricated ZIBs with I2 loaded CCTF&#8208;TPMB (I2@CCTF&#8208;TPMB) cathode achieve a large specific capacity of 243&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and an exceptionally stable cyclic performance, retaining 93.9% of its capacity over 30&#160;000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. The excellent electrochemical performance of the ZIBs can be attributed to the pyridine&#8208;rich cationic sites of CCTF&#8208;TPMB, which effectively suppress the leakage and shuttle of polyiodides, while also accelerating the conversion reaction of I2 species. Combined in situ Raman and UV&#8211;vis analysis, along with theoretical calculations, clearly reveal the critical role played by pyridine&#8208;rich cationic sites in boosting the ZIBs performances. This work opens up a promising pathway for designing advanced I2 cathode materials toward next&#8208;generation ZIBs and beyond.

         <title>Fast Photoactuation and Environmental Response of Humidity&#8208;Sensitive pDAP&#8208;Silicon Nanocantilevers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocantilevers are made using FIB milling on plasma pDAP&#8208;coated Si nanomembranes. Photoactuation originates in reversible sorption of atmospheric water vapor by the responsive pDAP layer. Rapid photothermal heating leads to the pDAP contraction and cantilever deflection within ms timescales. The straightening is spontaneous, albeit fast, due to the efficient heat dissipation through Si, leading to water absorption and pDAP expansion.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;responsive nanomembranes are a new class of advanced materials that can be harnessed in complex architectures for micro and nano&#8208;manipulators, artificial muscles, energy harvesting, soft robotics, and sensors. The design and fabrication of responsive membranes must meet such challenges as trade&#8208;offs between responsiveness and mechanical durability, volumetric low&#8208;cost production ensuring low environmental impact, and compatibility with standard technologies or biological systems This work demonstrates the fabrication of multi&#8208;responsive, mechanically robust poly(1,3&#8208;diaminopropane) (pDAP) nanomembranes and their application in fast photoactuators. The pDAP films are developed using a plasma&#8208;assisted polymerization technique that offers large&#8208;scale production and versatility of potential industrial relevance. The pDAP layers exhibit high elasticity with the Young's modulus of &#8776;7 GPa and remarkable mechanical durability across 20&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C temperatures. Notably, pDAP membranes reveal immediate and reversible contraction triggered by light, rising temperature, or reducing relative humidity underpinned by a reversible water sorption mechanism. These features enable the fabrication of photoactuators composed of pDAP&#8208;coated Si nanocantilevers, demonstrating ms timescale response to light, tens of &#181;m deflections, and robust performance up to kHz frequencies. These results advance fundamental research on multi&#8208;responsive nanomembranes and hold the potential to boost versatile applications in light&#8208;to&#8208;motion conversion and sensing toward the industrial level.

         <title>A Rotating Cathode with Periodical Changes in Electrolyte Layer Thickness for High&#8208;Rate Li&#8210;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is generally believed that the rate performance of Li&#8210;O2 batteries (LOBs) is limited by the slow mass transfer. To this end, a new type of LOB with a rotating cathode has been designed to decouple the maximum transfer rate of Li+ and O2, and consequently, the rate performance of LOBs has been significantly improved.








Abstract
Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs) possess the highest theoretical gravimetric energy density among all types of secondary batteries, but they are still far from practical applications. The poor rate performance resulting from the slow mass transfer is one of the primary obstacles in LOBs. To solve this issue, a rotating cathode with periodic changes in the electrolyte layer thickness is designed, decoupling the maximum transfer rate of Li+ and O2. During rotation, the thinner electrolyte layer on the cathode facilitates the O2 transfer, and the thicker electrolyte layer enhances the Li+ transfer. As a result, the rotating cathode enables the LOBs to undergo 58 cycles at 2.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and discharge stably even at a high current density of 7.5 mA cm&#8722;2. Besides, it also makes the batteries exhibit a large discharge capacity of 6.8 mAh cm&#8722;2, and the capacity decay is much slower with increasing current density. Notably, this rotating electrode holds great promise for utilization in other electrochemical cells involving gas&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid triple&#8208;phase interfaces, suggesting a viable approach to enhance the mass transfer in such systems.

         <title>Achieving Exceptional Volumetric Desalination Capacity Using Compact MoS2 Nanolaminates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1T&#8242;&#8208;MoS2 nanolaminates with compact architecture achieved high capacitance up to &#8764;277.5 F cm&#8722;3 under scan rate of 1000 mV s&#8722;1. The electrode demonstrates an exceptional volumetric desalination capacity of 65.1 mgNaCl cm&#8722;3 in capacitive deionization. Theoretical analysis reveals 1T&#697; phase is thermodynamically preferable over 2H phase, and ion hydration, channel confinement also play critical role in ion adsorption.








Abstract
Capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as a promising technology for freshwater recovery from low&#8208;salinity brackish water. It is still inapplicable in specific scenarios (e.g., households, islands, or offshore platforms) due to too low volumetric adsorption capacities. In this study, a high&#8208;density semi&#8208;metallic molybdenum disulfide (1T&#697;&#8208;MoS2) electrode with compact architecture obtained by restacking of exfoliated nanosheets, which achieve high capacitance up to &#8776;277.5&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3 under an ultrahigh scan rate of 1000&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1 with a lower charge&#8208;transfer resistance and nearly tenfold higher electrochemical active surface area than the 2H&#8208;MoS2 electrode, is reported.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capacitive deionization (CDI) has emerged as a promising technology for freshwater recovery from low-salinity brackish water. It is still inapplicable in specific scenarios (e.g., households, islands, or offshore platforms) due to too low volumetric adsorption capacities. In this study, a high-density semi-metallic molybdenum disulfide (1T&#697;-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electrode with compact architecture obtained by restacking of exfoliated nanosheets, which achieve high capacitance up to &#8776;277.5&#160;F&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; under an ultrahigh scan rate of 1000&#160;mV&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a lower charge-transfer resistance and nearly tenfold higher electrochemical active surface area than the 2H-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrode, is reported. Furthermore, 1T&#697;-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrode demonstrates exceptional volumetric desalination capacity of 65.1&#160;mg&lt;sub&gt;NaCl&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; in CDI experiments. Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveal that the cation storage mechanism with the dynamic expansion of 1T&#697;-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interlayer to accommodate cations such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which in turn enhances the capacity. Theoretical analysis unveils that 1T&#697; phase is thermodynamically preferable over 2H phase, the ion hydration and channel confinement also play critical role in enhancing ion adsorption.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Conductive and Patternable 40&#160;nm&#8208;Thick Polymer Film for Reliable Emotion Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin (40&#160;nm) polymer film comprising photolithographic poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) and graphene (PLPG) is developed as a patternable and compliant bioelectrode. Finite element analysis is adopted to optimize electrode structure for better stress dissipation ability. PLPG demonstrates excellent performance in motion artifact&#8208;less electrophysiological sensing. Integrating facial electromyogram with machine learning algorithms, a high emotion recognition accuracy is achieved.








Abstract
Understanding psychology is an important task in modern society which helps predict human behavior and provide feedback accordingly. Monitoring of weak psychological and emotional changes requires bioelectronic devices to be stretchable and compliant for unobtrusive and high&#8208;fidelity signal acquisition. Thin conductive polymer film is regarded as an ideal interface; however, it is very challenging to simultaneously balance mechanical robustness and opto&#8208;electrical property. Here, a 40&#160;nm&#8208;thick film based on photolithographic double&#8208;network conductive polymer mediated by graphene layer is reported, which concurrently enables stretchability, conductivity, and conformability. Photolithographic polymer and graphene endow the film photopatternability, enhance stress dissipation capability, as well as improve opto&#8208;electrical conductivity (4458 S cm&#8722;1@&gt;90% transparency) through molecular rearrangement by &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction, electrostatic interaction, and hydrogen bonding. The film is further applied onto corrugated facial skin, the subtle electromyogram is monitored, and machine learning algorithm is performed to understand complex emotions, indicating the outstanding ability for stretchable and compliant bioelectronics.

         <title>Bistable Electrochromic Ionogels via Supramolecular Interactions for Energy&#8208;Efficient Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy leveraging supramolecular interactions is proposed for designing bistable electrochromic materials, facilitating reversible color transitions, stabilizing the colored structure, and enabling spatial confinement to inhibit diffusion for bistable electrochromism. Utilizing biobased building blocks, reusable ITO electrodes, and ionogel functional layers, this approach achieves a flexible, energy&#8208;efficient, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable EC displays with excellent bistability.








Abstract
Bistable electrochromic (EC) materials and systems offer significant potential for building decarbonization through their optical modulation and energy efficiency. However, challenges such as limited design strategies and bottlenecks in cost, fabrication, and color have hindered the full commercialization of energy&#8208;saving EC windows and displays, with few materials achieving true bistability. Herein, a novel strategy for designing bistable electrochromic materials is proposed by leveraging supramolecular interactions. These interactions facilitate reversible color transitions, stabilize the colored structure, and enable spatial confinement to inhibit diffusion, thereby achieving bistable electrochromism. The mechanisms and materials underlying these unconventional electrochromic systems are substantiated through detailed characterization. This strategy enables the preparation of low&#8208;cost and sustainable transparent electrochromic displays with high performance. Notably, the display information remains clearly visible for more than 2 h without consuming energy. Involving biomass materials and removable device structures also enhances the sustainability and scalability of EC technology applications and development. These results demonstrate the crucial role of supramolecular chemistry in the development of cutting&#8208;edge materials for applications such as energy&#8208;saving smart windows.

         <title>Rapid&#8208;Response Water&#8208;Shrink Films with High Output Work Density Based on Polyethylene Oxide and &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin for Autonomous Wound Closure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;shrink film (WS film) with supercontraction, constructed by poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin, is demonstrated. Upon wetting, this film rapidly contracts, generating substantial contraction stress and a high output work density. Water&#8208;shrink tapes, based on this supercontractile film, autonomously close the bleeding wound, offering an innovative approach for self&#8208;treatment, especially in urgent self&#8208;care scenarios.








Abstract
Conventional wound closure methods, including sutures and tissue adhesives, present significant challenges for self&#8208;care treatment, particularly in the context of bleeding wounds. Existing stimuli&#8208;responsive contractile materials designed for autonomous wound closure frequently lack sufficient output work density to generate the force needed to bring the wound edges into proximity or necessitate stimuli that are not compatible with the human body. Here, semi&#8208;transparent, flexible, and water&#8208;responsive shrinkable films, composed of poly(ethylene oxide) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin, are reported. These films exhibit remarkable stability under ambient conditions and demonstrate significant contraction (&#8776;50%) within 6 s upon exposure to water, generating substantial contractile stress (up to 6&#160;MPa) and output work density (&#8776;1028&#160;kJ m&#8722;3), which is 100 times larger than that of conventional hydrogel and 25 times larger than that of skeletal muscles. Remarkably, upon hydration, these films are capable of lifting objects 10&#160;000 times their own weight. Leveraging this technology, water&#8208;shrink tapes, which, upon contact with water, effectively constrict human skin and autonomously close bleeding wounds in animal models within 10 seconds, are developed further. This work offers a novel approach to skin wound management, showing significant potential for emergency and self&#8208;care scenarios.

         <title>Accelerated Discovery of (TiZrHf)x(NbTa)1&#8722;x High&#8208;Entropy Alloys With Superior Thermal Stability and a New Crystallization Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work performs a high&#8208;throughput investigation of the thermal stability of (TiZrHf)x(NbTa)1&#8722;x&#160;high&#8208;entropy alloys based on combinatorial magnetron co&#8208;sputtering, vacuum annealing, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques, observing superior phase and grain size stability than previously reported nanocrystalline counterparts. The effect of composition on thermal stability is evaluated and a new crystallization mechanism is revealed.








Abstract
Nanocrystalline (nc) metals are generally strong yet thermally unstable, rendering them difficult to process and unsuitable for use, particularly at elevated temperatures. Nc multicomponent and high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are found to offer enhanced thermal stability but only in a few empirically discovered systems out of a vast compositional space. In response, this work develops a combinatorial strategy to accelerate the discovery of nc&#8208;(TiZrHf)x(NbTa)1&#8722;x alloy library with distinct thermal stability, in terms of phases and grain sizes. Based on synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron microscopy characterizations, a phase transition is observed from amorphous&#8211;crystalline nanocomposites to a body&#8208;centered cubic (bcc) phase upon annealing. With increased NbTa content (decreased x value), the system tends to achieve thermally stable dual bcc phases upon annealing; in contrast, alloys with increased TiZrHf content (x &gt; 0.6) maintain a single&#8208;composition nanocomposite state, impeding crystallization and grain growth. This investigation not only broadens the understanding of thermal stability but also delves into the onset of crystallization in HEA systems.

&lt;p&gt;Nanocrystalline (nc) metals are generally strong yet thermally unstable, rendering them difficult to process and unsuitable for use, particularly at elevated temperatures. Nc multicomponent and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are found to offer enhanced thermal stability but only in a few empirically discovered systems out of a vast compositional space. In response, this work develops a combinatorial strategy to accelerate the discovery of nc-(TiZrHf)&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;(NbTa)&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; alloy library with distinct thermal stability, in terms of phases and grain sizes. Based on synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy characterizations, a phase transition is observed from amorphous&#8211;crystalline nanocomposites to a body-centered cubic (bcc) phase upon annealing. With increased NbTa content (decreased &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; value), the system tends to achieve thermally stable dual bcc phases upon annealing; in contrast, alloys with increased TiZrHf content (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 0.6) maintain a single-composition nanocomposite state, impeding crystallization and grain growth. This investigation not only broadens the understanding of thermal stability but also delves into the onset of crystallization in HEA systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Reconstruction for Efficient NiOx&#8208;Based Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A record efficiency of 25.64% is achieved for NiOx&#8208;based inverted perovskite solar cell via a surface reconstruction strategy utilized lead chelation (LC) molecules. The LC molecules target passivates the undesirable defects while avoids the adverse clustering in local areas on perovskite surface during the surface reconstruction process, thereby maximizing the passivation effect.








Abstract
Functional agents are verified to efficiently enhance device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through surface engineering. However, the influence of intrinsic characteristics of molecules on final device performance is overlooked. Here, a surface reconstruction strategy is developed to enhance the efficiency of inverted PSCs by mitigating the adverse effects of lead chelation (LC) molecules. Bathocuproine (BCP) is chosen as the representative of LC molecules for its easy accessibility and outstanding optoelectronic properties. During this strategy, BCP molecules on perovskite surface are first dissolved in solvents and then captured specially by undercoordinated Pb2+ ions, preventing adverse n&#8208;type doping by the molecules themselves. In this case, the BCP molecule exhibits outstanding passivation effect on perovskite surface, which leads to an obviously increased open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC). Therefore, a record power conversion efficiency of 25.64% for NiOx&#8208;based inverted PSCs is achieved, maintaining over 80% of initial efficiency after exposure to ambient condition for &#8776;1500 h.

         <title>Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa Intermetallic Nanocatalysts with Enhanced Methanol Oxidation Performance for Efficient Hybrid Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quaternary Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa intermetallic nanoparticle electrocatalyst is designed, which shows outstanding performance for the methanol oxidation reaction in alkaline&#8211;saline water. Stable energy&#8208;saving hybrid seawater electrolysis is further demonstrated, using the prepared Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa nanoparticles to catalyze the anodic methanol oxidation coupled with the cathodic hydrogen evolution, which completely circumvents the interfering chlorine evolution.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis is a potentially cost&#8208;effective approach to green hydrogen production, but it currently faces substantial challenges for its high energy consumption and the interference of chlorine evolution reaction (ClER). Replacing the energy&#8208;demanding oxygen evolution reaction with methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) represents a promising alternative, as MOR occurs at a significantly low anodic potential, which cannot only reduce the voltage needed for electrolysis but also completely circumvents ClER. To this end, developing high&#8208;performance MOR catalysts is a key. Herein, a novel quaternary Pt1.8Pd0.2CuGa/C intermetallic nanoparticle (i&#8208;NP) catalyst is reported, which shows a high mass activity (11.13 A mgPGM&#8722;1), a large specific activity (18.13&#160;mA cmPGM&#8722;2), and outstanding stability toward alkaline MOR. Advanced characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that the introduction of atomically distributed Pd in Pt2CuGa intermetallic markedly promotes the oxidation of key reaction intermediates by enriching electron concentration around Pt sites, resulting in weak adsorption of carbon&#8208;containing intermediates and favorable adsorption of synergistic OH&#8722; groups near Pd sites. MOR&#8208;assisted seawater electrolysis is demonstrated, which continuously operates under 1.23&#160;V for 240&#160;h in simulated seawater and 120&#160;h in natural seawater without notable degradation.

         <title>Giant Iontronic Flexoelectricity in Soft Hydrogels Induced by Tunable Biomimetic Ion Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant iontronic flexoelectricity of soft hydrogels is reported induced by the ion polarization of cations and anions with different transfer rates under bending deformations, achieving flexoelectric coefficient much higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art flexoelectric materials.








Abstract
Flexoelectricity features the strain gradient&#8208;induced mechanoelectric conversion using materials not limited by their crystalline symmetry, but state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art flexoelectric materials exhibit very small flexoelectric coefficients and are too brittle to withstand large deformations. Here, inspired by the ion polarization in living organisms, this paper reports the giant iontronic flexoelectricity of soft hydrogels where the ion polarization is attributed to the different transfer rates of cations and anions under bending deformations. The flexoelectricity is found to be easily regulated by the types of anion&#8211;cation pairs and polymer networks in the hydrogel. A polyacrylamide hydrogel with 1&#160;m NaCl achieves a record&#8208;high flexoelectric coefficient of &#8776;1160 &#181;C m&#8722;1, which can even be improved to &#8776;2340 &#181;C m&#8722;1 by synergizing with the effects of ion pairs and extra polycation chains. Furthermore, the hydrogel as flexoelectric materials can withstand larger bending deformations to obtain higher polarization charges owing to its intrinsic low modulus and high elasticity. A soft flexoelectric sensor is then demonstrated for object recognition by robotic hands. The findings greatly broaden the flexoelectricity to soft, biomimetic, and biocompatible materials and applications.

         <title>Molecule Crowding Strategy in Polymer Electrolytes Inducing Stable Interfaces for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>

The molecule crowding effect caused by 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5&#160;leads to the abundant anions are forcing into the Li+ coordinated sheath to form anion&#8208;rich coordinated structure, which weakens the Li+ coordination and consequently boosts the Li+ transport. The confined anions decomposed at electrode/electrolyte interfaces to forming stable SEI and CEI, which achieve uniform lithium deposition, prevent electrolytes' continuous degradation, and suppress transition&#8208;metal crosstalk.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries with polymer electrolytes suffer from electrolyte decomposition and lithium dendrites because of the unstable electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Herein, a molecule crowding strategy is proposed to modulate the Li+ coordinated structure, thus in situ constructing the stable interfaces. Since 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 possesses superior compatibility with polymer and electrostatic repulsion for anion of lithium salt, the anions are forced to crowd into a Li+ coordinated structure to weaken the Li+ coordination with polymer and boost the Li+ transport. The coordinated anions prior decompose to form LiF&#8208;rich, thin, and tough interfacial passivation layers for stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Thus, the symmetric Li&#8211;Li cell can stably operate over 4360&#160;h, the LiFePO4||Li full battery presents 97.18% capacity retention in 700 cycles at 2&#160;C, and the NCM811||Li full battery possesses the capacity retention of 83.17% after 300 cycles. The assembled pouch cell shows excellent flexibility (stand for folding over 2000 times) and stability (89.42% capacity retention after 400 cycles). This work provides a promising strategy to regulate interfacial chemistry by modulating the ion environment to accommodate the interfacial issues and will inspire more effective approaches to general interface issues for polymer electrolytes.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Array via Liquid Metal Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The liquid metal nanoreactor strategy is proposed for realizing high&#8208;entropy alloy arrays. The coalescence nature endowed by the tendency to decrease surface energy constructed the basis of the nanoreactor to provide a confined reaction environment for the nucleation and growth of multiple elements, thus forming a single particle within each patterned feature.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanostructures arranged into well&#8208;defined configurations hold great potential for accelerating the development of electronics, photonics, catalysis, and device integration. However, the random nucleation induced by the disparity in physicochemical properties of multiple elements makes it challenging to achieve single&#8208;particle synthesis at the patterned preset sites in the high&#8208;entropy scenario. Herein, the liquid metal nanoreactor strategy is proposed to realize the construction of HEA arrays. The coalescence of the liquid metal driven by the tendency to decrease surface energy provides a restricted environment for the nucleation and growth to form single HEA particles at the preset locations, which can be regarded as a self&#8208;confinement reaction. Liquid metal endowing a low diffusion energy barrier on the substrate and a high diffusivity of the alloy system can dynamically promote the aggregation process. As a result, the HEA array is prepared with elements up to eleven and possesses uniform periodicity, which exhibits excellent holography response in a broad spectrum. This work injects new vitality into the construction of HEA nanopatterns and provides an excellent platform for propelling their fundamental research and applications.

         <title>Intrinsic Elastomer with Remarkable Dielectric Constant via Elastification of Relaxor Ferroelectric Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the slight cross&#8208;linking of relaxor ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;ter&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;ter&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE)), intrinsic elastomer with a remarkable dielectric constant of 54.2 at 100 Hz is obtained. Notably, the dielectric constant of the elastomer nearly doubles that of pristine P)(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE), and surpasses all reported intrinsic elastomers, suggesting that the slight cross&#8208;linking of relaxor ferroelectric polymers can effectively enhance the dielectric constants in intrinsic elastomers.








Abstract
High&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant elastomers always play a critical role in the development of wearable electronics for actuation, energy storage, and sensing; therefore, there is an urgent need for effective strategies to enhance dielectric constants. The present methods mainly involve adding inorganic or conductive fillers to the polymer elastomers, however, the addition of fillers causes a series of problems, such as large dielectric loss, increased modulus, and deteriorating interface conditions. Here, the elastification of relaxor ferroelectric polymers is investigated through slight cross&#8208;linking, aiming to obtain intrinsic elastomers with high&#8208;dielectric constants. By cross&#8208;linking of the relaxor ferroelectric polymer poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;ter&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;ter&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene) with a long soft chain cross&#8208;linker, a relaxor ferroelectric elastomer with an enhanced dielectric constant is obtained, twice that of the pristine relaxor ferroelectric polymer and surpassing all reported intrinsic elastomers. This elastomer maintains its high&#8208;dielectric constant over a wide temperature range and exhibits robust mechanical fatigue resistance, chemical stability, and thermal stability. Moreover, the ferroelectricity of the elastomer remains stable under strains up to 80%. This study offers a simple and effective way to enhance the dielectric constant of intrinsic elastomers, thus facilitating advancements in soft robots, biosensors, and wearable electronics.

         <title>Constructing an Interlaced Catalytic Surface via Fluorine&#8208;Doped Bimetallic Oxides for Oxygen Electrode Processes in Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural and catalytic factors of the oxygen electrode, culminating in the design of fluorine&#8208;doped bimetallic cobalt&#8208;nickel oxide (CoNiO2&#8211;xFx/CC) featuring an interlaced catalytic surface and a corncob&#8208;like structure, are meticulously balanced. Benefiting from its unique structural configuration and catalytic mechanism, the designed material significantly enhances the electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;O2 batteries across various aspects.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries, renowned for their high theoretical energy density, have garnered significant interest as prime candidates for future electric device development. However, their actual capacity is often unsatisfactory due to the passivation of active sites by solid&#8208;phase discharge products. Optimizing the growth and storage of these products is a crucial step in advancing Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Here, a fluorine&#8208;doped bimetallic cobalt&#8208;nickel oxide (CoNiO2&#8211;xFx/CC) with an interlaced catalytic surface (ICS) and a corncob&#8208;like structure is proposed as an oxygen electrode. Unlike conventional oxide electrodes with a &#8220;single adsorption catalytic mechanism,&#8221; the ICS of CoNiO2&#8722;xFx/CC offers a &#8220;competitive adsorption catalytic mechanism,&#8221; where oxygen sites facilitate oxygen conversion while fluorine sites contribute to the growth of Li2O2. This results in a change in Li2O2 morphology from a surface film to toroidal particles, effectively preventing&#160;the burial of active sites. Additionally, the unique open architecture aids in the capture and release of oxygen and the formation of well&#8208;contacted Li2O2/electrode interfaces, which benefits the complete decomposition of Li2O2 products. Consequently, the Li&#8211;O2 battery with a CoNiO2&#8722;xFx/CC cathode demonstrates a high specific capacity of up to 30923 mAh g&#8722;1 and a lifespan exceeding 580 cycles, surpassing most reported metal oxide&#8208;based cathodes.

Single&#8208;atom Co&#9472;N2O2 site&#8208;immobilized g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets are used to successfully establish a novel, visually striking, ultrahigh sensitive, and selective photosensitive detection system for colorless diclofenac with dye eosin Y for the first time.








Abstract
It is highly desired to develop a visual sensing system for ultrasensitive detection of colorless diclofenac (DCF), yet with a significant challenge. Herein, a novel dye&#8208;based photosensitization sensing system has been successfully developed for detecting DCF for the first time, in which the used dye eosin Y (DeY) can strongly absorb visible light and then be decolorized obviously by transferring photogenerated electrons to g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets (CN), while the built single&#8208;atomic Co&#9472;N2O2 sites on CN by boron&#8208;oxygen connection can competitively adsorb DCF to impede the photosensitization decoloration of DeY. This system exhibits a broad detection range from 8&#160;ng&#160;L&#8722;1 to 2 mg&#160;L&#8722;1 with 535&#160;nm light, an exceptionally low detection limit (3.5&#160;ng&#160;L&#8722;1), and remarkable selectivity. Through the time&#8208;resolved, in situ technologies, and theoretical calculations, the decolorization of DeY is attributed to the disruption of DeY's conjugated structure caused by the triplet excited state electron transfer from DeY to CN, meanwhile, the adsorbed oxygen facilitates the charge transfer process. The preferential adsorption of DCF mainly depends on the strong interactions between the as&#8208;constructed single&#8208;atom Co and Cl in DCF. This study opens an innovative light&#8208;driven sensing system by combining dye and single&#8208;atom metal/nanomaterial for visually intuitive detection of environmental pollutants.

         <title>Novel Palladium Hydride Surface Enabling Simultaneous Bacterial Killing and Osteogenic Formation through Proton Capturing and Activation of Antioxidant System in Immune Microenvironments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A palladium hydride (PdHx) film, fabricated on titanium implants, exhibits a lattice capable of capturing protons within the bacterial microenvironment, consequently inducing bacterial death. Furthermore, it mimics human antioxidant systems, reshaping the osteogenic immune microenvironment and promoting osteogenesis.








Abstract
Achieving bacterial killing and osteogenic formation on an implant surface rarely occurs. In this study, a novel surface design&#8211;a palladium hydride (PdHx) film that enables these two distinct features to coexist is introduced. The PdHx lattice captures protons in the extracellular microenvironment of bacteria, disrupting their normal metabolic activities, such as ATP synthesis, nutrient co&#8208;transport, and oxidative stress. This disruption leads to significant bacterial death, as evidenced by RNA sequence analysis. Additionally, the unique enzymatic activity and hydrogen&#8208;loading properties of PdHx activate the human antioxidant system, resulting in the rapid clearance of reactive oxygen species. This process reshapes the osteogenic immune microenvironment, promoting accelerated osteogenesis. These findings reveal that the downregulation of the NOD&#8208;like receptor signaling pathway is critical for activating immune cells toward M2 phenotype polarization. This novel surface design provides new strategies for modifying implant coatings to simultaneously prevent bacterial infection, reduce inflammation, and enhance tissue regeneration, making it a noteworthy contribution to the field of advanced materials.

         <title>Toward 1D Transport in 3D Materials: SOC&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Transport Anisotropy in Sm3ZrBi5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) mechanistically induces 1D charge transport in the bulk, 3D structure Ln3ZrPn5 (Ln = La, Sm; Pn = Sb, Bi). Anisotropic charge transport measurements and electronic structure calculations demonstrate how the anisotropic 3D Fermi Surface of the antimonide is dimensionally reduced to 1D sheets of electron density in the bismuthides.








Abstract
1D charge transport offers great insight into strongly correlated physics, such as Luttinger liquids, electronic instabilities, and superconductivity. Although 1D charge transport is observed in nanomaterials and quantum wires, examples in bulk crystalline solids remain elusive. In this work, it is demonstrated that spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) can act as a mechanism to induce quasi&#8208;1D charge transport in the Ln3MPn5 (Ln = lanthanide; M = transition metal; Pn = Pnictide) family. From three example compounds, La3ZrSb5, La3ZrBi5, and Sm3ZrBi5, density functional theory calculations with SOC included show a quasi&#8208;1D Fermi surface in the bismuthide compounds, but an anisotropic 3D Fermi surface in the antimonide structure. By performing anisotropic charge transport measurements on La3ZrSb5, La3ZrBi5, and Sm3ZrBi5, it is demonstrated that SOC starkly affects their anisotropic resistivity ratios (ARR) at low temperatures, with an ARR of &#8776;4 in the antimonide compared to &#8776;9.5 and &#8776;22 (&#8776;32 after magnetic ordering) in La3ZrBi5 and Sm3ZrBi5, respectively. This report demonstrates the utility of spin&#8208;orbit coupling to induce quasi&#8208;low&#8208;dimensional Fermi surfaces in anisotropic crystal structures, and provides a template for examining other&#160;systems.

         <title>Protocell Flow Reactors for Enzyme and Whole&#8208;Cell Mediated Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protocell continuous flow reactors consisting of a densely packed array of enzyme&#8208; or bacteria&#8208;containing membranized coacervate vesicles are constructed and used for the spatiotemporal processing of biochemical and whole&#8208;cell mediated catalysis. The engineering of continuous flow reactors based on cell&#8208;like microscale agents offers opportunities in the development of green and sustainable industrial bioprocessing.








Abstract
The design and construction of continuous flow biochemical reactors comprising immobilized biocatalysts have generated great interest in the efficient synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals. Living cells use compartmentalization and reaction&#8208;diffusion processes for spatiotemporal regulation of biocatalytic reactions, and implementing these strategies into continuous flow reactors can offer new opportunities in reactor design and application. Herein, the fabrication of protocell&#8208;based continuous flow reactors for enzyme and whole&#8208;cell mediated biocatalysis is demonstrated. Semipermeable membranized coacervate vesicles are employed as model protocells that spontaneously sequester enzymes or accumulate living bacteria to produce embodied microreactors capable of single&#8208; or multiple&#8208;step catalytic reactions. By packing millions of the enzyme/bacteria&#8208;containing coacervate vesicles in a glass column, a facile, cost&#8208;effective, and modular methodology capable of performing oxidoreductase, peroxidase and lipolytic reactions, enzyme&#8208;mediated L&#8208;DOPA synthesis, and whole&#8208;cell glycolysis under continuous flow conditions, is demonstrated. It is shown that the protocell&#8208;nested enzymes and bacterial cells exhibit enhanced activities and stability under deleterious operating conditions compared with their non&#8208;encapsulated counterparts. These results provide a step toward the engineering of continuous flow reactors based on cell&#8208;like microscale agents and offer opportunities in the development of green and sustainable industrial bioprocessing.

         <title>Symmetry Evolution Induced 2D Pt Single Atom Catalyst with High Density for Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uses salt&#8208;assisted methods to adjust the tetrahedral coordination in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks &#8208; 8 (ZIF&#8208;8) to planar tetragonal coordination without changing the ligand. In the carbonization process, to maintain the 2D morphology, the five&#8208;membered ring undergoes reconstruction to form a six&#8208;membered ring, introducing defects. These defects result in highly loaded Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with high hydrogen oxidation reaction activity after electrodeposition.








Abstract
The performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts is greatly influenced by the chemical environment surrounding the central atom. Here, a salt&#8208;assisted method is employed to transform the tetrahedral coordination structure of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks &#8208; 8 (ZIF&#8208;8)&#160;into a planar square coordination structure without altering the ligands. During the subsequent carbonization process, concurrent with the evaporation of zinc atoms, the structure of the nitrogen and carbon carriers (NC carriers) undergoes a transition from five&#8208;membered rings to six&#8208;membered rings to preserve the 2D structure. This transition results in the generation of additional defect sites on the 2D&#8208;NC substrates. Hence, the Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with planar square coordination symmetries can be precisely prepared via electrodeposition (denoted as 2D&#8208;Pt SAC). The Pt loading of 2D&#8208;Pt SAC is 0.49 &#177; 0.03 &#181;g cm&#8722;2, higher than that of 3D&#8208;Pt SAC (0.37 &#177; 0.04 &#181;g cm&#8722;2). In the context of the hydrogen oxidation reaction electrocatalysis, under an overpotential of 50 mV, these single&#8208;atom catalysts with 2D coordination exhibit mass activities of 2396 A gPt&#8722;1 (32 times higher than commercial Pt/C catalyst, 2 times higher than 3D&#8208;PtNC).

The challenges of instable adhesion, low impedance, and robust durability that hinder the long&#8208;term application of in vitro bioelectrodes. Inspired by treefrog web and bird's beak, through the optimization design, a web&#8208;like electrode, which can solve these complex integrated challenges, is proposed. Proposed electrode has the most balanced mechanical, electrical, and electrode properties of typical electrodes reported in recent years.









Abstract
Long&#8208;term continuous monitoring (LTCM) of physiological electrical signals is an effective means for detecting several cardiovascular diseases. However, the integrated challenges of stable adhesion, low impedance, and robust durability under different skin conditions significantly hinder the application of flexible electrodes in LTCM. This paper proposes a structured electrode inspired by the treefrog web, comprising dispersed pillars at the bottom and asymmetric cone holes at the top. Attachment structures with a dispersed pillar improve the contact stability (adhesion increases 2.79/13.16 times in dry/wet conditions compared to an electrode without structure). Improved permeable duct structure provides high permeability (12 times compared to cotton). Due to high adhesion and permeability, the electrode's durability is 40 times larger than commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes. The treefrog web&#8208;like electrode has great advantages in permeability, adhesion, and durability, resulting in prospects for application in physiological electrical signal detection and a new design idea for LTCM wearable dry electrodes.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Rational Design of Si&#9472;Rhodamine as Cathepsin&#8208;pH&#8208;Activated Probe for Accurate Fluorescence Navigation</title>

         <dc:description>
The development of machine learning has dramatically revolutionized the process of material discovery. Here, the desired xanthene dyes are rational designed through machine learning and dual&#8208;locked probe for precise imaging of complex hepatocellular carcinoma is constructed. These results not only affirm the validity of the model but also guide the design of novel probes with practical applications.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance fluorescent probes stand as indispensable tools in fluorescence&#8208;guided imaging, and are crucial for precise delineation of focal tissue while minimizing unnecessary removal of healthy tissue. Herein, machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted strategy to investigate the current available xanthene dyes is first proposed, and a quantitative prediction model to guide the rational synthesis of novel fluorescent molecules with the desired pH responsivity is constructed. Two novel Si&#9472;rhodamine derivatives are successfully achieved and the cathepsin/pH sequentially activated probe Si&#9472;rhodamine&#9472;cathepsin&#8208;pH (SiR&#9472;CTS&#8208;pH) is constructed. The results reveal that SiR&#9472;CTS&#8208;pH exhibits higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of fluorescence imaging, compared to single pH or cathepsin&#8208;activated probe. Moreover, SiR&#9472;CTS&#8208;pH shows strong differentiation abilities for tumor cells and tissues and accurately discriminates the complex hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from normal ones, indicating its significant application potential in clinical practice. Therefore, the continuous development of xanthene dyes and the rational design of superior fluorescent molecules through machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted model broaden the path and provide more advanced methods to researchers.

         <title>Hierarchical Chiral Calcium Silicate Hydrate Films Promote Vascularization for Tendon&#8208;to&#8208;Bone Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Calcium silicate hydrate films with levorotatory chirality promote endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis by activating integrin receptors and mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4. This process enhances vascularization at the enthesis and eventually promotes tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing in rat rotator cuff tear models, underscoring the potential of chiral biomaterials for tissue regeneration via revascularization.








Abstract
Revascularization after rotator cuff repair is crucial for tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing. The chirality of materials has been reported to influence their performance in tissue repair. However, data on the use of chiral structures to optimize biomaterials as a revascularization strategy remain scarce. Here, calcium silicate hydrate (CSO) films with hierarchical chirality on the atomic to micrometer scale are developed. Interestingly, levorotatory CSO (L&#8208;CSO) films promote the migration and angiogenesis of endothelial cells, whereas dextral and racemic CSO films do not induce the same effects. Molecular analysis demonstrates that L&#8208;chirality can be recognized by integrin receptors and leads to the formation of focal adhesion, which activates mechanosensitive ion channel transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 to conduct Ca2+ influx. Consequently, the phosphorylation of serum response factor is biased by Ca2+ influx to promote the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 signaling pathway, resulting in enhanced angiogenesis. After implanted in a rat rotator cuff tear model, L&#8208;CSO films strongly enhance vascularization at the enthesis, promoting collagen maturation, increasing bone and fibrocartilage formation, and eventually improving the biomechanical strength. This study reveals the mechanism through which chirality influences angiogenesis in endothelial cells and provides a critical theoretical foundation for the clinical application of chiral biomaterials.

         <title>A Cable&#8208;Stayed Honeycomb Superstructure to Improve the Stability of Li&#8208;Rich Materials via Inhibiting Interlaminar Lattice Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cable&#8208;stayed honeycomb superstructure is constructed by inducing high Li/Ni disorder in Li&#8208;rich cathode materials. The short&#8208;range order of the honeycomb superstructure is confirmed by the neutron pair distribution function. Benefiting from the high voltage stability and a superior crystal cell evolution mechanism of the cable&#8208;stayed superstructure, excellent cycle performance of the Li&#8208;rich/Si&#8208;C full cell is achieved.








Abstract
In layered Li&#8208;rich materials, over stoichiometric Li forms an ordered occupation of LiTM6 in transition metal (TM)&#160;layer, showing a honeycomb superstructure along [001] direction. At the atomic scale, the instability of the superstructure at high voltage is the root cause of problems such as capacity/voltage decay of Li&#8208;rich materials. Here a Li&#8208;rich material with a high Li/Ni disorder is reported, these interlayer Ni atoms locate above the honeycomb superstructure and share adjacent O coordination with honeycomb TM. These Ni&#9472;O bonds act as cable&#8208;stayed bridge to the honeycomb plane, and improve the high&#8208;voltage stability. The cable&#8208;stayed honeycomb superstructure is confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction to have a unique cell evolution mechanism that it can alleviate interlaminar lattice strain by promoting in&#8208;plane expansion along a&#8208;axis and inhibiting c&#8208;axis stretching. Electrochemical tests also demonstrate significantly improved long cycle performance after 500 cycles (86% for Li&#8208;rich/Li half cell and 82% for Li&#8208;rich/Si&#8208;C full cell) and reduced irreversible oxygen release. This work proves the feasibility of achieving outstanding stability of lithium&#8208;rich materials through superstructure regulation and provides new insights for the development of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes.

         <title>Full&#8208;Space Electric Field in Mo&#8208;Decorated Zn2In2S5 Polarization Photocatalyst for Oriented Charge Flow and Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the challenge of inadequate charge kinetics within the photocatalyst, this work has induced a sophisticated full&#8208;space electric field in an atomically dispersed Mo cluster&#8208;decorated Zn2In2S5, resulting in a substantial boost in charge separation efficiency and a streamlined charge flow, thereby paving the way for a highly&#8208;efficient artificial photosynthesis process.








Abstract
Integration of photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) evolution with oxidative organic synthesis presents a highly attractive strategy for the simultaneous production of clean H2 fuel and high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the sluggish dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers across the photocatalysts result in low photoconversion efficiency, hindering the wide applications of such a technology. Herein, this work overcomes this limitation by inducing the full&#8208;space electric field via charge polarization engineering on a Mo cluster&#8208;decorated Zn2In2S5 (Mo&#8208;Zn2In2S5) photocatalyst. Specifically, this full&#8208;space electric field arises from a cascade of the bulk electric field (BEF) and local surface electric field (LSEF), triggering the oriented migration of photogenerated electrons from [Zn&#8211;S] regions to [In&#8211;S] regions and eventually to Mo cluster sites, ensuring efficient separation of bulk and surface charge carriers. Moreover, the surface Mo clusters induce a tip enhancement effect to optimize charge transfer behavior by augmenting electrons and proton concentration around the active sites on the basal plane of Zn2In2S5. Notably, the optimized Mo1.5&#8208;Zn2In2S5 catalyst achieves exceptional H2 and benzaldehyde production rates of 34.35 and 45.31&#160;mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively, outperforming pristine ZnIn2S4 by 3.83&#8208; and 4.15&#8208;fold. These findings mark a significant stride in steering charge flow for enhanced photocatalytic performance.

     alt="Full-Space Electric Field in Mo-Decorated Zn2In2S5 Polarization Photocatalyst for Oriented Charge Flow and Efficient Hydrogen Production"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting the challenge of inadequate charge kinetics within the photocatalyst, this work has induced a sophisticated full-space electric field in an atomically dispersed Mo cluster-decorated Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, resulting in a substantial boost in charge separation efficiency and a streamlined charge flow, thereby paving the way for a highly-efficient artificial photosynthesis process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integration of photocatalytic hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) evolution with oxidative organic synthesis presents a highly attractive strategy for the simultaneous production of clean H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fuel and high-value chemicals. However, the sluggish dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers across the photocatalysts result in low photoconversion efficiency, hindering the wide applications of such a technology. Herein, this work overcomes this limitation by inducing the full-space electric field via charge polarization engineering on a Mo cluster-decorated Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (Mo-Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) photocatalyst. Specifically, this full-space electric field arises from a cascade of the bulk electric field (BEF) and local surface electric field (LSEF), triggering the oriented migration of photogenerated electrons from [Zn&#8211;S] regions to [In&#8211;S] regions and eventually to Mo cluster sites, ensuring efficient separation of bulk and surface charge carriers. Moreover, the surface Mo clusters induce a tip enhancement effect to optimize charge transfer behavior by augmenting electrons and proton concentration around the active sites on the basal plane of Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Notably, the optimized Mo&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;-Zn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst achieves exceptional H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and benzaldehyde production rates of 34.35 and 45.31&#160;mmol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, outperforming pristine ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by 3.83- and 4.15-fold. These findings mark a significant stride in steering charge flow for enhanced photocatalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gradient Doping Enables an Extraordinary Efficiency in Thermoelectric PbTe1&#8722;xIx</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient doping is realized in PbTe1&#8722;xIx using a vertical gradient solidification technique, enabling a spatial gradient in carrier concentration that optimizes zT at each portion of the device under its operating temperature. Such a gradient doping results in an extraordinary device efficiency of &#8776;14% at a &#916;T of &#8776;500&#160;K, corresponding to a &#8776;40% improvement as compared to homogeneous doping.








Abstract
The conversion efficiency of thermoelectric generators that have to be operated under a temperature difference (&#916;T) is mainly determined by material's dimensionless figure of merit (zT). However, maximization of zT at each temperature requires an optimization of carrier concentration (nopt) which strongly depends on the temperature and band parameters. Commonly utilized strategy of chemical doping usually enables a homogeneous carrier concentration throughout the material, leading the maximal zT to be achievable only within a narrow temperature range. In this work, a gradiently doping is successfully realized in PbTe1&#8722;xIx using a vertical gradient solidification technique, enabling a spatial gradient in carrier concentration that correspondingly optimizes zT at each portion of the material under its operating temperature. Such a gradient doping results in an extraordinary device efficiency of &#8776;14% at a &#916;T of &#8776;500&#160;K, corresponding to a &#8776;40% improvement as compared to that of homogeneous doping. Since directional solidification technique commonly enables gradient dopant concentrations in semiconductors, the resultant gradient carrier concentration is illustrated here as an effective approach for advancing thermoelectrics.

         <title>Intranasal Delivery of Near&#8208;Infrared and Magnetic Dual&#8208;Response Nanospheres to Rapidly Produce Antidepressant&#8208;Like and Cognitive Enhancement Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired from snuff bottle, a nasal delivery system with the combination of iron supplementation and a peripheral D2 receptor antagonist is developed for dopamine receptors upregulation which can solve a variety of mental disorders (such as depression, anxiety, and addiction) and improve cognition of patients.








Abstract
Restricted by synaptic plasticity, dopamine receptor (DR) upregulation takes a long time to work. Moreover, the impact of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) on delivery efficiency restricts the development of drugs. Taking inspiration from snuff bottles, a convenient, fast&#8208;acting, and nonaddictive nasal drug delivery system has been developed to rapidly reshape the balance of synaptic transmitters. This optical and magnetic response system called CFs@DP, comprised of carbonized MIL&#8208;100 (Fe) frameworks (CFs) and domperidone (DP), which can enter the brain via nasal administration. Under dual stimulation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and catecholamine&#8208;induced complexation, CFs@DP disintegrates to release iron ions and DP, causing upregulation of the dopamine type 1 (D1), type 2 (D2) receptors, and brain&#8208;derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to achieve a therapeutic effect. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the DR density of mice (postnatal day 50&#8211;60) increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) after 10 days of therapy, resulting in antidepressant&#8208;like and cognitive enhancement effects. Interestingly, the cognitive enhancement effect of CFs@DP is even working in noniron deficiency (normal fed) mice, making it a promising candidate for application in enhancing learning ability.

         <title>Dipole Moment Influences the Reversibility and Corrosion of Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dipole moment influences the distribution and orientation of solvent molecules in the electric double layer on lithium metal surface. And these parameters have significant impacts on lithium metal reversibility and corrosion. Solvents with high dipole moments are more likely to adsorb onto lithium metal surfaces, which also influence the solid electrolyte interphase.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) must have both long cycle life and calendar life to be commercially viable. However, &#8220;trial and error&#8221; methodologies remain prevalent in contemporary research endeavors to identify favorable electrolytes. Here, a guiding principle for the selection of solvents for LMBs is proposed, which aims to achieve high Coulombic efficiency while minimizing the corrosion. For the first time, this study reveals that the dipole moment and orientation of solvent molecules have significant impacts on lithium metal reversibility and corrosion. Solvents with high dipole moments are more likely to adsorb onto lithium metal surfaces, which also influence the solid electrolyte interphase. Using this principle, the use of LiNO3 is demonstrated as the sole salt in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li cells can achieve excellent cycling stability. Overall, this work bridges the molecular structure of solvents to the reversibility and corrosion of lithium metal, and these concepts can be extended to other metal&#8208;based batteries.

Magnetic navigation systems (MNS) facilitate minimally invasive procedures but face cost and infrastructure constraints. The Navion, a portable electromagnetic system, addresses these issues by generating a large magnetic field and is easily deployable in hospitals. It aids in the adoption of magnetically responsive medical devices, demonstrated through in vitro and in vivo experiments navigating various microstructures and catheters for medical procedures.








Abstract
Magnetic navigation systems are used to precisely manipulate magnetically responsive materials enabling the realization of new minimally invasive procedures using magnetic medical devices. Their widespread applicability has been constrained by high infrastructure demands and costs. The study reports on a portable electromagnetic navigation system, the Navion, which is capable of generating a large magnetic field over a large workspace. The system is easy to install in hospital operating rooms and transportable through health care facilities, aiding in the widespread adoption of magnetically responsive medical devices. First, the design and implementation approach for the system are introduced and its performance is characterized. Next, in vitro navigation of different microrobot structures is demonstrated using magnetic field gradients and rotating magnetic fields. Spherical permanent magnets, electroplated cylindrical microrobots, microparticle swarms, and magnetic composite bacteria&#8208;inspired helical structures are investigated. The navigation of magnetic catheters is also demonstrated in two challenging endovascular tasks: 1) an angiography procedure and 2) deep navigation within the circle of Willis. Catheter navigation is demonstrated in a porcine model in vivo to perform an angiography under magnetic guidance.</dc:description>

         <title>Enhanced Oxygen Evolution and Zinc&#8208;Air Battery Performance via Electronic Spin Modulation in Heterostructured Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic spin modulation by magnetic heterojunctions facilitates spin&#8208;selected charge transport, optimizes the reaction kinetics, and decreases the energy barrier to the evolution of oxygen, without the need for an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Beyond optimizing electronic energy levels, the modulation of the electronic spin configuration is an effective strategy, often overlooked, to boost activity and selectivity in a range of catalytic reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This electronic spin modulation is frequently accomplished using external magnetic fields, which makes it impractical for real applications. Herein, spin modulation is achieved by engineering Ni/MnFe2O4 heterojunctions, whose surface is reconstructed into NiOOH/MnFeOOH during the OER. NiOOH/MnFeOOH shows a high spin state of Ni, which regulates the OH&#8722; and O2 adsorption energy and enables spin alignment of oxygen intermediates. As a result, NiOOH/MnFeOOH electrocatalysts provide excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 261 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Besides, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries based on Ni/MnFe2O4 show a high open circuit potential of 1.56 V and excellent stability for more than 1000 cycles. This outstanding performance is rationalized using density functional theory calculations, which show that the optimal spin state of both Ni active sites and oxygen intermediates facilitates spin&#8208;selected charge transport, optimizes the reaction kinetics, and decreases the energy barrier to the evolution of oxygen. This study provides valuable insight into spin polarization modulation by heterojunctions enabling the design of next&#8208;generation OER catalysts with boosted performance.

         <title>Bioinspired Superhydrophobic All&#8208;In&#8208;One Coating for Adaptive Thermoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the longitudinal gradient and surface structure of the lotus leaf, this study presents an all&#8208;in&#8208;one coating that integrates superhydrophobicity, thermal&#8208;responsive sunlight reflectivity, and high infrared emission through a simple one&#8208;step process. The coating enables automatic transitions between radiative cooling and solar warming, preventing overcooling and contamination, offering a novel approach for large&#8208;scale production of smart thermoregulatory coatings.








Abstract
The development of scalable and passive coatings that can adapt to seasonal temperature changes while maintaining superhydrophobic self&#8208;cleaning functions is crucial for their practical applications. However, the incorporation of passive cooling and heating functions with conflicting optical properties in a superhydrophobic coating is still challenging. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one coating inspired by the hierarchical structure of a lotus leaf that combines surface wettability, optical structure, and temperature self&#8208;adaptation is obtained through a simple one&#8208;step phase separation process. This coating exhibits an asymmetrical gradient structure with surface&#8208;embedded hydrophobic SiO2 particles and subsurface thermochromic microcapsules within vertically distributed hierarchical porous structures. Moreover, the coating imparts superhydrophobicity, high infrared emission, and thermo&#8208;switchable sunlight reflectivity, enabling autonomous transitions between radiative cooling and solar warming. The all&#8208;in&#8208;one coating prevents contamination and over&#8208;cooling caused by traditional radiative cooling materials, opening up new prospects for the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of intelligent thermoregulatory coatings.

         <title>3D Intelligent Cloaked Vehicle Equipped with Thousand&#8208;Level Reconfigurable Full&#8208;Polarization Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D full&#8208;polarization cloaking system is proposed and the in situ dynamic invisibility is realized using a travelling vehicle. The cloaking system integrates with a perception&#8208;decision&#8208;control&#8208;execution operation loop, which mainly contains external sensors, high&#8208;performance metasurfaces, and hybrid inverse optimization strategy. Experiment results verifies its performance which yields a background scattering matching degree of up to 93.3%.








Abstract
A crucial aspect in shielding a variety of advanced electronic devices from electromagnetic detection involves controlling the flow of electromagnetic waves, akin to invisibility cloaks. Decades ago, the exploration of transformation optics heralded the dawn of modern invisibility cloaks, which has stimulated immense interest across various physical scenarios. However, most prior research is simplified to low&#8208;dimensional and stationary hidden objects, limiting their practical applicability in a dynamically changing world. This study develops a 3D large&#8208;scale intelligent cloak capable of remaining undetectable even in non&#8208;stationary conditions. By employing thousand&#8208;level reconfigurable full&#8208;polarization metasurfaces, this work has achieved an exceptionally high degree of freedom in sculpting the scattering waves as desired. Serving as the core computational unit, a hybrid inverse design enables the cloaked vehicle to respond in real&#8208;time, with a rapid reaction time of just 70&#160;ms. These experiments integrate the cloaked vehicle with a perception&#8208;decision&#8208;control&#8208;execution system and evaluate its performance under random static positions and dynamic travelling trajectories, achieving a background scattering matching degree of up to 93.3%. These findings establish a general paradigm for the next generation of intelligent meta&#8208;devices in real&#8208;world settings, potentially paving the way for an era of &#8220;Electromagnetic Internet of Things.&#8221;

         <title>Enabling Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Charged Near&#8208;Infrared Persistent Luminescence in Organics by Intermolecular Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable hour&#8208;level near&#8208;infrared (NIR) persistent luminescence is achieved by incorporating intermolecular charge transfer and trap states into a typical host&#8208;guest organic system. The constructed host&#8208;guest system allows for charge separation under visible light and efficient light&#8208;energy storage at room temperature by trap states, thus enabling a new triple&#8208;mode NIR anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage technology.








Abstract
Visible light is a universal and user&#8208;friendly excitation source; however, its use to generate persistent luminescence (PersL) in materials remains a huge challenge. Herein, the concept of intermolecular charge transfer (xCT) is applied in typical host&#8211;guest molecular systems, which allows for a much lower energy requirement for charge separation, thus enabling efficient charging of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) PersL in organics by visible light (425&#8211;700&#160;nm). Importantly, NIR PersL in organics occurs via the trapping of electrons from charge&#8208;transfer aggregates (CTAs) into constructed trap states with trap depths of 0.63&#8211;1.17&#160;eV, followed by the detrapping of these electrons by thermal stimulation, resulting in a unique light&#8208;storage effect and long&#8208;lasting emission up to 4.6 h at room temperature. The xCT absorption range is modulated by changing the electron&#8208;donating ability of a series of acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]pyrazine&#8208;8,9&#8208;dicarbonitrile&#8208;based CTAs, and the organic PersL is tuned from 681 to 722&#160;nm. This study on xCT interaction&#8208;induced NIR PersL in organic materials provides a major step forward in understanding the underlying luminescence mechanism of organic semiconductors and these findings are expected to promote their applications in optoelectronics, energy storage, and medical diagnosis.

Abstract
Wearable epidermic electronics assembled from conductive hydrogels are attracting various research attention for their seamless integration with human body for conformally real&#8208;time health monitoring, clinical diagnostics and medical treatment, and human&#8208;interactive sensing. Nevertheless, it remains a tremendous challenge to simultaneously achieve conformally bioadhesive epidermic electronics with remarkable self&#8208;adhesiveness, reliable ultraviolet (UV) protection ability, and admirable sensing performance for high&#8208;fidelity epidermal electrophysiological signals monitoring, along with timely photothermal therapeutic performances after medical diagnostic sensing, as well as efficient antibacterial activity and reliable hemostatic effect for potential medical therapy. Herein, a conformally bioadhesive hydrogel&#8208;based epidermic sensor, featuring superior self&#8208;adhesiveness and excellent UV&#8208;protection performance, is developed by dexterously assembling conducting MXene nanosheets network with biological hydrogel polymer network for conformally stably attaching onto human skin for high&#8208;quality recording of various epidermal electrophysiological signals with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios (SNR) and low interfacial impedance for intelligent medical diagnosis and smart human&#8208;machine interface. Moreover, a smart sign language gesture recognition platform based on collected electromyogram (EMG) signals is designed for hassle&#8208;free communication with hearing&#8208;impaired people with the help of advanced machine learning algorithms. Meanwhile, the bioadhesive MXene hydrogel possesses reliable antibacterial capability, excellent biocompatibility, and effective hemostasis properties for promising bacterial&#8208;infected wound bleeding.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Luminescence, Rapid Self&#8208;Healing, and Adaptive Reprogramming Liquid Crystal Elastomers Enabled by Dynamic Imine Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clusteroluminescence&#8208;based liquid&#8208;crystal elastomers (CL&#8208;LCEs) with fast self&#8208;healing, reprogramming, and actuation properties are prepared using an efficient green strategy. The resulting material can be customized for advanced materials, as demonstrated by their successful application in information storage, anticounterfeiting, actuators, and smart textiles.








Abstract
The integration of advanced functions and diverse practical applications calls for multifunctional liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs); however, the structure&#8208;intrinsic luminescence and excellent mechanical properties of LCEs have not yet been explored. In this study, clusteroluminescence (CL)&#8208;based LCEs (CL&#8208;LCEs) are successfully fabricated without depending on large conjugated structures, thereby avoiding redundant organic synthesis and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. The experimental and theoretical results reveal that secondary amine (&#8211;NH&#8211;) and imine (&#8211;C&#160;=&#160;N&#8211;) groups play vital roles in determining the presence of fluorescence in CL&#8208;LCEs. Based on the above observation, the strategy universalization and a molecular library for constructing CL&#8208;LCEs are further demonstrated. Meanwhile, the dynamic bond of imine bonds endows the CL&#8208;LCE system with rapid self&#8208;healing under mild conditions (70&#160;&#176;C in 10&#160;min), excellent stretchability, and adaptive programmable characteristics. Furthermore, the self&#8208;luminescent performance enables visual detection of the self&#8208;healing process. Finally, CL&#8208;based information storage and anticounterfeiting are successfully realized and their applications in fiber actuators and fluorescent textiles are demonstrated. The distinctive luminescence and dynamic chemistry presented in this work has significant implications in elucidating the mechanism of CL and providing new strategies for the rational design of novel multifunctional LCE materials.

         <title>Two&#8208;Step Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt; 25% Efficiency: Unveiling the Hidden Bottom Surface of Perovskite Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the often&#8208;overlooked PbI2 residual and its detailed impact on device performance are thoroughly investigated. Leveraging effective PbI2 management and precise regulation of the perovskite crystallization process, the champion devices achieve a PCE of 25.06% with long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
While significant efforts in surface engineering have been devoted to the conversion process of lead iodide (PbI2) into perovskite and top surface engineering of perovskite layer with remarkable progress, the exploration of residual PbI2 clusters and the hidden bottom surface on perovskite layer have been limited. In this work, a new strategy involving 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium acetate (BMIMAc) ionic liquid (IL) additives is developed and it is found that both the cations and the anions in ILs can interact with the perovskite components, thereby regulating the crystallization process and diminishing the residue PbI2 clusters as well as filling vacancies. The introduction of BMIMAc ILs induces the formation of a uniform porous PbI2 film, facilitating better penetration of the second&#8208;step organic salt and fostering a more extensive interaction between PbI2 and the organic salt. Surprisingly, the oversized residual PbI2 clusters at the bottom surface of the perovskite layer completely diminish. In addition, advanced depth analysis techniques including depth&#8208;resolved grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS) and bottom thinning technology are employed for a comprehensive understanding of the reduction in residual PbI2. Leveraging effective PbI2 management and regulation of the perovskite crystallization process, the champion devices achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.06% with long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Directed Surface Reconstruction of Fe Modified Co2VO4 Spinel Oxides for Water Oxidation Catalysts Experiencing Self&#8208;Terminating Surface Deterioration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Fe modified Co2VO4 spinel oxide is elaborately designed as high&#8208;performance OER electrocatalyst. With structural flexibility and directed generation of alkali&#8208;resistance surface restructuring layer, the trade&#8208;off between activity and stability of transition metal catalysts is perfectly addressed, and consequently, this catalyst can sustain an alkaline OER operation for 600 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2 with almost no activity decay.








Abstract
Affordable highly efficient catalysts for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) play pivotal roles in green hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Regarding the non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts, considerable efforts are made to decipher the cation leaching and surface reconstruction; yet, little attention is focused on correlating them with catalytical activity and stability. Herein, in situ reconstruction of Fe&#8208;modified Co2VO4 precursor catalyst to form a highly active (Fe,V)&#8208;doped CoOOH phase for OER is reported, during which partial leaching of V accelerates the surface reconstruction and the V reserved in the reconstructed CoOOH layer in the form of alkali&#8208;resistant V2O3 serves for dynamic charge compensation and prevention of excessive loss of lattice oxygen and Co dissolution. Fe substitution facilitates Co pre&#8208;oxidation and endows the catalysts with structural flexibility by elevating O 2p band level; hence, encouraging participation of lattice oxygen in OER. The optimized Co2Fe0.25V0.75O4 electrode can afford current densities of 10 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2 at low overpotentials of 205 and 320 mV, respectively, with satisfactory stability over 600 h. By coupling with Pt/C cathode, the assembled alkaline electrolyzer can deliver 500 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low cell voltage of 1.798 V, better than that of commercial RuO2 (+) || Pt/C (&#8722;).

         <title>Thermal Runaway Mechanism in Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Full Cells of Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: The Role of Multidirectional Crosstalk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work addresses the fundamental causes of thermal runaway in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, particularly in LiNi0.88Co0.1Al0.02O2/graphite full cells, a significant challenge for the electric vehicle industry. By employing synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and calorimetry, the intermediates that establish a self&#8208;amplifying positive feedback loop are comprehensively identified through multidirectional crosstalk.








Abstract
Crosstalk, the exchange of chemical species between battery electrodes, significantly accelerates thermal runaway (TR) of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. To date, the understanding of their main mechanisms has centered on single&#8208;directional crosstalk of oxygen (O2) gas from the cathode to the anode, underestimating the exothermic reactions during TR. However, the role of multidirectional crosstalk in steering additional exothermic reactions is yet to be elucidated due to the difficulties of correlative in situ analyses of full cells. Herein, the way in which such crosstalk triggers self&#8208;amplifying feedback is elucidated that dramatically exacerbates TR within enclosed full cells, by employing synchrotron&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature X&#8208;ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and calorimetry. These findings reveal that ethylene (C2H4) gas generated at the anode promotes O2 evolution at the cathode. This O2 then returns to the anode, further promoting additional C2H4 formation and creating a self&#8208;amplifying loop, thereby intensifying TR. Furthermore, CO2, traditionally viewed as an extinguishing gas, engages in the crosstalk by interacting with lithium at the anode to form Li2CO3, thereby accelerating TR beyond prior expectations. These insights have led to develop an anode coating that impedes the formation of C2H4 and O2, to effectively mitigate TR.

&lt;p&gt;This work addresses the fundamental causes of thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries, particularly in LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.88&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.02&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/graphite full cells, a significant challenge for the electric vehicle industry. By employing synchrotron-based high-temperature X-ray diffraction, mass spectrometry, and calorimetry, the intermediates that establish a self-amplifying positive feedback loop are comprehensively identified through multidirectional crosstalk.

         <title>Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells with &gt;25% Efficiency and High Stability Enabled by Crystallization Modulation and Holistic Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic semiconductor nanoparticles with good dispersion in perovskite inks are facilely synthesized. The addition of these NPs into perovskite inks can effectively facilitate charge extraction and passivate the defects in the holistic perovskite films. The air&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells based on indene&#8208;C60 biadduct nanoparticles realize a high power conversion efficiency of 25.1% and improved stability.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors (e.g., PCBM and IDIC) frequently serve as interface passivants for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their beneficial passivation effects on perovskite interfaces. However, their passivation to the interiors of perovskite films is greatly limited by their poor solubility in polar solvents and compatibility issues. Here the facile synthesis of organic semiconductor nanoparticle (NP) passivants that readily disperse in perovskite inks is reported. Adding these NPs into perovskite inks not only modulates perovskite crystallization, improves film quality and conductivity, but also achieves holistic bulk film passivation. Consequently, blade&#8208;coated p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with ICBA NPs achieve an impressive efficiency of 25.1% (independently certified as 25.0%), the highest reported value for air&#8208;processed PSCs irrespective of fabrication methods or device structures. This work develops a novel approach for effective and holistic perovskite passivation by converting conventional passivants to perovskite&#8208;compatible NPs, paving the way for more efficient and stable perovskite solar devices.

         <title>Superconductivity in Freestanding Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelate Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work reports the synthesis of the superconducting freestanding La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 membranes (Tczero=10.6K${T}_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{zero}}\ =\ 10.6\mathrm{K}$), emphasizing the crucial roles of the interface engineering in the precursor phase film growth and the quick transfer process in achieving superconductivity. This work offers a new versatile platform for investigating superconductivity in nickelates, such as the pairing symmetry via constructing Josephson tunneling junctions and higher Tc values via high&#8208;pressure experiments.








Abstract
The observation of superconductivity in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates has attracted significant attention due to its potential as a new platform for exploring high&#8208;Tc superconductivity. However, thus far, superconductivity has only been observed in epitaxial thin films, which limits the manipulation capabilities and modulation methods compared to two&#8208;dimensional exfoliated materials. Given the exceptionally giant strain tunability and stacking capability of freestanding membranes, separating superconducting nickelates from the as&#8208;grown substrate is a novel way to engineer the superconductivity and uncover the underlying physics. Herein, this work reports the synthesis of the superconducting freestanding La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 membranes (Tczero=10.6K${T}_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{zero}}\ =\ 10.6\ \mathrm{K}$), emphasizing the crucial roles of the interface engineering in the precursor phase film growth and the quick transfer process in achieving superconductivity.

         <title>Adhesive Zwitterionic Poly(ionic liquid) with Unprecedented Organic Solvent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a zwitterionic poly(ionic liquid) (ZPIL) adhesive, known for its exceptional resistance to organic solvents and recyclability. Utilizing electrostatic dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, ZPIL maintains strong adhesion across various substrates and withstands prolonged exposure to organic solvents. This breakthrough addresses key challenges in adhesive technology, offering significant potential for industrial applications in plastics, coatings, and adhesives.








Abstract
The resistance of adhesives to organic solvents is of paramount importance in diverse industries. Unfortunately, many currently available adhesives exhibit either weak intermolecular chain interactions, resulting in insufficient resistance to organic solvents, or possess a permanent covalent crosslinked network, impeding recyclability. This study introduces an innovative approach to address this challenge by formulating zwitterionic poly(ionic liquid) (ZPIL) derivatives with robust dipole&#8211;dipole interactions, incorporating sulfonic anions and imidazolium cations. Due to its unique dynamic and electrostatic self&#8208;crosslinking structure, the ZPIL exhibits significant adhesion to various substrates and demonstrates excellent recyclability even after multiple adhesion tests. Significantly, ZPIL exhibits exceptional adhesion stability across diverse nonpolar and polar organic solvents, including ionic liquids, distinguishing itself from nonionic polymers and conventional poly(ionic liquid)s. Its adhesive performance remains minimally affected even after prolonged exposure to soaking conditions. The study presents a promising solution for the design of highly organic solvent&#8208;resistant materials for plastics, coatings, and adhesives.

         <title>Single Dispersion of Fe(H2O)2&#8208;Based Polyoxometalate on Polymeric Carbon Nitride for Biomimetic CH4 Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Well&#8208;defined Fe single&#8208;site catalyst is constructed by uniformly dispersing nanosized molecular cluster on the polymeric carbon nitride support. The well&#8208;defined (WO)4&#8208;Fea(H2O)2 site can not only act as active site for dramatically boosting methane&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion, but also serves as the model with precise structure for the investigating enzyme&#8208;like catalytic mechanism.








Abstract
Direct methane conversion to value&#8208;added oxygenates under mild conditions with in&#8208;depth mechanism investigation has attracted wide interest. Inspired by methane monooxygenase, the K9Na2Fe(H2O)2{[&#947;&#8208;SiW9O34Fe(H2O)]}2&#183;25H2O polyoxometalate (Fe&#8208;POM) with well&#8208;defined Fe(H2O)2 sites is synthesized to clarify the key role of Fe species and their microenvironment toward CH4 photooxidation. The Fe&#8208;POM can efficiently drive the conversion of CH4 to HCOOH with a yield of 1570.0&#160;&#181;mol gPOM&#8722;1 and 95.8% selectivity at ambient conditions, much superior to that of [Fe(H2O)SiW11O39]5&#8722; with Fe(H2O) active site, [Fe2SiW10O38(OH)]214&#8722; and [P8W48O184Fe16(OH)28(H2O)4]20&#8722; with multinuclear Fe&#8722;OH&#8722;Fe active sites. Single&#8208;dispersion of Fe&#8208;POM on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) is facilely achieved to provide single&#8208;cluster functionalized PCN with well&#8208;defined Fe(H2O)2 site, the HCOOH yield can be improved to 5981.3&#160;&#181;mol gPOM&#8722;1. Systemic investigations demonstrate that the (WO)4&#8722;Fe(H2O)2 can supply Fe&#9552;O active center for C&#8722;H activation via forming (WO)4&#8722;Fea&#8722;Ot&#183;&#183;&#183;CH4 intermediate, similar to that for CH4 oxidation in the monooxygenase. This work highlights a promising and facile strategy for single dispersion of &#8776;1&#8211;2 &#197; metal center with precise coordination microenvironment by uniformly anchoring nanoscale molecular clusters, which provides a well&#8208;defined model for in&#8208;depth mechanism research.

The well-defined (WO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; site can not only act as active site for dramatically boosting methane-to-formate conversion, but also serves as the model with precise structure for the investigating enzyme-like catalytic mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct methane conversion to value-added oxygenates under mild conditions with in-depth mechanism investigation has attracted wide interest. Inspired by methane monooxygenase, the K&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{[&#947;-SiW&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;34&lt;/sub&gt;Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)]}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;25H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O polyoxometalate (Fe-POM) with well-defined Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sites is synthesized to clarify the key role of Fe species and their microenvironment toward CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photooxidation. The Fe-POM can efficiently drive the conversion of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to HCOOH with a yield of 1570.0&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sub&gt;POM&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 95.8% selectivity at ambient conditions, much superior to that of [Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)SiW&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;39&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;5&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) active site, [Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiW&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;14&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and [P&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;W&lt;sub&gt;48&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;184&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;28&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;20&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; with multinuclear Fe&#8722;OH&#8722;Fe active sites. Single-dispersion of Fe-POM on polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) is facilely achieved to provide single-cluster functionalized PCN with well-defined Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; site, the HCOOH yield can be improved to 5981.3&#160;&#181;mol g&lt;sub&gt;POM&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Systemic investigations demonstrate that the (WO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Fe(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can supply Fe&#9552;O active center for C&#8722;H activation via forming (WO)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;Fe&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&#8722;O&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&#183;&#183;CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate, similar to that for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation in the monooxygenase. This work highlights a promising and facile strategy for single dispersion of &#8776;1&#8211;2 &#197; metal center with precise coordination microenvironment by uniformly anchoring nanoscale molecular clusters, which provides a well-defined model for in-depth mechanism research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Electroplating Ruthenium Precursor on the Surface Oxidized Nickel Foam for Efficient and Stable Bifunctional Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>

Nanoparticle based catalysts of Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2 with a tuned valence state overcome the thermodynamic instability of Ru active sites. The synergistic modulation of tailored valence state, coordination environment, and electronic property results in fast kinetics for both the OER and HER.








Abstract
Water electrolysis to produce hydrogen (H2) using renewable energy is one of the most promising candidates for realizing carbon neutrality, but its reaction kinetics is hindered by sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ruthenium (Ru) in its high&#8208;valence state (oxide) provides one of the most active OER sites and is less costly, but thermodynamically unstable. The strong interaction between Ru nanoparticles (NPs) and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) is leveraged to directly form Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2 on the surface of a porous nickel foam (NF) electrode via spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction. The formation of Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni bonds at the interface of the Ru NPs and Ni(OH)2 (Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2) on the surface oxidized NF significantly enhance stability of the Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2/NF electrode. In addition to OER, the catalyst is active enough for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, it is able to deliver overpotentials of 228 and 15&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER and HER, respectively. An industry&#8208;scale evaluation using Ru&#8211;Ni(OH)2/NF as both OER and HER electrodes demonstrates a high current density of 1500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (OER: 410&#160;mV; HER: 240&#160;mV), surpassing commercial RuO2 (OER: 600&#160;mV) and Pt/C based performance (HER: 265&#160;mV).

         <title>Handedness&#8208;Inverted and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Luminescent Nano/Micromaterials Through Pathway&#8208;Dependent Chiral Supramolecular Polymorphism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Handedness&#8208;inverted circularly polarized luminescent nano/micromaterials from the same monomers in the same concentrations and the same solvent have been prepared through a pathway&#8208;dependent chiral supramolecular polymorphism approach for the first time, which display multistimuli responsive and ON&#8211;OFF switching abilities.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of supramolecular polymorphs has been widely applied to control the morphologies and functions of self&#8208;assemblies, but is rarely utilized for the fabrication of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials with tailored properties. Here, this work reports that an amphiphilic naphthalene&#8208;histidine compound (NIHis) readily self&#8208;assembled into distinct chiral nanostructures through pathway&#8208;dependent supramolecular polymorphism, which shows opposite and multistimuli responsive CPL signals. Specifically, NIHis display assembly&#8208;induced CPL from the polymorphic keto tautomer, which become predominant during enol&#8208;keto tautomerization shifting controlled by a bulk solvent effect. Interestingly, chiral polymorphs of nanofiber and microbelt with inverted CPL signals can be prepared from the same NIHis monomer in exactly the same solvent compositions and concentrations by only changing the temperature. The tunable CPL performance of the solid microbelts is realized under multi external physical or chemical stimuli including grinding, acid fuming, and heating. In particular, an emission color and CPL on&#8211;off switch based on the microbelt polymorph by reversible heating&#8211;cooling protocol is developed. This work brings a new approach for developing smart CPL materials via supramolecular polymorphism engineering.

By harnessing the unique property changes induced by photothermal effects in 2D graphene oxide (GO) films, three novel functionalities beyond the capability of photonic integrated circuits are demonstrated, including all&#8208;optical control and tuning, optical power limiting, and nonreciprocal light transmission. The experimental results are theoretically analyzed, reflecting intriguing insights into the physics of 2D GO films.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip integration of 2D materials with unique structures and properties endow integrated devices with new functionalities and improved performance. With high flexibility in ways to modify its properties and compatibility with integrated platforms, graphene oxide (GO) is an exceptionally attractive 2D material for hybrid integrated photonic chips. Here, by harnessing unique property changes induced by photothermal effects in 2D GO films, novel functionalities beyond the capability of photonic integrated circuits are demonstrated. These include all&#8208;optical control and tuning, optical power limiting, and nonreciprocal light transmission. The 2D layered GO films are integrated onto photonic chips with precise control of their thickness and size. Benefitting from the broadband optical response of 2D GO films, all three functionalities feature a very wide operational optical bandwidth. By fitting the experimental results with theory, the changes in GO film properties induced by the photothermal effects are analyzed, revealing interesting insights about the physics of 2D GO films. These results highlight the versatility of 2D GO films in implementing new functions for integrated photonic devices for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Carbon Dots&#8208;Inked Paper with Single/Two&#8208;Photon Excited Dual&#8208;Mode Thermochromic Afterglow for Advanced Dynamic Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermochromic afterglow (TCAG) in carbon dots&#8208;inked paper (CDs@Paper) is achieved by tuning the temperature&#8208;dependent dual&#8208;mode afterglow of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The TCAG properties of CDs@Paper are leveraged to design a multidimensional color code containing color and temperature information for advanced dynamic information encryption. And the two&#8208;photon afterglow is first reported in CDs materials.








Abstract
Achieving thermochromic afterglow (TCAG) in a single material for advanced information encryption remains a significant challenge. Herein, TCAG in carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;inked paper (CDs@Paper) is achieved by tuning the temperature&#8208;dependent dual&#8208;mode afterglow of room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The CDs are synthesized through thermal treatment of levofloxacin in melting boric acid with postpurification via dialysis. CDs@Paper exhibit both TCAG and excitation&#8208;dependent afterglow color properties. The TCAG of CDs@Paper exhibits dynamic color changes from blue at high temperatures to yellow at low temperatures by adjusting the proportion of the temperature&#8208;dependent TADF and phosphorescence.

&lt;p&gt;Thermochromic afterglow (TCAG) in carbon dots-inked paper (CDs@Paper) is achieved by tuning the temperature-dependent dual-mode afterglow of room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The TCAG properties of CDs@Paper are leveraged to design a multidimensional color code containing color and temperature information for advanced dynamic information encryption. And the two-photon afterglow is first reported in CDs materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving thermochromic afterglow (TCAG) in a single material for advanced information encryption remains a significant challenge. Herein, TCAG in carbon dots (CDs)-inked paper (CDs@Paper) is achieved by tuning the temperature-dependent dual-mode afterglow of room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The CDs are synthesized through thermal treatment of levofloxacin in melting boric acid with postpurification via dialysis. CDs@Paper exhibit both TCAG and excitation-dependent afterglow color properties. The TCAG of CDs@Paper exhibits dynamic color changes from blue at high temperatures to yellow at low temperatures by adjusting the proportion of the temperature-dependent TADF and phosphorescence. Notably, two-photon afterglow in CDs-based afterglow materials and time-dependent two-photon afterglow colors are achieved for the first time. Moreover, leveraging the opposite emission responses of phosphorescence and TADF to temperature, CDs@Paper demonstrate TCAG with temperature-sensing capabilities across a wide temperature range. Furthermore, a CDs@Paper-based 3D code containing color and temperature information is successfully developed for advanced dynamic information encryption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photosensitizer&#8208;Amplified Antimicrobial Materials for Broad&#8208;Spectrum Ablation of Resistant Pathogens in Ocular Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of photodynamic therapy agents combining nonphotosensitive and photosensitive benzodiazoles and their modular integration into peptide sequences for broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity is presented. Chemical optimization leads to PEP3 with strong phototoxicity against Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria as well as fungi, including MDR pathogens, biofilms, and ex vivo porcine models of microbial keratitis.








Abstract
The emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens and the scarcity of new potent antibiotics and antifungals are one of the biggest threats to human health. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) combines light and photosensitizers to kill drug&#8208;resistant pathogens; however, there are limited materials that can effectively ablate different classes of infective pathogens. In the present work, a new class of benzodiazole&#8208;paired materials is designed as highly potent PDT agents with broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activity upon illumination with nontoxic light. The results mechanistically demonstrate that the energy transfer and electron transfer between nonphotosensitive and photosensitive benzodiazole moieties embedded within pathogen&#8208;binding peptide sequences result in increased singlet oxygen generation and enhanced phototoxicity. Chemical optimization renders PEP3 as a novel PDT agent with remarkable activity against MDR bacteria and fungi as well as pathogens at different stages of development (e.g., biofilms, spores, and fungal hyphae), which also prove effective in an ex vivo porcine model of microbial keratitis. The chemical modularity of this strategy and its general compatibility with peptide&#8208;based targeting agents will accelerate the design of highly photosensitive materials for antimicrobial PDT.

         <title>Planar Chlorination Engineering: A Strategy of Completely Breaking the Geometric Symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 Site for Boosting Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The planar chlorination engineering of Fe&#8208;N4 site is successfully designed by &#8220;NaCl&#8208;co&#8208;pyrolysis&#8221; strategy, which completely breaks the geometric symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 site. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst exhibits higher catalytic activities for both oxygen electroreduction and Zn&#8208;air battery test than traditional Fe&#8208;N4 catalyst, revealing the enormous potential of planar chlorination engineering in electrocatalysis, energy storage, and conversion devices.








Abstract
Introducing asymmetric elements and breaking the geometric symmetry of traditional metal&#8208;N4 site for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are meaningful and challenging. Herein, the planar chlorination engineering of Fe&#8208;N4 site is first proposed for remarkably improving the ORR activity. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst with broken symmetry exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.917&#160;V versus RHE, 49 and 72&#160;mV higher than those of traditional Fe&#8208;N4/CN and commercial 20 wt% Pt/C catalysts. The Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst also has excellent stability for 25&#160;000 cycles and good methanol tolerance ability. For Zn&#8208;air battery test, the Fe&#8208;N4/CNCl catalyst has the maximum power density of 228&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and outstanding stability during 150&#160;h charge&#8211;discharge test, as the promising substitute of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in energy storage and conversion devices. The density functional theory calculation demonstrates that the adjacent C&#9472;Cl bond effectively breaks the symmetry of Fe&#8208;N4 site, downward shifts the d&#8208;band center of Fe, facilitates the reduction and release of OH*, and remarkably lowers the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step. This work reveals the enormous potential of planar chlorination engineering for boosting the ORR activity of traditional metal&#8208;N4 site by thoroughly breaking their geometric symmetry.

         <title>Unconventional Band Structure via Combined Molecular Orbital and Lattice Symmetries in a Surface&#8208;Confined Metallated Graphdiyne Sheet</title>

ToC Figure illustrates the emergence of unconventional band structure in mesoscopically (&#8776;1 &#181;m) ordered metallated&#8208;graphdiyne single sheet due to combined frontier molecular orbital and lattice symmetries.








Abstract
Graphyne (GY) and graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based monolayers represent the next generation 2D carbon&#8208;rich materials with tunable structures and properties surpassing those of graphene. However, the detection of band formation in atomically thin GY/GDY analogues has been challenging, as both long&#8208;range order and atomic precision have to be fulfilled in the system. The present&#160;work reports direct evidence of band formation in on&#8208;surface synthesized metallated Ag&#8208;GDY sheets with mesoscopic (&#8776;1&#160;&#181;m) regularity. Employing scanning tunneling and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopies, energy&#8208;dependent transitions of real&#8208;space electronic states above the Fermi level and formation of the valence band are respectively observed. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations corroborate the observations and reveal that doubly degenerate frontier molecular orbitals on a honeycomb lattice give rise to flat, Dirac and Kagome bands close to the Fermi level. DFT modeling also indicates an intrinsic band gap for the pristine sheet material, which is retained for a bilayer with h&#8208;BN, whereas adsorption&#8208;induced in&#8208;gap electronic states evolve at the synthesis platform with Ag&#8208;GDY decorating the (111) facet of silver. These results illustrate the tremendous potential for engineering novel band structures via molecular orbital and lattice symmetries in atomically precise 2D carbon materials.

         <title>Brain Delivery of Protein Therapeutics by Cell Matrix&#8208;Inspired Biomimetic Nanocarrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell matrix&#8208;inspired biomimetic nanocarrier for intracerebral delivery of protein therapeutics. It transports diverse proteins across the blood&#8211;brain barrier. It facilitates rapid intracellular delivery and release of catalase via macropinocytosis&#8208;activated membrane fusion, resulting in improved spatial learning and memory in traumatic brain injury mice, and enhances motor function and prolongs survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice.








Abstract
Protein therapeutics are anticipated to offer significant treatment options for central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, the majority of proteins are unable to traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and reach their CNS target sites. Inspired by the natural environment of active proteins, the cell matrix components hyaluronic acid (HA) and protamine (PRTM) are used to self&#8208;assemble with proteins to form a protein&#8208;loaded biomimetic core and then incorporated into ApoE3&#8208;reconstituted high&#8208;density lipoprotein (rHDL) to form a protein&#8208;loaded biomimetic nanocarrier (Protein&#8208;HA&#8208;PRTM&#8208;rHDL). This cell matrix&#8208;inspired biomimetic nanocarrier facilitates the penetration of protein therapeutics across the BBB and enables their access to intracellular target sites. Specifically, CAT&#8208;HA&#8208;PRTM&#8208;rHDL facilitates rapid intracellular delivery and release of catalase (CAT) via macropinocytosis&#8208;activated membrane fusion, resulting in improved spatial learning and memory in traumatic brain injury (TBI) model mice (significantly reduces the latency of TBI mice and doubles the number of crossing platforms), and enhances motor function and prolongs survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model mice (extended the median survival of ALS mice by more than 10 days). Collectively, this cell matrix&#8208;inspired nanoplatform enables the efficient CNS delivery of protein therapeutics and provides a novel approach for the treatment of CNS diseases.

Inspired by the natural environment of active proteins, the cell matrix components hyaluronic acid (HA) and protamine (PRTM) are used to self-assemble with proteins to form a protein-loaded biomimetic core and then incorporated into ApoE3-reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rHDL) to form a protein-loaded biomimetic nanocarrier (Protein-HA-PRTM-rHDL). This cell matrix-inspired biomimetic nanocarrier facilitates the penetration of protein therapeutics across the BBB and enables their access to intracellular target sites. Specifically, CAT-HA-PRTM-rHDL facilitates rapid intracellular delivery and release of catalase (CAT) via macropinocytosis-activated membrane fusion, resulting in improved spatial learning and memory in traumatic brain injury (TBI) model mice (significantly reduces the latency of TBI mice and doubles the number of crossing platforms), and enhances motor function and prolongs survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model mice (extended the median survival of ALS mice by more than 10 days). Collectively, this cell matrix-inspired nanoplatform enables the efficient CNS delivery of protein therapeutics and provides a novel approach for the treatment of CNS diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Neutral Cyanine: Ultra&#8208;Stable NIR&#8208;II Merocyanines for Highly Efficient Bioimaging and Tumor&#8208;Targeted Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II emissive neutral merocyanine dye is developed based on the clinically used ionic indocyanine green, exhibiting maintained strong near&#8208;infrared absorption, improved photostability, enhanced photothermal performance, bright NIR&#8208;II emission, and specific tumor accumulation. The mCy890 NPs are successfully utilized for efficient in vivo NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging and cancer phototheranostics.









Abstract
Fluorescence imaging (FLI)&#8208;guided phototheranostics using emission from the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window show significant potential for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Clinical imaging&#8208;used polymethine ionic indocyanine green (ICG) dye is widely adopted for NIR fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) research due to its exceptional photophysical properties. However, ICG has limitations such as poor photostability, low photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), short&#8208;wavelength emission peak, and liver&#8208;targeting issues, which restrict its wider use. In this study, two ionic ICG derivatives are transformed into neutral merocyanines (mCy) to achieve much&#8208;enhanced performance for NIR&#8208;II cancer phototheranostics. Initial designs of two ionic dyes show similar drawbacks as ICG in terms of poor photostability and low photothermal performance. One of the modified neutral molecules, mCy890, shows significantly improved stability, an emission peak over 1000&#160;nm, and a high photothermal PCE of 51%, all considerably outperform ICG. In vivo studies demonstrate that nanoparticles of the mCy890 can effectively accumulate at the tumor sites for cancer photothermal therapy guided by NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging. This research provides valuable insights into the development of neutral merocyanines for enhanced cancer phototheranostics.

Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2402024, Jongwoo Lim and co&#8208;workers explore the fundamental causes of temperature surges during thermal runaway in lithium&#8208;ion battery full cells. The article identifies intermediates that create a self&#8208;amplifying loop via multidirectional crosstalk between the battery electrodes. The cover image depicts this crosstalk, illustrating how ethylene gas from the anode and oxygen gas from the cathode trigger thermal runaway.

Highways for Spins
The spins efficiently move on the highways formed by two topological nodal lines in Fe3GaTe2. The brighter, upward, and large arrows indicate the presence of strongly correlated states that can preserve the spins traveling on the highways. In the cover image, Yeongkwan Kim, Myung Joon Han, Heejun Yang, and co&#8208;workers express the flat nodal lines in Fe3GaTe2 by the two straight ways for spins, and the spins' moving on the highways is observed as exceptionally the high anomalous Hall effect in Fe3GaTe2.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Highways for Spins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spins efficiently move on the highways formed by two topological nodal lines in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The brighter, upward, and large arrows indicate the presence of strongly correlated states that can preserve the spins traveling on the highways. In the cover image, Yeongkwan Kim, Myung Joon Han, Heejun Yang, and co-workers express the flat nodal lines in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by the two straight ways for spins, and the spins' moving on the highways is observed as exceptionally the high anomalous Hall effect in Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Electromagnetic Navigation Systems for Minimally Invasive Surgery
Magnetic navigation systems (MNSs) are used to precisely manipulate magnetically responsive materials enabling the realization of new minimally invasive procedures. Widespread adoption is currently limited by the size and limits of the current generation of MNSs. In article number 2310701, Simone Gervasoni, Salvador Pan&#233;, Bradley J. Nelson, and co&#8208;workers present a new generation of a human&#8208;scale mobile eMNS, capable of manipulating tethered robotic catheters and untethered magnetic microrobots.

Quantum Materials
Integrating topological materials and high temperature superconductors is critical for new applications. However, merging materials at atomically sharp interfaces presents distinct materials challenges. In article 2401809, Robert G. Moore, Matthew Brahlek, and co&#8208;workers show an unconventional way to enhance superconductivity at epitaxial interfaces between the Bi&#8208;Te topological insulators and Fe(Se,Te), which highlights unusual properties while moving a step closer to the generation of new quantum technologies.

On&#8208;Demand Crack Formation
In article number 2314374, Dong Ki Yoon, Seunghwa Ryu, Soon Mo Park, and their colleagues present a simple method for creating aligned cracks via organic solvent&#8208;induced dehydration on DNA liquid crystal films. The directional fractures result from the anisotropic volume shrinkage of DNA polymers, and this will provide a new platform for patterning applications.

         <title>Visualizing Dynamic Single Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many heterogeneous catalytic processes are key to developing sustainable products and energy. Visualization and analysis of dynamic single atom catalysis provide insights into the processes. The example shows in&#160;situ ESTEM&#8208;HAADF observations of carbon supported platinum catalysts important for fuel cells, revealing single atoms, atom clusters and multiple phases at 400&#160;&#176;C in hydrogen gas. The scale bar is 5&#160;nm.








Abstract
Many industrial chemical processes, including for producing fuels, foods, pharmaceuticals, chemicals and environmental controls, employ heterogeneous solid state catalysts at elevated temperatures in gas or liquid environments. Dynamic reactions at the atomic level play a critical role in catalyst stability and functionality. In situ visualization and analysis of atomic&#8208;scale processes in real time under controlled reaction environments can provide important insights into practical frameworks to improve catalytic processes and materials. This review focuses on innovative real time in situ electron microscopy (EM)&#160;methods, including recent progress in analytical in&#160;situ environmental (scanning) transmission EM (E(STEM), incorporating environmental scanning TEM (ESTEM) and environmental transmission EM (ETEM), with single atom resolution for visualizing and analysing dynamic single atom catalysis under controlled flowing gas reaction environments. ESTEM studies of single atom dynamics of reactions, and of sintering deactivation, contribute to a better&#8208;informed understanding of the yield and stability of catalyst operations. Advances in in situ technologies, including gas and liquid sample holders, nanotomography, and higher voltages, as well as challenges and opportunities in tracking reacting atoms, are highlighted. The findings show that the understanding and application of fundamental processes in catalysis can be improved, with valuable economic, environmental, and societal benefits.

         <title>Breaking the pH Limitation of Nanozymes: Mechanisms, Methods, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic activity of nanozymes is often pH dependent with elusive mechanism. In this review, the pH&#8208;dependent activities of peroxidase&#8208;like, oxidase&#8208;like, and catalase&#8208;like nanozymes are systematically summarized. Moreover, the inner pH&#8208;dependent mechanisms, methods to break through the limitation of catalytic pH, and applications of pH&#8208;independent nanozymes are comprehensively discussed.








Abstract
Although nanozymes have drawn great attention over the past decade, the activities of peroxidase&#8208;like, oxidase&#8208;like, and catalase&#8208;like nanozymes are often pH dependent with elusive mechanism, which largely restricts their application. Therefore, a systematical discussion on the pH&#8208;related catalytic mechanisms of nanozymes together with the methods to overcome this limitation is in need. In this review, various nanozymes exhibiting pH&#8208;dependent catalytic activities are collected and the root causes for their pH dependence are comprehensively analyzed. Subsequently, regulatory concepts including catalytic environment reconstruction and direct catalytic activity improvement to break this pH restriction are summarized. Moreover, applications of pH&#8208;independent nanozymes in sensing, disease therapy, and pollutant degradation are overviewed. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities on the development of pH&#8208;independent nanozymes are suggested. It is anticipated that this review will promote the further design of pH&#8208;independent nanozymes and broaden their application range with higher efficiency.

         <title>Critical Review of Cu&#8208;Based Hole Transport Materials for Perovskite Solar Cells: From Theoretical Insights to Experimental Validation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;based binary oxides and chalcogenides face narrow bandgap issues. The &#8220;chemical modulation of the valence band&#8221; strategy creates ternary oxides with low mobility and ternary chalcogenides with high mobility but band alignment mismatch with perovskites. Cu&#8208;based halides are good hole&#8208;transporters but unstable. Single&#8208;anion types have limitations; composite anion compounds and mixed&#8208;cation chalcogenides are promising for future research.








Abstract
Despite the remarkable efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), long&#8208;term stability remains the primary barrier to their commercialization. The prospect of enhancing stability by substituting organic transport layers with suitable inorganic compounds, particularly Cu&#8208;based inorganic hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs), holds promise due to their high valence band maximum (VBM) aligning with perovskite characteristics. This review assesses the advantages and disadvantages of these five types of Cu&#8208;based HTMs. Although Cu&#8208;based binary oxides and chalcogenides face narrow bandgap issues, the &#8220;chemical modulation of the valence band&#8221; (CMVB) strategy has successfully broadened the bandgap for Cu&#8208;based ternary oxides and chalcogenides. However, Cu&#8208;based ternary oxides encounter challenges with low mobility, and Cu&#8208;based ternary chalcogenides face mismatches in VBM alignment with perovskites. Cu&#8208;based binary halides, especially CuI, exhibit excellent properties such as wider bandgap, high mobility, and defect tolerance, but their stability remains a concern. These limitations of single anion compounds are insightfully discussed, offering solutions from the perspective of practical application. Future research can focus on Cu&#8208;based composite anion compounds, which merge the advantages of single anion compounds. Additionally, mixed&#8208;cation chalcogenides such as CuxM1&#8722;xS enable the customization of HTM properties by selecting and adjusting the proportions of cation M.

         <title>Toward Durable CO2 Electroreduction with Cu&#8208;Based Catalysts via Understanding Their Deactivation Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review article, factors contributing to the gradual loss of performance in copper&#8208;based, ambient temperature CO2 electrochemical reduction systems are summarized into generalized deactivation modes that are applicable to other systems. Fundamental principles and mitigation strategies to each deactivation mode are discussed based on recent in situ/operando characterization studies in structure&#8208; and composition&#8208;activity relationship.








Abstract
The technology of CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) provides a means to convert CO2, a waste greenhouse gas, into value&#8208;added chemicals. Copper is the most studied element that is capable of catalyzing CO2ER to obtain multicarbon products, such as ethylene, ethanol, acetate, etc., at an appreciable rate. Under the operating condition of CO2ER, the catalytic performance of Cu decays because of several factors that alters the surface properties of Cu. In this review, these factors that cause the degradation of Cu&#8208;based CO2ER catalysts are categorized into generalized deactivation modes, that are applicable to all electrocatalytic systems. The fundamental principles of each deactivation mode and the associated effects of each on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are discussed in detail. Structure&#8208; and composition&#8208;activity relationship developed from recent in situ/operando characterization studies are presented as evidence of related deactivation modes in operation. With the aim to address these deactivation modes, catalyst design and reaction environment engineering rationales are suggested. Finally, perspectives and remarks built upon the recent advances in CO2ER are provided in attempts to improve the durability of CO2ER catalysts.

         <title>4D Printing for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews four&#8208;dimensional (4D) (bio&#8208;)printing, highlighting its application in biomedical engineering for developing medical devices (e.g., stents, microneedles (MNs), and implants). It further explores smart biomaterials, external stimuli, and design strategies essential for the success of 4D printing. Additionally, it discusses future research directions, including in vivo tissue regeneration and machine learning&#8208;based modeling to predict the behavior of 4D printed constructs.








Abstract
4D (bio&#8208;)printing endows 3D printed (bio&#8208;)materials with multiple functionalities and dynamic properties. 4D printed materials have been recently used in biomedical engineering for the design and fabrication of biomedical devices, such as stents, occluders, microneedles, smart 3D&#8208;cell engineered microenvironments, drug delivery systems, wound closures, and implantable medical devices. However, the success of 4D printing relies on the rational design of 4D printed objects, the selection of smart materials, and the availability of appropriate types of external (multi&#8208;)stimuli. Here, this work first highlights the different types of smart materials, external stimuli, and design strategies used in 4D (bio&#8208;)printing. Then, it presents a critical review of the biomedical applications of 4D printing and discusses the future directions of biomedical research in this exciting area, including in vivo tissue regeneration studies, the implementation of multiple materials with reversible shape memory behaviors, the creation of fast shape&#8208;transformation responses, the ability to operate at the microscale, untethered activation and control, and the application of (machine learning&#8208;based) modeling approaches to predict the structure&#8211;property and design&#8211;shape transformation relationships of 4D (bio)printed constructs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the recent developments in electronic skin (e&#8208;skin) caused by various new materials and functions. The topics covered include material properties, functional integration, and applications. The current application status and future development directions and challenges of e&#8208;skin in the field of health monitoring are discussed.








Abstract
Electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), a skin&#8208;like wearable electronic device, holds great promise in the fields of telemedicine and personalized healthcare because of its good flexibility, biocompatibility, skin conformability, and sensing performance. E&#8208;skin can monitor various health indicators of the human body in real time and over the long term, including physical indicators (exercise, respiration, blood pressure, etc.) and chemical indicators (saliva, sweat, urine, etc.). In recent years, the development of various materials, analysis, and manufacturing technologies has promoted significant development of e&#8208;skin, laying the foundation for the application of next&#8208;generation wearable medical technologies and devices. Herein, the properties required for e&#8208;skin health monitoring devices to achieve long&#8208;term and precise monitoring and summarize several detectable indicators in the health monitoring field are discussed. Subsequently, the applications of integrated e&#8208;skin health monitoring systems are reviewed. Finally, current challenges and future development directions in this field are discussed. This review is expected to generate great interest and inspiration for the development and improvement of e&#8208;skin and health monitoring systems.

         <title>What Matters for the Charge Transport of 2D Perovskites?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review first comprehensively analyzes the factors influencing the charge transport properties of 2D perovskites from four key aspects. It then consolidates and compares the common transport testing methods for 2D perovskites, followed by investigating strategies to enhance charge transport properties from a compositional approach.








Abstract
Compared to 3D perovskites, 2D perovskites exhibit excellent stability, structural diversity, and tunable bandgaps, making them highly promising for applications in solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and photodetectors. However, the trade&#8208;off for worse charge transport is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. This comprehensive review first discusses the structure of 3D and 2D metal halide perovskites, then summarizes the significant factors influencing charge transport in detail and provides a brief overview of the testing methods. Subsequently, various strategies to improve the charge transport are presented, including tuning A&#8242;&#8208;site organic spacer cations, A&#8208;site cations, B&#8208;site metal cations, and X&#8208;site halide ions. Finally, an outlook on the future development of improving the 2D perovskites&#8217; charge transport is discussed.

         <title>Beyond Lipids: Exploring Advances in Polymeric Gene Delivery in the Lipid Nanoparticles Era</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent surge in lipid popularity, driven by approval of lipid nanoparticle vaccines, overshadows polymers as gene delivery vectors. Nonetheless, polymeric systems are advancing in clinical trials, with multiple early&#8208;stage companies actively developing them. This review highlights advances in polymer design for gene delivery via polyplexes and covalent polymer&#8208;nucleic acid conjugates, and briefly covers novel computational techniques for improved design.








Abstract
The recent success of gene therapy during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has underscored the importance of effective and safe delivery systems. Complementing lipid&#8208;based delivery systems, polymers present a promising alternative for gene delivery. Significant advances have been made in the recent past, with multiple clinical trials progressing beyond phase I and several companies actively working on polymeric delivery systems which provides assurance that polymeric carriers can soon achieve clinical translation. The massive advantage of structural tunability and vast chemical space of polymers is being actively leveraged to mitigate shortcomings of traditional polycationic polymers and improve the translatability of delivery systems. Tailored polymeric approaches for diverse nucleic acids and for specific subcellular targets are now being designed to improve therapeutic efficacy. This review describes the recent advances in polymer design for improved gene delivery by polyplexes and covalent polymer&#8208;nucleic acid conjugates. The review also offers a brief note on novel computational techniques for improved polymer design. The review concludes with an overview of the current state of polymeric gene therapies in the clinic as well as future directions on their translation to the clinic.

         <title>Transparent Recombination Layers Design and Rational Characterizations for Efficient Two&#8208;Terminal Perovskite&#8208;Based Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent recombination layers for two&#8208;terminal perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells are reviewed, including their fundamental functions, photophysical mechanisms, working principles, requirements, and characterization methods. Existing challenges and future perspectives for research in this promising field are also presented.








Abstract
Two&#8208;terminal (2T) perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) arouse burgeoning interest in breaking the Shockley&#8211;Queisser (S&#8211;Q) limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells by combining two subcells with different bandgaps. However, the highest certified efficiency of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs (33.9%) lags behind the theoretical limit (42&#8211;43%). A vital challenge limiting the development of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs is the transparent recombination layers/interconnecting layers (RLs) design between two subcells. To improve the performance of 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs, RLs simultaneously fulfill the optical loss, contact resistance, carrier mobility, stress management, and conformal coverage requirements. In this review, the definition, functions, and requirements of RLs in 2T perovskite&#8208;based TSCs are presented. The insightful characterization methods applicable to RLs, which are inspiring for further research on the RLs both in 2T perovskite&#8208;based two&#8208;junction and multi&#8208;junction TSCs, are also highlighted. Finally, the key factors that currently limit the performance enhancement of RLs and the future directions that should be continuously focused on are summarized.

         <title>Advances in Mixed Tin&#8208;Lead Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for Single&#8208;Junction and All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 31, August 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the development of tin&#8208;lead perovskites and their applications in single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. The fundamental structural and optoelectronic properties of tin&#8208;lead perovskites and the recent advances with various approaches covering additives, solvents, interfaces, perovskite growth, and charge transport materials are discussed. The challenges and strategies for further development are also provided.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic metal&#8208;halide perovskites have received great attention for photovoltaic (PV) applications owing to their superior optoelectronic properties and the unprecedented performance development. For single&#8208;junction PV devices, although lead (Pb)&#8208;based perovskite solar cells have achieved 26.1% efficiency, the mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites offer more ideal bandgap tuning capability to enable an even higher performance. The Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite (with a bandgap tuned to &#8776;1.2&#160;eV) is also attractive as the bottom subcell for a tandem configuration to further surpass the Shockley&#8211;Queisser radiative limit for the single&#8208;junction devices. The performance of the all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells has gained rapid development and achieved a certified efficiency up to 29.1%. In this article, the properties and recent development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites and their application in single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells are reviewed. Recent advances in various approaches covering additives, solvents, interfaces, and perovskite growth are highlighted. The authors also provide the perspective and outlook on the challenges and strategies for further development of mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites in both efficiency and stability for PV applications.

         <title>Engineering Mesoscale T Cell Receptor Clustering by Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Nanotools</title>

Abstract
T&#160;cell receptor (TCR) clustering and formation of an immune synapse are crucial for TCR signaling. However, limited information is available about these dynamic assemblies and their connection to transmembrane signaling. Here, we controlled TCR clustering via plug&#8208;and&#8208;play nanotools based on an engineered irreversible conjugation pair and a peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule to compare receptor assembly in a ligand (pMHC)&#8208;induced or ligand&#8208;independent manner. A streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide displayed in both tools enabled their anchoring in streptavidin&#8208;pre&#8208;structured matrices. Strikingly, pMHC&#8208;induced clustering in the confined regions exhibited higher density and dynamics than the ligand&#8208;free approach, indicating that the size and architecture of the pMHC ligand influences TCR assembly. Our approach enables the control of membrane receptor clustering with high specificity and provide the possibility to explore different modalities of receptor activation.

         <title>Atomic Confinement Empowered CoZn Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanotubes for H2O2 Production in Sequential Dual&#8208;Cathode Electro&#8208;Fenton Process</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are flourishing in various fields because of their 100% atomic utilization. However, their uncontrollable selectivity, poor stability and vulnerable inactivation remain critical challenges. According to theoretical predictions and experiments, a heteronuclear CoZn dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom confined in N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) was synthesized via a spatial confinement growth strategy. CoZnSA@CNTs exhibited superior performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis over the entire pH range due to dual&#8208;confinement of the atomic sites and O2 molecule. CoZnSA@CNTs was favorable for H2O2 production mainly because the synergy of adjacent atomic sites, defect&#8208;rich feature and nanotube reactor promoted O2 enrichment and enhanced H2O2 reactivity/selectivity. The H2O2 selectivity reached nearly 100% in a range of 0.2 &#8764; 0.65&#160;V versus RHE and the yield achieved 7.50&#160;M gcat&#8722;1 with CoZnSA@CNTs/carbon fiber felt, which exceeded most of the reported SACs in H&#8208;type cells. The obtained H2O2 was converted directly to sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate in a safe way for H2O2 storage/transportation. The sequential dual&#8208;cathode electron&#8208;Fenton process promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species (&#8226;OH, 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by activating the in&#8208;situ generated H2O2, enabling accelerated degradation of various pollutants and Cr(VI) detoxification in actual wastewater. This work proposes a promising confinement strategy for catalyst design and selectivity regulation of complex reactions.

         <title>Cu/CuxO/Graphdiyne Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity towards NH3 product is a technical challenge. Here we present a graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/CuxO nanoparticles anchored to GDY support (termed Cu/CuxO/GDY) for efficient electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. We achieve a high NH3 yield rate of 25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 (25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% at an applied potential of &#8208;0.8&#160;V versus RHE using the designed catalyst. These performance metrics outperform most reported NO3&#8722; to NH3 catalysts in the alkaline media. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory reveal that the NO3&#8722; preferentially attacks Cu/CuxO, and the GDY can effectively catalyze the reduction of NO2&#8722; to NH3. This work highlights the efficacy of GDY as a new class of tandem catalysts for the artificial nitrogen cycle and provides powerful guidelines for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

Recently, mechanochromic LC materials have becoming a hot topic in multi fields from flexible artificial skins to visualized sensors and smart biomimetic devices. In this review, the recent progress of mechanochromic LCs is comprehensively summarized. Firstly, the mechanism and functionalities of mechanochromic LC is introduced, followed by preparation of various functional materials based on mechanochromic LCs. Then the applications of mechanochromic LCs are provided. Finally, the conclusion and outlooks of this field is given. This overview is hoped to provide inspiration in fabrication of advanced functional soft materials for scientists and engineers from multidisciplines including materials science, elastomers, chemistry and physical science.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.

&lt;p&gt;DNA double helices containing metal-mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Hg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self-assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X-ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3-dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5-position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
