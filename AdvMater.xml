         <title>Durable and Adjustable Interfacial Engineering of Polymeric Electrolytes for Both Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes and High&#8208;Energy Metal Anodes</title>

Abstract
Achieving stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries is crucial for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries with high energy density and high safety. However, the complicated interface problems in both cathode/anode electrodes preclude their practical applications hitherto. Herein, to simultaneously solve such interfacial limitations and obtain sufficient Li+ conductivity in the electrolyte, an ultrathin and adjustable interface is developed at the cathode side through a convenient surface in&#8208;situ polymerization (SIP), achieving a durable high&#8208;voltage tolerance and Li&#8208;dendrite inhibition. The integrated interfacial engineering fabricates a homogeneous solid electrolyte with optimized interfacial interactions that contributes to tame the interfacial compatibility between LiNixCoyMnzO2 and polymeric electrolyte accompanied by anti&#8208;corrosion of aluminum current collector. Further, the SIP enables a uniform adjustment of solid electrolyte composition by dissolving additives such as Na+ and K+ salts, which presents prominent cyclability in symmetric Li cells (&gt;300 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). The assembled LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2(4.3&#160;V)||Li batteries show excellent cycle life with high Coulombic efficiencies (&gt;99%). This SIP strategy is also investigated and verified in sodium metal batteries. It opens a new frontier for solid electrolytes towards high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;energy metal battery technologies.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Halide Perovskite Nanocrystal Superlattice: Self&#8208;Assembly and Optical Fingerprints</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;halide perovskite superlattices assembled from dispersed nanocrystals feature abundant geometries and unique optical properties, becoming intriguing study objects both for fundamental research and practical applications. A review covering packing models, functional capping ligands, synthetic methodologies, characterization technologies, optical fingerprints, and contemporary applications is presented. Outstanding issues and the&#160;perspective outlook&#160;are highlighted to inspire more research in this field.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystals into superlattices is a fascinating process that not only changes geometric morphology, but also creates unique properties that considerably enrich the material toolbox for new applications. Numerous studies have driven the blossoming of superlattices from various aspects. These include precise control of size and morphology, enhancement of properties, exploitation of functions, and&#160;integration of the material into miniature devices. The effective synthesis of metal&#8211;halide perovskite nanocrystals has advanced research on self&#8208;assembly of building blocks into micrometer&#8208;sized superlattices. More importantly, these materials exhibit abundant optical features,&#160;including highly coherent superfluorescence, amplified spontaneous laser emission, and adjustable spectral redshift, facilitating basic research and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. This review summarizes recent advances in the field of metal&#8211;halide perovskite superlattices. It begins with basic packing models and introduces various stacking configurations of superlattices. The potential of multiple capping ligands is also discussed and their crucial role in superlattice growth is highlighted, followed by detailed reviews of synthesis and characterization methods. How these optical features can be distinguished and present contemporary applications is then considered. This review concludes with a list of unanswered questions and an outlook on their potential use in quantum computing and quantum communications to stimulate further research in this area.

         <title>Reversible Perspiring Artificial &#8220;Fingertips&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a coating made of liquid crystal networks&#160;is designed to mimic not only the unique fingerprint topography, but also the liquid secretion in human fingertips. The biomimetic perspiration of the coating is reversible as controlled by light, which can be used to fine&#8208;tune the tribological property when the coating is in contact with other surfaces.








Abstract
Fingertip perspiration is a vital process within human predation, to which the species owes its survival and its biological success. In this paper, the unique human ability of extensive perspiration and controlled friction in self&#8208;assembled cholesteric liquid crystals is recreated, mimicking the natural processes that occur in the dermis and epidermis of human skin. This is achieved by inducing porosity in responsive, liquid&#8208;bearing material through the controlled&#8208;polymerization phase&#8208;separation process. The unique topography of human fingerprints is further emulated in the materials by balancing the parallel chirality&#8208;induced force and the perpendicular substrate&#8208;anchoring force during synthesis. As a result, artificial fingertips are capable of secreting and re&#8208;absorbing liquid upon light illumination. By demonstrating the function of the soft material in a tribological aspect, it exhibits a controllable anti&#8208;sliding property&#160;comparable to human fingertips and subsequently attains a higher degree of biomimicry. This biomimetic fingertip is envisioned being applied in a multitude of fields, ranging from biomedical instruments to interactive, human&#8208;like soft robotic devices.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Crosslinked, Highly Entangled Hydrogels with Excellent Mechanical Properties but Ultra&#8208;Low Solid Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully swollen hydrogel with ultra&#8208;low solid content (5.8%) but excellent mechanical properties, including high stretchability (440%), high tensile strength (220 KPa), superb resilience (99%), high fracture toughness (2100 J&#160;m&#8722;2), excellent fatigue resistance (720 J&#160;m&#8722;2), low friction (0.0059), and high wear resistance, are successfully synthesized by combining two recently developed approaches.








Abstract
Low&#160;solid&#160;content&#160;is&#160;the&#160;ultimate&#160;reason&#160;for&#160;the&#160;brittleness&#160;and&#160;weakness of ordinary hydrogels. Here, hydrogels with ultra&#8208;low solid content but good mechanical properties are successfully synthesized using high monomer concentrations and low cross&#8208;linker/monomer ratios to obtain highly entangled structure&#160;and poly(l&#8208;lysine)&#8208;based cross&#8208;linker&#160;to&#160;introduce&#160;peptide&#160;chains. Compared with hydrogel cross&#8208;linked with N,N'&#8208;methylenebisacrylamide (BIS), the peptide&#8208;crosslinked one has a larger swelling degree in water, leading to fully swollen gel with ultra&#8208;low solid content (5.8%). However, it still exhibits excellent mechanical properties, including high stretchability (440%), high tensile strength (220 KPa), superb resilience (99%), high fracture toughness (2100 J&#160;m&#8722;2), excellent fatigue resistance (720 J&#160;m&#8722;2), low friction (0.0059), and high wear resistance. These properties are comparable to or even better than the BIS&#8208;crosslinked hydrogel, although&#160;the former has much lower solid content. The excellent mechanical properties of the peptide&#8208;crosslinked gel are attributed to its highly entangled structure and also to the introduction of a novel mechanism for energy dissipation, that is, energy dissipation via breakage of intramolecular hydrogen bonds stabilizing the helical structure of the&#160;peptide.

         <title>Highly Selective On&#8208;Surface Reactions of Aryl Propiolic Acids via Decarboxylative Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The on&#8208;surface Glaser coupling of aryl propiolic acids is herein&#160;presented as a new class of monomers on Ag(111). The coupling yielding poly(arylenebutadiynylenes) with high selectivity is investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and supportive density functional theory calculations. Further, the selective formation of unsymmetric metal&#8208;organic coordination bonds out of p&#8208;halogenated congeners is disclosed, which might&#160;enable new reactivity of Ag&#8208;adatoms.








Abstract
Aryl propiolic acids are introduced as a new class of monomers in the field of on&#8208;surface chemistry to build up poly(arylenebutadiynylenes) through decarboxylative Glaser coupling. As compared to aryl alkynes that are routinely used in the on&#8208;surface Glaser coupling, it is found that the decarboxylative coupling occurs at slightly lower temperature and with excellent selectivity. Activation occurs through decarboxylation for the propiolic acids, whereas the classical Glaser coupling is achieved through alkyne C&#63743;H activation, and this process shows poor selectivity. The efficiency of the decarboxylative coupling is documented by the successful polymerization of bis(propiolic acids) as monomers. It is also found that the new activation mode is compatible with aryl bromide functionalities, which allows the formation of unsymmetric metal&#8208;organic polymers on the surface by chemoselective sequential reactions. All transformations are analyzed by a scanning tunneling microscope and are further studied by density functional theory calculations.

     alt="Highly Selective On-Surface Reactions of Aryl Propiolic Acids via Decarboxylative Coupling"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The on-surface Glaser coupling of aryl propiolic acids is herein&#160;presented as a new class of monomers on Ag(111). The coupling yielding poly(arylenebutadiynylenes) with high selectivity is investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and supportive density functional theory calculations. Further, the selective formation of unsymmetric metal-organic coordination bonds out of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-halogenated congeners is disclosed, which might&#160;enable new reactivity of Ag-adatoms.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aryl propiolic acids are introduced as a new class of monomers in the field of on-surface chemistry to build up poly(arylenebutadiynylenes) through decarboxylative Glaser coupling. As compared to aryl alkynes that are routinely used in the on-surface Glaser coupling, it is found that the decarboxylative coupling occurs at slightly lower temperature and with excellent selectivity. Activation occurs through decarboxylation for the propiolic acids, whereas the classical Glaser coupling is achieved through alkyne C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;H activation, and this process shows poor selectivity. The efficiency of the decarboxylative coupling is documented by the successful polymerization of bis(propiolic acids) as monomers. It is also found that the new activation mode is compatible with aryl bromide functionalities, which allows the formation of unsymmetric metal-organic polymers on the surface by chemoselective sequential reactions. All transformations are analyzed by a scanning tunneling microscope and are further studied by density functional theory calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chelated Ion&#8208;exchange Strategy towards BiOCl Mesoporous Single&#8208;crystalline Nanosheets for Boosting Photocatalytic Selective Aromatic Alcohols Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The photoresponse and photocatalytic efficiency of bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) are greatly limited by rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers. The construction of porous single&#8208;crystal BiOCl photocatalyst can effectively alleviate this issue and provide accessible active sites. Herein, a facile chelated ion&#8208;exchange strategy was developed to synthesize BiOCl mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets (BiOCl MSCN) using acetic acid and ammonia solution respectively as chelating agent and ionization promoter. The strong chelation between acetate ions and Bi3+ ions introduces acetate ions into the precipitated product to exchange with Cl&#8722; ions, resulting in large lattice mismatch, strain release and formation of void&#8208;like mesopores. The prepared BiOCl MSCN photocatalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance with 99% conversion and 98% selectivity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and superior general adaptability for various aromatic alcohols. The theoretical calculations and characterizations confirm that the superior performance is mainly attributed to the abundant oxygen vacancies, plenty of accessible adsorption/active sites and fast charge transport path without grain boundaries.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer Based Dexterous Artificial Motor Unit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the great advancement in designing diverse soft robots, they are not yet as dexterous as animals in many aspects. One challenge is that they still lack compact design of an artificial motor unit with a great comprehensive performance which can be conveniently fabricated, although many recently developed artificial muscles have shown excellent properties in one or two aspects. Herein, w e develop an artificial motor unit based on gold&#8208;coated ultrathin liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) film. Subjected to a voltage, Joule heating generated by the gold film increases the temperature of the LCE film underneath and causes it to contract. Due to the small thermal inertial and electrically controlling method of the ultrathin LCE structure, its cyclic actuation speed is fast and controllable. W e show that under electrical stimulation, the actuation strain of the LCE&#8208;based motor unit reaches 45%, strain rate is as high as 750%/s, and the output power density is as high as 1360&#160;W/kg. W e further demonstrate that the LCE&#8208;based motor unit behaves like an actuator, a brake, or a nonlinear spring on demand, analogous to most animal muscles. Finally, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, w e demonstrate multiple highly dexterous artificial neuromuscular systems using the LCE&#8208;based motor unit.

         <title>Flexible and Stretchable Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Physiological Sensing Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible and stretchable bioelectronics provides a biocompatible interface between electronics and biological systems and has received tremendous attention for in&#8208;situ monitoring of various biological systems. Considerable progress in organic electronics has made organic semiconductors, as well as other organic electronic materials, ideal candidates for developing wearable, implantable, and biocompatible electronic circuits due to their potential mechanical compliance and biocompatibility. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as an emerging member of organic electronic building blocks, exhibit considerable advantages in biological sensing due to the ionic nature at the base of the switch behavior, low driving voltage (&lt;1 V) and high transconductance (in mS range). During the past few years significant progress in constructing flexible/stretchable OECTs (FSOECTs) for both biochemical and bioelectrical sensing has been reported. In this regard, to summarize major research accomplishments in this emerging field, this review first discusses structure and critical features of FSOECTs, including working principle, materials and architectural engineering. Next, a wide spectrum of relevant physiological sensing applications, where FSOECTs are the key components, are summarized. Last, major challenges and opportunities for further advancing FSOECT physiological sensors are discussed.

         <title>Reconfiguring Hard Carbons with Emerging Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries: a Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hard carbons, an important category of amorphous carbons, are non&#8208;graphitizable and are widely accepted as the most promising anode material for the emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of their changeable low&#8208;potential charge/discharge plateaus. However, their microstructures are not fixed as layer&#8208;structured graphitic materials do and are difficult to accurately demonstrate. The successful use of hard carbons in SIBs revives the interests to give a clear picture of their complicated microstructures that are in close relevance to the sodium storage. In this review, we start by revisiting the past definitions and structural models of hard carbons, and then present our renewed understanding of their sodium storage mechanism, focusing especially on the critical low&#8208;potential plateaus. Three critical structural features are highlighted for hard carbons, namely crystallites, defects and nanopores, which are directly responsible for the presence of the low&#8208;potential plateaus and their reversible extension. The impact of these structural features upon the sodium storage is then deeply discussed and an ideal configuration, namely sieving carbons with tightened pore entrance and enlarged pore body, is finally proposed for superhigh sodium storage. We expect this review to offer a clear picture of hard carbons, and help realize a truly rational design of high&#8208;capacity carbon anodes engining the industrialization of SIBs, and more promisingly open up a window for exploring their possible new uses.

         <title>Van der Waals Epitaxy Growth of 2D Single&#8208;Element Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
2D single&#8208;element materials, which are pure and intrinsically homogeneous on the nanometer scale, could cut the time&#8208;consuming material&#8208;optimization process and circumvent the impure phase, bringing about new opportunities to explore new physics and applications. Herein, for the first time, we demonstrated the synthesis of ultrathin cobalt single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets with sub&#8208;millimeter scale via van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) using a dihalides reduction strategy. The thickness can be as low as &#8764;6&#160;nm. Density functional theory calculations reveal their intrinsic ferromagnetic nature and epitaxial mechanism: that is, the synergistic effect between van der Waals interactions and surface energy minimization dominates the growth process for ultrathin cobalt nanosheets. The as&#8208;grown cobalt nanosheets exhibit ultrahigh blocking temperature above 710 K and in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy. Electrical transport measurements further reveals that cobalt nanosheets have significant magnetoresistance (MR) effect, and could realize a unique coexistence of positive MR and negative MR under different magnetic field configurations, which can be attributed to the competition and cooperation effect among ferromagnetic interaction, orbital scattering and electronic correlation. These results provide a valuable case study for synthesizing 2D elementary metal crystals with pure phase and room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism, and pave the way for investigating new physics and related applications in spintronics.

         <title>A Superconducting Micro&#8208;Magnetometer for Quantum Vortex in Superconducting Nanoflakes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Superconducting quantum interferometer device (SQUID) plays a key role in understanding electromagnetic properties and emergent phenomena in quantum materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Superconducting quantum interferometer device (SQUID) plays a key role in understanding electromagnetic properties and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. The technological appeal of SQUID is that its detection accuracy for the electromagnetic signal can precisely reach the quantum level of a single magnetic flux. However, conventional SQUID techniques normally can only be applied to bulky sample and do not have the capability to probe the magnetic properties of micro-scale samples with small magnetic signals. Herein, it is demonstrated that, based on a specially designed superconducting nano-hole array, the contactless detection of magnetic properties and quantized vortices in micro-sized superconducting nanoflakes is realized. An anomalous hysteresis loop and a suppression of Little&#8211;Parks oscillation was observed in the detected magnetoresistance signal, which originate from the disordered distribution of the pinned vortices in Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CaCu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8+&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;. Therefore, the density of pinning centers of the quantized vortices on such micro-sized superconducting samples can be quantitatively evaluated, which is technically inaccessible for conventional SQUID detection. Our superconducting micro-magnetometer provides a new approach to exploring mesoscopic electromagnetic phenomena of quantum materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>User&#8208;Controlled 4D Biomaterial Degradation with Substrate&#8208;Selective Sortase Transpeptidases for Single&#8208;Cell Biology</title>

Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive biomaterials show great promise for modelling disease dynamics ex vivo with spatiotemporal control over the cellular microenvironment. However, harvesting cells from such materials for downstream analysis without perturbing their state remains an outstanding challenge in 3D/4D culture and tissue engineering. In this manuscript, we introduce a fully enzymatic strategy for hydrogel degradation that affords spatiotemporal control over cell release while maintaining cytocompatibility. Exploiting engineered variants of the sortase transpeptidase evolved to recognize and selectively cleave distinct peptide sequences largely absent from the mammalian proteome, we sidestep many limitations implicit to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods to liberate cells from gels. We demonstrate that evolved sortase exposure has minimal impact on the global transcriptome of primary mammalian cells and that proteolytic cleavage proceeds with high specificity; incorporation of substrate sequences within hydrogel crosslinkers permits rapid and selective cell recovery with high viability. In composite multimaterial hydrogels, we show that sequential degradation of hydrogel layers enables highly specific retrieval of single&#8208;cell suspensions for phenotypic analysis. We expect that the high bioorthogonality and substrate selectivity of the evolved sortases will lead to their broad adoption as an enzymatic material dissociation cue and that their multiplexed use will enable newfound studies in 4D cell culture.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) show great promise for the development of snext&#8208;generation light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) owning to their unique electronic and optoelectronic properties. The dangling bond&#8208;free surface and direct bandgap structure of monolayer TMDCs allow for near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies. The excellent mechanical and optical characteristics of 2D TMDCs offer great potentials to fabricate TMDC&#8208;based LEDs featuring good flexibility and transparency. Great progress has been made in the fabrication of bright and efficient LEDs with varying device structures. In this review article, we aim to provide a comprehensive summary on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the construction of bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs. After a brief introduction on the research background, the preparation of 2D TMDCs used for LEDs is briefly discussed. The requirements and the corresponding challenges to achieve bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs are introduced. Thereafter, various strategies to enhance the brightness of monolayer 2D TMDCs are described. Following that, the carrier injection schemes enabling bright and efficient TMDC&#8208;based LEDs along with the device performance are summarized. Finally, the challenges and future prospects regarding the accomplishment of TMDC&#8208;LEDs with ultimate brightness and efficiency are discussed.

         <title>Jellybean Quantum Dots in Silicon for Qubit Coupling and On&#8208;Chip Quantum Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The small size and excellent integrability of silicon metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot spin qubits make them an attractive system for mass&#8208;manufacturable, scaled&#8208;up quantum processors. Furthermore, classical control electronics can be integrated on&#8208;chip, in&#8208;between the qubits, if an architecture with sparse arrays of qubits is chosen. In such an architecture qubits are either transported across the chip via shuttling, or coupled via mediating quantum systems over short&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate distances. This paper investigates the charge and spin characteristics of an elongated quantum dot &#8211; a so&#8208;called jellybean quantum dot &#8211; for the prospects of acting as a qubit&#8208;qubit coupler. Charge transport, charge sensing and magneto&#8208;spectroscopy measurements are performed on a SiMOS quantum dot device at mK temperature, and compared to Hartree&#8208;Fock multi&#8208;electron simulations. At low electron occupancies where disorder effects and strong electron&#8208;electron interaction dominate over the electrostatic confinement potential, the data reveals the formation of three coupled dots, akin to a tunable, artificial molecule. One dot is formed centrally under the gate and two are formed at the edges. At high electron occupancies, these dots merge into one large dot with well&#8208;defined spin states, verifying that jellybean dots have the potential to be used as qubit couplers in future quantum computing&#160;architectures.

&lt;p&gt;The small size and excellent integrability of silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot spin qubits make them an attractive system for mass-manufacturable, scaled-up quantum processors. Furthermore, classical control electronics can be integrated on-chip, in-between the qubits, if an architecture with sparse arrays of qubits is chosen. In such an architecture qubits are either transported across the chip via shuttling, or coupled via mediating quantum systems over short-to-intermediate distances. This paper investigates the charge and spin characteristics of an elongated quantum dot &#8211; a so-called jellybean quantum dot &#8211; for the prospects of acting as a qubit-qubit coupler. Charge transport, charge sensing and magneto-spectroscopy measurements are performed on a SiMOS quantum dot device at mK temperature, and compared to Hartree-Fock multi-electron simulations. At low electron occupancies where disorder effects and strong electron-electron interaction dominate over the electrostatic confinement potential, the data reveals the formation of three coupled dots, akin to a tunable, artificial molecule.

         <title>Visualizing Catalytic Dynamics Process via Synchrotron Radiation Multi&#8208;Techniques</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The importance of catalysts today as workhorses in most modern industrial fields cannot be downplayed. As a result, rational design and engineering of targeted catalysts have emerged as key objectives and are dependent on in&#8208;depth understanding of complex catalytic dynamics, such as phase transformation, structural reconstruction, electronic evolution, and differentiation in surface and bulk. The synchrotron radiation (SR) light sources with rich advanced experimental methods are being recognized as a comprehensive characterization platform, which could draw a full picture on such multiparameter&#8208;involved catalysis under actual working conditions. Herein, we summarize the recent progress of catalytic dynamics process studied by the means of various SR&#8208;techniques. In particular, the SR&#8208;based spectroscopic, scattering and imaging investigations on true catalysts are firstly introduced with the potential of in situ and operando characterizations. Apparently, the limitations from single SR&#8208;technique naturally prompt a simple combination of SR&#8208;techniques to better understand the whole catalysis process. Moreover, the discrepancies among various online testing facilities and batches of samples, along with random/systematic errors introduced by traditional intermittent/asynchronous measurement make it imperative to develop more prolific system, complementary of multiple SR&#8208;techniques for deep probing of dynamic catalytic processes from atomic, molecular and electronic levels. We believe that booming new light sources will further enrich the current multiple SR&#8208;techniques by offering more synchronous (Femto&#8211;microsecond time scale in the same experiment), fine (&#8764;nm spatial resolution and &#8764;meV energy resolution) and real (actual atmosphere, pressure, temperature, etc.) catalytic conditions, and thus may realize the true visualization on future catalytic dynamic processes.

         <title>Diagnosing and Correcting the Failure of Solid&#8208;state Polymer Electrolyte for Enhancing Solid&#8208;state Lithium&#8208;sulfur Battery</title>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (SPEs) attracted great interest in developing high&#8208;performance yet reliable solid&#8208;state batteries. However, understanding of the failure mechanism of SPE and SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries remains in its infancy, posing a great barrier to practical solid&#8208;state batteries. Herein, we identify the high accumulation and clogging of &#8220;dead&#8221; lithium polysulfides (LiPS) on the interface between the cathode and SPE with intrinsic diffusion limitation as a critical failure cause of SPE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries. It induces a poorly reversible chemical environment with retarded kinetics on the cathode&#8208;SPE interface and in bulk SPEs, starving the Li&#8208;S redox in solid&#8208;state cells. This observation is different from the case in liquid electrolytes with free solvent and charge carriers, where LiPS dissolve but remain alive for electrochemical/chemical redox without interfacial clogging. Electrocatalysis demonstrates the feasibility of tailoring the chemical environment in diffusion&#8208;restricted reaction media for reducing Li&#8208;S redox failure in SPE. It enables Ah&#8208;level solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S pouch cells with a high specific energy of 343 Wh kg&#8211;1 on the cell level. This work may shed new light on the understanding of the failure mechanism of SPE for bottom&#8208;up improvement of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Ni&#8211;Cu Catalysts for pH&#8208;Universal CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with alkaline and neutral electrolytes, using an acidic electrolyte for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) can significantly improve the carbon utilization efficiency. Herein, a Ni&#8211;Cu dual&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is developed for pH&#8208;universal CO2 electroreduction, which shows superior catalytic performance due to the electronic interaction between the Ni and the Cu. In particular, the carbon utilization efficiency increases from 33.0% to 64.3%.








Abstract
CO2 electroreduction is of great significance to reduce CO2 emissions and complete the carbon cycle. However, the unavoidable carbonate formation and low CO2 utilization efficiency in neutral or alkaline electrolytes hinder its application at commercial scale. The development of CO2 reduction under acidic conditions provides a promising strategy, but the inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction is difficult. Herein, the first work to design a Ni&#8211;Cu dual atom catalyst supported on hollow nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon is reported for pH&#8208;universal CO2 electroreduction to CO. The catalyst shows a high CO Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;99% in acidic, neutral, and alkaline electrolytes, and the partial current densities of CO reach 190 &#177; 11, 225 &#177; 10, and 489 &#177; 14&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. In particular, the CO2 utilization efficiency under acidic conditions reaches 64.3%, which is twice as high as that of alkaline conditions. Detailed study indicates the existence of electronic interaction between Ni and Cu atoms. The Cu atoms push the Ni d&#8208;band center further toward the Fermi level, thereby accelerating the formation of *COOH. In addition, operando characterizations and density functional theory calculation are used to elucidate the possible reaction mechanism of CO2 to CO under acidic and alkaline electrolytes.

         <title>Pore Perforation of Graphene Coupled with In Situ Growth of Co3Se4 for High&#8208;Performance Na&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pore&#8208;forming engineering has been employed to simultaneously achieve the perforation of graphene nanosheets and the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. Benefiting from the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction, Co3Se4/holey&#160;graphene&#160;(Co3Se4/HG) as anode material exhibits remarkable rate performance and excellent cycling performance in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Graphene&#8208;based nanomaterials have sprung up as promising anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries due to the intriguing properties of graphene itself and the synergic effect between graphene and active materials. However, the 2D&#160;graphene sheet only allows the rapid diffusion of sodium ions along the parallel direction while that of the vertical direction is difficult, limiting the rate capability of graphene&#8208;based electrode materials. To tackle this problem, pore&#8208;forming engineering has been employed to perforate graphene and concurrently achieve the in situ growth of Co3Se4 nanoparticles. The generation of in&#8208;plane nanohole breaks through the physical barriers of the graphene nanosheets, enabling the fast diffusion of electrolyte ions in the longitudinal direction. In addition, this design limits the aggregation of Co3Se4 nanoparticles because of the high affinity of Co3Se4 on graphene. Benefiting from the high conductivity and fast ion transport bestowed by the ingenious architecture, the Co3Se4/holey graphene exhibits a remarkable rate performance of 519.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 and desirable cycle stability. Conclusions drawn from this investigation are that the transport of sodium inside the graphene&#8208;based composites is crucial for rate performance enhancement and this method is effective in modifying graphene&#8208;based nanomaterials as potential anode materials.

Based on the super&#8208;semiconducting metallic bi&#8208;layer shell arrays, this experiment realizes super&#8208;semiconductor&#160;p&#8208;n junction diodes with near zero&#8208;threshold&#160;voltage and a high breakdown field (&#8776;1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;1). This research paves the way to develop ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power semiconducting transistors, integrated circuits, chips, and power devices.








Abstract
Semiconductor devices are currently one of the most common energy consumption devices. Significantly reducing the energy consumption of semiconductor devices with advanced energy&#8208;efficient technologies is highly desirable. The discovery of super&#8208;semiconductors (SSCs) based on metallic bi&#8208;layer shell arrays provides an opportunity to realize ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power consumption semiconductor devices. As an example, the achievement of near zero&#8208;threshold voltage in p&#8208;n junction diodes based on super&#8208;semiconducting nanostructured Ag/Al arrays is reported, realizing ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power p&#8208;n junction diodes: &#8776;3&#160;W per trillion diodes with a working voltage of 1&#160;V or 30&#160;mW per trillion diodes with an operating voltage of 0.1 V. In addition, the p&#8208;n junction diodes exhibit a high breakdown field of &#8776;1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;1, similar to that of SiC and GaN, due to a robust built&#8208;in field driven by infrared light photons. The SSC p&#8208;n diodes with near zero&#8208;threshold&#160;voltage and high breakdown field allow access to ultra&#8208;low&#8208;power semiconducting transistors, integrated circuits, chips, etc.

         <title>Voltage Modulated Untwist Deformations and Multispectral Optical Effects from Ion Intercalation into Chiral Ceramic Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Geometric reconfiguration of chiral ceramic nanostructures after ion intercalation should favor specific nanoscale twists that should lead to unusually strong chiroptical effects. Based on multifaceted experimental, simulation, and theoretical data, here we show that V2O3 nanoparticles have &#8220;built&#8208;in&#8221; chiral distortions caused by multipoint binding of enantiomers of tartaric acid to the surface of inorganic core. As evidenced by spectroscopy/microscopy techniques and calculations of nanoscale chirality measures, the intercalation of Zn2+ ions into the V2O3 lattice results in particle expansion, untwist deformations and related decrease of chirality. Coherent deformations in the particle ensemble manifest as changes in sign and positions of multiple circular polarization bands at ultraviolet, visible, mid&#8208;, near&#8208; (NIR) and infrared (IR) wavelengths originating in the electronic states of the surface ligands and the semiconductor cores. The g&#8208;factors observed for IR and NIR spectral diapasons are &#8764;100&#8208;400 times higher than those for previously reported dielectric, semiconductor and plasmonic nanoparticles. Nanocomposite films layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembled (LBL) from V2O3 nanoparticles reveal cyclic voltage&#8208;driven modulation of optical activity. Device prototypes for IR and NIR range problematic for liquid crystals and other organic materials, were demonstrated. High optical activity, synthetic simplicity, sustainable processability and environmental robustness of the chiral LBL nanocomposites provide a versatile platform for photonic devices. Similar reconfigurations of particle shapes are expected for multiple chiral ceramic nanostructures with a variety of optical, electrical, and magnetic properties.

         <title>Modular design of a polymer&#8208;bilayer&#8208;based mechanically compliant worm&#8208;like robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft earthwormlike robots that exhibit mechanical compliance can, in principle, navigate through uneven terrains and constricted spaces that are inaccessible to traditional legged and wheeled robots. However, unlike the biological originals which they mimic, most worm&#8208;like robots reported to date contain rigid components that limit their compliance, such as electromotors or pressure&#8208;driven actuation systems. Here we report a mechanically compliant worm&#8208;like robot with a fully modular body that is based on soft polymers. The robot is composed of strategically assembled, electrothermally activated polymer bilayer actuators, which are based on a semicrystalline polyurethane with an exceptionally large nonlinear thermal expansion coefficient. The segments were designed on the basis of a modified Timoshenko model, and finite element analysis simulation was used to describe their performance. Upon electrical activation of the segments with basic waveform patterns, the robot can move through repeatable peristaltic locomotion on exceptionally slippery or sticky surfaces and it can be oriented in any direction. The soft body enables the robot to wriggle through openings and tunnels that are much smaller than its cross&#8208;section.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft earthwormlike robots that exhibit mechanical compliance can, in principle, navigate through uneven terrains and constricted spaces that are inaccessible to traditional legged and wheeled robots. However, unlike the biological originals which they mimic, most worm-like robots reported to date contain rigid components that limit their compliance, such as electromotors or pressure-driven actuation systems. Here we report a mechanically compliant worm-like robot with a fully modular body that is based on soft polymers. The robot is composed of strategically assembled, electrothermally activated polymer bilayer actuators, which are based on a semicrystalline polyurethane with an exceptionally large nonlinear thermal expansion coefficient. The segments were designed on the basis of a modified Timoshenko model, and finite element analysis simulation was used to describe their performance. Upon electrical activation of the segments with basic waveform patterns, the robot can move through repeatable peristaltic locomotion on exceptionally slippery or sticky surfaces and it can be oriented in any direction. The soft body enables the robot to wriggle through openings and tunnels that are much smaller than its cross-section.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Functionalized Nanocomposite Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Strong Alkaline&#8208;Tolerance and High Zinc Anode Stability for Ultralong&#8208;Life Flexible Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries have attracted extensive interests, for which the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state gel polymer electrolytes (QSGPEs) are state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolytes. This study reports a sulfonate functionalized nanocomposite QSGPE with high ionic conductivity, strong alkaline tolerance, and high zinc anode stability, endowing an ultralong cycling life of 450&#160;h and high power output for the fabricated zinc&#8211;air battery.








Abstract
Increasing pursuit of next&#8208;generation wearable electronics has put forward the demand of reliable energy devices with high flexibility, durability, and enhanced electrochemical performances. Flexible aqueous zinc&#8211;air batteries (FAZABs) have attracted great interests owing to the high energy density, safety, and environmental benignity, for which quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state gel polymer electrolytes (QSGPEs) are state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolytes with high ionic conductivity, flexibility, and resistance to leakage problems of traditional liquid electrolytes. Compared to commonly used PVA&#8211;KOH electrolyte with poor electrolyte retention capability and cycling stability, a new type of sulfonate functionalized nanocomposite QSGPE is applied in FAZABs with high ionic conductivity, strong alkaline tolerance, and high zinc anode stability. Notably, the existence of (1) strong anionic sulfonate groups of QSGPEs, contributing to the exposure of preferred Zn (002) plane that is more resistant to zinc dendrite formation, and (2) nano&#8208;attapulgite electrolyte additives, beneficial for the enhancement of ionic conductivity, electrolyte uptake, and retention capability, endows a ultralong cycling life of 450&#160;h for the fabricated FAZAB. Furthermore, flexible energy belts and knittable energy wires fabricated with a series/parallel unit of several FAZABs can be used to power various wearable electronics.

         <title>Tension&#8208;Induced Cavitation in Li&#8208;Metal Stripping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cavitation&#8208;mediated Li stripping pathways controlled by the ratio of supporting solid structures (SSS) thickness to Li whisker radius are uncovered by in situ transmission electron microscope (TEM). For whiskers with t/r ratio smaller than a critical value, Li0 strips via multisite cavitation with severe buckling and Li0 &#8220;trapping&#8221;; for whiskers with t/r ratio being larger than the critical value, Li0 undergoes planar stripping and negligible SSS buckling.








Abstract
Designing stable Li metal and supporting solid structures (SSS) is of fundamental importance in rechargeable Li&#8208;metal batteries. Yet, the stripping kinetics of Li metal and its mechanical effect on the supporting solids (including solid electrolyte interface) remain mysterious to date. Here, through nanoscale in situ observations of a solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal battery in an electron microscope, two distinct cavitation&#8208;mediated Li stripping modes controlled by the ratio of the SSS thickness (t) to the Li deposit's radius (r) are discovered. A quantitative criterion is established to understand the damage tolerance of SSS on the Li&#8208;metal stripping pathways. For mechanically unstable SSS (t/r&#160;&lt; 0.21), the stripping proceeds via tension&#8208;induced multisite cavitation accompanied by severe SSS buckling and necking, ultimately leading to Li &#8220;trapping&#8221; or &#8220;dead Li&#8221; formation; for mechanically stable SSS (t/r&#160;&gt; 0.21), the Li metal undergoes nearly planar stripping from the root via single cavitation, showing negligible buckling. This work proves the existence of an electronically conductive precursor film coated on the interior of solid electrolytes that however can be mechanically damaged, and it is of potential importance to the design of delicate Li&#8208;metal supporting structures to high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Bioorthogonal Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of bioorthogonal catalysis is highly challenging owing to safety concerns of metal toxicity and low spatiotemporal regulation in vivo. Here, an intelligent Cu@PAA NCs&#160;catalyst is developed, the catalytic activity of which can be precisely regulated via valence state transformation between Cu(II) and Cu(I) under ultrasound irradiation, promoting off&#8208;target prodrug activation at lesion sites and generating ROS.








Abstract
Bioorthogonal chemistry, referring to the rapid and selective synthesis of imaging and/or therapeutic molecules in live animals via transition metal&#8208;mediated non&#8208;natural chemical transformation without disrupting endogenous reactions, has greatly expanded the tools and techniques for biomedicine. However, owing to safety concerns associated with metal toxicity, selectivity, sensitivity and stability, efficient bioorthogonal reactions that can be reliably executed in complex biological environments remain challenging. In this study, an intelligent, versatile bioorthogonal catalyst based on ultrasmall poly(acrylic acid)&#8208;modified copper nanocomplexes (Cu@PAA NCs) to achieve high spatiotemporal catalytic efficacy is established. The catalytic activity of the Cu@PAA NCs can be reversibly regulated via valence state interconversion between Cu(II) and Cu(I) under exogenous ultrasound irradiation, promoting off&#8208;target prodrug activation in lesion sites through the Cu(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition reaction. Moreover, ultrasound&#8208;triggered electron&#8211;hole separation endows the Cu@PAA NCs with robust sonosensitizing ability for sonodynamic therapy. Furthermore, the Cu@PAA NCs exhibit enhanced contrast in magnetic resonance and photoacoustic imaging. Notably, the renal&#8208;clearable Cu@PAA NCs exhibit intrinsically benign biocompatibility. This spatiotemporally ultrasound&#8208;mediated bioorthogonal catalysis not only expands the repertoire of in situ therapeutic agents but also provides a new avenue for disease theranostics.

         <title>Highly Sensitive and Cost&#8208;Effective Polymeric&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Based Mid&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Linear Polarizers with Tailored Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Resonance</title>

         <dc:description>
Inverse&#8208;vulcanized polymeric sulfur can replace expensive commercial semiconductors and chalcogenides for mid&#8208;wavelength infrared applications. Here, a highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective polymeric&#8208;sulfur&#8208;based bilayer wire&#8208;grid linear polarizer with a pitch of 400&#160;nm is successfully demonstrated by systematically investigated thermal nanoimprinting conditions and precisely changed spacer thickness to control Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonance.








Abstract
Inverse&#8208;vulcanized polymeric sulfur has received considerable attention for application in waste&#8208;based infrared (IR) polarizers with high polarization sensitivities, owing to its high transmittance in the IR region and thermal processability. However, there have been few reports on highly sensitive polymeric sulfur&#8208;based polarizers by replication of pre&#8208;simulated dimensions to achieve a high transmission of the transverse magnetic field (TTM) and extinction ratio (ER). Herein, a 400&#8208;nanometer&#8208;pitch mid&#8208;wavelength infrared bilayer linear polarizer with self&#8208;aligned metal gratings is introduced on polymeric sulfur gratings integrated with a spacer layer (SM&#8208;polarizer). The dimensions of the SM&#8208;polarizer can be closely replicated using pre&#8208;simulated dimensions via a systematic investigation of thermal nanoimprinting conditions. Spacer thickness is tailored from 40 to 5100&#160;nm by adjusting the concentration of polymeric sulfur solution during spin&#8208;coating. A tailored spacer thickness can maximize TTM in the broadband MWIR region by satisfying Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonance. The SM&#8208;polarizer yields TTM of 0.65, 0.59, and 0.43 and ER of 3.12 &#215; 103, 5.19 &#215; 103, and 5.81 &#215; 103 at 4&#160;&#181;m for spacer thicknesses of 90, 338, and 572&#160;nm, respectively. This demonstration of a highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective SM&#8208;polarizer opens up exciting avenues for infrared polarimetric imaging and for applications in polarization manipulation.

The SM-polarizer yields T&lt;sub&gt;TM&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.65, 0.59, and 0.43 and ER of 3.12 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 5.19 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and 5.81 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 4&#160;&#181;m for spacer thicknesses of 90, 338, and 572&#160;nm, respectively. This demonstration of a highly sensitive and cost-effective SM-polarizer opens up exciting avenues for infrared polarimetric imaging and for applications in polarization manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Architected Low&#8208;Tortuosity Electrodes with Tunable Porosity from Nonequilibrium Soft&#8208;Matter Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In energy storage devices, the microstructure of pores and materials is tied to performance. A material&#8208;agnostic process is reported to fabricate free&#8208;standing electrodes with adjustable thicknesses, featuring straight and accessible channels with homogenous diameters in the micrometer range, and tunable pore density. Through this scalable process, feature sizes can be tailored to inform and enable architectures for application&#8208;specific energy storage.








Abstract
Mass transport is performance&#8208;defining across energy storage devices, often causing limitations at high current rates. To optimize and balance the device&#8208;scale energy and power density for a given energy storage demand, tailored electrode architectures with precisely controllable phase dimensions are needed in combination with low&#8208;tortuosity channels that maximize the geometric component of diffusion and species flux. A material&#8208;agnostic nonequilibrium soft&#8208;matter process is reported to fabricate free&#8208;standing inorganic composite electrodes with adjustable thicknesses of 100s of&#160;&#181;m, featuring straight and accessible channels ranging in diameter from 5&#8211;30&#160;&#181;m, coupled with tunable material&#8208;to&#8208;pore ratios. Such architected anode and cathode electrodes exhibit electrochemical and architectural stability over extended cycling in a full&#8208;cell battery. Further, mass&#8208;transport constraints appear at high current densities, and the lithiation step is identified as rate&#8208;performance limiting, a result of insufficient lithium&#8208;ion supply and concentration polarization. The results demonstrate the need for and feasibility of tailored electrode architectures where dimensional ratios between low&#8208;tortuosity channels, the charge&#8208;storing matrix, and electrode thickness are tunable to meet coupled power and energy&#8208;storage requirements.

         <title>Entropy Stabilization Strategy for Enhancing the Local Structural Adaptability of Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with higher intralayer configuration entropy have more local structural diversity and higher distortion energy, resulting in superior local structural adaptability: no drastic redox couple evolution, major local structural adjustment, or obvious layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition. This leads to high stability of the capacity and voltage, greatly enhancing energy retention.








Abstract
Layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with high reversible energy densities are becoming prevalent. However, owing to the activation of low&#8208;potential redox couples and the progressively irreversible structural transformation caused by the local adjustment of transition&#8208;metal ions in the intra/interlayer driven by anionic redox, continuous capacity degradation, and voltage decay emerge, thus greatly reducing the energy density and increasing the difficulty of battery system management. Herein, layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with higher intralayer configuration entropy have more local structural diversity and higher distortion energy, resulting in superior local structural adaptability with no drastic redox couple evolution, major local structural adjustment, or obvious layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition. Consequently, the energy retention of the entropy&#8208;stabilization&#8208;strategy&#8208;enhanced Li&#8208;rich cathode materials is almost twice that of a typical Li&#8208;rich cathode material (Li1.20Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2, T&#8208;LRM) after 3 months of cyclic testing. Moreover, when cycled at 1&#160;C, the voltage degradation per cycle is less than 0.02%, that is, it results in a voltage loss of only 0.8&#160;mV per cycle, which is excellent performance. This study paves the way for the development of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with stabilized intralayer atomic arrangements and high local structural adaptability.

         <title>Rational Design of All&#8208;Inorganic Assemblies with Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly route to achieve circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with both high anisotropic factor and photoluminescence quantum yield is developed. The excellent CPL performance arises from the efficient generation of linearly polarized luminescence from the aligned quantum nanorods and then transformation to CPL by an inorganic nanowire&#8208;based quarter&#8208;wave plate.








Abstract
Materials with exceptional circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are important in multi&#8208;field applications such as 3D display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, spin electronics, etc. Although CPL properties have been widely investigated ranging from the traditional chiral organic molecules to the emerging chiral inorganic nanomaterials and their assemblies, a trade&#8208;off between the luminescence efficiency (quantum yield, &#981;) and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) is always the bottleneck for all the chiral luminescent materials, which hinders their practical application. Herein, a new route to overcome the paradox through rationally assembling quantum nanorods and ultrathin inorganic nanowires into ordered multilayer structures is reported, achieving both high &#981; and glum. In these assembled structures, the aligned quantum nanorods emit linearly polarized light that is then transformed to CPL by the aligned ultrathin nanowire assemblies with precisely controlled phase retardation. This method is universal and readily extended to versatile 1D nanomaterials, paving the way for the practical applications of CPL active materials.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Responsive Upconversion Nanoprobe with Simultaneously Enhanced Single&#8208;Band Red Luminescence and Phase/Size Control for Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) (1532 nm) light responsive upconversion nanoparticles with enhanced single&#8208;band red upconversion emission and controllable phase and size is designed by introducing Er3+ as sensitizer and utilizing Mn2+ as energy manipulator. Moreover, NIR&#8208;II light activated red upconversion bioimaging and photodynamic therapy are successfully achieved for the first time.








Abstract
Lanthanide based upconversion (UC) nanoprobes have emerged as promising agents for biological applications. Extending the excitation light to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II), instead of the traditional 980/808&#8201;nm light, and realizing NIR&#8208;II responsive single&#8208;band red UC emission is highly demanded for bioimaging application, which has not yet been explored. Here, a new type of NIR&#8208;II (1532&#160;nm) light responsive UC nanoparticles (UCNPs) with enhanced single&#8208;band red UC emission and controllable phase and size is designed by introducing Er3+ as sensitizer and utilizing Mn2+ as energy manipulator. Through tuning the content of Mn2+ in NaLnF4:Er/Mn, the crystal phase, size, and emitting color are readily controlled, and the red&#8208;to&#8208;green (R/G) ratio is significantly increased from &#8776;20 to &#8776;300, leading to NIR&#8208;II responsive single band red emission via efficient energy transfer between Er3+ and Mn2+. In addition, the single band red emitting intensity can be further improved by coating shell to avoid the surface quenching effect. More importantly, NIR&#8208;II light activated red UC bioimaging and photodynamic therapy through loading photosensitizer of zinc phthalocyanine are successfully achieved for the first time. These findings provide a new strategy of designing NIR&#8208;II light responsive single&#8208;band red emissive UCNPs for biomedical applications.

         <title>Metavalent Bonding Origins of Unusual Properties of Group IV Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metavalent bonding (MVB) is defined in the property space and its origin and distinction from resonant bonding and hyperconjugation are unclear. The essential electronic mechanisms of MVB are uncovered that involve bonding and antibonding pairwise interactions alternating along linear chains of at least five atoms, facilitating long&#8208;range electron transfer in response to polar fields that cause exotic properties.








Abstract
A distinct type of metavalent bonding (MVB) is recently proposed to explain an unusual combination of anomalous functional properties of group IV chalcogenide crystals, whose electronic mechanisms and origin remain controversial. Through theoretical analysis of evolution of bonding along continuous paths in structural and chemical composition space, emergence of MVB in rocksalt chalcogenides is demonstrated as a consequence of weakly broken symmetry of parent simple&#8208;cubic crystals of Group V metalloids. High electronic degeneracy at the nested Fermi surface of parent metal drives spontaneous breaking of its translational symmetry with structural and chemical fields, which open up a small energy gap and mediate strong coupling between conduction and valence bands making metavalent crystals highly polarizable, conductive, and sensitive to bond&#8208;lengths. Stronger symmetry&#8208;breaking structural and chemical fields, however, transform them discontinuously to covalent and ionic semiconducting states. MVB involves bonding&#8208;antibonding pairwise interactions alternating along linear chains of at least five atoms, which facilitate long&#8208;range electron transfer in response to polar fields causing unusual properties. The precise picture of MVB predicts anomalous second&#8208;order Raman scattering as an addition to set off their unusual properties, and will guide in design of new metavalent materials with improved thermoelectric, ferroelectric and nontrivial electronic topological properties.

         <title>Formation and Stabilization of NiOOH by Introducing &#945;&#8208;FeOOH in LDH: Composite Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution and Urea Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owning to the strong electron&#8208;capturing and hydrogen&#8208;absorption capability of &#945;&#8208;FeOOH, NiOOH can be easily formedand stabilized in LDH, which exhibits highly efficient OER and UOR performance. 








Abstract
NiOOH is considered as the most active intermediate during electrochemical oxidation reaction, however, it is hard to directly synthesize due to high oxidation energy. Herein, theoretical calculations predict that &#945;&#8208;FeOOH enables a decline in formation energy and an improvement in stabilization of NiOOH in NiFe&#8208;based layered double hydroxide (LDH). Inspiringly, a composite composed of &#945;&#8208;FeOOH and LDH is well&#8208;designed and successfully fabricated in hydrothermal treatment by adding extra Fe3+ resource, and stable NiOOH is obtained by the following electro&#8208;oxidation method. Benefiting from strong electron&#8208;capturing capability of &#945;&#8208;FeOOH, it efficiently promotes charge redistribution around the Ni/Fe sites and activates Ni atoms of LDH, verified by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) and X&#8208;ray absorption spectra (XAS). The d&#8208;band center is optimized that balances the absorption and desorption energy, and thus Gibbs free energy barrier is lowered dramatically toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR), and finally showing an outstanding overpotential of 195&#160;mV and a potential of 1.35&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. This study provides a novel strategy to construct highly efficient catalysts via the introduction of a new phase for complex multiple&#8208;electron reactions.

         <title>Large Harvested Energy by Self&#8208;Excited Liquid Suspension Triboelectric Nanogenerator with Optimized Charge Transportation Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;excited liquid suspension triboelectric nanogenerator based on solid&#8211;liquid triboelectrification effect, charge&#8211;liquid transmission, and dissipation effect for harvesting micro energy achieves the highest recorded charge density of non&#8208;contact mode TENG and 100% retention of the output for long&#8208;term operation cycles.








Abstract
To enhance the durability of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), liquid lubrication has been used to reduce mechanical abrasion. However, as the charge transportation behavior in dielectric liquid is not clearly understood, the output energy is still low although some improvements have been reported. Herein, the charge transportation behaviors in dielectric liquid by self&#8208;excited liquid suspension triboelectric nanogenerator (LS&#8208;TENG) are systematically investigated. The important role of solid&#8211;liquid triboelectrification effect, charge&#8211;liquid transmission and dissipation effect, and the homogeneous dielectric induction effect in promoting its output performance is found. The LS&#8208;TENG with a dual dielectric tribolayer has advantages of slight driving force and long lifetime for harvesting micro energy. The output of LS&#8208;TENG remains almost constant for more than 234 k operating cycles. A high charge density of 704 &#181;C m&#8722;2 is obtained, 2.7 times as much as that of the current highest record in non&#8208;contact TENG. Additionally, the rotary LS&#8208;TENG lights up 4200 LEDs and continuously powers a variety of wireless sensors by harvesting wind energy at low wind speed. This work provides an important insight toward the charge transportation mechanism in dielectric liquid, and a prospective strategy for achieving highly robust TENG in micro energy harvesting for practical applications.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoelectric Coupling in Atomically Thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3</title>

         <dc:description>
A space&#8208;confined CVD strategy is designed to synthesize atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3 single crystals and disclose the room&#8208;temperature ferrimagnetism. The strong ferroelectricity and its switching behavior are discovered in atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3, accompanied with an anomalous thickness&#8208;dependent coercive voltage. The robust room&#8208;temperature magnetoelectric coupling is uncovered by controlling the magnetism with electric field and verifies the multiferroic feature of &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3.








Abstract
2D multiferroics with magnetoelectric coupling combine the magnetic order and electric polarization in a single phase, providing a cornerstone for constructing high&#8208;density information storages and low&#8208;energy&#8208;consumption spintronic devices. The strong interactions between various order parameters are crucial for realizing such multifunctional applications, nevertheless, this criterion is rarely met in classical 2D materials at room&#8208;temperature. Here an ingenious space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition strategy is designed to synthesize atomically thin non&#8208;layered &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3 single crystals and disclose the room&#8208;temperature long&#8208;range ferrimagnetic order. Interestingly, the strong ferroelectricity and its switching behavior are unambiguously discovered in atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3, accompanied with an anomalous thickness&#8208;dependent coercive voltage. More significantly, the robust room&#8208;temperature magnetoelectric coupling is uncovered by controlling the magnetism with electric field and verifies the multiferroic feature of atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3. This work not only represents a substantial leap in terms of the controllable synthesis of 2D multiferroics with robust magnetoelectric coupling, but also provides a crucial step toward the practical applications in low&#8208;energy&#8208;consumption electric&#8208;writing/magnetic&#8208;reading devices.

         <title>Enhanced Selectivity in the Electroproduction of H2O2 via F/S Dual&#8208;Doping in Metal&#8208;Free Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;free nanofibers are engineered as large&#8208;scale electrocatalysts for H2O2 production. Optimized sample yields an onset potential of 0.814 V versus RHE and almost an ideal 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity of 99.1%. Theoretical computations and experiments demonstrate that the enhanced 2e&#8722; ORR performances stem from the intermolecular charge transfer coupled with electron spin redistribution effect contributed by the fluorine and sulfur dual&#8208;doping.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is attracting broad interest in diversified areas including paper manufacturing, wastewater treatment, production of liquid fuels, and public sanitation.

&lt;p&gt;Metal-free nanofibers are engineered as large-scale electrocatalysts for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.

         <title>BSA&#8208;AIE Nanoparticles with Boosted ROS Generation for Immunogenic Cell Death Immunotherapy of Multiple Myeloma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer (BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn) by loading AIE photosensitizers into BSA nanoparticles is developed for multiple myeloma immunotherapy. BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn&#160;could induce an effective ICD process, leading to&#160;dentric cell maturation, T cell activation, and tumor infiltration of T cells. Intriguingly, BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn has the potential to reverse T cell senescence, which plays vital roles in MM therapy.








Abstract
The main obstacle of multiple myeloma (MM) therapy is the compromised immune microenvironment, which leads to MM relapses and extramedullary disease progression. In this study, a novel strategy is reported of enhanced immunogenic cell death (ICD) immunotherapy with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer&#8208;loaded bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles (referred as BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn), which can activate T cells, convert the cold tumor to hot, and reverse T cell senescence to restore the immune microenvironment for MM treatment. Loading AIE photosensitizer into the hydrophobic domain of BSA proteins significantly immobilizes the molecular geometry, which massively increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and elicits a promising ICD immune response. Employing a NOD&#8208;SCID IL&#8208;2receptor gamma null mice model with MM patients&#8217; monocytes, it is shown that BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn can simulate human dentric cell maturation, activate functional T lymphocytes, and increase additional polarization and differentiation signals to deliver a promising immunotherapy performance. Intriguingly, for the first time, it is shown that BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn can greatly reverse T cell senescence, a main challenge in treating MM. Additionally, BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn can effectively recruit more functional T lymphocytes into MM tumor. As a consequence, BSA/TPA&#8208;Erdn restores MM immune microenvironment and shows the best MM tumor eradication performance, which shall pave new insights for MM treatment in clinical practices.

         <title>In Situ Endothelialization of Free&#8208;Form 3D Network of Interconnected Tubular Channels via Interfacial Coacervation by Aqueous&#8208;in&#8208;Aqueous Embedded Bioprinting</title>

         <dc:description>
Endothelialized liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid architectures are presented by a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) embedded bioprinting strategy. The interfacial coacervation of aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS) is exploited for maintaining liquid architectures and serving as filamentous scaffolds for cell growth. The free&#8208;form 3D networks of interconnected endothelium lumens suspended in liquids can be significant for generating functional tissues. 








Abstract
The challenge of bioprinting vascularized tissues is structure retention and in situ endothelialization. The issue is addressed by adopting an aqueous&#8208;in&#8208;aqueous 3D embedded bioprinting strategy, in which the interfacial coacervation of the cyto&#8208;mimic aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS) are employed for maintaining the suspending liquid architectures, and serving as filamentous scaffolds for cell attachment and growth. By incorporating endothelial cells in the ink phase of ATPS, tubular lumens enclosed by coacervated complexes of polylysine (PLL) and oxidized bacteria celluloses (oxBC) can be cellularized with a confluent endothelial layer, without any help of adhesive peptides. By applying PLL/oxBC ATPS for embedded bioprinting, free&#8208;form 3D vascular networks with in situ endothelialization of interconnected tubular lumens are achieved. This simple approach is a one&#8208;step process without any sacrificed templates and post&#8208;treatments. The resultant functional vessel networks with arbitrary complexity are suspended in liquid medium and can be conveniently handled, opening new routes for the in vitro production of thick vascularized tissues for pathological research, regeneration therapy and animal&#8208;free drug development.

Solution&#8208;processed high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type WSe2 thin&#8208;film transistor is successfully fabricated by Br2&#8208;doping with a field&#8208;effect hole mobility of more than 27&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, and a high on/off current ratio of &#8776;107. The resulting complementary inverters with patterned p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2 layered films reaches an ultra&#8208;high gain of 1280 under a driving voltage (VDD) of 7&#160;V.








Abstract
Semiconducting ink based on 2D single&#8208;crystal flakes with dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces enables the implementation of high&#8208;performance devices on form&#8208;free substrates by cost&#8208;effective and scalable printing processes. However, the lack of solution&#8208;processed p&#8208;type 2D semiconducting inks with high mobility is an obstacle to the development of complementary integrated circuits. Here, a versatile strategy of doping with Br2 is reported to enhance the hole mobility by orders of magnitude for p&#8208;type transistors with 2D layered materials. Br2&#8208;doped WSe2 transistors show a field&#8208;effect hole mobility of more than 27&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, and a high on/off current ratio of &#8776;107, and exhibits excellent operational stability during the on&#8208;off switching, cycling, and bias stressing testing. Moreover, complementary inverters composed of patterned p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2 layered films are demonstrated with an ultra&#8208;high gain of 1280 under a driving voltage (VDD) of 7&#160;V. This work unveils the high potential of solution&#8208;processed 2D semiconductors with low&#8208;temperature processability for flexible devices and monolithic circuitry.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Functional Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on the Comprehensive Integration and Synergetic Utilization of Triboelectrification, Electrostatic Induction, and Electrostatic Discharge to Achieve Alternating Current/Direct Current Convertible Outputs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the comprehensive integration and synergetic utilization of triboelectrification, electrostatic induction, and electrostatic discharge, a brand&#8208;new energy converter paradigm is achieved. The dual&#8208;functional triboelectric nanogenerator can produce an alternating current/direct current convertible output by adjusting the slider motion state, generating a remarkable constant output current and power density of 1.51 mA m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1 and 398 mW m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1, respectively.








Abstract
Traditional alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), which are implemented via the pairwise coupling of triboelectrification, electrostatic induction, and electrostatic discharge, have been widely explored in various fields. In this work, the comprehensive integration and synergetic utilization of triboelectrification, electrostatic induction, and electrostatic discharge in a single device for the first time is realized, achieving a dual&#8208;functional TENG (DF&#8208;TENG) to produce an AC/DC convertible output. Distinguishing from the conventional TENGs, the coupling of triboelectrification and electrostatic discharge enables charge circulation between the dielectric tribo&#8208;layers, while electrostatic induction realizes charge transfer in the external circuit. This novel energy conversion mechanism has been proven to be applicable to a variety of materials, including polymers, fabrics, and semiconductors. The output mode of the DF&#8208;TENG can be tuned by adjusting the slider motion state, and its constant output current and power density can reach 1.51 mA m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1 and 398 mW m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1, respectively, which are the highest records reported for constant DC&#8208;TENGs to date. This work not only provides a paradigm shift to achieve AC/DC convertible output, but it also exhibits high potential for extending the TENG design philosophy.

&lt;p&gt;Through the comprehensive integration and synergetic utilization of triboelectrification, electrostatic induction, and electrostatic discharge, a brand-new energy converter paradigm is achieved. The dual-functional triboelectric nanogenerator can produce an alternating current/direct current convertible output by adjusting the slider motion state, generating a remarkable constant output current and power density of 1.51 mA m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 398 mW m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; Hz&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.

         <title>Strong and Tough Supramolecular Covalent Adaptable Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular covalent adaptable networks (supra&#8208;CANs) with room&#8208;temperature closed&#8208;loop recyclability are constructed by introducing reversible noncovalent crosslinks into the dynamic covalent polymer networks, resulting in strong and stiff thermosets that also exhibit thermoplastic&#8208;like ductility and toughness, as well as reprocessability and rehealability. The mechanical properties of the supra&#8208;CANs are superior to those of strong and tough commodity polycarbonate.








Abstract
Development of closed&#8208;loop chemically recyclable plastics (CCRPs) that can be widely used in daily life can be a fundamental solution to the global plastic waste crisis. Hence, it is of great significance to develop easy&#8208;to&#8208;recycle CCRPs that possess superior or comparable material properties to the commodity plastics. Here, a novel dual crosslinked CCRP, namely, supramolecular covalent adaptable networks (supra&#8208;CANs), is reported, which not only displays mechanical properties higher than the strong and tough commodity polycarbonate, but also exhibits excellent solvent resistance as thermosets. The supra&#8208;CANs are constructed by introducing reversible noncovalent crosslinks into the dynamic covalent polymer networks, resulting in highly stiff and strong thermosets that also exhibit thermoplastic&#8208;like ductile and tough behaviors as well as reprocessability and rehealability. In great contrast, the analogs that do not have noncovalent crosslinks (CANs) show elastomeric properties with significantly decreased mechanical strength. Importantly, the developed supra&#8208;CANs and CANs can be converted back into the initial monomers in high yields and purity at room temperature, even with additives, which enables the sustainable polymer&#8208;monomer&#8208;polymer circulation. This work provides new design principles for high&#8208;performance chemically recyclable polymers as sustainable substitutes for the conventional plastics.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Amplified Enzyodynamic Tumor Therapy by Perovskite Nanoenzyme&#8208;Enabled Cell Pyroptosis and Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound&#8208;amplified enzyodynamic therapy has been developed to heighten the rate/degree of deleterious reactive oxygen species generation for inducing the pyroptosis of breast cancer cells, which is based on the advanced catalytic perovskite nanoenzyme.








Abstract
Overcoming apoptosis resistance to achieve efficient breast cancer treatment remains a challenge. The precise induction of another form of programmed cell death, pyroptosis, is an excellent alternative for treating cancer. Ultrasound (US)&#8208;enhanced enzyme dynamic (enzyodynamic) therapy is developed by employing LaFeO3 (LFO) perovskite nanocrystals as a substrate to increase the rate of deleterious reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for intensive cell pyroptosis. LFO nanocrystals possess quadruple enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities, including oxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, glutathione peroxidase&#8208;, and catalase&#8208;mimicking activities, which undertake the dominant therapeutic task through cascade catalytic reactions, including the reversal of hypoxic microenvironment, depletion of endogenous glutathione, and continuous output of ROS. US exogenous stimulation increases the transition rate of the intermediate complex to Fe (II) and favors incremental ROS production, by which the ROS burst&#8208;induced pyroptosis process is accomplished through the ROS&#8208;TXNIP&#8208;NLRP3&#8208;GSDMD pathway. Both in vitro and in vivo antineoplastic outcomes affirm the ascendancy of LFO nanozyme&#8208;induced pyroptosis. This work highlights the critical role of US coupled with nanocatalytic reactors in pyroptosis&#8208;dominant breast cancer treatment with the apoptosis resistance circumvention feature.

         <title>Ternary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Efficiency up to 18.14% Employing a Two&#8208;Step Sequential Deposition</title>

In this work, well&#8208;designed polymer acceptor materials for layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) processing are combined with a ternary strategy to improve the active layer morphology. The optimized LbL&#8208;type ternary system not only shows the best efficiency of 18.14% among the all&#8208;polymer solar cells but also exhibits insensitivity to the active layer thickness ranging from 82&#8211;180 nm.








Abstract
Achieving a finely tuned active layer morphology with a suitable vertical phase to facilitate both charge generation and charge transport has long been the main goal for pursuing the highly efficient bulk heterojunction all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Herein, a solution to address the above challenge via synergistically combining the ternary blend strategy and the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) procedure is proposed. By introducing a synthesized polymer acceptor (PA), PY&#8208;Cl, with higher crystallinity into the designed host acceptor PY&#8208;SSe&#8208;V, vertical phase distribution and molecular ordering of the LbL&#8208;type ternary all&#8208;PSCs can be improved in comparison to the LbL&#8208;type PM6/PY&#8208;SSe&#8208;V binary all&#8208;PSCs. The formation of the superior bulk microstructure can not only promote charge transport and extraction properties but also reduce energetic disorder and non&#8208;radiative recombination loss, thus improving all three photovoltaic parameters simultaneously. Consequently, the PM6/(PY&#8208;SSe&#8208;V:PY&#8208;Cl) ternary all&#8208;PSCs show the best efficiency of 18.14%, which is among the highest values reported to date for all&#8208;PSCs. This work provides a facile and effective LbL&#8208;type ternary strategy for obtaining high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Pushing the Limit of Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Deficit via Modifying Buried Interface in CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a multifunctional optimization strategy based on employing 3&#8208;sulphonatopropyl acrylate potassium salt to modify the buried interface of TiO2 and adjacent perovskite is demonstrated. Benefitting from the suppressed charge recombination loss and decreased energetic mismatch, the target CsPbI3&#8208;based device delivers an efficiency of 20.98% and a record&#8208;low VOC deficit of 0.451 V.








Abstract
Although CsPbI3 perovskites have shown tremendous potential in the photovoltaic field owing to their excellent thermal stability, the device performance is seriously restricted by severe photovoltage loss. The buried titanium oxide/perovskite interface plays a critical role in interfacial charge transport and perovskite crystallization, which is closely related to open&#8208;circuit voltage deficit stemming from nonradiative recombination. Herein, target molecules named 3&#8208;sulphonatopropyl acrylate potassium salts are deliberately employed with special functional groups for modifying the buried interface, giving rise to favorable functions in terms of passivating interfacial defects, optimizing energetic alignment, and facilitating perovskite crystallization. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the buried interface modification inhibits the electron transfer barrier and simultaneously improves perovskite crystal quality, thereby reducing trap&#8208;assisted charge recombination and interfacial energetic loss. Consequently, the omnibearing modification regarding the buried interface endows the devices with an impressive efficiency of 20.98%, achieving a record&#8208;low VOC deficit of 0.451&#160;V. The as&#8208;proposed buried interface modification strategy renders with a universal prescription to push the limit of VOC deficit, showing a promising future in developing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;inorganic perovskite photovoltaics.

Herein, target molecules named 3-sulphonatopropyl acrylate potassium salts are deliberately employed with special functional groups for modifying the buried interface, giving rise to favorable functions in terms of passivating interfacial defects, optimizing energetic alignment, and facilitating perovskite crystallization. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the buried interface modification inhibits the electron transfer barrier and simultaneously improves perovskite crystal quality, thereby reducing trap-assisted charge recombination and interfacial energetic loss. Consequently, the omnibearing modification regarding the buried interface endows the devices with an impressive efficiency of 20.98%, achieving a record-low &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; deficit of 0.451&#160;V. The as-proposed buried interface modification strategy renders with a universal prescription to push the limit of &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; deficit, showing a promising future in developing high-performance all-inorganic perovskite photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liesegang Phenomenon of Liquid Metals on Au Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomena and mechanisms for achieving Liesegang patterns of spatially recurrent crystallization through gallium (Ga)&#8208;based liquid metal clusters dabbed onto the gold (Au) film have been disclosed. During the reaction&#8208;diffusion&#8208;spreading process of Ga&#8208;based liquid metal clusters on Au film, the chemical reactions occur simultaneously, accompanied by the crystallization of intermediate phase products AuGa2 and AuIn2.








Abstract
Room temperature liquid metals (LM) such as gallium (Ga) own the potential to react with specific materials which would incubate new application categories. Here, diverse self&#8208;organized ring patterns due to nonequilibrium reaction&#8208;diffusion and spreading&#8208;limitation of Ga&#8208;based LM clusters on gold (Au) film are reported, among which diffusion is the controlling step and the self&#8208;limiting oxide layer plays the role of kinetic barrier. Such phenomena, classically known as the Liesegang rings, mainly occur in electrolyte media. Unlike existing systems, the present periodic crystallization mechanism enables highly symmetric spatiotemporal periodic Liesegang rings on a smaller scale under ambient conditions. Typically, the Ga&#8208;Au and eutectic gallium&#8208;indium alloy (EGaIn)&#8208;Au reaction&#8208;diffusion&#8208;spreading systems are constructed, obtaining the revert type and hybrid type concentric Liesegang patterns, respectively. The competitive patterning behavior of the intermediate phase products AuGa2 and AuIn2 in hybrid Liesegang patterns is further analyzed by altering the initial Ga/In mass ratio, first&#8208;principles calculations, and molecular dynamic simulations. When the mass ratio of In in GaIn alloy exceeds 15%, it will preferentially react with Au. The discovery of LM Liesegang phenomenon is expected to be a flashpoint for self&#8208;organized reaction&#8208;diffusion systems and offers promising rules for diverse areas such as materials synthesis and the jewelry design industry.

         <title>Scalable Alkaline Zinc&#8208;Iron/Nickel Hybrid Flow Battery with Energy Density up to 200&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining the electrochemical reactions and the redox&#8208;mediated chemical reaction, an alkaline zinc&#8208;iron/nickel hybrid flow battery with energy density up to 200&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1 and the upscaling of kW&#8208;scale stack with a high performance for 600&#160;h are demonstrated, which will inspire the development of next&#8208;generation cost&#8208;effective flow batteries based on novel redox chemistries for electrochemical energy storage applications.








Abstract
Achieving net&#8208;zero emissions requires low&#8208;cost and reliable energy storage devices that are essential to deploy renewables. Alkaline zinc&#8208;based flow batteries such as alkaline zinc&#8208;iron (or nickel) flow batteries are well suited for energy storage because of their high safety, high efficiency, and low cost. Nevertheless, their energy density is limited by the low solubility of ferro/ferricyanide and the limited areal capacity of sintered nickel electrodes. Here, combining the electrochemical reaction with the chemical reaction of ferro/ferricyanide couple in a homemade nickel electrode, an alkaline zinc&#8208;iron/nickel hybrid flow battery with a high energy density of 208.9&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1 and an energy efficiency of 84.7% at a high current density of 80&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is reported. The reversible chemical reactions between dual couples are proven to stabilize the nickel electrode by promoting the activation of the nickel electrode and further preventing the formation of &#947;&#8208;NiOOH. A kW&#8208;scale stack is demonstrated by the integration of ferro/ferricyanide couple with nickel electrode, delivering a coulombic efficiency of 98% and an energy efficiency of 89% at 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates a promising pathway for constructing and upscaling flow batteries with high energy density and low cost.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained Snapping Drives Autonomous Dancing and Motion in Free&#8208;Standing Wavy Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving self&#8208;sustained snapping and motion remains challenging in autonomous systems. Harnessing wavy ribbon rings for realizing self&#8208;sustained snapping in liquid&#8208;crystal elastomer rings under constant temperature and light are reported. It drives continuous flipping for either periodic self&#8208;dancing in place in symmetric rings or self&#8208;crawling in asymmetric rings on the ground and underwater, as well as self&#8208;escaping from confined spaces.








Abstract
Harnessing snapping, an instability phenomenon observed in nature (e.g., Venus flytraps), for autonomy has attracted growing interest in autonomous soft robots. However, achieving self&#8208;sustained snapping and snapping&#8208;driven autonomous motions in soft robots remains largely unexplored. Here, harnessing bistable, ribbon ring&#8208;like structures for realizing self&#8208;sustained snapping in a library of soft liquid&#8208;crystal elastomer wavy rings under constant thermal and photothermal actuation are reported. The self&#8208;sustained snapping induces continuous ring flipping that drives autonomous dancing or crawling motions on the ground and underwater. The 3D, free&#8208;standing wavy rings employ either a highly symmetric or symmetry&#8208;broken twisted shape with tunable geometric asymmetries. It is found that the former favors periodic self&#8208;dancing motion in place due to isotropic friction, while the latter shows a directional crawling motion along the predefined axis of symmetry during fabrication due to asymmetric friction. It shows that the crawling speed can be tuned by the geometric asymmetries with a peak speed achieved at the highest geometric asymmetry. Lastly, it is shown that the autonomous crawling ring can also adapt its body shape to pass through a confined space that is over 30% narrower than its body size.

         <dc:description>
By using a pH&#8208;flip based on a self&#8208;decarboxylating acid, transient control of a soft actuator is achieved. This method of control allows for tuning of actuation amplitude and duration, and can be coupled to further reactions for more complex self&#8208;regulation. Autonomous operation and unique &#8220;fire and forget&#8221; time&#8208;programmed applications are demonstrated.








Abstract
Hydrogel actuators are important for designing stimuli&#8208;sensitive soft robots. They generate mechanical motion by exploiting compartmentalized (de)swelling in response to a stimulus. However, classical switching methods, such as manually lowering or increasing the pH, cannot provide more complex autonomous motions. By coupling an autonomously operating pH&#8208;flip with programmable lifetimes to a hydrogel system containing pH&#8208;responsive and non&#8208;responsive compartments, autoonenomous forward and backward motion as well as more complex tasks, such as interlocking of &#8220;puzzle pieces&#8221; and collection of objects are realized. All operations are initiated by one simple trigger, and the devices operate in a &#8220;fire and forget&#8221; mode. More complex self&#8208;regulatory behavior is obtained by adding chemo&#8208;mechano&#8208;chemo feedback mechanisms. Due to its simplicity, this method shows great potential for the autonomous operation of soft grippers and metamaterials.

         <title>Dilute Alloying to Implant Activation Centers in Nitride Electrocatalysts for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dilute alloying implants &#8220;activating&#8221; centers in nitride alloy electrocatalysts to boost lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Dilute Co dopants activate the surrounding N and Ti atoms to construct multiatom active domains for efficient bidirectional catalysis of S redox reactions. The corresponding dilute nitride alloy improves the reaction kinetics and electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Dilute alloying is an effective strategy to tune properties of solid catalysts but is rarely leveraged in complex reactions beyond small molecule conversion. In this work, dilute dopants are demonstrated to serve as activating centers to construct multiatom catalytic domains in metal nitride electrocatalysts for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, of which the sulfur cathode suffers from sluggish and complex conversion reactions. With titanium nitride (TiN) as a model system, the dilute cobalt alloying is shown to greatly improve the reaction kinetics while inducing negligible catalyst reconstruction. Compared to the pristine TiN, the dilute nitride alloy catalyst enables onefold increase in the high rate (2.0 C) capacities of Li&#8211;S batteries, as well as an impressively low cyclic decay rate of 0.17% at a sulfur loading of 4.0 mgS cm&#8722;2. This work opens up new opportunities toward the rational design of Li&#8211;S electrocatalysts by dilute alloying and also enlightens the understandings of complex domain&#8208;catalyzed reactions in energy applications.

         <title>Delicate Co&#8208;Control of Shell Structure and Sulfur Vacancies in Interlayer&#8208;Expanded Tungsten Disulfide Hollow Sphere for Fast and Stable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) has been fruitful in addressing the bottlenecks of rechargeable batteries. Herein, delicate co&#8208;control over multiscale structures of HoMS is reported, specifically, sextuple&#8208;shelled WS2&#8722;x HoMS with abundant sulfur vacancies and expanded&#8208;interlayer spacing is developed. Benefiting from its plentiful sodium ion storage sites, prompted charge diffusion and improved structural stability, WS2&#8722;x HoMS exhibits an excellent sodium storage performance.








Abstract
Hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is a promising multi&#8208;functional platform for energy storage, owing to its unique temporal&#8208;spatial ordering property and buffering function. Accurate co&#8208;control of its multiscale structures may bring fascinating properties and new opportunities, which is highly desired yet rarely achieved due to the challenging synthesis. Herein, a sequential sulfidation and etching approach is developed to achieve the delicate co&#8208;control over both molecular&#8208; and nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;scale structure of WS2&#8722;x HoMS. Typically, sextuple&#8208;shelled WS2&#8722;x HoMS with abundant sulfur vacancies and expanded&#8208;interlayer spacing is obtained from triple&#8208;shelled WO3 HoMS. By further coating with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon, WS2&#8722;x HoMS maintains a reversible capacity of 241.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles for sodium storage, which is superior to the previously reported results. Mechanism analyses reveal that HoMS provides good electrode&#8211;electrolyte contact and plentiful sodium storage sites as well as an effective buffer of the stress/strain during cycling; sulfur vacancy and expanded interlayer of WS2&#8722;x enhance ion diffusion kinetics; carbon coating improves the electron conductivity and benefits the structural stability. This finding offers prospects for realizing practical fast&#8208;charging, high&#8208;energy, and long&#8208;cycling sodium storage.

         <title>Bidirectional Water&#8208;Stream Behavior on a Multifunctional Membrane for Simultaneous Energy Generation and Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy generation from environmental sources such as water is mainly focused on the power generation characteristics. However, the purification technology of environmental sources are also desired techniques for recent environmental and energy global issues. In this work, bifunctional (energy generation and water purification) membranes are successfully developed by controlling the water flow directions on the membranes (electricity generation and purification membrane).








Abstract
Hydroelectric nanogenerators have been previously proposed to recycle various water resources and polluted water. However, as conventional hydroelectric nanogenerators only utilize water resources, they cannot provide a fundamental solution for water recycling. In this study, a water purification membrane is proposed that can simultaneously generate electricity during the purification process (electricity generation and purification membrane (EPM)) for water recycling. As polluted water passes through the EPM, the water is purified in the perpendicular direction, while electricity is simultaneously produced in the horizontal direction by the movement of ions. Notably, the EPM exhibits high energy generation performance (maximum power 16.44&#160;&#181;W and energy 15.16&#160;mJ) by the streaming effect of water&#8208;streaming carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Moreover, by using a poly(acrylic acid)/carboxymethyl cellulose (PAA/CMC) binder to EPM, the energy&#8208;generation performance and long&#8208;term stability are substantially improved and outstanding mechanical stability is provided, regardless of the acidity of the water source (pH 1&#8211;10). More importantly, the EPM exhibits the water purification characteristics of &gt;90% rejection of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm pollutants and potentiality of &#229;ngstrom level cation rejection, with simultaneous and continuous energy generation. Overall, this study proposes an efficient EPM model, which can be potentially used as a next&#8208;generation renewable energy generation approach, thus laying the foundation for effective utilization of polluted water resources.

         <title>Dual Immunostimulatory Pathway Agonism through a Synthetic Nanocarrier Triggers Robust Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity in Murine Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here immune stimulants delivered via this new platform called cyclodextrin&#8208;adjuvant nanoparticle dual immunotherapy (CANDI) are shown to effectively target myeloid cells in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) mouse models, and reverse immune suppression. This immunotherapy turns the &#8220;cold&#8221; GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) into a &#8220;hot&#8221; T cell inflamed TME, and leads to significant survival benefits in GBM.








Abstract
Myeloid cells are abundant, create a highly immunosuppressive environment in glioblastoma (GBM), and thus contribute to poor immunotherapy responses. Based on the hypothesis that small molecules can be used to stimulate myeloid cells to elicit anti&#8208;tumor effector functions, a synthetic nanoparticle approach is developed to deliver dual NF&#8208;kB pathway&#8208;inducing agents into these cells via systemic administration. Synthetic, cyclodextrin&#8208;adjuvant nanoconstructs (CANDI) with high affinity for tumor&#8208;associated myeloid cells are dually loaded with a TLR7 and 8 (Toll&#8208;like receptor, 7 and 8) agonist (R848) and a cIAP (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein) inhibitor (LCL&#8208;161) to dually activate these myeloid cells. Here CANDI is shown to: i) readily enter the GBM tumor microenvironment (TME) and accumulate at high concentrations, ii) is taken up by tumor&#8208;associated myeloid cells, iii) potently synergize payloads compared to monotherapy, iv) activate myeloid cells, v) fosters a &#8220;hot&#8221; TME with high levels of T effector cells, and vi) controls the growth of murine GBM as mono&#8208; and combination therapies with anti&#8208;PD1. Multi&#8208;pathway targeted myeloid stimulation via the CANDI platform can efficiently drive anti&#8208;tumor immunity in GBM.

         <dc:description>
A dibetaine zinc(II) complex with additional weakly coordinating acetonitrile ligands proves to be an excellent electrolyte for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;based rechargeable batteries and ion capacitors.

Growth of dendrites, limited coulombic efficiency (CE), and the lack of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes restrict the commercialization of zinc batteries and capacitors. These issues are resolved by a new electrolyte, based on the zinc(II)&#8211;betaine complex [Zn(bet)2][NTf2]2. Solutions in acetonitrile (AN) avoid dendrite formation. A Zn||Zn cell operates stably over 10 110 h (5055 cycles) at 0.2 mA cm&#8722;2 or 110 h at 50 mA cm&#8722;2, and has an area capacity of 113 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 80% depth of discharge. A zinc&#8211;graphite battery performs at 2.6 V with a midpoint discharge&#8208;voltage of 2.4 V. The capacity&#8208;retention at 3 A g&#8722;1 (150 C) is 97% after 1000 cycles and 68% after 10&#160;000 cycles. The charge/discharge time is about 24 s at 3.0 A g&#8722;1 with an energy density of 49 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 6864 W kg&#8722;1 based on the cathode. A zinc||activated&#8208;carbon ion&#8208;capacitor (coin cell) exhibits an operating&#8208;voltage window of 2.5 V, an energy density of 96 Wh kg&#8722;1 with a power density of 610 W kg&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. At 12 A g&#8722;1, 36 Wh kg&#8722;1, and 13&#160;600 W kg&#8722;1 are achieved with 90% capacity&#8208;retention and an average CE of 96% over 10&#160;000 cycles. Quantum&#8208;chemical methods and vibrational spectroscopy reveal [Zn(bet)2(AN)2]2+ as the dominant complex in the electrolyte.

         <title>Multiple Fusion Strategy for High&#8208;Performance Yellow OLEDs with Full Width at Half Maximums Down to 23&#160;nm and External Quantum Efficiencies up to 37.4%</title>

         <dc:description>
Toward the goal of ideal narrowband yellow emission, a novel &#8220;multi&#8208;fusion&#8221; design strategy is proposed to break the trade&#8208;off between spectral redshift and broadening. The corresponding electroluminescent device exhibits leading performance in yellow multi&#8208;resonance (MR) devices, with peak efficiencies of 37.4%, 136.6 cd A&#8722;1, and 119.2 lm W&#8722;1 and FWHM of only 23 nm.








Abstract
The pursuit of ideal narrowband yellow multiple resonance (MR) emitters is hampered by the mutual constraints of effective spectral redshift and maintaining a small full width at half maximum (FWHM) value. Here, a novel multiple fusion molecular design strategy is reported to break this trade&#8208;off. Compared with the selected narrowband parent core, the specific multiple MR effects in target molecules can simultaneously extend the &#960;&#8208;conjugation length, increase the rigidity of the structure, and reduce the vibrational frequency. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept emitters BN&#8208;DICz and DBN&#8208;ICz show bright yellowish green to yellow emissions in dilute toluene solutions with peaks at 533&#8211;542&#160;nm and extremely small FWHMs of &#8804;20&#160;nm. Notably, BN&#8208;DICz&#8208;based electroluminescent device exhibits excellent efficiencies of 37.4%, 136.6&#160;cd A&#8722;1, and 119.2&#160;lm W&#8722;1 with an FWHM of merely 23&#160;nm, representing the best performance for yellow MR organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.

         <title>Tailoring Optical Properties in Transparent Highly Conducting Perovskites by Cationic Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfect transparent conductor in the visible range will display 100% transmission in the corresponding wavelength range (black dotted curve). What the engineered advanced conducting perovskite SrV1&#8722;xMoxO3 can do, is indicated by the red dotted curve. Pairing this with the ultrahigh conductivity of this material gives a novel key contender for transparent electronics and plasmonics.








Abstract
SrMoO3 , SrNbO3, and SrVO3 are remarkable highly conducting d1 (V, Nb) or d2 (Mo) perovskite metals with an intrinsically high transparency in the visible. A key scientific question is how the optical properties of these materials can be manipulated to make them suitable for applications as transparent electrodes and in plasmonics. Here, it is shown how 3d/4d cationic substitution in perovskites tailors the relevant materials parameters, i.e., optical transition energy and plasma frequency. With the example of the solid&#8208;state solution SrV1&#8722;xMoxO3, it is shown that the absorption and reflection edges can be shifted to the edges of the visible light spectrum, resulting in a material that has the potential to outperform indium tin oxide (ITO) due to its extremely low sheet resistance. An optimum for x&#160;= 0.5, where a resistivity of 32&#160;&#181;&#937; cm (&#8776;12&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1) is paired with a transmittance above 84% in the whole visible spectrum is found. Quantitative comparison between experiments and electronic structure calculations show that the shift of the plasma frequency is governed by the interplay of d&#8208;band filling and electronic correlations. This study advances the knowledge about the peculiar class of highly conducting perovskites toward sustainable transparent conductors and emergent plasmonics.

         <title>Super&#8208;Assembled Multi&#8208;Level Asymmetric Mesochannels for Coupled Accelerated Dual&#8208;Ion Selective Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a multi&#8208;level asymmetric mesoporous carbon/AAO/mesoporous silica (MC/AAO/MS) with dual&#8208;ion selective layers is constructed by super&#8208;assembly strategy. The special structure endows it with gating, storing and releasing performance. Importantly, the couple of MC and MS in MC/AAO/MS nanochannels endow it with enhanced cation selectivity and osmotic energy conversion performance.








Abstract
Asymmetric nanofluidic devices hold great potential in energy conversion applications. However, most of the existing asymmetric nanofluidic devices remain a single&#8208;level asymmetric structure and a single&#8208;ion selective layer, which results in weak ion selectivity and limited energy conversion efficiency. Herein, a multi&#8208;level asymmetric mesoporous carbon/anodized aluminum/mesoporous silica (MC/AAO/MS) nanofluidic device with abundant and ordered mesochannels is constructed from super&#8208;assembly strategy. The resultant MC/AAO/MS exhibits diode&#8208;like ion transport and outstanding ion storage&#8208;release performance. Importantly, MC/AAO/MS couples the MC and MS dual&#8208;ion selective layers, which ensures a high ionic conductance and evidently enhances the cation selectivity. Thereby, the MC/AAO/MS demonstrates ascendant salinity gradient energy conversion performance. The power density and conversion efficiency can reach up to 5.37&#160;W m&#8722;2 and 32.79%, respectively. Noteworthy, a good energy conversion performance of 63&#160;mW m&#8722;2 can still be achieved upon high working area, outperforming 300% of the performance of MC/AAO and MS/AAO single&#8208;level asymmetric nanochannels. Theoretical calculation further verifies that the multi&#8208;level asymmetric structure and dual&#8208;ion selective transport are the reason for the enhanced cation selectivity and energy conversion efficiency. This work opens a new avenue for constructing multi&#8208;level asymmetric structured nanofluidic devices for various applications.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Synthetic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired strategy is developed for the synthesis of robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). These HOFs not only exhibit high stability in strong acids or bases but also have a high proton conductivity due to the presence of charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonds. This study demonstrates that the precise structure of proton conductors is of great importance in the understanding of structure&#8208;performance correlations.








Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a rising class of promising proton&#8208;conducting materials. However, they always suffer from the inherent contradiction between chemical stability and proton conduction. Herein, inspired by the self&#8208;assembly of lipid bilayer membranes, a series of aminomethylphosphonic acid&#8208;derived single&#8208;component HOFs are successfully developed with different substituents attached to the phosphonate oxygen group. They remain highly stable in strong acid or alkaline water solutions for one month owing to the presence of charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, in the absence of external proton carriers, the methyl&#8208;substituted phosphonate&#8208;based HOF exhibits a very high proton conductivity of up to 4.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 under 80&#160;&#176;C and 98% relative humidity. This value is not only comparable to that of HOFs consisting of mixed ligands but also is the highest reported in single&#8208;component HOFs. A combination of single&#8208;crystal structure analysis and density functional theory calculations reveals that the high conductivity is attributed to the strengthened H&#8208;bonding interactions between positively charged amines and negatively charged phosphonate groups in the channel of bio&#8208;inspired HOFs. This finding demonstrates that the well&#8208;defined molecular structure of proton conductors is of great importance in the precise understanding of the relationship between structure and property.

         <title>Wearable Triboelectric Visual Sensors for Tactile Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a self&#8208;powered wearable visual tactile sensor is developed, which realized the portability of wearable devices. The tactile information is readily converted into visible light signals (9.8&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2) owing to the high&#8208;power density (2.1 W m&#8722;2) of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), which is 4.4&#160;times higher than the output performance of the vertical contact&#8208;separation type TENG.








Abstract
Tactile sensors with visible light feedback functions, such as wearable displays and electronic skin and biomedical devices, are becoming increasingly important in various fields. However, existing methods cannot meet the application requirements for the tactile perception of intensity feedback and extended intersection due to their limited light&#8208;mapping performance and insufficient portability. Herein, a freely constructible self&#8208;powered visual tactile sensor is proposed, which consists of a high&#8208;output triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and a visual light source. The transferred charge of the TENG is enhanced to 746 nC by the structural design of the triboelectric material and device, which can easily drive the light source to generate a light signal with a brightness of 9.8 cd m&#8722;2. Notably, the application of the TENG enables to realization visual sensing of the palm&#8208;grasp state and strength feedback without an external power supply. This visual feedback and power&#8208;free tactile sensors are expected to have potential application in the field of artificial intelligence as a new interactive medium for smart protective clothing and robotics.

         <title>A Continuous Gradient Colloidal Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled extraction emulsion process (CrEEP) allows the synthesis of monodisperse latex particles with a continuous size gradient. Subsequent self&#8208;assembly into a photonic glass results in a thin film with a continuous photonic gradient and structural colors ranging over the full visible spectrum. This concept is shown to improve the broadband reflectance of such a mesostructure compared to a non&#8208;gradient&#160;mixture.








Abstract
Colloidal crystals and glasses manipulate light propagation depending on their chemical composition, particle morphology, and mesoscopic structure. This light&#8211;matter interaction has been intensely investigated, but a knowledge gap remains for mesostructures comprising a continuous property gradient of the constituting particles. Here, a general synthetic approach to bottom&#8208;up fabrication of continuous size gradient colloidal ensembles is introduced. First, the technique synthesizes a dispersion with a specifically designed gradual particle size distribution. Second, self&#8208;assembly of this dispersion yields a photonic colloidal glass with a continuous size gradient from top to bottom. Local and bulk characterization methods are used to highlight the significant potential of this mesostructure, resulting in vivid structural colors along, and in superior light scattering across the gradient. The process describes a general pathway to mesoscopic gradients. It can expectedly be transferred to a variety of other particle&#8208;based systems where continuous gradients will provide novel physical insights and&#160;functionalities.

         <title>A Versatile and Low&#8208;Cost Polymer Donor Based on 4&#8208;Chlorothiazole for Highly Efficient Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile and low&#8208;cost 4&#8208;chlorothiazole&#8208;based polymer donor PBTTz3Cl is designed and synthesized. PBTTz3Cl not only exhibits excellent photovoltaic performances with various small molecule acceptors (e.g., BTP&#8208;Ec9 and L8&#8208;BO), but also possesses a decent power conversion efficiency of 19.12% in ternary devices when blended with BTP&#8208;Ec9:L8&#8208;BO mixture.








Abstract
Benefiting from the emergence of narrow&#8208;band&#8208;gap small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs), especially &#8220;Y&#8221; series, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer solar cells (PSCs) is rapidly improved. However, polymer donors with high efficiency, easy synthesis, and good universality are relatively scarce except PBDB&#8208;TF and D18. Herein, two polymer donors are designed and synthesized based on 4&#8208;chlorothiazole derivatives with simple structures, namely PTz3Cl and PBTTz3Cl. The OSCs based on PBTTz3Cl with slightly weaker intermolecular forces in comparison to PTz3Cl exhibits a decent PCE of 18.38% in blending with SMA L8&#8208;BO, owing to its strong donor/acceptor interaction with L8&#8208;BO, which shapes suitable phase separation morphology. Further research finds that PBTTz3Cl can exhibit excellent photovoltaic performances with various SMA materials, highlighting its universality. Based on this, ternary PSCs are designed where BTP&#8208;eC9 is introduced as a guest into the PBTTz3Cl:L8&#8208;BO host system. Thanks to further optimal blend morphology and more balanced charge transport, the PCE is improved up to 19.12%, which is among the highest values for PSCs. This work provides a new design of low&#8208;cost electron&#8208;deficient units for constructing highly versatile, high&#8208;performance polymer donors.

         <title>Photonic Crystal&#8208;Integrated Optoelectronic Devices with Naked&#8208;Eye Visualization and Digital Readout for High&#8208;Resolution Detection of Ultratrace Analytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photonic crystal&#8208;based optoelectronic device is developed for rapid and real&#8208;time digital monitoring of ultratrace analytes with detection limits down to 5&#160;&#181;L, which is highly desirable for the non&#8208;invasive monitoring of human diseases, such as the quick identification of diabetes from ultratrace glucose in sweat.








Abstract
The detection of ultratrace analytes is highly desirable for the non&#8208;invasive monitoring of human diseases. However, a major challenge is fast, naked&#8208;eye, high&#8208;resolution ultratrace detection. Herein, a rectangular 3D composite photonic crystal (PC)&#8208;based optoelectronic device is first designed that combines the sensitivity&#8208;enhancing effects of PCs and optoelectronic devices with fast and real&#8208;time digital monitoring. A crack&#8208;free, centimeter&#8208;scale, mechanically robust ellipsoidal composite PCs with sufficient hardness and modulus, even exceeding most plastics and aluminum alloys, are developed. The high mechanical strength of ellipsoidal composite PCs allows them to be hand&#8208;machined into rectangular geometries that can be conformally covered with the centimeter&#8208;scale flat light&#8208;detection area without interference from ambient light, easily integrating 3D composite PC&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. The PC&#8208;based device's signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio increases dramatically from original 30&#8211;40 to &#8776;60&#8211;70&#160;dB. Droplets of ultratrace analytes on the device are identified by fast digital readout within seconds, with detection limits down to 5&#160;&#181;L, enabling rapid identification of ultratrace glucose in artificial sweat and diabetes risk. The developed 3D PC&#8208;based sensor offers the advantages of small size, low cost, and high reliability, paving the way for wider implementation in other portable optoelectronic devices.

     alt="Photonic Crystal-Integrated Optoelectronic Devices with Naked-Eye Visualization and Digital Readout for High-Resolution Detection of Ultratrace Analytes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A photonic crystal-based optoelectronic device is developed for rapid and real-time digital monitoring of ultratrace analytes with detection limits down to 5&#160;&#181;L, which is highly desirable for the non-invasive monitoring of human diseases, such as the quick identification of diabetes from ultratrace glucose in sweat.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detection of ultratrace analytes is highly desirable for the non-invasive monitoring of human diseases. However, a major challenge is fast, naked-eye, high-resolution ultratrace detection. Herein, a rectangular 3D composite photonic crystal (PC)-based optoelectronic device is first designed that combines the sensitivity-enhancing effects of PCs and optoelectronic devices with fast and real-time digital monitoring. A crack-free, centimeter-scale, mechanically robust ellipsoidal composite PCs with sufficient hardness and modulus, even exceeding most plastics and aluminum alloys, are developed. The high mechanical strength of ellipsoidal composite PCs allows them to be hand-machined into rectangular geometries that can be conformally covered with the centimeter-scale flat light-detection area without interference from ambient light, easily integrating 3D composite PC-based optoelectronic devices. The PC-based device's signal-to-noise ratio increases dramatically from original 30&#8211;40 to &#8776;60&#8211;70&#160;dB. Droplets of ultratrace analytes on the device are identified by fast digital readout within seconds, with detection limits down to 5&#160;&#181;L, enabling rapid identification of ultratrace glucose in artificial sweat and diabetes risk. The developed 3D PC-based sensor offers the advantages of small size, low cost, and high reliability, paving the way for wider implementation in other portable optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Matching Bidentate Ligand Anchoring: an Accurate Control Strategy for Stable Single&#8208;Atom/ZIF Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;loading MN4 SACs (&gt;10 wt.%) with tunable coordination environments are designed using the matching bidentate ligand (MBL) anchoring strategy. The obtained Cu SA/ZIF nanocomposites exhibit superior performance in homo&#8208;coupling of phenyl acetylene under light irradiation (TON = 580, selectivity &gt; 99%), which is 22 times higher than that of Cu SA/NC&#8208;800. Experiments and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the specific Cu five&#8208;membered ring formed using the MBL strategy is the key to the immobilization of isolated Cu atoms.








Abstract
Improving metal loading and controlling the coordination environment is nontrivial and challenging for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which have the greatest atomic efficiency and largest number of interface sites. In this study, a matching bidentate ligand (MBL) anchoring strategy is designed for the construction of CuN4 SACs with tunable coordination environments (Cu loading range from 0.4 to15.4 wt.%). The obtained Cu SA/ZIF and Cu SA/ZIF*&#65279;&#65279; (0.4 wt.%) (ZIF and ZIF*&#160;= Zeolitic imidazolate framework with Matching bidentate N&#8208;ligands) nanocomposites exhibit superior performance in homo&#8208;coupling of phenyl acetylene under light irradiation (TON = 580, selectivity &gt; 99%), which is 22 times higher than that of Cu SA/NC&#8208;800 (NC = N&#8208;doped porous carbon). Experiments and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the specific Cu five&#8208;membered ring formed using the MBL anchoring strategy is the key to the immobilization of isolated Cu atoms. This strategy provides a basis for the construction of M SA/MOF, which has the potential to narrow the gap between experimental and theoretical catalysis, as further confirmed by the successful preparation of Fe SA/ZIF and Ni SA/ZIF.

         <dc:description>
A versatile platform that enables self&#8208;powered programming of fibroblasts into neurons via a scalable magnetoelastic generator array is developed. The generated electrical stimulation enhances&#160;the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons up to 2&#8208;fold (104%) and subsequent neuronal maturation up to 3&#8208;fold (251%). This easily configurable electrical stimulation device can harness the biomechanical activities in human bodies and convert them into electrical signals, thereby potentially providing a general therapeutic approach for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Developing scalable electrical stimulating platforms for cell and tissue engineering applications is limited by external power source dependency, wetting resistance, microscale size requirements, and suitable flexibility. Here, a versatile and scalable platform is developed to enable tunable electrical stimulation for biological applications by harnessing the giant magnetoelastic effect in soft systems, converting gentle air pressure (100&#8211;400&#160;kPa) to yield a current of up to 10.5&#160;mA and a voltage of 9.5&#160;mV. The platform can be easily manufactured and scaled up for integration in multiwell magnetoelastic plates via 3D printing. The authors demonstrate that the electrical stimulation generated by this platform enhances the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons up to 2&#8208;fold (104%) and subsequent neuronal maturation up to 3&#8208;fold (251%). This easily configurable electrical stimulation device has broad applications in high throughput organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems, and paves the way for future development of neural engineering, including cellular therapy via implantable self&#8208;powered electrical stimulation devices.

         <title>Engineering Co&#63743;P Alloy Foil to a Well&#8208;Designed Integrated Electrode Toward High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple neutral salt solution&#8208;mediated electrochemical dealloying strategy is developed to address existing drawbacks of binder&#8208;free nanostructured integrated electrodes toward electrochemical energy storage. Accordingly, a Co&#63743;P alloy&#8208;derived Co(OH)x/Co2P mesoporous electrode not only loads over 3.0&#160;g cm&#8722;3 of active materials, but also exhibits excellent electron&#8208;ion mixed conductivity and high mechanical stability, making it a promising candidate for practical applications.








Abstract
Nanostructured integrated electrodes with binder&#8208;free design show great potential to solve the ever&#8208;growing problems faced by currently commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries such as insufficient power and energy densities. However, there are still many challenging problems limiting practical application of this emerging technology, in particular complex manufacturing process, high fabrication cost, and low loading mass of active material. Different from existing fabrication strategies, here using a Co&#63743;P alloy foil as a precursor&#160; a simple neutral salt solution&#8208;mediated electrochemical dealloying method to well address the above issues is demonstrated. The resultant freestanding mesoporous np&#8208;Co(OH)x/Co2P product possesses not only active compositions of high specific capacity and large electrode packing density (&gt;3.0&#160;g cm&#8722;3) to meet practical capacity requirements, high&#8208;conductivity and well&#8208;developed nanoporous framework to achieve simultaneously fast ion and electron transfer, but also interconnected ligaments and suitable free space to ensure strong structural stability. Its comprehensively excellent electrochemical energy storage (EES) performances in both lithium/sodium&#8208;ion batteries and lithium&#8208;ion capacitors can further illustrate the effectiveness of the integrated electrode preparation strategy, such as remarkable reversible specific capacities/capacitances, dominated pseudo&#8208;capacitive EES mechanism, and ultra&#8208;long cycling life. This study provides new insights into preparation and design of high&#8208;performance integrated electrodes for practical applications.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling Suppression by Enhanced Lattice Rigidity in 2D Perovskite Single Crystals for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D perovskite single crystal is designed by introducing a diamine molecule DGA into the lead&#8208;iodine octahedron. Compared with the monoamine o&#8208;F&#8208;PEA, the DGA strongly interacts with the [PbI6]4&#8208;, improving the lattice stiffness, reducing electron&#8208;phonon coupling and lattice distortion, and making the corresponding device to achieve high carrier mobility (78.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and high X&#8208;ray sensitivity (4869.0 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
2D Dion&#8722;Jacobson (DJ) perovskite single crystals (PSCs) usually demonstrate better X&#8208;ray detection performance than Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) PSCs. However, the mechanism of the improved performance is still elusive. Here, by the aid of strong interactions between dimethylbiguanide (DGA) and PbI2, a novel DJ&#8208;perovskitoid (DGA)PbI4 is designed. From the comparison of (DGA)PbI4 to other 2D PSCs, it is discovered that the tiniest lattice distortion and increased hydrogen bonds in the atom&#8208;scaled analysis strengthen lattice rigidity and weaken electron&#8208;phonon coupling to suppress disordered scattering of carriers, resulting in significantly improved carrier transport and stability. Therefore, high carrier mobility (78.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and a pronounced sensitivity of 4869.0 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 are achieved using (DGA)PbI4, which are the best in 2D Pb&#8208;based PSC devices to date. Finally, the (DGA)PbI4 devices exhibit good spatial resolution in X&#8208;ray imaging and excellent long&#8208;term stability to work as a promising candidate for medical diagnostics and nondestructive determination.

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D Dion&#8722;Jacobson (DJ) perovskite single crystals (PSCs) usually demonstrate better X-ray detection performance than Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) PSCs. However, the mechanism of the improved performance is still elusive. Here, by the aid of strong interactions between dimethylbiguanide (DGA) and PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a novel DJ-perovskitoid (DGA)PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is designed. From the comparison of (DGA)PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to other 2D PSCs, it is discovered that the tiniest lattice distortion and increased hydrogen bonds in the atom-scaled analysis strengthen lattice rigidity and weaken electron-phonon coupling to suppress disordered scattering of carriers, resulting in significantly improved carrier transport and stability. Therefore, high carrier mobility (78.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and a pronounced sensitivity of 4869.0 &#181;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved using (DGA)PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which are the best in 2D Pb-based PSC devices to date. Finally, the (DGA)PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; devices exhibit good spatial resolution in X-ray imaging and excellent long-term stability to work as a promising candidate for medical diagnostics and nondestructive determination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An in situ cathode&#8208;interweaving strategy based on metalloporphyrin organic polymer (M&#8208;COP, M = Mn, Ni, and Zn) binders is proposed and excellent performance is achieved in Li&#8211;S battery.








Abstract
The elaborate design of powerful Li&#8211;S binders with extended&#8208;functions like polysulfides adsorption/catalysis and Li+ hopping/transferring in addition to robust adhesion&#8208;property has remained a challenge. Here, an in situ cathode&#8208;interweaving strategy based on metalloporphyrin based covalent&#8208;bonding organic polymer (M&#8208;COP, M = Mn, Ni, and Zn) binders is reported for the first time. Thus&#8208;produced functional binders possess excellent mechanical&#8208;strengths, polysulfides adsorption/catalysis, and Li+ hopping/transferring ability. Specifically, the modulus of Mn&#8208;COP can reach up to &#8776;54.60&#160;GPa (&#8776;40 times higher than poly(vinylidene fluoride)) and the relative cell delivers a high initial&#8208;capacity (1027 mAh g&#8208;1, 1 C and 913 mAh g&#8208;1, 2 C), and excellent cycling&#8208;stability for &gt;1000 cycles even at 4 C. The utilization&#8208;rate of sulfur can reach up to 81.8% and the electrodes based on these powerful binders can be easily scale&#8208;up fabricated (&#8776;20&#160;cm in a batch&#8208;experiment). Noteworthy, Mn&#8208;COP based cell delivers excellent capacities at a high sulfur&#8208;loading (8.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and low E/S ratio (5.8&#160;&#181;L mg&#8208;1). In addition, theoretical calculations reveal the vital roles of metalloporphyrin and thiourea&#8208;groups in enhancing the battery&#8208;performance.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Free Carbon&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks with Heteroatom&#8208;Free Units Boost Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to regulate the charge redistribution of active centers of metal&#8208;free organic electrocatalysts by using heteroatom&#8208;free methyl groups (MGs) is reported. MGs can produce ortho activation, confirming the ortho carbon (site&#8208;5) as active centers. This study provides insight into the design of highly efficient metal&#8208;free organic electrocatalysts via the regulation of valence bonds.








Abstract
Accurate identification of carbon&#8208;based metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst (CMFE) activity and enhancing their catalytic efficiency for O2 conversion is an urgent and challenging task. This study reports a promising strategy to simultaneously develop a series of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with well&#8208;defined heterocyclic&#8208;free biphenyl or fluorenyl units. Unlike heteroatom doping, the developed method not only supplies methyl&#8208;induced molecular configuration to promote activity, but also provides a direct opportunity to identify heteroatom&#8208;free carbon active centers. The introduction of methyl groups (MGs) with reversible valence bonds into a pristine biphenyl&#8208;based COF results in an excellent performance with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.74&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is among the highest values for CMFE&#8208;COFs as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Combined with in situ Raman spectra and theoretical calculations, the MG&#8208;bound skeleton (DAF&#8208;COF) is found to produce ortho activation, confirming the ortho carbon (site&#8208;5) adjacent to MGs as active centers. This may be attributed to the opening and binding of MGs, which effectively regulate the molecular configuration and charge redistribution, as well as improve charge transfer and reduce the energy barrier. This study provides insight into the design of highly efficient metal&#8208;free organic electrocatalysts via the regulation of valence bonds.

Hydrogel Actuators
In article number 2209870, Stefano Di Stefano, Andreas Walther, and co&#8208;workers show how pH feedback systems with programmable lifetimes and pH&#8208;responsive actuators can be combined to make autonomous soft robotic devices that perform tasks in a pre&#8208;organized fashion. Such autonomous robots enable, for instance &#8220;fire&#8208;and&#8208;forget&#8221; operation for interlocking of complex interfaces or for gripping objects through small openings.

Liquid Metal Liesegang Rings
In article number 2209392, Qian Wang, Jing Liu, and co&#8208;workers investigate the Liesegang rings phenomenon induced by gallium&#8208;based liquid metal (LM) on gold film systems. The mechanisms are attributed to the reaction&#8208;diffusion and spreading&#8208;limiting processes of the LM on gold film, over which chemical reactions occur simultaneously with the spatially recurrent crystallization of intermetallic compounds AuGa2 and AuIn2. This discovery has generalized purpose and can serve as a flashpoint for tackling diverse self&#8208;organized reaction&#8208;diffusion systems between LMs and various solid metal films.

Self&#8208;Dancing Rings
By exploring self&#8208;sustained snapping instabilities, in article number 2207372, Yao Zhao, Jie Yin, and co&#8208;workers report a self&#8208;dancing and crawling wavy ring under heat and light. This ring crawls like a front&#8208;wheel or rear&#8208;wheel car and can even self&#8208;navigate through a narrow space that is smaller than its ring size via snapping and adaptive interactions.

Photonic Colloidal Glass
Continuous gradients in self&#8208;assembled materials can provide functionality exceeding that of the homogenous case. In article number 2208745, Markus Retsch and co&#8208;workers present a synthesis method that provides gradient size distributions via a controlled extraction emulsion process (CrEEP). The high degree of control allows the fabrication of a continuous&#8208;gradient photonic glass with enhanced broadband reflectance.

         <title>2D Functionalized Germananes: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis and functionalization of 2D germananes (hydrogen atom and covalent group(s) termination) via topotactical deintercalation offer customizable properties or new functionalities. The fundamentals from synthesis and exfoliation to properties; for optoelectronics, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors, and biomedical applications are reviewed. The review presents the recent progress and challenges, and provides insight for future exploration of these materials.








Abstract
In the realm of 2D layered materials, the monoelemental group 14 Xene, germanene, as the germanium analog of graphene, has emerged as the next prospective candidate. Preceded by silicon, germanium is widely used in the semiconductor industry; thus, germanene is deemed compatible with existing semiconductor technologies. Germanene consists of mixed sp2&#8211;sp3&#8208;hybridized networks in a buckled hexagonal honeycomb structure. Chemical exfoliation of Zintl phases, such as CaGe2, specifically the topotactical deintercalation in acidic media, removes the alkaline earth metal ions Ca2+, giving rise to layered germanane (germanene with the Ge centers covalently saturated with terminal hydrogen atoms). Diverse variants of functionalized germananes (with covalent group(s) termination) can be obtained by varying the topotactical deintercalation precursors, elevating the game with limitless functionalization possibilities for customizable properties or new functionalities. The preparation of Zintl phases to the details of functionalized and modified germananes and their properties, and the additional exfoliation step to achieve mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer germananes, are comprehensively covered. The progress and challenges of 2D functionalized germananes in optoelectronics, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors, and biomedical areas are reviewed. This review provides insight into designing and exploring this class of atomically thin semiconductors in realizing future nanoarchitectonics.

         <title>Computational Biomaterials: Computational Simulations for Biomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 7, February 16, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically introduces the achievements on computational biomaterials in biomedical applications, summarizes the computational simulation in revealing internal physicochemical mechanism behind the biomaterial, and offers an outlook on the computatinal biomaterials in nanoenabled amalgamation of chemistry, material science, biology, computational and medicine based on the reports of computational biomaterials&#8208;involved disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapies and other biomimetic biomaterials.








Abstract
With the flourishing development of material simulation methods (quantum chemistry methods, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, phase field, etc.), extensive adoption of computing technologies (high&#8208;throughput, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.), and the invention of high&#8208;performance computing equipment, computational simulation tools have sparked the fundamental mechanism&#8208;level explorations to predict the diverse physicochemical properties and biological effects of biomaterials and investigate their enormous application potential for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Herein, the term &#8220;computational biomaterials&#8221; is proposed and the computational methods currently used to explore the inherent properties of biomaterials, such as optical, magnetic, electronic, and acoustic properties, and the elucidation of corresponding biological behaviors/effects in the biomedical field are summarized/discussed. The theoretical calculation of the physiochemical properties/biological performance of biomaterials applied in disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapeutics, and specific paradigms such as biomimetic biomaterials is discussed. Additionally, the biosafety evaluation applications of theoretical simulations of biomaterials are presented. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of such computational simulations for biomaterials development are clarified. It is anticipated that these simulations would offer various methodologies for facilitating the development and future clinical translations/utilization of versatile biomaterials.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the flourishing development of material simulation methods (quantum chemistry methods, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, phase field, etc.), extensive adoption of computing technologies (high-throughput, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.), and the invention of high-performance computing equipment, computational simulation tools have sparked the fundamental mechanism-level explorations to predict the diverse physicochemical properties and biological effects of biomaterials and investigate their enormous application potential for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Herein, the term &#8220;computational biomaterials&#8221; is proposed and the computational methods currently used to explore the inherent properties of biomaterials, such as optical, magnetic, electronic, and acoustic properties, and the elucidation of corresponding biological behaviors/effects in the biomedical field are summarized/discussed. The theoretical calculation of the physiochemical properties/biological performance of biomaterials applied in disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapeutics, and specific paradigms such as biomimetic biomaterials is discussed. Additionally, the biosafety evaluation applications of theoretical simulations of biomaterials are presented. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of such computational simulations for biomaterials development are clarified. It is anticipated that these simulations would offer various methodologies for facilitating the development and future clinical translations/utilization of versatile biomaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuned Ultra&#8208;Microporous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework in Mixed&#8208;Matrix Membrane: Pore&#8208;Tailoring Optimization for C2H2/C2H4 Separation</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) (JLU&#8208;MOF87&#8211;89) with triangular channels is successfully blueprinted and constructed via mixed&#8208;ligand strategy. By selecting different&#8208;sized ligands and applying linker modification, the channel is fine&#8208;tuned and precisely tailored into the optimized zone, realizing high C2H2/C2H4 selectivity. Moreover, the excellent performances of JLU&#8208;MOF mixed&#8208;matrix membranes have validated the application potential for C2H2/C2H4 separation.








Abstract
Effective separation of ethyne from ethyne/ethylene (C2H2/C2H4) mixtures is a challenging and crucial industrial process. Herein, an ultra&#8208;microporous metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) platform, Cd(dicarboxylate)2(ditriazole), with triangular channels is proposed for high&#8208;efficiency separation of C2H2 from C2H4. The targeted structures are constructed via a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy by selecting different&#8208;sized ligands, allowing for tunable pore sizes and volumes. The pore properties can be further optimized by additional modification via pore environment tailoring. This concept leads to the successful synthesis of three ultra&#8208;microporous Cd&#8208;MOFs (JLU&#8208;MOF87&#8211;89). As intended, C2H2 uptake and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity gradually increase with progressively optimizing the pore structure by adjusting ligand length and substituents. JLU&#8208;MOF89, functionalized with methyl groups, features the most optimal pore chemistry and shows selective recognition of C2H2 over C2H4, owing to the framework&#8211;C2H2 host&#8211;guest interactions. Furthermore, JLU&#8208;MOFs are fabricated into mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for C2H2/C2H4 separation. C2H2 permeability and C2H2/C2H4 permselectivity are substantially enhanced by &#8805;400% and &#8805;200%, respectively, after hybridization of JLU&#8208;MOF88 and JLU&#8208;MOF89 with a polyimide&#160;polymer&#160;(6FDA&#8211;ODA). These membranes can work efficiently and are stable under different conditions, demonstrating their potential in actual ethyne separation.

         <title>Achieving Fast Charge Separation by Ferroelectric Ultrasonic Interfacial Engineering for Rapid Sonotherapy of Bacteria&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of ferroelectric polarization interfacial engineering of BiFeO3/Ti3C2 to treat osteomyelitis under ultrasound&#160;is&#160;reported. The ferroelectric polarization induces the formation of&#160;a piezoelectric field. US cavitation effect&#160;induced sonoluminescence stimulates BiFeO3/Ti3C2 to produce photogenerated carriers. With synergistic action of the&#160;polarization electric field and Schottky junction, BiFeO3/Ti3C2 enhances the utilization of polarized charges and photogenerated charges, enhancing the yield of reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Bacteria&#8208;infected osteomyelitis is life&#8208;threatening without effective therapeutic methods clinically. Here, a rapid and effective therapeutic strategy to treat osteomyelitis through ferroelectric polarization interfacial engineering of BiFeO3/MXene (Ti3C2) triggered by ultrasound (US) is reported. Under US, the ferroelectric polarization induces the formation of the&#160;piezoelectric field. US cavitation effect&#160;induced sonoluminescence stimulates BiFeO3/Ti3C2 to produce photogenerated carriers. With synergistic action of&#160;the&#160;polarization electric field and Schottky junction, BiFeO3/Ti3C2 accelerates the separation of electrons and holes and simultaneously inhibits the backflow of electrons, thus improving the utilization of polarized charges and photogenerated charges and consequently enhancing the yield of reactive oxygen species under US. As a result, 99.87 &#177; 0.05% of Staphylococcus aureus are efficiently killed in 20&#160;min with the assistance of ultrasonic heating. The theory of ferroelectric ultrasonic interfacial engineering is proposed, which brings new insight for developing ferroelectric ultrasonic responsive materials used for the diagnosis and therapy of deep tissue infection and other acoustoelectric devices.

         <title>Controlled Interfacial Polymer Self&#8208;assembly Coordinates Ultrahigh Drug Loading and Zero&#8208;Order Release in Particles Prepared under Continuous Flow</title>

Abstract
Here, we successfully engineer microparticles through controlled interfacial self&#8208;assembly of polymers to harmonize ultrahigh drug loading with zero&#8208;order release of protein payloads. To address their poor miscibility with carrier materials, protein molecules are transformed into nanoparticles, whose surfaces are covered with polymer molecules. This polymer layer hinders the transfer of cargo nanoparticles from oil to water, achieving superior encapsulation efficiency (up to 99.9%). To control payload release, we enhance the polymer density at the oil&#8211;water interface, forming a compact shell for microparticles. The resultant microparticles could harvest up to 49.9% mass fraction of proteins with zero&#8208;order release kinetics in vivo, enabling an efficient glycemic control in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the precise control of engineering process offered through continuous flow results in high batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and, ultimately, excellent scale&#8208;up feasibility.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;scale Nanoporous 2D Active Pixel Image Sensor Matrix with Highly Uniformity, High Sensitivity, and Rapid Switching</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been successfully developed as novel ubiquitous optoelectronics owing to their excellent electrical and optical characteristics. However, active&#8208;matrix image sensors based on TMDs have limitations owing to the difficulty of fabricating large&#8208;area integrated circuitry and achieving high optical sensitivity. Herein, we report a large&#8208;area uniform, highly sensitive, and robust image sensor matrix with active pixels consisting of nanoporous molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) phototransistors and indium&#8211;gallium&#8211;zinc oxide (IGZO) switching transistors. Large&#8208;area uniform 4&#8208;inch wafer&#8208;scale bilayer MoS2 films were synthesized by radio&#8208;frequency magnetron sputtering and sulfurization processes and patterned to be a nanoporous structure consisting of an array of periodic nanopores on the MoS2 surface via block copolymer lithography. Edge exposure on the nanoporous bilayer MoS2 induces the formation of subgap states, which promotes a photogating effect to obtain an exceptionally high photoresponsivity of 5.2 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1. We successively achieved 4&#8208;inch&#8208;wafer&#8208;scale image mapping using our active&#8208;matrix image sensor by controlling the device sensing and switching states. Our high&#8208;performance active&#8208;matrix image sensor is state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in 2D material&#8208;based integrated circuitry and pixel image sensor applications.

Abstract
The past decade has witnessed the development of layered hydroxide&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting electrodes, but the low active mass ratio impedes its all&#8208;around energy storage applications. Herein, we break the intrinsic limit of layered hydroxides by engineering F&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 (Ni&#8208;F&#8208;OH) plates with a sub&#8208;micron thickness (over 700&#160;nm), producing a super&#8208;high mass loading of 29.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 on the carbon substrate. Theoretical calculation and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that Ni&#8208;F&#8208;OH shares the &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2&#8208;like structure with slightly tuned lattice parameters. More interestingly, the synergy modulation of NH4+ and F&#8722; is found to serve as the key enabler to tailor these sub&#8208;micron&#8208;thickness 2D plates thanks to the modification effects on the (001) plane surface energy and local OH&#8722; concentration. Guided by this mechanism, we further develop the superstructures of bimetallic hydroxides and their derivatives, manifesting they are a versatile family with great promise. The tailored ultra&#8208;thick phosphide superstructure achieves a super&#8208;high specific capacity of 7144 mC cm&#8722;2 and a superior rate capability (79% at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). This work highlights a multiscale understanding of how exceptional structure modulation happens in low&#8208;dimensional layered materials. The as&#8208;built unique methodology and mechanisms will boost the development of advanced materials to better meet future energy demands.

         <title>Interlayer&#8208;Spacing Engineering of Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>

Abstract
Lead&#8208;free A3Bi2I9&#8208;type perovskites have been demonstrated as a class of promising semiconductors for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection due to their high bulk resistivity and strong X&#8208;ray absorption, as well as reduced ion migration. However, due to their long interlamellar distance along their c&#8208;axis, their limited carrier transport along the vertical direction is a bottleneck for their detection sensitivity. Herein, we design a new A&#8208;site cation of aminoguanidinium (AG) with all&#8208;NH2 terminals to shorten the interlayer spacing by forming more and stronger N&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds. The prepared large AG3Bi2I9 single crystals (SCs) render shorter interlamellar distance for a larger mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 7.94 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1, which is 3 times higher than the value measured on the best MA3Bi2I9 SC (2.87&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1). Therefore, the X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated on the AG3Bi2I9 SC exhibit high sensitivity of 5791 uC Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, low detection limit of 2.6 nGy s&#8722;1 and short response time of 690 &#956;s, all of which are far better than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MA3Bi2I9 SC detectors. The combination of high sensitivity and high stability enables astonishingly high spatial resolution (8.7 lp mm&#8722;1) X&#8208;ray imaging. This work will facilitate the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance lead&#8208;free X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Energy trapping management in X&#8208;ray storage phosphors for flexible 3D imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
X&#8208;ray imaging has received a sustained attention for healthcare diagnostics and nondestructive inspection. To develop photonic materials with tunable photophysical properties in principle accelerates radiation detection technologies. Here we report the rational design and synthesis of doped halide perovskite CsCdCl3:Mn2+, R4+ (R = Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn) as next generation X&#8208;ray storage phosphors, and the capability is greatly improved by trap management via Mn2+ site occupation manipulation and heterovalent substitution. Specially, CsCdCl3:Mn2+, Zr4+ displays zero&#8208;thermal&#8208;quenching (TQ) radioluminescence and anti&#8208;TQ X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated persistent luminescence even up to 448 K, further revealing the charge carrier compensation and redeployment mechanisms. We demonstrate X&#8208;ray imaging with the resolution of 12.5 lp mm&#8722;1 and realize convenient 3D X&#8208;ray imaging for the curved objects in a time&#8208;lapse manner. This work demonstrates efficient modulation of energy traps to achieve high storage capacities and promote future researches in flexible X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Periphery Fusion Strategy of Carbazole&#8208;based Macrocycle towards Coplanar N&#8208;Heterocycloarene for High&#8208;Mobility Single Crystal Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Designing (hetero)cycloarenes through the modifications of the &#960;&#8208;topology and molecular packing of organic semiconductors has recently garnered considerable attention. However, their applications as an organic active layer in field&#8208;effect transistors are very limited, and the obtained hole carrier mobilities are less than 1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Herein, a novel alkyl&#8208;substituted coplanar N&#8208;heterocycloarene (FM&#8208;C4) containing four carbazole units has been successfully synthesized in crystalline form. As compared to the corresponding single bond linked carbazole&#8208;based macrocycle M&#8208;C4, it is found that the periphery fusion strategy greatly changes the electronic structures, energy levels, photophysical properties, host&#8208;guest interactions with fullerenes, and molecular crystal stacking motifs. In particular, the fully fused N&#8208;heterocycloarene FM&#8208;C4 exhibits a herringbone packing structure with an unusual long&#8208;range &#960;&#8722;&#960; overlap distance as low as 3.19 &#197;, whereas the single crystal of M&#8208;C4 demonstrates no &#960;&#8722;&#960; interactions. As a consequence, FM&#8208;C4 in single&#8208;crystal transistors displays the highest hole mobility of 2.06 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, significantly outperforming M&#8208;C4 and all the reported (hetero)cycloarenes and suggesting that the high potential of (hetero)cycloarenes for organic electronic applications.

         <title>Multiexciton Generation From a 2D Organic&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Perovskite with Nearly 200% Quantum Yield of Red Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two dimensional (2D) organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) show obvious advantages in the optoelectronic field due to their high luminescent stability and good solution processability. However, the thermal quenching and self&#8208;absorption of excitons caused by the strong interaction between inorganic metal ions lead to the low luminescence efficiency of 2D perovskites. Herein, we report a 2D Cd&#8208;based OIHP (named as PACC) with a weak red phosphorescence (&#934;P &lt; 6%) at 620&#160;nm and a blue afterglow. Interestingly, Mn&#8208;doped PACC (PACC&#8208;M) exhibits very strong red emission with nearly 200% of quantum yield and 15&#160;ms of lifetime, thus resulting in a red afterglow. The experimental data prove that the doping of Mn2+ not only induces the multi&#8208;exciton generation (MEG) process of the perovskite, avoiding the energy loss of inorganic excitons, but also promotes the Dexter energy transfer from organic triplet excitons to inorganic excitons, thus realizing the super&#8208;efficient red&#8208;light emission of Cd2+. This work suggests that guest metal ions can induce host metal ions to realize MEG in 2D bulk OIHPs, which provides a new idea for the development of optoelectronic materials and devices with ultra&#8208;high energy utilization.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two dimensional (2D) organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) show obvious advantages in the optoelectronic field due to their high luminescent stability and good solution processability. However, the thermal quenching and self-absorption of excitons caused by the strong interaction between inorganic metal ions lead to the low luminescence efficiency of 2D perovskites. Herein, we report a 2D Cd-based OIHP (named as PACC) with a weak red phosphorescence (&lt;i&gt;&#934;&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 6%) at 620&#160;nm and a blue afterglow. Interestingly, Mn-doped PACC (PACC-M) exhibits very strong red emission with nearly 200% of quantum yield and 15&#160;ms of lifetime, thus resulting in a red afterglow. The experimental data prove that the doping of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; not only induces the multi-exciton generation (MEG) process of the perovskite, avoiding the energy loss of inorganic excitons, but also promotes the Dexter energy transfer from organic triplet excitons to inorganic excitons, thus realizing the super-efficient red-light emission of Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. This work suggests that guest metal ions can induce host metal ions to realize MEG in 2D bulk OIHPs, which provides a new idea for the development of optoelectronic materials and devices with ultra-high energy utilization.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
This article reports on a Molecular&#8208;Spin&#8208;Sensitive&#8208;Antenna (MSSA) that is based on stacked layers of organically functionalized graphene on a fibrous helical cellulose network for carrying out spatiotemporal identification of chiral enantiomers. The MSSA structures combine 3 complementary features: (i) chiral separation via a helical quantum sieve for chiral trapping, (ii) chiral recognition by a synthetically implanted spin&#8208;sensitive center in a graphitic lattice; and (iii) chiral selectivity by a chirality&#8208;induced&#8208;spin mechanism that polarizes the local electronic band&#8208;structure in graphene through chiral&#8208;activated Rashba spin&#8208;orbit interaction field. Combining the MSSA structures with decision&#8208;making principles based on neuromorphic artificial intelligence show fast, portable and wearable spectrometry for the detection and classification of pure and a mixture of chiral molecules, such as butanol (S and R), limonene (S and R) and xylene isomers, with 95&#8211;98% accuracy. These results could have a broad impact where the MSSA approach is central as a precautionary risk assessment against potential hazards impacting human health and the environment due to chiral molecules; furthermore, it acts as a dynamic monitoring tool of all parts of the chiral molecule life cycles.

         <title>An Ultrathin Nonporous Polymer Separator Regulates Na Transfer Toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Storage Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ultrathin exterior&#8208;nonporous polymer separator composed of honeycomb&#8208;structured fibers is prepared for high&#8208;energy sodium storage batteries. It effectively suppresses Na dendrites and avoids the related safety risk, as&#160;well&#160;as shows the ability to customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, thereby leading to ion&#8208;conductivity&#8208;enhanced inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase and cathode electrolyte interphase.








Abstract
Sodium storage batteries are one of the ever&#8208;increasing next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to the abundant resources and low cost. However, their viability is severely hampered by dendrite&#8208;related hazards on anodes. Herein, a novel ultrathin (8 &#181;m) exterior&#8208;nonporous separator composed of honeycomb&#8208;structured fibers is prepared for homogeneous Na deposition and suppressed dendrite penetration. The unhindered ion transmission greatly benefits&#160;from honeycomb&#8208;structured fibers with huge electrolyte uptake (376.7%) and the polymer's inherent transport ability. Additionally, polar polymer chains consisting of polyethersulfone and polyvinylidene customize the highly aggregated solvation structure of electrolytes via substantial solvent immobilization, facilitating ion&#8208;conductivity&#8208;enhanced inorganic&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with remarkable interface endurance. With the reliable mechanical strength of the&#160;separator, the assembled sodium&#8208;ion full cell delivers significantly improved energy density and high safety,&#160;enabling stable operation under cutting and rolling. The as&#8208;prepared separator can further be generalized to lithium&#8208;based batteries for which apparent dendrite inhibition and cyclability are accessible and demonstrates its potential for practical application.

         <title>Sequential Deposition of Multicomponent Bulk Heterojunctions Increases Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;bulk heterojunction active layer structure for organic solar cell (OSC) is constructed by sequential deposition of a PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend on top of a D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend, in which the optimal morphology of the two binary blends were&#160;retained with a vertical phase separation, resulting in a record PCE of 19.61%.








Abstract
Constructing tandem and multi&#8208;blend organic solar cells (OSCs) is&#160;an effective way to overcome the absorption limitations of conventional single&#8208;junction devices. However, these methods inevitably require tedious multilayer deposition or complicated morphology&#8208;optimization procedures. Herein, sequential deposition is utilized as an effective and simple method to fabricate multicomponent OSCs with a double&#8208;bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure of the active layer to further improve photovoltaic performance. Two efficient donor&#8208;acceptor pairs, D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 and PM6:L8&#8208;BO, are sequentially deposited to form the D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9/PM6:L8&#8208;BO double&#8208;BHJ active layer. In these double&#8208;BHJ OSCs, light absorption is significantly improved, and optimal morphology is also retained without requiring a more complicated morphology optimization involved in quaternary blends. Compared to the quaternary blend devices, energy loss (Eloss) is also reduced by rationally matching each donor with an appropriate acceptor. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved from 18.25% for D18&#8208;Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 and 18.69% for PM6:L8&#8208;BO based binary blend OSCs to 19.61% for the double&#8208;BHJ OSCs. In contrast, a D18&#8208;Cl:PM6:L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;eC9 quaternary blend of OSCs exhibited a dramatically reduced PCE of 15.83%. These results demonstrate that a double&#8208;BHJ strategy, with a relatively simple processing procedure, can potentially enhance the device performance of OSCs and lead to more widespread use.

         <title>All&#8208;Transfer Electrode Interface Engineering Toward Harsh&#8208;Environment&#8208;Resistant MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors are demonstrated by engineering the electrode&#8211;channel interfaces with an all&#8208;transfer technique of van der Waals electrodes. The intact and defect&#8208;free interfaces not only reduce the Schottky barrier height at electrodes, but enable high resistances of the MoS2 devices to humid, oxidizing, and high&#8208;temperature environments, surpassing the devices with other kinds of electrodes.








Abstract
Nanoscale electronic devices that can work in harsh environments are in high demand for wearable, automotive, and aerospace electronics. Clean and defect&#8208;free interfaces are of vital importance for building nanoscale harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant devices. However, current nanoscale devices are subject to failure in these environments, especially at defective electrode&#8211;channel interfaces. Here, harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant MoS2 transistors are developed by engineering electrode&#8211;channel interfaces with an all&#8208;transfer of van der Waals electrodes. The delivered defect&#8208;free, graphene&#8208;buffered electrodes keep the electrode&#8211;channel interfaces intact and robust. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated MoS2 devices have reduced Schottky barrier heights, leading to a very large on&#8208;state current and high carrier mobility. More importantly, the defect&#8208;free, hydrophobic graphene buffer layer prevents metal diffusion from the electrodes to MoS2 and the intercalation of water molecules at the electrode&#8211;MoS2 interfaces. This enables high resistances of MoS2 devices with all&#8208;transfer electrodes to various harsh environments, including humid, oxidizing, and high&#8208;temperature environments, surpassing the devices with other kinds of electrodes. The work deepens the understanding of the roles of electrode&#8211;channel interfaces in nanoscale devices and provides a promising interface engineering strategy to build nanoscale harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant devices.

         <title>Orally Administrable H2S&#8208;Scavenging Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Prepared by Co&#8208;Flow Microfluidics for Comprehensive Restoration of Intestinal Milieu</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic nanoplatform is synthesized to scavenge and detect H2S to recover intestinal barrier damaged by inflammatory bowel diseases. Nanoplatform is prepared by encapsulation of UiO&#8208;66 with a CR probe (UR) in pH&#8208;responsive hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) done via microfluidic. Following oral administration, HPMCAS dissolves to expose UR NPs at the inflamed intestine which adsorbs and detects H2S.








Abstract
Intestinal milieu disorders are strongly related to the occurrence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), which results from mucosa destruction, epithelium disruption, and tight junction (TJ) proteins loss. Excess of H2S in the intestinal milieu produced by the&#160;sulfate&#8208;reducing bacteria metabolism contributes to&#160;development of&#160;IBDs via epithelial barrier breakdown. Conventional interventions, such as surgery and anti&#8208;inflammatory medications, are considered not completely effective because of frequent recurrence and other complications. Herein, a novel oral delivery system, a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS)&#8208;based polymer&#8208;coated Zr&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (UiO&#8208;66) with a Cux&#8208;rhodamine B (CR) probe (hereinafter referred to as HUR), is produced via&#160;a&#160;co&#8208;flow microfluidic approach with the ability to reduce H2S levels, thus restoring the intestinal lumen milieu. HPMCAS serves as an enteric coating that exposes UiO&#8208;66@CR at the pH of the intestine but not the acidic pH of the stomach. The synthesized HUR exhibits notable therapeutic efficacy, including mucosa recovery, epithelium integrity restoration, and TJ proteins upregulation via H2S scavenging to protect against intestinal barrier damage and microbiome dysbiosis. Thus, HUR is verified to be a promising theranostic platform able to decrease the H2S content for intestinal milieu disorder treatment. The presented study therefore opens the door for further exploitation for IBDs therapy.

         <title>Combined Vacuum Evaporation and Solution Process for High&#8208;Efficiency Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Solar Cells with Exceptional Reproducibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacuum evaporation of lead iodide and solution processing of organic ammonium halide are combined to produce large&#8208;area homogeneous perovskite films with high reproducibility. The resulting PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.0% (certified PCE 23.7%) on large area (1&#160;cm2) under AM 1.5G illumination, which is currently the highest PCE for large area perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites exhibit outstanding performances in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the complex solution chemistry of perovskites precursors renders it difficult to prepare large&#8208;area devices in a reproducible way, which is a prerequisite for the technology to make an impact beyond lab scale. Vacuum processing, instead, is an established technology for large&#8208;scale coating of thin films. However, with respect to the hybrid perovskites it is highly challenging due to the high vapor pressure of the organic ammonium halide. In this work, vacuum evaporation of lead iodide and solution processing of organic ammonium halide is combined to produce large&#8208;area homogeneous perovskite films with large grains in a highly reproducible way. The resulting PSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.3% (certified 23.9%) on small area (0.10&#160;cm2), 24.0% (certified 23.7%) on large area (1&#160;cm2) and 20.0% for minimodule (16&#160;cm2), and maintain 90% of its initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h 1&#8208;sun operation. The vacuum evaporation prevents advert environmental effects on lead halide formation and guarantees a reproducible fabrication of high&#8208;quality large&#8208;area perovskite films, which opens a promising way for large&#8208;scale fabrication of perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;Hybridized Hydroxides for Energy Conversion and Storage: Interface Chemistry and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon&#8208;hybridized hydroxides (CHHs) have unique superiorities in energy storage/conversion, in which the intrinsic roles of carbon at the heterogeneous interface are highlighted. The methods to construct a robust heterointerface in CHHs are summarized. The techniques to pinpoint the interface interaction and rehybridization electron configuration between carbon and hydroxides, and the future directions and perspective of the CHHs are outlined.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;hybridized hydroxides (CHHs) have been intensively investigated for uses in the energy conversion/storage fields. Nevertheless, the intrinsic structure&#8211;activity relationships between carbon and hydroxides within CHHs are still blurry, which hinders the fine modulation of CHHs in terms of practical applications to some degree. This review aims to figure out the intrinsic role of carbon materials in CHHs with a focus on the interface chemistry and the engineering strategy in&#8208;between two components. The fundamental effects of the carbon materials in enhancing the charge/mass transfer kinetics are first analyzed, particularly the extra electron pathways for fast charge transfer and the anchoring sites for boosting the mass transfer. Subsequently, the surface&#8208;guided/confined effects of carbon materials in CHHs to modify the morphology and tailor the hydroxides, and functional heterojunction for regulating the inner electronic structure are decoupled. The methods to efficiently construct a stable yet robust solid&#8211;solid heterointerface are summarized, including oxygen functional groups engrafting, topological defective sites construction and heteroatom incorporation to activate the inert carbon surface. The smart CHHs in some typical energy applications are demonstrated. Additionally, the methodologies that can reveal the hybridization electron configuration between two components are summed up. At last, the perspective and challenges faced by the CHHs for energy&#8208;related applications are outlined.

         <title>Resolution of MoS2 Nanosheets&#8208;Induced Pulmonary Inflammation Driven by Nanoscale Intracellular Transformation and Extracellular&#8208;Vesicle Shuttles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoS2 nanosheets trigger lung inflammation that is fast recovered, although the products derived from their degradation remain in the alveolar macrophages and in the extracellular vesicles for&#160;up to 30 days. The&#160;in&#160;vivo&#160;biotransformation&#160;of&#160;MoS2 is caused by reactive oxygen species following three mechanisms: scrolling, etching, and oxidation, generating molybdate ions and oxide nanoparticles.








Abstract
Pulmonary exposure to some engineered nanomaterials can cause chronic lesions as a result of unresolved inflammation. Among 2D nanomaterials and graphene, MoS2 has received tremendous attention in optoelectronics and nanomedicine. Here an integrated approach is proposed to follow up the transformation of MoS2 nanosheets at the nanoscale and assesss&#160;their impact on lung inflammation status over 1 month after a single inhalation in mice. Analysis of immune cells, alveolar macrophages, extracellular vesicles, and cytokine profiling in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) shows that MoS2 nanosheets induced initiation of lung inflammation. However, the inflammation is rapidly resolved despite the persistence of various biotransformed molybdenum&#8208;based nanostructures in the alveolar macrophages and the extracellular vesicles for&#160;up to 1 month. Using in situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy experiments, the dynamics of MoS2 nanosheets transformation triggered by reactive oxygen species could be evidenced. Three main transformation mechanisms are observed directly at the nanoscale level: 1) scrolling of the dispersed sheets leading to the formation of nanoscrolls and folded patches, 2) etching releasing soluble MoO4&#8722;, and 3) oxidation generating oxidized sheet fragments. Extracellular vesicles released in BALF are also identified as a potential shuttle of MoS2 nanostructures and their degradation products and more importantly as mediators of inflammation resolution.

         <title>Flexible Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries with Ampere&#8208;Hour Capacities and Wide&#8208;Temperature Adaptabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic liquid (IL) additive hydrogel is reported for flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries (FZABs). Similar to a crab, the IL creates pores and captures water in the hydrogel, which improves the ionic conductivity and water retention of the hydrogel. The FZABs based on this hydrogel can operate at high and low temperatures.








Abstract
Flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries (FZABs) have significant potentials as efficient energy storage devices for wearable electronics because of their safeties and high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratios. However, their application is limited by their short cycle lives, low discharge capacities per cycle, and high charge/discharge polarizations. Accordingly, herein, a poly(sodium acrylate)&#8211;polyvinyl alcohol (PANa&#8211;PVA)&#8211;ionic liquid (IL) hydrogel (PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL) is prepared using a hygroscopic IL, 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride, as an additive for twin&#8208;chain PANa&#8211;PVA. PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL exhibits a high conductivity of 306.9&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a water uptake of 2515 wt% at room temperature. Moreover, a low&#8208;cost bifunctional catalyst, namely, Co9S8 nanoparticles anchored on N&#8208; and S&#8208;co&#8208;doped activated carbon black pearls 2000 (Co9S8&#8208;NSABP), is synthesized, which demonstrates a low O2 reversibility potential gap of 0.629&#160;V. FZABs based on PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL and Co9S8&#8208;NSABP demonstrate high discharge capacities of 1.67&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 per cycle and long cycle lives of 330&#160;h.&#160;Large&#8208;scale flexible rechargeable Zn&#8211;air pouch cells exhibit total capacities of 1.03&#160;Ah and energy densities of 246&#160;Wh&#160;kgcell&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;An ionic liquid (IL) additive hydrogel is reported for flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries (FZABs). Similar to a crab, the IL creates pores and captures water in the hydrogel, which improves the ionic conductivity and water retention of the hydrogel. The FZABs based on this hydrogel can operate at high and low temperatures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries (FZABs) have significant potentials as efficient energy storage devices for wearable electronics because of their safeties and high energy-to-cost ratios. However, their application is limited by their short cycle lives, low discharge capacities per cycle, and high charge/discharge polarizations. Accordingly, herein, a poly(sodium acrylate)&#8211;polyvinyl alcohol (PANa&#8211;PVA)&#8211;ionic liquid (IL) hydrogel (PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL) is prepared using a hygroscopic IL, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, as an additive for twin-chain PANa&#8211;PVA. PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL exhibits a high conductivity of 306.9&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a water uptake of 2515 wt% at room temperature. Moreover, a low-cost bifunctional catalyst, namely, Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles anchored on N- and S-co-doped activated carbon black pearls 2000 (Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-NSABP), is synthesized, which demonstrates a low O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reversibility potential gap of 0.629&#160;V. FZABs based on PANa&#8211;PVA&#8211;IL and Co&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-NSABP demonstrate high discharge capacities of 1.67&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; per cycle and long cycle lives of 330&#160;h.&#160;Large-scale flexible rechargeable Zn&#8211;air pouch cells exhibit total capacities of 1.03&#160;Ah and energy densities of 246&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sub&gt;cell&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study provides new information about hydrogels with high ionic conductivities and water uptakes and should facilitate the application of FZABs in wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topological Metal MoP Nanowire for Interconnect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological metal molybdenum phosphide (MoP) nanowires are demonstrated as a new class of interconnect material for on&#8208;chip applications. Owing to its high carrier density, low resistivity, and short electron mean free path, MoP nanowires exhibit dimensional scaling of resistivity far superior to effective copper (Cu) and ruthenium&#160;(Ru). MoP is also oxidation resistant and has a high cohesive energy, potentially enabling a barrier&#8208;free interconnect design. Thus, this work demonstrates MoP as a breakthrough material for interconnect technologies for continued downscaling of integrated circuits and future energy&#8208;efficient computing.








Abstract
The increasing resistance of copper (Cu) interconnects for decreasing dimensions is a major challenge in continued downscaling of integrated circuits beyond the 7&#160;nm technology node&#160;as it leads to unacceptable signal delays and power consumption in computing. The resistivity of Cu increases due to electron scattering at surfaces and grain boundaries at the nanoscale. Topological semimetals, owing to their topologically protected surface states and suppressed electron backscattering, are promising candidates to potentially replace current Cu interconnects. Here,&#160;we report the unprecedented resistivity scaling of topological metal molybdenum phosphide (MoP) nanowires, and it is shown that the resistivity values are superior to those of nanoscale Cu interconnects &lt;500&#160;nm2 cross&#8208;section areas. The cohesive energy of MoP suggests better stability against electromigration, enabling a barrier&#8208;free design . MoP nanowires are more resistant to surface oxidation than the 20&#160;nm thick Cu. The thermal conductivity of MoP is comparable to those of Ru and Co. Most importantly, it is demonstrated that the dimensional scaling of MoP, in terms of line resistance versus total cross&#8208;sectional area, is competitive to those of effective Cu with barrier/liner and barrier&#8208;less Ru, suggesting MoP is an attractive alternative for the scaling challenge of Cu interconnects.

         <title>Heterogeneous Structure Omnidirectional Strain Sensor Arrays With Cognitively&#160;Learned Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An omnidirectional strain sensor array for electronic skin applications, which can detect and predict both the 360&#176; direction and strain intensity based on machine learning,&#160;is demonstrated. By adopting a learning algorithm based on the multiclass&#8211;multioutput model, highly accurate prediction of strain information is achieved.








Abstract
Mechanically stretchable strain sensors gain tremendous attention for bioinspired skin sensation systems and artificially intelligent tactile sensors. However, high&#8208;accuracy detection of both strain intensity and direction with simple device/array structures is still insufficient. To overcome this limitation, an omnidirectional strain perception platform utilizing a stretchable strain sensor array with triangular&#8208;sensor&#8208;assembly (three sensors tilted by 45&#176;) coupled with machine learning (ML) &#8208;based neural network classification algorithm, is proposed. The strain sensor, which is constructed with strain&#8208;insensitive electrode regions and strain&#8208;sensitive channel region, can minimize the undesirable electrical intrusion from the electrodes by strain, leading to a heterogeneous surface structure for more reliable strain sensing characteristics. The strain sensor exhibits decent sensitivity with gauge factor (GF) of &#8776;8, a moderate sensing range (&#8776;0&#8211;35%), and relatively good reliability (3000 stretching cycles). More importantly, by employing a multiclass&#8211;multioutput behavior&#8208;learned cognition algorithm, the stretchable sensor array with triangular&#8208;sensor&#8208;assembly exhibits highly accurate recognition of both direction and intensity of an arbitrary strain by interpretating the correlated signals from the three&#8208;unit sensors. The omnidirectional strain perception platform with its&#160;neural network algorithm exhibits overall strain intensity and direction accuracy around 98% &#177; 2% over a strain range of &#8776;0&#8211;30% in various surface stimuli environments.

         <title>Direct Observation of Oxygen Atoms Taking Tetrahedral Interstitial Sites in Medium&#8208;Entropy Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interstitial solutes normally occupy the octahedral interstices in body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic metals. Using deep&#8208;sub&#8208;angstrom&#8208;resolution electron ptychography, this work provides the first experimental evidence to directly observe individual oxygen atoms, and shows a switch in preference to the unusual tetrahedral sites at high oxygen concentrations in a medium&#8208;entropy alloy.








Abstract
Interstitial solutes, such as carbon in steels, are effective solid&#8208;solution hardening agents. These alloying elements are believed to occupy the octahedral interstices in body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (bcc) metals. Using deep&#8208;sub&#8208;angstrom&#8208;resolution electron ptychography, here&#160;the first experimental evidence to directly observe individual oxygen atoms in a highly concentrated bcc solid solution&#8212;the (TiNbZr)86O12C1N1 medium&#8208;entropy alloy (MEA)&#8212;is&#160;provided, whereby&#160;the interstitial sites in which&#160;the&#160;oxygen&#160;atoms are located&#160;are discerned. In addition to oxygen interstitials residing in octahedral sites, the first unambiguous evidence of a switch in preference to the unusual tetrahedral sites at high oxygen concentrations&#160;is&#160;shown. This shift away from octahedral occupancy is explained as resulting from the extra cost of strain energy when the requisite displacement of the host atoms is deterred in the presence of nearby octahedral interstitials.

         <title>Oxygen Vacancies in Piezoelectric ZnO Twin&#8208;Mesocrystal to Improve Peroxymonosulfate Utilization Efficiency via Piezo&#8208;Activation for Antibiotic Ornidazole Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric ZnO mesocrystals with different oxygen vacancy (OVs) concentrations are quantitatively regulated as models for understanding the role of OVs in piezoelectric&#8208;catalysis for peroxymonosulfate&#160;(PMS) activation. The ZnO with a moderate OVs concentration realizes increased electron delocalization, reduced charge transfer barrier, and enhanced reactants affinity, thus accelerating the kinetics of PMS activation.








Abstract
Piezoelectric mesocrystals as defective materials have been demonstrated to possess adsorptive and catalytic properties in redox reactions. However, there is still a lack of research on the quantitative relationship between the defect concentration and the piezocatalytic performance in piezoelectric mesocrystals. Herein, twin&#8208;hierarchical structure ZnO piezoelectric mesocrystals are taken with different oxygen&#8208;vacancies (OVs) concentrations to quantitatively investigate the effect of defect content on the peroxymonosulfate (PMS) piezo&#8208;activation in water purification. The ZnO piezoelectric mesocrystal with moderate OVs concentration exhibits a rapid antibiotic ornidazole (ORZ) pollutants degradation rate (0.034&#160;min&#8722;1) and achieves a high PMS utilization efficiency (0.162) that exceeds the most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic processes, while excessive OVs suppressed the piezocatalytic performance. Through calculations of electron property and reactants affinity, a quantitative relationship between OVs concentration and piezocatalytic properties is established. The ZnO mesocrystal with moderate OVs concentration realized increased electron delocalization, reduced charge transfer barrier, and enhanced reactants affinity, thus accelerating the kinetics of PMS activation. This work provides theoretical guidance for the application of defect engineering in mesocrystal to realize enhanced piezocatalytic performance.

         <title>Morphology Tuning via Linker Modulation: Metal&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Nanostructures with Exceptional Chemical Stability for Electrocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;rationally designed synthetic route for synthesizing pure imidazole&#8208;linked porous organic polymers&#160;(POPs) by modulating the liker geometry to induce rigidity into the system&#160;is&#160;presented. Directing the reaction solely toward imidazole linkage formation instead of the imine&#8208;imidazole mixture tunes the random morphology to hollow&#8208;spheres, improving porosity&#160;and thermal and chemical stability. These POPs show excellent performance as metal&#8208;free bi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts toward water splitting with long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
The development of synthetic routes for the formation of robust porous organic polymers (POPs) with well&#8208;defined nanoscale morphology is fundamentally significant for their practical applications. The thermodynamic characteristics that arise from reversible covalent bonding impart intrinsic chemical instability in the polymers, thereby impeding their overall potential. Herein, a unique strategy is reported to overcome the stability issue by designing robust imidazole&#8208;linked POPs via tandem reversible/irreversible bond formation. Incorporating inherent rigidity into the secondary building units leads to robust microporous polymeric nanostructures with hollow&#8208;spherical morphologies. An in&#8208;depth analysis by extensive solid&#8208;state NMR (1D and 2D) study on 1H, 13C, and 14N nuclei elucidates the bonding and reveals the high purity of the newly designed imidazole&#8208;based POPs. The nitrogen&#8208;rich polymeric nanostructures are further used as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for water splitting. In particular, the rigid POPs show excellent catalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with long&#8208;term durability. Among them, the most efficient OER electrocatalyst (TAT&#8208;TFBE) requires 314&#160;mV of overpotential to drive 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density, demonstrating its superiority over state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts (RuO2 and IrO2).

         <title>Controlling &#960;&#8211;&#960; Interactions of Highly Soluble Naphthalene Diimide Derivatives for Neutral pH Aqueous Redox Flow Batteries</title>

The design of organic redox&#8208;active molecules to develop spin pairing during the electron&#8208;transfer process improves cycling performance in aqueous redox flow batteries.








Abstract
Organic redox&#8208;active molecules are a promising platform for designing sustainable, cheap, and safe charge carriers for redox flow batteries. However, radical formation during the electron&#8208;transfer process causes severe side reactions and reduces cyclability. This problem is mitigated by using naphthalene diimide (NDI) molecules and regulating their &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. The long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;stacking of NDI molecules, which leads to precipitation, is disrupted by tethering four ammonium functionalities, and the solubility approaches 1.5&#160;m in water. The gentle &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions induce clustering and disassembling of the NDI molecules during the two&#8208;electron transfer processes. When the radical anion forms, the antiferromagnetic coupling develops tetramer and dimer and nullifies the radical character. In addition, short&#8208;range&#8208;order NDI clusters at 1&#160;m concentration are not precipitated but inhibit crossover. They are disassembled in the subsequent electron&#8208;transfer process, and the negatively charged NDI core strongly interacts with ammonium groups. These behaviors afford excellent RFB performance, demonstrating 98% capacity retention for 500 cycles at 25&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and 99.5% Coulombic efficiency with 2&#160;m electron storage capacity.

         <title>Recent Advances in Efficient Photocatalysis via Modulation of Electric and Magnetic Fields and Reactive Phase Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric and magnetic fields&#8217; modulation and reactive phase control strategies exhibit robust manipulation role in promoting the separation and transfer of photoexcited carriers, lowering photocatalytic reaction energy barrier, and facilitating mass transfer, which have received much attention and become the research hotspot in photocatalytic field for achieving efficient photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
The past several years has witnessed significant progress in enhancing photocatalytic performance via robust electric and magnetic fields&#8217; modulation to promote the separation and transfer of photoexcited carriers, and phase control at reactive interface to lower photocatalytic reaction energy barrier and facilitate mass transfer. These three research directions have received soaring attention in photocatalytic field. Herein, recent advances in photocatalysis modulated by electric field (i.e., piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and triboelectric fields, as well as their coupling) with specific examples and mechanisms discussion are first examined. Subsequently, the strategy via magnetic field manipulation for enhancing photocatalytic performance is scrutinized, including the spin polarization, Lorentz force, and magnetoresistance effect. Afterward, materials with tailored structure and composition design enabled by reactive phase control and their applications in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction are reviewed. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities to further boost photocatalytic efficiency are presented, aiming at providing crucial theoretical and experimental guidance for those working in photocatalysis, ferroelectrics, triboelectrics, piezo&#8208;/pyro&#8208;/tribo&#8208;phototronics, and electromagnetics, among other related areas.

         <title>Rapid Identification and Monitoring of Multiple Bacterial Infections Using Printed Nanoarrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, fast, and accessible diagnosis tool is developed for direct point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of pathogenic bacteria in clinical and food samples at the single&#8208;cell level, by using a nanoarray&#8208;based colorimetric biosensor. It does not need enrichment, culturing, fluorescence probes, or other sample pretreatments, and can be readily extended to many microbes such as viruses, spirochetes, mycoplasma, rickettsia, and chlamydia.








Abstract
Fast and accurate detection of microbial cells in clinical samples is highly valuable but remains a challenge. Here, a simple, culture&#8208;free diagnostic system is developed for direct detection of pathogenic bacteria in water, urine, and serum samples using an optical colorimetric biosensor. It consists of printed nanoarrays chemically conjugated with specific antibodies that exhibits distinct color changes after capturing target pathogens. By utilizing the internal capillarity inside an evaporating droplet, target preconcentration is achieved within a few minutes to enable rapid identification and more efficient detection of bacterial pathogens. More importantly, the scattering signals of bacteria are significantly amplified by the nanoarrays due to strong near&#8208;field localization, which supports a visualizable analysis of the growth, reproduction, and cell activity of bacteria at the single&#8208;cell level. Finally, in addition to high selectivity, this nanoarray&#8208;based biosensor is also capable of accurate quantification and continuous monitoring of bacterial load on food over a broad linear range, with a detection limit of 10 CFU mL&#8722;1. This work provides an accessible and user&#8208;friendly tool for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing of pathogens in many clinical and environmental applications, and possibly enables a breakthrough in early prevention and treatment.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;acoustic Sequentially Actuated CAR T cell Microrobots for Precision Navigation and in&#8208;situ Antitumour Immunoactivation</title>

Abstract
Despite its clinical success, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) cell immunotherapy remains limited in solid tumours, owing to harsh physical barriers and immunosuppressive microenvironments. Here we describe a CAR T cell&#8208;based live microrobot (M&#8208;CAR T) created by decorating CAR T with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation. M&#8208;CAR Ts are capable of magnetic&#8208;acoustic actuation for precision tumour targeting and in&#8208;situ activation of antitumour immune responses. Sequential actuation endows M&#8208;CAR Ts with magnetically actuated anti&#8208;flow and obstacle avoidance capabilities as well as tumour tissue penetration driven by acoustic propulsion, enabling efficient migration and accumulation in artificial tumour models. In animal models, sequentially actuated M&#8208;CAR Ts achieved long&#8208;distance targeting and accumulated at the peritumoural area under programmable magnetic guidance, and subsequently acoustic tweezers actuated M&#8208;CAR Ts to migrate into deep tumour tissues, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated exogenous CD8+ CAR T cells compared with that with no actuation. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads in&#8208;situ stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumour efficacy. Thus, our sequential actuation&#8208;guided cell microrobot combines the merits of autonomous targeting and penetration of intelligent robots with in&#8208;situ immunoactivation of T cells, and holds considerable promise for precision navigation of cancer immunotherapies.

         <title>Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum Inspired Polystyrene Brush&#8208;Based Superhigh Sulfur Content Cathodes Enable Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Cells with High Mass and Capacity Loading</title>

Abstract
The development of highly sophisticated biomimetic models is significant yet remains challenging in electrochemical energy storage field. Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) cells with high sulfur content and high sulfur loading cathodes are urgently required to meet the fast&#8208;growing demand of electronic devices. Nevertheless, such cathode materials generally suffer from large sulfur agglomeration, nonporous structure and insufficient conductivity, leading to rapid capacity decay and low sulfur utilization. Herein, inspired by rough endoplasmic reticulum, two&#8208;dimensional polystyrene (PS) brush&#8208;based (G&#8208;g&#8208;PS) superhigh sulfur content (96 wt%) composites (G&#8208;g&#8208;sPS@S) are fabricated via vulcanization reaction. The vulcanized PS side&#8208;chains and their S8 composites on the nanosheet surface can efficiently provide sulfur species, and the intersheet interstitial pores can provide rapid mass transfer channels for redox reactions of sulfur species. Furthermore, the highly sulfophilic vulcanized PS side&#8208;chains are able to effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides and regulate their redox process. With these merits, the cells with G&#8208;g&#8208;sPS@S cathodes exhibit an ultralow decay rate of 0.02% per cycle over 400 cycles at 2 C and deliver a superior areal capacity of 12.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 even with a high sulfur loading of 10.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enabled Holographic Lithography for Impact&#8208;Absorbing Nanoarchitected Sheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optical metasurfaces are utilized to fabricate polymer nanoarchitected sheets with a thickness of 30&#8211;40 &#181;m and lateral dimensions of 2.1&#160;&#215;&#160;2.4 cm2. Nanoindentation reveals the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elastic modulus to vary between 0.3 and 4 GPa. Laser&#160;induced particle impact tests indicate specific inelastic energy dissipation of 0.51&#8211;2.61 MJ kg&#8722;1 which is comparable to other high&#160;impact energy absorbing composites and nanomaterials.








Abstract
Nanoarchitected materials represent a class of structural meta&#8208;materials that utilze nanoscale features to achieve unconventional material properties such as ultralow density and high energy absorption. A dearth of fabrication methods capable of producing architected materials with sub&#8208;micrometer resolution over large areas in a scalable manner exists. A fabrication technique is presented that employs holographic patterns generated by laser exposure of phase metasurface masks in negative&#8208;tone photoresists to produce 30&#8211;40 &#181;m&#8208;thick nanoarchitected sheets with 2.1 &#215; 2.4 cm2 lateral dimensions and &#8776;500 nm&#8208;wide struts organized in layered 3D brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar&#8208;like patterns to result in &#8776;50&#8211;70% porosity. Nanoindentation arrays over the entire sample area reveal the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane elastic modulus to vary between 300 MPa and 4 GPa, with irrecoverable post&#8208;elastic material deformation commencing via individual nanostrut buckling, densification within layers, shearing along perturbation perimeter, and tensile cracking. Laser&#160;induced particle impact tests (LIPIT) indicate specific inelastic energy dissipation of 0.51&#8211;2.61 MJ kg&#8722;1, which is comparable to other high impact energy absorbing composites and nanomaterials, such as Kevlar/poly(vinyl butyral)&#160;(PVB) composite, polystyrene, and pyrolized carbon nanolattices with 23% relative density. These results demonstrate that holographic lithography offers a promising platform for scalable manufacturing of nanoarchitected materials with impact resistant&#160;capabilities.

         <title>Microfluidics&#8208;enabled Serial Assembly of Lipid&#8208;siRNA&#8208;sorafenib Nanoparticles for Synergetic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of microfluidics&#8208;enabled serial assembly is used to assemble multi&#8208;component nanoparticles step&#8208;by&#8208;step. This versatile microfluidic platform can accommodate both fast and slow processes to sequentially enable the assembly of sorafenib supramolecule, electrostatic adsorption of siRNA, and surface assembly of lipids. The improved performances are observed in the produced lipid&#8208;siRNA&#8208;sorafenib nanoparticles, including ultrahigh encapsulation efficiency, transfection efficiency, and anti&#8208;tumor effects.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;component nanoparticles (mNPs) hold great potential for disease prevention and treatment. However, a major barrier is the lack of versatile platforms to accommodate steps of assembly processes of mNPs. Here the microfluidics&#8208;enabled serial assembly (MESA) of mNPs is presented. The microfluidic chip, as a mini&#8208;conveyor of initial materials, sequentially enables the assembly of sorafenib supramolecule, electrostatic adsorption of siRNA, and surface assembly of protective lipids. The produced lipid&#8208;siRNA&#8208;sorafenib nanoparticles (LSS NPs) have ultrahigh encapsulation efficiencies for sorafenib (&#8776;100%) and siRNA (&#8776;95%), which benefit from the accommodation of both fast and slow processes on the chip. Although carrying negative charges, LSS NPs enable cytosolic delivery of agents and high gene silencing efficiency within tumor cells. In vivo, the LSS NPs delivering hypoxia&#8208;induced factor (HIF1&#945;)&#8208;targeted siRNA efficiently regress tumors of Hep3B xenograft and hepatocellular carcinoma patient&#8208;derived primary cells xenograft (PDCX) and finally extend the average survival of PDCX mice to 68 days. Thus, this strategy is promising as a sorafenib/siRNA combination therapy, and MESA can be a universal platform for fabricating complex nanosystems.

         <title>Programmable Jigsaw Puzzles of Soft Materials Enabled by Pixelated Holographic Surface Reliefs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiscale optical jigsaw puzzles with tailored functions are established by programming pixelated holographic surface reliefs. The robust reliefs and stimuli&#8208;responsive&#160;liquid&#160;crystals&#160;(LCs) endow the optical jigsaw puzzles with broad spectral adaptability, unprecedented stability, and reliable durability, which builds up a new way for soft materials in adaptive flat optics.








Abstract
Manual intervention in the self&#8208;organization of soft matter to obtain a desired superstructure is a complex but significant project. Specifically, optical components made fully or partially from reconfigurable and stimuli&#8208;responsive soft materials, referred to as soft photonics, are poised to form versatile platforms in various areas; however, a limited scale, narrow spectral adaptability, and poor stability are still formidable challenges. Herein, a facile way is developed to program the optical jigsaw puzzle of nematic liquid crystals via pixelated holographic surface reliefs, leading to an era of manufacturing for programmable soft materials with tailored functions. Multiscale jigsaw puzzles are established and endowed with unprecedented stability and durability, further sketching a prospective framework toward customized adaptive photonic architectures. This work demonstrates a reliable and efficient approach for directly assembling soft matter, unlocking the long&#8208;sought full potential of stimuli&#8208;responsive soft systems, and providing opportunities to inspire the next generation of soft photonics and relevant areas.

         <title>Ambient Electrosynthesis toward Single&#8208;Atom Sites for Electrocatalytic Green Hydrogen Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress in ambient electrosynthesis toward single&#8208;atom sites ranging from nonprecious Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, V, Cr, Mn, Sn, Pd, and Bi to noble Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au for green hydrogen cycling is reviewed, and further opportunities are discussed. Three electrosynthesis strategies including electrochemical etching, direct electrodeposition, and electrochemical leaching&#8211;redeposition&#160;are&#160;summarized.








Abstract
With the ultimate atomic utilization, well&#8208;defined configuration of active sites and unique electronic properties, catalysts with single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) exhibit appealing performance for electrocatalytic green hydrogen generation from water splitting and further utilization via hydrogen&#8211;oxygen fuel cells, such that a vast majority of synthetic strategies toward SAS&#8208;based catalysts (SASCs) are exploited. In particular, room&#8208;temperature electrosynthesis under atmospheric pressure offers a novel, safe, and effective route to access SASs. Herein, the recent progress in ambient electrosynthesis toward SASs for electrocatalytic sustainable hydrogen generation and utilization, and future opportunities are discussed. A systematic summary is started on three kinds of ambient electrochemically synthetic routes for SASs, including electrochemical etching (ECE), direct electrodeposition (DED), and electrochemical leaching&#8211;redeposition (ELR), associated with advanced characterization techniques. Next, their electrocatalytic applications for hydrogen energy conversion including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, and oxygen reduction reaction are reviewed. Finally, a brief conclusion and remarks&#160;on future challenges regarding further development of ambient electrosynthesis of high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective SASCs for many other electrocatalytic applications are presented.

&lt;p&gt;The recent progress in ambient electrosynthesis toward single-atom sites ranging from nonprecious Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, V, Cr, Mn, Sn, Pd, and Bi to noble Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au for green hydrogen cycling is reviewed, and further opportunities are discussed. Three electrosynthesis strategies including electrochemical etching, direct electrodeposition, and electrochemical leaching&#8211;redeposition&#160;are&#160;summarized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the ultimate atomic utilization, well-defined configuration of active sites and unique electronic properties, catalysts with single-atom sites (SASs) exhibit appealing performance for electrocatalytic green hydrogen generation from water splitting and further utilization via hydrogen&#8211;oxygen fuel cells, such that a vast majority of synthetic strategies toward SAS-based catalysts (SASCs) are exploited. In particular, room-temperature electrosynthesis under atmospheric pressure offers a novel, safe, and effective route to access SASs. Herein, the recent progress in ambient electrosynthesis toward SASs for electrocatalytic sustainable hydrogen generation and utilization, and future opportunities are discussed. A systematic summary is started on three kinds of ambient electrochemically synthetic routes for SASs, including electrochemical etching (ECE), direct electrodeposition (DED), and electrochemical leaching&#8211;redeposition (ELR), associated with advanced characterization techniques. Next, their electrocatalytic applications for hydrogen energy conversion including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, overall water splitting, and oxygen reduction reaction are reviewed. Finally, a brief conclusion and remarks&#160;on future challenges regarding further development of ambient electrosynthesis of high-performance and cost-effective SASCs for many other electrocatalytic applications are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanozymes: Definition, Activity, and Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking a historical perspective, the definition, catalytic activity, and mechanism of nanozymes are compared with enzymes. Immobilized catalysts and catalytic nanomaterials are two types of nanozymes, and the field has benefited from the name of nanozyme to endeavor replacement of enzymes with catalytic nanomaterials for analytical, environmental, and biomedical applications.








Abstract
&#8220;Nanozyme&#8221; is used to describe various catalysts from immobilized inorganic metal complexes, immobilized enzymes to inorganic nanoparticles. Here, the history of nanozymes is dvescribed in detail, and they can be largely separated into two types. Type 1 nanozymes refer to immobilized catalysts or enzymes on nanomaterials, which&#160;were&#160;dominant in the first decade since 2004. Type 2 nanozymes, which rely on the surface catalytic properties of inorganic nanomaterials, are the dominating type in the past decade. The definition of nanozymes is evolving, and a definition based on the same substrates and products as enzymes are able to cover most currently claimed nanozymes, although they may have different mechanisms compared to their enzyme counterparts. A broader definition can inspire application&#8208;based research to replace enzymes with nanomaterials for analytical, environmental, and biomedical applications. Comparison with enzymes also requires a clear definition of a nanozyme unit. Four ways of defining a nanozyme unit are described, with iron oxide and horseradish peroxidase activity comparison as examples in each definition. Growing work is devoted to understanding the&#160;catalytic mechanism of nanozymes, which provides a basis for further rational engineering of active sites. Finally, future perspective of the nanozyme field is discussed.

         <title>Direct Synthessis of Ammonia From Nitrate On Amorphous Graphene With Near 100% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ammonia is an indispensable commodity in the agricultural and pharmaceutical industries. Direct nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electroreduction is a decentralized route yet challenged by competing side reactions. Most of the catalysts are metal&#8208;based, and metal&#8208;free catalyst with high nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion activity is rarely reported. Herein, we show that amorphous graphene synthesized by laser induction and comprising strained and disordered pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons can electrocatalyze the eight&#8208;electron reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 with a Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;100% and an ammonia production rate of 2859 &#956;g/cm2/h at &#8211;0.93 V versus RHE. X&#8208;ray pair distribution function analysis and electron microscopy reveal the unique molecular features of amorphous graphene that facilitate NO3&#8722; reduction. In&#8208;situ FTIR spectroscopy and theoretical calculations establish the critical role of these features in stabilizing reaction intermediates via structural relaxation. The enhanced catalytic activity enables the implementation of flow electrolysis for the on&#8208;demand synthesis and release of ammonia with &gt;70% selectivity, resulting in significantly increased yields and survival rates when applied to plant cultivation. The results of this study show significant promise for remediating nitrate&#8208;polluted water and completing the NOx cycle.

         <title>Lead (II) 2&#8208;Ethylhexanoate for Simultaneous Modulated Crystallization and Surface Shield to Boost Perovskite Solar Cell Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The bulk and surface of a perovskite light harvesting layer are two pivotal aspects affecting its carrier transport and long&#8208;term stability. In this work, lead (II) 2&#8208;ethylhexanoate (LDE) is introduced via an antisolvent process into the perovskite films to change the reaction kinetics of the crystallization process, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Meanwhile, the carboxyl functional group with a long alkyl chain coordinates with Pb cation, reducing the defect density related to unsaturated Pb atoms. Moreover, the long alkyl chains form a protecting layer at the surface of the perovskite film to prevent chemical attack by water and air, prolonging the lifetime of perovskite devices. Consequently, the assembled device demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.84%. Both of the thermal and operational stability are significantly improved due to reduced ion migration channels.

         <title>Unconventional giant &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; in bosonic semiconducting diamond nanorings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in doped insulators such as cuprates and pnictides coincides with their doping&#8208;driven insulator&#8208;metal transitions. Above the critical doping threshold, a metallic state sets in at high temperatures, while superconductivity sets in at low temperatures. A hitherto unanswered question is whether the formation of Cooper pairs in a well&#8208;established metal will inevitably transform the host material into a superconductor, as manifested by a resistance drop. Here, this question is addressed by investigating the electrical transport in nanoscale rings (full loops) and half loops manufactured from heavily boron&#8208;doped diamond. It is shown that in contrast to the half&#8208;loops exhibiting a metal&#8208;superconductor transition, the diamond nanorings demonstrate a sharp resistance increase up to 430% and a giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221; below the superconducting transition temperature of the starting material. The finding of the unconventional giant negative &#8220;magnetoresistance&#8221;, as distinct from existing categories of magnetoresistance, i.e., the conventional giant magnetoresistance in magnetic multilayers, the colossal magnetoresistance in perovskites, and the geometric magnetoresistance in semiconductor&#8208;metal hybrids, reveals the transformation of the diamond nanorings from metals to bosonic semiconductors upon the formation of Cooper pairs. Diamond nanorings like these could be used to manipulate the motion of Cooper pairs in superconducting quantum devices.

         <title>Gelatin&#8208;based Ingestible Impedance Sensor to Evaluate Gastrointestinal Epithelial Barriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Low&#8208;profile and transient ingestible electronics capsules for diagnostics and therapeutics could replace widely used yet invasive procedures such as endoscopies. Several gastrointestinal diseases such as reflux disease, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel syndrome, and eosinophilic esophagitis result in increased intercellular dilation in epithelial barriers. Currently, the primary method of diagnosing and monitoring epithelial barrier integrity is via endoscopic tissue biopsies followed by histological imaging. In this work, w e propose a gelatin&#8208;based ingestible electronic capsule that can monitor epithelial barriers via electrochemical impedance measurements. Toward this end, w e describe materials&#8208;specific transfer printing methodologies to manufacture soft gelatin&#8208;based electronics, an in vitro synthetic disease model to validate impedance&#8208;based sensing, and tests of capsules using ex vivo using porcine esophageal tissue. The technologies described herein could advances next generation of oral diagnostic devices that reduce invasiveness and improve convenience for patients.

Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials with strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy have attracted significant interest as the long&#8208;range magnetic order in these systems can survive even when their thicknesses is reduced to two&#8208;dimensional (2D) limit. Even though the interlayer coupling between the neighboring magnetic layers is very weak, it has a determining effect on the magnetism of these atomic&#8208;thickness materials. Herein, we report a new 2D ferromagnetic material, namely, non&#8208;vdW CuCrSe2 nanosheet with even&#8208;odd&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism when laminated from an antiferromagnetic bulk. Monolayer and even&#8208;layer CuCrSe2 exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and a significantly enhanced magnetic ordering temperature of more than 125 K. In contrast, the linear Hall effect exists in the odd&#8208;layer samples. Theoretical calculations indicate that the layer&#8208;dependent magnetic coupling is attributable to the orbital shift of the Cr atoms in the CrSe2 layers owing to the Cu&#8208;induced breaking of the centrosymmetry. Thus, this work sheds light on the exotic magnetic properties of layered materials that exhibit phenomena beyond weak interlayer interactions.

&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials with strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy have attracted significant interest as the long-range magnetic order in these systems can survive even when their thicknesses is reduced to two-dimensional (2D) limit. Even though the interlayer coupling between the neighboring magnetic layers is very weak, it has a determining effect on the magnetism of these atomic-thickness materials. Herein, we report a new 2D ferromagnetic material, namely, non-vdW CuCrSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheet with even-odd-layer-dependent ferromagnetism when laminated from an antiferromagnetic bulk. Monolayer and even-layer CuCrSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit the anomalous Hall effect and a significantly enhanced magnetic ordering temperature of more than 125 K. In contrast, the linear Hall effect exists in the odd-layer samples.

         <title>Perovskite Grain&#8208;Boundary Manipulation Using Room&#8208;Temperature Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing &#8220;Ligaments&#8221; for Developing Highly Stable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.8% Efficiency</title>

Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) are the best candidates to complement traditional silicon SCs in portable power applications. However, their mechanical, operational, and ambient stabilities are still unable to meet the practical demands, because of the natural brittleness, residual tensile strain, and high defect density along the perovskite grain boundaries. To overcome these issues, we carefully developed a crosslinkable monomer TA&#8208;NI with dynamic covalent disulfide bonds, H&#8208;bonds, and ammonium. The crosslinking act as &#8220;ligaments&#8221; attached on the perovskite grain boundaries. These &#8220;ligaments&#8221; consisting of elastomers and 1D perovskites, can not only passivate the grain boundaries and enhance moisture resistance but also release the residual tensile strain and mechanical stress in 3D perovskite films. More importantly, the elastomer can repair bending&#8208;induced mechanical cracks in the perovskite film because of dynamic self&#8208;healing characteristics. The resultant flexible pero&#8208;SCs exhibited promising improvements in efficiency, and record values (23.84% and 21.66%) were obtained for 0.062&#8208;cm2&#8208; and 1.004&#8208;cm2&#8208;devices; the flexible devices also showed overall improved stabilities with T90 &gt; 20000 bending cycles, operational stability with T90 &gt; 1248&#160;h, and ambient stability (relative humidity = 30%) with T90 &gt; 3000&#160;h. This strategy paves a new way for the industrial&#8208;scale development of high&#8208;performance flexible pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Expanding Embedded 3D Bioprinting Capability for Engineering Complex Organs with Freeform Vascular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Creating functional tissues and organs in vitro on demand is a major goal in biofabrication, but the ability to replicate the external geometry of specific organs and their internal structures such as blood vessels simultaneously remains one of the greatest impediments. Here, we address this limitation by developing a generalizable bioprinting strategy of sequential printing in a reversible ink template (SPIRIT). We demonstrated that our microgel&#8208;based biphasic (MB) bioink can be used as both an excellent bioink and a suspension medium that supports embedded 3D printing due to its shear&#8208;thinning and self&#8208;healing behavior. When encapsulating human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), the MB bioink was 3D printed to generate cardiac tissues and organoids by extensive stem cell proliferation and cardiac differentiation. By incorporating MB bioink, the SPIRIT strategy enabled the effective printing of a ventricle model with a perfusable vascular network, which is not possible to fabricate using extant 3D printing strategies. Our SPIRIT technique offers an unparalleled bioprinting capability to replicate the complex organ geometry and internal structure in a faster manner, which would accelerate the biofabrication and therapeutic applications of tissue and organ constructs.

         <title>Giant Exchange Bias&#8208;Like Effect at Low Cooling Fields Induced by Pinned Magnetic Domains in Y2NiIrO6 Double Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Exchange bias is highly desirable for widespread technologies. Generally conventional exchange bias heterojunctions require excessively large cooling fields for sufficient bias fields, which are generated by pinned spins at the interface of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic layers. It is crucial for applicability to obtain considerable exchange bias fields with minimum cooling fields. Here we report an exchange bias&#8208;like effect in a double perovskite, Y2NiIrO6, which shows long&#8208;range ferrimagnetic ordering below 192 K. It manifests a giant bias&#8208;like field of 1.1 T with a cooling field of only 15&#160;Oe at 5 K. The robust phenomenon appears below 170 K. This fascinating bias&#8208;like effect is the secondary effect of the vertical shifts of the magnetic loops, which is attributed to the pinned magnetic domains due to the combination of strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling on Ir, and antiferromagnetically coupled Ni&#8208; and Ir&#8208;sublattices. The pinned moments in Y2NiIrO6 are present throughout the full volume, not just at the interface as in conventional bilayer systems.

         <title>Ion&#8208;transfer engineering via Janus hydrogels enables ultra&#8208;high performance and salt&#8208;resistant solar desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Emerging solar interfacial evaporation offers the most promising response to the severe freshwater crisis. However, the most challenging bottleneck has been the conflict between resisting salt accumulation and maintaining high evaporation performance since conventional salt&#8208;resistant evaporators enhance water flow to remove salt, leading to tremendous heat loss. Herein, we propose an ion&#8208;transfer engineering via a Janus ion&#8208;selective hydrogel that enables ion electromigration salt removal, breaking the historical dependence on water convection, and significantly lowering the heat loss. The hydrogels drive cations downward and anions upward, away from the evaporation surfaces. It establishes an electrical potential inside the evaporator and stably removes salt in 15wt% brine throughout seven days. A record&#8208;high evaporation rate of 6.86&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 in 15wt% brine, 2.5 times the previously reported works, is achieved. With the from&#8208;scratch salt&#8208;resistant route, comprehensive water&#8208;thermal analysis, and record&#8208;high performance, this work holds great potential for the future salt&#8208;resistant evaporator.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Wall Engineering Enabled Thermal Modulation in PMN&#8208;PT Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Acting like thermal resistances, ferroelectric domain walls can be manipulated to realize dynamic modulation of thermal conductivity (k), which is essential for developing novel phononic circuits. Despite the interest, little attention has been paid to achieve room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in bulk materials due to challenges in obtaining a high thermal conductivity switch ratio (khigh/klow), particularly in commercially viable materials. Here, we demonstrate room&#8208;temperature thermal modulation in 2.5&#160;mm&#8208;thick Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8208;xPbTiO3 (PMN&#8208;xPT) single crystals. With the use of advanced poling conditions, assisted by the systematic study on composition and orientation dependence of PMN&#8208;xPT, we observed a range of thermal conductivity switch ratios with a maximum &#8776;1.27. Simultaneous measurements of piezoelectric coefficient (d33) to characterize the poling state, domain wall density using polarized light microscopy (PLM) and birefringence change using quantitative PLM reveal that compared to the unpoled state, the domain wall density at intermediate poling states (0&lt; d33&lt; d33,max) is lower due to the enlargement in domain size. At optimized poling conditions (d33,max), the domain sizes show increased inhomogeneity that leads to enhancement in the domain wall density. This work highlights the potential of commercially available PMN&#8208;xPT single crystals among other relaxor&#8208;ferroelectrics for achieving temperature control in solid&#8208;state devices.

Simultaneous measurements of piezoelectric coefficient (d&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;) to characterize the poling state, domain wall density using polarized light microscopy (PLM) and birefringence change using quantitative PLM reveal that compared to the unpoled state, the domain wall density at intermediate poling states (0&amp;lt; d&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt; d&lt;sub&gt;33,max&lt;/sub&gt;) is lower due to the enlargement in domain size. At optimized poling conditions (d&lt;sub&gt;33,max&lt;/sub&gt;), the domain sizes show increased inhomogeneity that leads to enhancement in the domain wall density. This work highlights the potential of commercially available PMN-&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;PT single crystals among other relaxor-ferroelectrics for achieving temperature control in solid-state devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Advanced Nonflammable Organic Electrolyte Promises Safer Li&#8208;Metal Batteries: From Solvation Structure Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonflammable organic electrolytes are very promising to address the safety issue facing Li&#8208;metal batteries. Several types of nonflammable organic electrolytes are reviewed from the perspective of solvation structure. The analysis of solvation structure provides insight into the nonflammability and the mechanism for Li&#8208;dendrite suppression. Finally, future guidelines for designing nonflammable electrolyte are provided.








Abstract
Batteries with a Li&#8208;metal anode have recently attracted extensive attention from the battery communities owing to their high energy density. However, severe dendrite growth hinders their practical applications. More seriously, when Li dendrites pierce the separators and trigger short circuit in a highly flammable organic electrolyte, the results would be catastrophic. Although the issues of growth of Li dendrites have been almost addressed by various methods, the highly flammable nature of conventional organic liquid electrolytes is still a lingering fear facing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;metal batteries given the possibility of thermal runaway of the high&#8208;voltage cathode. Recently, various kinds of nonflammable liquid&#8208; or solid&#8208;state electrolytes have shown great potential toward safer Li&#8208;metal batteries with minimal detrimental effect on the battery performance or even enhanced electrochemical performance. In this review, recent advances in developing nonflammable electrolyte for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;metal batteries including high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte, fluorinated electrolyte, ionic liquid electrolyte, and polymer electrolyte are summarized. Then, the solvation structure of different kinds of nonflammable liquid and polymer electrolytes are analyzed to provide insight into the mechanism for dendrite suppression and fire extinguishing. Finally, guidelines for future design of nonflammable electrolyte for safer Li&#8208;metal batteries are provided.

         <title>Curvature in Biological Systems: Its Quantification, Emergence, and Implications across the Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curvature as a local descriptor for shape has been revealed to play a fundamental role in the development of biological systems. Advanced 3D characterization methods allow its quantification across time and length scales indicating that cells and tissue growth can cause emergence of curved surfaces but in turn curvature also acts as a trigger for specific biological processes.








Abstract
Surface curvature both emerges from, and influences the behavior of, living objects at length scales ranging from cell&#160;membranes to single cells to tissues and organs. The relevance of surface curvature in biology is supported by numerous experimental and theoretical investigations in recent years. In this review, first, a brief introduction to the key ideas of surface curvature in the context of biological systems is given and the challenges that arise when measuring surface curvature are discussed. Giving an overview of the emergence of curvature in biological systems, its significance at different length scales becomes apparent. On the other hand, summarizing current findings also shows that both single cells and entire cell sheets, tissues or organisms respond to curvature by modulating their shape and their migration behavior. Finally, the interplay between the distribution of morphogens or micro&#8208;organisms and the emergence of curvature across length scales is addressed with examples demonstrating these key mechanistic principles of morphogenesis. Overall, this review highlights that curved interfaces are not merely a passive by&#8208;product of the chemical, biological, and mechanical processes but that curvature acts also as a signal that co&#8208;determines these processes.

         <title>Technological Breakthroughs in Chip Fabrication, Transfer, and Color Conversion for High&#8208;Performance Micro&#8208;LED Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Technical issues in integration of full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LED display, in the aspects of quantum efficiency, mass transfer technique, and color conversion technique, are reviewed. Various approaches for improving quantum efficiency of device along with methods of massively and accurately transferring them to a target substrate are discussed. Color conversion techniques and their deposition methods of quantum dots on micro&#8208;LEDs are introduced.








Abstract
The implementation of high&#8208;efficiency and high&#8208;resolution displays has been the focus of considerable research interest. Recently, micro light&#8208;emitting diodes (micro&#8208;LEDs), which are inorganic light&#8208;emitting diodes of size &lt;100&#8201;&#181;m2, have emerged as a promising display technology owing to their superior features and advantages over other displays like liquid crystal displays and organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Although many companies have introduced micro&#8208;LED displays since 2012, obstacles to mass production still exist. Three major challenges, i.e., low quantum efficiency, time&#8208;consuming transfer, and complex color conversion, have been overcome with technological breakthroughs to realize cost&#8208;effective micro&#8208;LED displays. In the review, methods for improving the degraded quantum efficiency of GaN&#8208;based micro&#8208;LEDs induced by the size effect are examined, including wet chemical treatment, passivation layer adoption, LED structure design, and growing LEDs in self&#8208;passivated structures. Novel transfer technologies, including pick&#8208;up transfer and self&#8208;assembly methods, for developing large&#8208;area micro&#8208;LED displays with high yield and reliability are discussed in depth. Quantum dots as color conversion materials for high color purity, and deposition methods such as electrohydrodynamic jet printing or contact printing on micro&#8208;LEDs are also addressed. This review presents current status and critical challenges of micro&#8208;LED technology and promising technical breakthroughs for commercialization of high&#8208;performance displays.

         <title>Tumor Cell Nanovaccines Based on Genetically Engineered Antibody&#8208;Anchored Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic design of universal nanovaccine platform is introduced by taking advantage of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived components and genetically engineered antibody&#8208;anchored membrane. The nanovaccines can be cross&#8208;presented on dendritic cells (DCs) to activate antigen&#8208;specific T cells. The incorporation of agonistic antibody anti&#8208;CD40 single chain variable fragment into the nanovaccines facilitates DC maturation, which in turn activates tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells.








Abstract
Despite the promise in whole&#8208;tumor cell vaccines, a key challenge is to overcome the lack of costimulatory signals. Here, agonistic&#8208;antibody&#8208;boosted tumor cell nanovaccines are reported by genetically engineered antibody&#8208;anchored membrane (AAM) technology, capable of effectively activating costimulatory pathways. Specifically, the AAM can be stably constructed following genetic engineering of tumor cell membranes with anti&#8208;CD40 single chain variable fragment (scFv), an agonistic antibody to induce costimulatory signals. The nanovaccines are versatilely designed and obtained based on the anti&#8208;CD40 scFv&#8208;anchored membrane and nanotechnology. Following vaccination, the anti&#8208;CD40 scFv&#8208;anchored membrane nanovaccine (Nano&#8208;AAM/CD40) significantly facilitates dendritic cell maturation in CD40&#8208;humanized transgenic mice and subsequent adaptive immune responses. Compared to membrane&#8208;based nanovaccines alone, the enhanced antitumor efficacy in both &#8220;hot&#8221; and &#8220;cold&#8221; tumor models of the Nano&#8208;AAM/CD40 demonstrates the importance of agonistic antibodies in development of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;based vaccines. To expand the design of nanovaccines, further incorporation of cell lysates into the Nano&#8208;AAM/CD40 to conceptually construct tumor cell&#8208;like nanovaccines results in boosted immune responses and improved antitumor efficacy against malignant tumors inoculated into CD40&#8208;humanized transgenic mice. Overall, this genetically engineered AAM technology provides a versatile design of nanovaccines by incorporation of tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;based components and agonistic antibodies of costimulatory immune checkpoints.

         <title>A Neurospheroid&#8208;Based Microrobot for Targeted Neural Connections in a Hippocampal Slice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using an external rotating magnetic field, a magnetic neurospheroid consisting of primary hippocampal neurons and superparamagnetic nanoparticles can be precisely delivered to the target area in an ex vivo brain slice, where the neurospheroid subsequently establishes structural and functional neuronal connectivity. This method can be used to examine ex vivo functional neuronal connections and neuronal regeneration processes.








Abstract
Functional restoration by the re&#8208;establishment of cellular or neural connections remains a major challenge in targeted cell therapy and regenerative medicine. Recent advances in magnetically powered microrobots have shown potential for use in controlled and targeted cell therapy. In this study, a magnetic neurospheroid (Mag&#8208;Neurobot) that can form both structural and functional connections with an organotypic hippocampal slice (OHS) is assessed using an ex vivo model as a bridge toward in vivo application. The Mag&#8208;Neurobot consists of hippocampal neurons and superparamagnetic nanoparticles (SPIONs); it is precisely and skillfully manipulated by an external magnetic field. Furthermore, the results of patch&#8208;clamp recordings of hippocampal neurons indicate that neither the neuronal excitabilities nor the synaptic functions of SPION&#8208;loaded cells are significantly affected. Analysis of neural activity propagation using high&#8208;density multi&#8208;electrode arrays shows that the delivered Mag&#8208;Neurobot is functionally connected with the OHS. The applications of this study include functional verification for targeted cell delivery through the characterization of novel synaptic connections and the functionalities of transported and transplanted cells. The success of the Mag&#8208;Neurobot opens up new avenues of research and application; it offers a test platform for functional neural connections and neural regenerative processes through cell transplantation.

         <title>Stabilization of the Alkylammonium Cations in Halide Perovskite Thin Films by Water&#8208;Mediated Proton Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkylammonium in the form of CH3NH3+ is produced in the reaction between CH3NH2 and dissociated 2H2O molecules via the catalytic halide anion in a hybrid perovskite precursor. This stabilization of alkylammonium is largely dependent on the quantity of the ionized halide additive and its proton affinity. Consequently, the stabilized alkylammonium can produce stable and more ordered organic&#8211;inorganic metal trihalide perovskite crystals.








Abstract
The development of alkylammonium lead trihalide perovskite (ALHP) photovoltaics has grown rapidly over the past decade. However, there are remaining critical challenges, such as proton defects, which can lead to the material instability of ALHPs. Although specific strategies, including the use of halide additives, have significantly reduced the defects, a fundamental understanding of the defect passivation mechanism remains elusive. Herein, an approach and mechanism for minimizing proton defects in ALHP crystals by adding ionized halides to the perovskite precursor solution are reported. This work clarifies that the ionized halides induced proton transfer from H2O to the alkylammonium cation in the precursor solution, stabilizing the ALHP crystals. The fundamental characteristics of ALHP and its precursors are examined by X&#8208;ray diffraction, transmittance electron microscopy, in situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, Fourier&#160;transform NMR spectroscopy, and Fourier&#160;transform infrared spectroscopy. The findings from this work will guide the development of highly stable ALHP crystals, enabling efficient and stable optoelectronic ALHP devices.

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Based Therapeutic Antioxidants for Biomedical Applications</title>

Abstract
The growing interest in nanomedicine over the last 20 years has carved out a research field called &#8220;nanocatalytic therapy&#8221;, where catalytic reactions mediated by nanomaterials are employed to intervene in disease&#8208;critical biomolecular processes. Among many kinds of catalytic/enzyme&#8208;mimetic nanomaterials investigated thus far, ceria nanoparticles stand out from others owing to their unique scavenging properties against biologically noxious free radicals, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), by exerting enzyme mimicry and non&#8208;enzymatic activities. Many efforts have been made to utilize ceria nanoparticles as self&#8208;regenerating anti&#8208;oxidative and anti&#8208;inflammatory agents for various kinds of diseases, given the detrimental effects of ROS and RNS therein that need alleviation. In this context, this review is intended to provide an overview as to what makes ceria nanoparticles merit attention in disease therapy. The introductory part describes the characteristics of ceria nanoparticles as an oxygen&#8208;deficient metal oxide. The pathophysiological roles of ROS and RNS are then presented, as well as their scavenging mechanisms by ceria nanoparticles. Representative examples of recent ceria nanoparticle&#8208;based therapeutics are summarized by categorization into organ and disease types, followed by the discussion on the remaining challenges and future research directions.

         <title>Spin&#8208;resolved imaging of antiferromagnetic order in Fe4Se5 ultrathin films on SrTiO3</title>

Abstract
Unraveling the magnetic order in iron chalcogenides and pnictides at atomic scale is pivotal for understanding their unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism, but is experimentally challenging. Here, by utilizing spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, we successfully resolve real&#8208;space spin contrasts exhibiting atomically unidirectional stripes in Fe4Se5 ultrathin films, the plausible closely&#8208;related compound of bulk FeSe with ordered Fe&#8208;vacancies, which are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. As is substantiated with the first&#8208;principles electronic structure calculations, the spin contrast originates from a pair&#8208;checkerboard antiferromagnetic ground state with in&#8208;plane magnetization, which is modulated by a spin&#8208;lattice coupling. Our measurements further identify three types of nanoscale antiferromagnetic domains with distinguishable spin contrasts, which are subject to thermal fluctuations into short&#8208;ranged patches at elevated temperatures. Our work provides promising opportunities in understanding the emergent magnetic order and the electronic phase diagram for the FeSe&#8208;derived superconductors.

         <title>Fibro&#8208;gel: An All&#8208;aqueous Hydrogel Consisting of Microfibers with Tunable Release Profile and its Application in Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Injectable hydrogels are valuable tools in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to the unique advantages of injectability with minimal invasiveness and usability for irregularly shaped sites. However, it remains challenging to achieve scalable manufacturing together with matching physicochemical properties and on&#8208;demand drug release for a high level of control over biophysical and biomedical cues to direct endogenous cells. Here, we demonstrate the use of an injectable fibro&#8208;gel, a water&#8208;filled network of entangled hydrogel microfibers, whose physicochemical properties and drug release profiles can be tailored to overcome these shortcomings. This fibro&#8208;gel exhibits favorable in vitro biocompatibility and the capability to aid vascularization. The potential use of the fibro&#8208;gel for advancing tissue regeneration is explored with a mice excision skin model. Preliminary in vivo tests indicate that the fibro&#8208;gel promotes wound healing with a faster rate of new tissue regeneration and the appearance of de novo regenerated healthy tissue when compared with a commercial gel. Moreover, we demonstrate that the release of distinct drugs at different rates can further accelerate wound healing with higher efficiency by using a two&#8208;layer fibro&#8208;gel model. The combination of injectability and tailorable properties of this fibro&#8208;gel offers a promising approach in biomedical fields such as therapeutic delivery, medical dressings, and 3D tissue scaffolds for tissue engineering.

         <title>All&#8208;Printed Roll to Roll Perovskite Photovoltaics Enabled by Solution Processed Carbon Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics have shown great promise in device efficiency but also the promise of scalability through solution&#8208;processed manufacture. Efforts to scale perovskites have been taken through printable mesoporous scaffolds and slot die coating of flexible substrates roll to roll. However, to date there has been no demonstration of entirely roll to roll coated devices due to the lack of a compatible solution processable back electrode instead high value evaporated metal contacts are employed as a post process. Here in this study, the combination of a low&#8208;temperature device structure and roll to roll compatible solution formulations have been employed to make a fully roll to roll printable device architecture overcoming interlayer incompatibilities and recombination losses. Therefore, the n&#8208;i&#8208;p device structure of SnO2/Perovskite/PEDOT/Carbon was employed to form an ohmic contact between a p type semiconductor and printable carbon electrode. In particular, the results show that the small&#8208;scale device efficiencies of 13&#8211;14% are achieved matching the device performance of evaporated gold electrodes. Also, this entirely roll to roll coated perovskite prototype represents a game changer, reaching over 10% (10.8) stabilised PCE with unencapsulated long&#8208;term stability retaining 84% of its original efficiency over 1000 hours under 70% RH and 25&#176;C.

Also, this entirely roll to roll coated perovskite prototype represents a game changer, reaching over 10% (10.8) stabilised PCE with unencapsulated long-term stability retaining 84% of its original efficiency over 1000 hours under 70% RH and 25&#176;C.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Extracting Polaron Recombination from Electroluminescence in Organic Light&#8208;emitting Diodes by Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Direct exploring the electroluminescence (EL) of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) is a challenge due to the complicated processes of polarons, excitons, and their interactions. This study demonstrated the extraction of the polaron dynamics from transient EL by predicting the recombination coefficient via artificial intelligence, overcoming multivariable kinetics problems. The performance of a machine learning (ML) model trained by various EL decay curves was significantly improved using a novel featurization method and input node optimization, achieving an R2 value of 0.947. The optimized ML model successfully predicted the recombination coefficients of actual OLEDs based on an exciplex&#8208;forming cohost, enabling the quantitative understanding of the overall polaron behavior under various electrical excitation conditions.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Regulation of Microenvironment of Ni(II)&#8208;Porphyrin Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Accurately regulating the microenvironments around active sites is an important approach for boosting the overall water splitting performance of bifunctional electrocatalyst that can drive both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the same electrolyte. Herein, pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins (o&#8208;NiTPyP, m&#8208;NiTPyP and p&#8208;NiTPyP) with pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atoms located at ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208; or para&#8208;position are prepared and used as model catalyst for alkaline water splitting. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atom positions can regulate the microenvironment around active sites and the adsorption free energy of H&#8208;donating substances by affecting the H&#8208;bonding interaction and the N&#8211;Ni&#8211;N bond angles of active sites, and thus those pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins deliver better electrocatalytic activity than the Ni(II)&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin (NiTPP) without pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atoms. Among which, m&#8208;NiTPyP on carbon nanotubes delivers the lowest overpotentials of 267 and 138&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER and HER, respectively. Specifically, m&#8208;NiTPyP as bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline electrolyzer requires only 1.62&#160;V to drive efficient overall water splitting at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 while remaining durability. This work proposes a new H&#8208;bond regulating approach of microenvironment of electrocatalysts for effectively boosting the overall water splitting activity and deeply understanding its related mechanism.

         <title>Functional Ultrathin Separators Proactively Stabilizing Zinc Anodes for Zinc&#8208;Based Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrathin separators are indispensable to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but their easy failure caused by zinc dendrites poses a great challenge. Herein, we report 23&#160;&#956;m&#8208;thick functional ultrathin separators (FUSs), realizing superb electrochemical stability of zinc anodes and outstanding long&#8208;term durability of ultrathin separators. In the FUSs, an ultrathin but mechanically&#8208;strong nanoporous membrane substrate benefits fast and flux&#8208;homogenized Zn2+ transport, while a MOF&#8208;derived C/Cu nanocomposite decoration layer provides rich low&#8208;barrier zinc nucleation sites, thereby synergistically stabilizing zinc anodes to inhibit zinc dendrites and dendrite&#8208;caused separator failure. Investigation of the zinc affinity of the MOF&#8208;derived C/Cu nanocomposites unravels the high zincophilicity of heteroatom&#8208;containing C/Cu interfaces. Zinc anodes coupled with the FUSs present superior electrochemical stability, whose operation lifetime exceeds 2000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA/cm2 and 600&#160;h at 10&#160;mA/cm2, 40&#8211;50 times longer than that of the zinc anodes using glass fiber separators. The reliability of the FUSs in ZIBs and zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors is also validated. This work proposes a new strategy to stabilize zinc anodes and provides theoretical guidance in developing ultrathin separators for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;based energy storage.

         <title>Prioritizing Hetero&#8208;Metallic Interfaces via Thermodynamics Inertia and Kinetics Zincophilia Metrics for Tough Zn&#8208;based Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Poor thermodynamic stability and sluggish electrochemical kinetics of metallic Zn anode in aqueous solution greatly hamper its practical application. To solve such problems, to date, various zincophilic surface modification strategies have been developed, which can facilitate reversible Zn plating/stripping behavior. However, there is still a lack of systematic and fundamental understanding regarding the metrics of thermodynamics inertia and kinetics zincophilia in selecting zincophilic sites. Herein, w e prioritize hetero&#8208;metallic interfaces for the first time via optimizing different hetero metals (Fe, Co, Ni, Sn, Bi, Cu, Zn, etc.) and synthetic solvents (ethanol, ethylene glycol, n&#8208;propanol, etc.). Specifically, both theoretical simulations and experimental results suggest that this Bi@Zn interface can exhibit high efficiency owing to the thermodynamics inertia and kinetics zincophilia. A best practice for prioritizing zincophilic sites in a more practical metric is also proposed. As a proof of concept, the Bi@Zn anode delivers ultralow overpotential of ca. 55&#160;mV at a high rate of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stable cycle life over 4700 cycles. The elaborated &#8220;thermodynamics inertia and kinetics metalphilia&#8221; metrics for hetero&#8208;metallic interfaces could benchmark the success of other metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Multivalent Nanobody Conjugate with Rigid, Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Scaffold for Multi&#8208;Target Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Efficient therapeutic strategies that concurrently target both A&#946; aggregation and oxidative stress in the AD microenvironment emerge as a cutting&#8208;edge tool to combat the intricate pathogenesis of AD. Here we develop a multivalent nanobody conjugate with rigid, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging scaffold to achieve simultaneous A&#946; amyloidogenesis mitigation, ROS elimination, and A&#946; plaque clearance. Grafting A&#946; segment (33&#8208;GLMVGGVVIA&#8208;42) into the third complementary&#8208;determining region of a parent nanobody generates an engineered nanobody NB that can recognize A&#946; and inhibit its aggregation through homotypic interactions. NB is further genetically modified with a fragment of human interleukin&#8208;1&#946; (163&#8208;VQGEESNDK&#8208;171), so that the obtained fusion nanobody NBIL can also facilitate the A&#946; clearance by microglia. Linking NBIL covalently onto a rigid, ROS scavenging scaffold poly(deca&#8208;4,6&#8208;diynedioic acid) (PDDA) creates the multivalent nanobody conjugate PNBIL, which not only boosts the binding affinity between NBIL and A&#946; aggregates for nearly 100 times but also possesses a long&#8208;term capability of oxidative stress alleviation, inflammation reduction, and neuron protection. PNBIL has significantly attenuated symptoms on two AD mouse models through amyloidogenesis inhibition and AD microenvironment modulation, validating that our multivalent nanobody conjugate design based on combinatory nanobody and molecular engineering is a promising approach of multi&#8208;target therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Tetramode Metamaterials as Phonon Polarizers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In classical Cauchy elasticity, three&#8208;dimensional materials exhibit six eigenmodes of deformation. Following the 1995 work of Milton and Cherkaev, extremal elastic materials can be classified by the number of eigenmodes, N, out of these six that are &#8220;easy&#8221;. Using Greek number words, this leads to hexamode (N&#8197; = &#8197;6), pentamode (N&#8197; = &#8197;5), tetramode (N&#8197; = &#8197;4), trimode (N&#8197; = &#8197;3), dimode (N&#8197; = &#8197;2), and monomode (N&#8197; = &#8197;1) materials. While hexamode materials are unstable in all regards, the possibility of pentamode metamaterials (&#8220;meta&#8208;fluids&#8221;) has attracted considerable attention throughout the last decade. Here, inspired by the 2021 theoretical work of Wei, Liu, and Hu, microstructured three&#8208;dimensional polymer&#8208;based tetramode metamaterials are designed and characterized by numerical band&#8208;structure calculations, fabricated by laser printing, characterized by ultrasound experiments, and compared to the theoretical ideal. An application in terms of a compact and broadband polarizer for acoustical phonons at ultrasound frequencies is demonstrated.

         <title>Concerted redox&#8208; and light&#8208;activated agent for controlled multimodal therapy against hypoxic cancer cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hypoxia represents a remarkably exploitable target for cancer therapy as it is encountered only in solid human tumors and is highly associated with cancer resistance and recurrence. Here we report a hypoxia&#8208;activated mitochondrial&#8208;accumulated Ru(II) polypyridyl prodrug functionalized with conjugated azo (Az) and nitrogen mustard (NM) functionalities, RuAzNM. This prodrug has multimodal theranostic properties towards hypoxic cancer cells. Reduction of the azo group in hypoxic cell microenvironments gives rise to the generation of two primary amine products, a free aniline mustard, and the polypyridyl RuNH2 complex. Thus, aniline mustard triggers ROS generation and mtDNA crosslinking. Meanwhile, the resultant biologically&#8208;benign phosphorescent RuNH2 gives rise to a diagnostic signal and signals activation of the phototherapy. This multimodal therapeutic effect eventually elevates ROS levels, depletes NADH and ATP, and induces mitochondrial membrane damage, mtDNA damage, and ultimately cell apoptosis. This unique strategy allows controlled multimodal theranostics to be realized in hypoxic cells and multicellular spheroids, making RuAzNM a highly selective and effective cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective theranostic agent (IC50 = 2.3&#160;&#956;M for hypoxic HepG2 cancer cells versus 58.2&#160;&#956;M for normoxic THL&#8208;3 normal cells). This is the first report of a metal&#8208;based compound developed as a multimodal theranostic agent for hypoxia.

         <title>Strongly Correlated Exciton&#8208;Magnetization System for Optical Spin Pumping in CrBr3 and CrI3.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ferromagnetism in van der Waals systems, preserved down to a monolayer limit, attracted attention to a class of materials with general composition CrX3 (X=I, Br, Cl), which are treated now as canonical two&#8208;dimensional ferromagnets. Their diverse magnetic properties, such as different easy axes or varying and controllable character of in&#8208;plane or interlayer ferromagnetic coupling, make them promising candidates for spintronic, photonic, optoelectronic, and other applications. Still, significantly different magneto&#8208;optical properties between the three materials, have been presenting a challenging puzzle for researchers over the last few years. Herewith, we&#160;demonstrate that despite similar structural and magnetic configurations, the coupling between excitons and magnetization is qualitatively different in CrBr3 and CrI3 films. Through a combination of the optical spin pumping experiments with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theory describing bound excitonic states in the presence of magnetization, we&#160;concluded that the hole&#8208;magnetization coupling has the opposite sign in CrBr3 and CrI3 and also between the ground and excited exciton state. Consequently, we&#160;demonstrate efficient spin pumping capabilities in CrBr3 driven by magnetization via spin&#8208;dependent absorption and unraveled the different origins of the magnetic hysteresis in CrBr3 and CrI3.

         <title>Elastomers Grow into Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastomer that can grow automatically and finally becomes a soft actuator is presented. The whole process does not need energy input or external stimuli other than a single pre&#8208;stretch. The growth can output mechanical work. The material has an uncommon liquid crystal phase. The formation of soft actuators is associated with a usually unnoticed reaction.








Abstract
It is common knowledge that when an elastomer (rubber) is stretched, its length will be&#160;maintained if its two ends are fixed. Here, it is serendipitously found that when&#160;an elastomer is&#160;slowly elongated further to achieve buckling under such conditions, the final length is much longer than the pre&#8208;stretched length. This allows the design&#160;of untethered autonomous synthetic&#8208;material&#8208;based soft robots that do not need any other chemical or electrical energy sources or external stimuli after the pre&#8208;strain is installed. Once the growth starts, the elongation continues to proceed even when the applied force is removed. Moreover, the elastomer, after growing, eventually forms a robust soft actuator that can be reshaped for different purposes. Few synthetic materials can grow like this, so far. This investigation shows that the material has an uncommon liquid crystal phase. Contrary to normal liquid crystals, it becomes birefringent only at high temperatures. The formation and the reshaping of the resulting soft actuators relate to a usually unnoticed reversible reaction. The work is promising to promote further understanding of dynamic covalent chemistry and liquid crystal elastomers, as well as to foster new designs and high&#8208;impact applications of bioinspired sustainable soft actuators in areas other than soft robots.

         <title>Colloid Electrolyte with Changed Li+ Solvation Structure for High&#8208;Power, Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel colloid electrolyte constructs a weak Li+ solvation environment by introducing lithium thiocarbonate colloids to coordinate with solvents and anions competitively. Thus, the Li+ conductivity, desolvation process, and configuration of the&#160;cathode electrolyte interface are optimized. The enhanced interfacial Li+ transfer kinetics endow lithium&#8208;ion batteries with excellent fast charging/discharging capability and long lifespan at room and low temperatures.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries currently suffer from low capacity and fast degradation under fast charging and/or low temperatures. In&#160;this&#160;work, a colloid liquid electrolyte (CLE) is designed, where the trace amount of lithium thiocarbonate (LTC) colloids in commercial carbonate electrolyte (1&#160;m LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate) not only boosts up &#963;Li+ but also improves the Li+ transfer kinetics at LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA) cathode/electrolyte interface. The competitive coordination of LTCs with anions and solvents facilitates the dissociation of lithium salts and Li+ decoupling, dramatically enhancing the &#963;Li+ (15 to 4.5 mS cm&#8722;1 at 30 and &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, respectively); meanwhile, the desolvation process is accelerated. It demonstrates that LTC colloids induce an&#160;&#8776;5&#160;nm ultrathin Li2CO3&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interface&#160;and infuse the grain boundary of NCA particles, enhancing interfacial Li+ transfer and inhibiting the particle cracks during cycling. Consequently, the Li||CLE||NCA battery delivers a maximum capacity of 135 mAh g&#8722;1 at a 10 C rate with 80% retention after 2000 cycles. Moreover, the fast&#8208;charging capability under a sub&#8208;zero environment is proved (122 mAh g&#8722;1 with 90% retention after 400 cycles at 2 C and &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C). This strategy for tailoring the interfacial charge transfer appears generalizable and can practically be extended to next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.

This strategy for tailoring the interfacial charge transfer appears generalizable and can practically be extended to next-generation energy-storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Mott&#8208;Insulator&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Phase Transition in Ultrathin Intermediate&#8208;Spin Ferromagnetic Perovskite Ruthenates</title>

         <dc:description>
A&#160;photocarrier&#8208;doping&#8208;induced reversible Mott&#8208;insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal phase transition is realized by means of UV&#8208;light irradiation in a few atomic layers of intermediate&#8208;spin ferromagnetic SrRuO3&#8722;&#948;. Dynamical mean&#8208;field theory calculations further verify such photoinduced electronic phase transformation,&#160;owing to oxygen vacancies and orbital reconstruction. Therefore, a new intermediate&#8208;spin ferromagnetic metallic metastable phase of perovskite ruthenate is demonstrated.








Abstract
Light control of emergent quantum phenomena is a widely used external stimulus for quantum materials. Generally, perovskite strontium ruthenate SrRuO3 has an itinerant ferromagnetism with a low&#8208;spin state. However, the phase of intermediate&#8208;spin (IS) ferromagnetic metallic state has never been seen. Here, by means of UV&#8208;light irradiation, a photocarrier&#8208;doping&#8208;induced Mott&#8208;insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal phase transition is shown in a few atomic layers of perovskite IS ferromagnetic SrRuO3&#8722;&#948;. This new metastable IS metallic phase can be reversibly regulated due to the convenient photocharge transfer from SrTiO3 substrates to SrRuO3&#8722;&#948; ultrathin films. These dynamical mean&#8208;field theory calculations further verify such photoinduced electronic phase transformation, owing to oxygen vacancies and orbital reconstruction. The optical manipulation of charge&#8208;transfer finesse is an alternative pathway toward discovering novel metastable phases in strongly correlated systems and facilitates potential light&#8208;controlled device applications in optoelectronics and spintronics.

         <title>Interface Modulation of Metal Sulfide Anodes for Long&#8208;Cycle&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new capacity fading mechanism of metal sulfide electrode materials is discovered, that is, the parasitic reaction between electrolyte anions and metal sulfides. Herein, a universal strategy is proposed to manipulate the electrolyte decomposition and construct a stable and ion&#8208;conductive solid electrolyte interphase that prevents the corrosive side reactions and leads to prolonged cycle life.








Abstract
Although studies of transition metal sulfides (TMS) as anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries are extensively reported, the short cycle life is still a thorny problem that impedes their practical application. In this work, a new capacity fading mechanism of the TMS electrodes is demonstrated; that is, the parasitic reaction between electrolyte anions (i.e., ClO4&#8722;) and metal sulfides yields non&#8208;conductive and unstable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and meanwhile, corrosively turns metal sulfides into less&#8208;active oxides. This knowledge guides the development of an electrochemical strategy to manipulate the anion decomposition and construct a stable interface that prevents extensive parasitic reactions. It is shown that introducing sodium nitrate to the electrolyte radically changes the Na+ solvation structure by populating nitrate ions in the first solvation sheath, generating a stable and conductive SEI layer containing both Na3N and NaF. The optimized interface enables an iron sulfide anode to stably cycle for over 2000 cycles with negligible capacity loss, and a similar enhancement in cycle performance is demonstrated on a number of other metal sulfides. This work discloses metal sulfides&#8217; cycling failure mechanism from a unique perspective and highlights the critical importance of manipulating the interface chemistry in sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Membrane Protein Modification Modulates Big and Small Extracellular Vesicle Biodistribution and Tumorigenic Potential in Breast Cancers In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Big and small extracellular vesicles circulate differentially and confer tumorigenic function modulatable by extracellular vesicle (EV) membrane proteins. Malignant breast cancers release more big EVs, in addition to small EVs, than normal cells to target organs and individually promote tumor growth via tumor&#8208;progression&#8208;associated EV surface membrane proteins.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by cells to mediate intercellular communication under pathological and physiological conditions. While small EVs (sEVs; &lt;100&#8211;200&#160;nm, exosomes) are intensely investigated, the properties and functions of medium and large EVs (big EVs (bEVs); &gt;200&#160;nm, microvesicles) are less well explored. Here, bEVs and sEVs are identified as distinct EV populations, and it is determined that bEVs are released in a greater bEV:sEV ratio in the aggressive human triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. PalmGRET, bioluminescence&#8208;resonance&#8208;energy&#8208;transfer (BRET)&#8208;based EV reporter, reveals dose&#8208;dependent EV biodistribution at nonlethal and physiological EV dosages, as compared to lipophilic fluorescent dyes. Remarkably, the bEVs and sEVs exhibit unique biodistribution profiles, yet individually promote in vivo tumor growth in a syngeneic immunocompetent TNBC breast tumor murine model. The bEVs and sEVs share mass&#8208;spectrometry&#8208;identified tumor&#8208;progression&#8208;associated EV surface membrane proteins (tpEVSurfMEMs), which include solute carrier family 29 member 1, Cd9, and Cd44. tpEVSurfMEM depletion attenuates EV lung organotropism, alters biodistribution, and reduces protumorigenic potential. This study identifies distinct in vivo property and function of bEVs and sEVs in breast cancer, which suggest the significant role of bEVs in diseases, diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Pollen&#8208;Inspired Shell&#8211;Core Aerosol Particles Capable of Brownian Motion for Pulmonary Vascularization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by pollen in nature, novel shell&#8211;core aerosol particles capable of Brownian motion and immune evasion are constructed for respiratory administration. The aerosol particles disperse into the alveolar cavity by Brownian motion, implant in the alveolar interstitium by immune evasion, and activate angiogenic sprouting via the HIF&#8208;1 pathway, thus promoting bronchopulmonary development.








Abstract
Nebulization is the most widely used respiratory delivery technique with non&#8208;invasive properties. However, nebulized drugs often fail to function due to the excretion and immune clearance of the respiratory system. In&#160;this&#160;work, inspired by pollen in nature, novel shell&#8211;core aerosol particles (APs) capable of Brownian motion are constructed for respiratory delivery. Drugs&#8208;loaded poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) nanoparticles are prepared by emulsification to form the inner core, and the membranes of macrophages are extracted to form the outer shell. The optimized size and the shell&#8211;core structure endow APs with Brownian motion and atomization stability, thus enabling the APs to reach the bronchi and alveoli deeply for effective deposition. Camouflaging the&#160;macrophage membranes equips the APs with immune evasion. In vitro experiments prove that deferoxamine (DFO)&#8208;loaded APs (DFO@APs) can promote the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. A hyperoxia&#8208;induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) model is constructed to validate the efficiency of DFO@APs. In BPD mice, DFO@APs can release DFO in the alveolar interstitium, thus promoting the reconstruction of microvasculature, ultimately inducing lung development for treating BPD. In conclusion, this study develops &#8220;pollen&#8221;&#8208;inspired shell&#8211;core aerosol particles capable of Brownian motion, which provides a novel idea and theoretical basis for respiratory administration.

         <dc:description>
A high voltage endows cobalt oxides with stably acidic oxygen evolution on the surface of a&#160;MnO2 host material. MnO2 treated with molten salt possesses more cobalt deposition sites and therefore shows higher oxygen&#160;evolution&#160;reaction&#160;(OER) activity. The stable presence of CoO2 at 1.8&#160;V in the acid electrolyte is beneficial to high activity and stability for the&#160;OER. The exploration of applying high voltage to construct stable species in the&#160;Pourbaix diagram before they are exposed in an&#160;acidic environment proves the feasibility of this method to improve the stability of cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalyst, which provides a new perspective for the design of acidic non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The design and maintenance of highly active sites in an&#160;acidic environment is vital and challenging for the&#160;oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In&#160;this&#160;work, it is found that the obtained CoO2 under high applied potential can be stable on MnO2 host in acidic environment, which may act as an effective means to solve the instability of cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalyst. The significant improvement of acidic OER activity (6.9 times) and stability (46.4 times) of 90&#8208;Co&#8208;MnO2 (treated by molten salt with more Co deposition sites) demonstrates the advantages of this approach. In situ Raman and the&#160;Pourbaix diagram suggest that the enhanced performance derives from the stable presence of CoO2 at the voltage &gt;1.8&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). However, when the potential is &lt;1.8&#160;V, the corresponding other cobalt species is too unstable to facilitate the&#160;OER. Density functional theorycalculations reveal that the deposited cobalt oxides can act as active sites, thus effectively reducing the reaction energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. This work provides a new perspective for enhancing the stability of cobalt&#8208;based electrocatalyst. In the future, the dual consideration of applied potential and stable species of active element in the&#160;Pourbaix diagram may be a new direction for developing acid&#8208;stable electrocatalysts.

         <title>Harvesting Triplet Excitons in High Mobility Emissive Organic Semiconductor for Efficiency Enhancement of Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triplet excitons in high mobility emissive semiconductor 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) are successfully harvested via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation and further increased by doping a highly emissive guest. The exciton utilization and device efficiency of DPA are significantly improved in organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs). This concept can be extended to other advanced high mobility emissive organic semiconductors for promoting the development of OLETs and related functional devices.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs), a kind of highly integrated and minimized optoelectronic device, demonstrate great potential applications in various fields. The construction of high&#8208;performance OLETs requires the integration of high charge carrier mobility, strong emission, and high triplet exciton utilization efficiency in the active layer. However, it remains a significant long&#8208;term challenge, especially for single component active layer OLETs. Herein, the successful harvesting of triplet excitons in a high mobility emissive molecule, 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA), through the triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation process is demonstrated. By incorporating a highly emissive guest into the DPA host system, an obvious increase in photoluminescence efficiency along with exciton utilization efficiency results in an obvious enhancement of external quantum efficiency of 7.2&#160;times for OLETs compared to the non&#8208;doped devices. Moreover, well&#8208;tunable multi&#8208;color electroluminescence, especially white emission with Commission Internationale del'Eclairage&#160; of (0.31, 0.35), from OLETs is also achieved by modulating the doping concentration with a controlled energy transfer process. This work opens a new avenue for integrating strong emission and efficient exciton utilization in high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors for high&#8208;performance OLETs and advancing their related functional device applications.

         <title>Electrically Driven Sub&#8208;Micrometer Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Arrays Using Maskless and Etching&#8208;Free Pixelation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;pixelation technique of micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes via helium focused ion beam irradiation is introduced. Various pixel sizes down to sub&#8208;micrometer scale are demonstrated, and their optical and electrical properties are investigated. This approach does not require any complicated fabrication processes for pixelation such as lithography, passivation, and planarization, providing a new way to fabricate sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;scale optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
For decades, group&#8208;III&#8208;nitride&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) have&#160;been regarded as a light emitting source for future displays by virtue of their novel properties such as high efficiency, brightness, and stability. Nevertheless, realization of high pixel density displays is still challenging due to limitations of pixelation methods. Here, a maskless and etching&#8208;free micro&#8208;LED (&#181;LED) pixelation method is developed via tailored He focused ion beam (FIB) irradiation technique, and electrically driven sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;scale &#181;LED pixel arrays are demonstrated. It is confirmed that optical quenching and electrical isolation effects are simultaneously induced at a certain ion dose (&#8776;1014 ions cm&#8722;2) without surface damage. Furthermore, highly efficient &#181;LED pixel arrays at sub&#8208;micrometer scale (square pixel, 0.5&#160;&#181;m side length) are fabricated. Their pixelation and brightness are verified by various optical measurements such as cathodo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, and electroluminescence. It is expected that the FIB&#8208;induced optical quenching and electrical isolation method can pioneer a new defect engineering technology not only for &#181;LED fabrication, but also for sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;scale optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Photothermal&#8208;Therapy&#8208;Assisted Immunomodulation via Multiresponsive Adjuvant Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Multiresponsive adjuvant nanoparticles (RMmAGL) were fabricated to perform tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy while regulating the behavior of tumor&#8208;associated immune cells for primary tumor eradication and metastasis inhibition. Core&#8211;satellite&#8208;like RMmAGL had a core of mannose&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with R837 (R837@MSN&#8208;mannose) connected via hydrazone bonds to satellites of glutamine (Glu)&#8208; and lysine (Lys)&#8208;comodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys). During therapy, the acidic environment in tumor tissue cleaved the hydrazone bonds to release AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys, which further accumulated in tumor cells. After internalization, photothermal agents (aggregated AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys) were generated in situ through the intratumoral enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction between Glu and Lys, resulting in tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy. The detachment of AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys also triggered the release of R837, which matured dendritic cells (DCs) via a vaccine&#8208;like mechanism along with the tumor&#8208;associated antigens generated by photothermal therapy. These matured DCs further activated surrounding T cells for immunotherapy. Moreover, the resulting free MSN&#8208;mannose served as an artificial glycocalyx to continuously induce the polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages from an immunosuppressive phenotype to an inflammatory phenotype, thus further enhancing immunotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated significant inhibition of malignant tumors after therapy.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of 2D Mo2C and Thickness&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen Evolution on Its Basal Plane and Edges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides (2D TMC and MXenes) are promising candidates for applications of energy storage and catalysis. Mo2C MXene has shown promise for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but scalable synthesis of high&#8208;quality large 2D Mo2C flakes could not be achieved. Here, we report a facile strategy for direct synthesis of 2D Mo2C with a low concentration of defects by salt&#8208;assisted templating, in which KCl serves as a template to form an intermediate 2D product and facilitates Mo2C formation without coarsening upon melting. Ability to produce flakes with thicknesses from monolayer (0.36&#160;nm) to 10 layers (4.55&#160;nm) allowed us to show that the electrocatalytical HER activity of 2D Mo2C is inversely proportional to its thickness. The thinnest monolayer Mo2C shows a remarkable HER performance with a current density of &#8764; 6800&#160;mA/cm2 at 470&#160;mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode and an ultra&#8208;high turnover frequency of &#8764; 17500 s&#8722;1. The theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption increases with decreasing thickness of Mo2C, increasing HER activity. WC and V8C7 nanosheets were fabricated using this versatile approach, thus expanding the family of 2D carbides. These results indicate that the salt&#8208;assisted synthesis opens a new pathway to direct synthesis of MXene&#8208;like 2D carbides that eliminates the need for layered ceramic precursors.

These results indicate that the salt-assisted synthesis opens a new pathway to direct synthesis of MXene-like 2D carbides that eliminates the need for layered ceramic precursors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Boosting the Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy Performance of 2D Layered Double Hydroxide Nanosheet&#8208;Based Sonosensitizers Via Crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;Amorphous Phase Transformation</title>

Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has been a promising therapeutic modality for cancer because of its superior advantages compared with other therapeutic strategies. However, the current sonosensitizers used for SDT normally exhibit low activity for ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Herein, we first report the crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous phase transformation as a simple but powerful strategy to engineer ultrathin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) CoW&#8208;LDH and NiW&#8208;LDH nanosheets as highly efficient sonosensitizers for SDT. The phase transformation of CoW&#8208;LDH and NiW&#8208;LDH nanosheets from polycrystalline to amorphous ones is achieved through a simple acid etching treatment. Importantly, compared with the polycrystalline one, the amorphous CoW&#8208;LDH (a&#8208;CoW&#8208;LDH) nanosheets possess higher ROS generation activity under US irradiation, which is &#8764;17 times of the commercial TiO2 sonosensitizer. Our results suggest that the enhanced performance of ultrathin a&#8208;CoW&#8208;LDH nanosheets for US&#8208;induced ROS generation may be attributed to the phase transformation&#8208;induced defect generation and electronic structure changes. After polyethylene glycol modification, the a&#8208;CoW&#8208;LDH nanosheets can serve as a high&#8208;efficiency sonosensitizer for SDT to achieve cell death in vitro and tumor eradication in vivo under US irradiation.

         <title>Unveiling the Intrinsic Structure and Intragrain Defects of Organic Inorganic Hybrid Perovskites by Ultra&#8208;low Dose Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful tool for unveiling the structural, compositional, and electronic properties of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHP) at the atomic to micron length scales. However, the structural and compositional instability of OIHPs under electron beam radiation results in misunderstandings of the microscopic structure&#8722;property&#8722;performance relationship in OIHP devices. Here, we utilize ultra&#8208;low dose TEM to identify the mechanism of the electron beam&#8208;induced changes in OHIPs and clarify the cumulative electron dose thresholds (critical dose) of different commercially interesting state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OIHPs, including MAPbI3, FAPbI3, FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3, FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3, and MAPb0.5Sn0.5I3. The critical dose is related to the composition of the OIHPs, with FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3 having the highest critical dose of &#8764;84 e &#197;&#8722;2 and FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 having the lowest critical dose of &#8764;4.2 e &#197;&#8722;2. The electron beam irradiation results in the formation of a superstructure with ordered I and FA vacancies along &lt;110&gt;c, as identified from the three major crystal axes in cubic FAPbI3, &lt;100&gt;c, &lt;110&gt;c and &lt;111&gt;c. The intragrain planar defects in FAPbI3 are stable while an obvious modification is observed in FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 under continuous electron beam exposure. This information can serve as a guide for ensuring a reliable understanding of the microstructure of OIHP optoelectronic devices by TEM.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast Piezocatalysts Enabled By Interfacial Interaction of Reduced Graphene Oxide/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The catalytic activity has been investigated in 2D materials, and the unique structural and electronic properties contribute to their success in conventional heterogeneous catalysis. Heterojunction&#8208;based piezocatalysis has attracted increasing attention due to the band&#8208;structure engineering and the enhanced charge carrier separation by prominent piezoelectric effect. However, the piezocatalytic behavior of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is still unknown, and the finite active sites, catalyst poisoning, and poor conductivity are challenges for developing good piezocatalysts. Herein, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure is rationally designed to tackle these challenges. The heterostructure shows a record&#8208;high piezocatalytic degradation rate of 1.40 &#1093; 102 L mol&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is 7.86 times higher than MoS2 nanosheets. Piezoresponse force microscope (PFM) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveal that the coupling between semiconductive and piezoelectric properties in the vdW heterojunction is vital to break the metallic state screening effect at the MoS2 edge for keeping the piezoelectric potential. The dynamic charges generated by MoS2 and the fast charge transfer in rGO activate and maintain catalytically active sites for pollutant degradation with ultra&#8208;fast rate and good stability. The working mechanism opens new avenues for developing efficient catalysts significant to wastewater treatments and other applications.

Abstract
Magnetic materials in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) have attracted widespread attention for their intriguing magnetic properties. 2D magnetic heterostructures can provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring fundamental physics and novel spintronic devices. Here, w e report the heteroepitaxial growth of ferromagnetic CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on Cr2Te3 and mica by chemical vapor deposition. Magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect measurements revealed the thickness&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism of CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica, where a decrease of Curie temperature (TC) from 320 K to 260 K and an enhancement of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with reducing thickness w ere observed. Moreover, lattice&#8208;matched heteroepitaxial ultrathin CuCr2Te4 on Cr2Te3 exhibits an enhanced robust ferromagnetism with TC up to 340 K due to the interfacial charge transfer. Stripe&#8208;type magnetic domains and single magnetic domain w ere discovered in this heterostructure with different thicknesses. O ur work provides a way to construct robust room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetic heterostructures for functional spintronic devices.

         <title>Coexistence of Merons with Skyrmions in the Centrosymmetric van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe5&#8208;xGeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fe5&#8208;xGeTe2 is a centrosymmetric, layered van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnet that displays Curie temperatures Tc (270&#8208;330 K) that are within the useful range for spintronic applications. However, little is known about the interplay between its topological spin textures (e.g., merons, skyrmions) with technologically relevant transport properties such as the topological Hall effect (THE), or topological thermal transport. Here, we show via high&#8208;resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy that merons and anti&#8208;meron pairs coexist with N&#233;el skyrmions in Fe5&#8208;xGeTe2 over a wide range of temperatures and probe their effects on thermal and electrical transport. We detect a THE, even at room T, that senses merons at higher T&#8217;s as well as their coexistence with skyrmions as T is lowered indicating an on&#8208;demand thermally driven formation of either type of spin texture. Remarkably, we also observe an unconventional THE in absence of Lorentz force and attribute it to the interaction between charge carriers and magnetic field&#8208;induced chiral spin textures. Our results expose Fe5&#8208;xGeTe2 as a promising candidate for the development of applications in skyrmionics/meronics due to the interplay between distinct but coexisting topological magnetic textures and unconventional transport of charge/heat carriers.

However, little is known about the interplay between its topological spin textures (e.g., merons, skyrmions) with technologically relevant transport properties such as the topological Hall effect (THE), or topological thermal transport. Here, we show via high-resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy that merons and anti-meron pairs coexist with N&#233;el skyrmions in Fe&lt;sub&gt;5-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over a wide range of temperatures and probe their effects on thermal and electrical transport. We detect a THE, even at room &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;, that senses merons at higher &lt;i&gt;T&#8217;&lt;/i&gt;s as well as their coexistence with skyrmions as &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt; is lowered indicating an on-demand thermally driven formation of either type of spin texture. Remarkably, we also observe an unconventional THE in absence of Lorentz force and attribute it to the interaction between charge carriers and magnetic field-induced chiral spin textures. Our results expose Fe&lt;sub&gt;5-x&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a promising candidate for the development of applications in skyrmionics/meronics due to the interplay between distinct but coexisting topological magnetic textures and unconventional transport of charge/heat carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Piezocatalytic 2D WS2 Nanosheets for Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Piezodynamic Cancer Therapy Synergized with Energy Metabolism&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy</title>

Abstract
Piezoelectric nanomaterials that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by piezoelectric polarization under an external mechanical force have emerged as an effective platform for cancer therapy. In this study, piezoelectric, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) WS2 nanosheets were prepared and functionalized with mitochondrial&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphonium (TPP) for ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted piezodynamic cancer therapy. In addition, a glycolysis inhibitor (FX11) that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism was loaded into TPP&#8208; and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;conjugated WS2 nanosheets (TPEG&#8208;WS2) to potentiate its piezodynamic therapeutic efficacy. FX11&#8208;loaded TPEG&#8208;WS2 (FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2) exhibited high physiological stability and biocompatibility. Upon US irradiation, the sono&#8208;excited electrons and holes generated in the 2D WS2 were efficiently separated by piezoelectric polarization, which subsequently promoted the production of ROS. The variation in the piezoelectric potential with respect to US&#8208;induced pressure was calculated using COMSOL Multiphysics&#174;. TPEG&#8208;WS2 selectively accumulates in the mitochondria of human breast cancer cells, rendering them more vulnerable&#160;to ROS&#8208;triggered apoptosis. In addition, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 effectively inhibited glycolytic pathways, leading to the significant inhibition of adenosine triphosphate and lactate production. Thus, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 exhibited outstanding anticancer effects under US irradiation. An in vivo biodistribution study using tumor&#8208;xenograft mice demonstrated that FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 effectively accumulated in the tumors. Tumor accumulation of FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 was also visualized using in vivo computed tomography imaging. Notably, a single intravenous injection of FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 under US irradiation remarkably suppressed the tumor growth of mice without systemic toxicity. This study demonstrates that the combination of US&#8208;triggered piezodynamic cancer therapy and energy metabolism&#8208;targeted chemotherapy using mitochondria&#8208;targeting piezoelectric 2D WS2 nanosheets is a novel therapeutic strategy for the selective and effective treatment of tumors

         <title>Building K&#8208;C anode with ultrahigh self&#8208;diffusion coefficient for solid state potassium metal batteries operating at &#8208;20 to 120&#176;C</title>

Abstract
Solid state potassium metal batteries are intriguing in grid&#8208;scale energy storage, benefiting from the low cost, safety and high energy density. However, their practical applications are impeded by poor K/solid electrolyte (SE) interfacial contact and limited capacity caused by the low K self&#8208;diffusion coefficient, dendrite growth, and the intrinsically low melting point/soft features of metallic K. Herein, we demonstrate that a fused&#8208;modeling strategy using potassiophilic carbon allotropes molted with K, can enhance the electrochemical performance/stability of the system via promoting K diffusion kinetics (2.37 &#215; 10&#8722;8 cm2 s&#8722;1), creating an extremely low interfacial resistance (&#8764;1.3 &#937; cm2), suppressing dendrite growth, and maintaining mechanical/thermal stability at 200&#176;C. A homogeneous/stable K stripping/plating is consequently implemented with a high current density of 2.8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (at 25&#176;C) and a record&#8208;high areal capacity of 11.86 mAh cm&#8722;2 (at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). The enhanced K diffusion kinetics contributes to sustaining intimate interfacial contact, stabilizing the stripping/plating at high current densities. Full cells coupling ultrathin K&#8208;C composite anodes (&#8764;50&#160;&#956;m) with Prussian blue cathodes and &#946;/&#946;"&#8208;Al2O3 SEs delivers a high energy density of 389&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with a retention of 94.4% after 150 cycles and fantastic performances in a temperature range from &#8208;20 to 120&#176;C.

         <title>Transition from Elastohydrodynamic to Mixed Regimes in Lubricated Friction of Soft Solid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lubricated contacts in soft materials are common in various engineering and natural systems. Two major regimes are elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), in which solid surfaces are fully separated by a fluid film, and mixed lubrication (ML), in which there is partial solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid contact. Transition between these regimes governs the minimum sliding friction achievable and is thus very important in various engineering and natural settings such as tires, haptic applications, bio&#8208;inspired systems, contact lenses, and the fabrication of soft electronic devices. Generally, the transition from EHL to ML regimes is believed to occur when the thickness of the lubricant layer is comparable with the amplitude of surface roughness. We performed lubricated sliding experiments on smooth polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates under various normal load, sliding velocity, and lubricant conditions. We found that for smooth soft surfaces, the transition from EHL to ML regimes can occur when the thickness of the liquid layer is much larger than the height of asperities, that is, the conventional criterion is highly inaccurate. By direct visualization of the &#8220;contact&#8221; region during sliding experiments, we demonstrate that the transition corresponds to the formation of wave&#8208;like surface wrinkles at the leading contact edge and associated instabilities at the trailing contact edge. We believe these instabilities are peculiar to soft solids and trigger transition to the mixed regime. Our results change the fundamental understanding of what governs the important EHL&#8208;ML transition in lubricated sliding of soft solids.

         <title>Tuning the Coordination Environment of Carbon&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Doping with Multiple Heteroatoms and Their Applications in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are considered to be a perfect platform for studying the structure&#8208;activity relationship of different reactions due to the adjustability of their coordination environment. Multi&#8208;heteroatom doping has been demonstrated as an effective strategy for tuning the coordination environment of carbon&#8208;based SACs and enhancing catalytic performance in electrochemical reactions. Herein, we summarize recently developed strategies for multi&#8208;heteroatom doping, focusing on the regulation of single&#8208;atom active sites by heteroatoms in different coordination shells. In addition, we investigate the correlation between the coordination environment and the catalytic activity of carbon&#8208;based SACs through representative experiments and theoretical calculations for various electrochemical reactions. Finally, concerning certain shortcomings of the current strategies of doping multi&#8208;heteroatoms, some suggestions are put forward to promote the development of carbon&#8208;based SACs in the field of electrocatalysis.

         <title>Engineered Living Intestinal Muscle Patch Produces Macroscopic Contractions that can Mix and Break down Artificial Intestinal Contents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intestinal muscle layers execute various gut wall movements to achieve controlled propulsion and mixing of intestinal content. Engineering intestinal muscle layers with complex contractile function is critical for developing bioartificial intestinal tissue to treat patients with short bowel syndrome. Here we report the first demonstration of a living intestinal muscle patch capable of generating three distinct motility patterns and displaying multiple digesta manipulations. Assessment of cell contractility, cellular morphology, and transcriptome profile reveals that successful generation of the contracting intestinal muscle patch relies on both biological factors in a serum&#8208;free medium and environmental cues from an elastic electrospun gelatin scaffold. By comparing gene&#8208;expression patterns among samples, we show that biological factors from the medium strongly affect ion transport activities, while the scaffold unexpectedly regulates cell&#8208;cell communication. Analysis of the ligand&#8208;receptor interactome identifies the scaffold&#8208;driven changes in intercellular communication, and 78% of the upregulated ligand&#8208;receptor interactions are involved in the development and function of enteric neurons. Our discoveries highlight the importance of combining biomolecular and biomaterial approaches for tissue engineering. The living intestinal muscle patch represents a pivotal advancement for building functional replacement intestinal tissue. It offers a more physiological model for studying GI motility and for preclinical drug discovery.

&lt;p&gt;The intestinal muscle layers execute various gut wall movements to achieve controlled propulsion and mixing of intestinal content. Engineering intestinal muscle layers with complex contractile function is critical for developing bioartificial intestinal tissue to treat patients with short bowel syndrome. Here we report the first demonstration of a living intestinal muscle patch capable of generating three distinct motility patterns and displaying multiple digesta manipulations. Assessment of cell contractility, cellular morphology, and transcriptome profile reveals that successful generation of the contracting intestinal muscle patch relies on both biological factors in a serum-free medium and environmental cues from an elastic electrospun gelatin scaffold. By comparing gene-expression patterns among samples, we show that biological factors from the medium strongly affect ion transport activities, while the scaffold unexpectedly regulates cell-cell communication. Analysis of the ligand-receptor interactome identifies the scaffold-driven changes in intercellular communication, and 78% of the upregulated ligand-receptor interactions are involved in the development and function of enteric neurons. Our discoveries highlight the importance of combining biomolecular and biomaterial approaches for tissue engineering. The living intestinal muscle patch represents a pivotal advancement for building functional replacement intestinal tissue. It offers a more physiological model for studying GI motility and for preclinical drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Young Exosome Bio&#8208;nanoparticles Restore Aging&#8208;Impaired Tendon Stem/Progenitor Cell Function and Reparative Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aging impairs tendon stem cell function and homeostasis, however, effective treatments for aging&#8208;induced tendon diseases are lacking. Exosomes are naturally derived nanoparticles that contain bioactive molecules, and therefore, have attracted great interests in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this study, we show that young exosomes secreted by stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED&#8208;Exos) possess abundant anti&#8208;aging signals. These young bio&#8208;nanoparticles can alleviate the aging phenotypes of aged tendon stem/progenitor cells (AT&#8208;SCs) and maintain their tenogenic capacity. Mechanistically, SHED&#8208;Exos modulate histone methylation and inhibit nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B to reverse AT&#8208;SC aging. In a naturally aging mouse model, systemic administration of SHED&#8208;Exo bio&#8208;nanoparticles retards tendon degeneration. Interestingly, local delivery of SHED&#8208;Exos&#8208;loaded microspheres confers anti&#8208;aging phenotypes, including reduced senescent cells and decreased ectopic bone formation, and thereby functionally and structurally rescuing endogenous tendon regeneration and repair capacity in aged rats. Overall, SHED&#8208;Exos, as natural bioactive nanoparticles, have promising translational and therapeutic potential for aging&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Synaptic Resistor Circuits Based on Al Oxide and Ti Silicide for Concurrent Learning and Signal&#8208;Processing in Artificial Intelligence Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neurobiological circuits containing synapses can process signals while learning concurrently in real&#8208;time. Before an artificial neural network (ANN) can execute a signal&#8208;processing program, it must first be programmed by humans or trained with respect to a large and defined data set during learning processes, resulting in significant latency, high power consumption, and poor adaptability to unpredictable changing environments. In this article, we report a crossbar circuit of synaptic resistors (synstors), each synstor integrating an Si channel with an Al oxide memory layer and Ti silicide Schottky contacts. Individual synstors were characterized and analyzed to understand their concurrent signal&#8208;processing and learning abilities. Without any prior training, synstor circuits concurrently execute signal&#8208;processing and learning in real time to fly drones toward a target position in an aerodynamically changing environment faster than human controllers, and with learning speed, performance, power consumption, and adaptability to the environment significantly superior to an ANN running on computers. The synstor circuit provides a path to establish power&#8208;efficient intelligent systems with real&#8208;time learning and adaptability in the capriciously mutable real&#8208;world.

         <title>Enhancement of Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque by Interfacial Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxidation in CuPt/ferromagnet interface is found to be able to enhance the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) torque and associated spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) switching efficiency with remaining threefold rotational symmetry. The enhancement is independent of the device shapes, magnetic materials, or magnetization easy axis. This work offers an industrial&#8208;compatible route to improve the performance of low&#8208;symmetry crystal&#8208;based spintronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT)&#8208;induced switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of magnetic field is crucial for the application of SOT&#8208;based spintronic devices. Recent works have demonstrated that the low&#8208;symmetry crystal structure in CuPt/CoPt can give rise to an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) spin torque and lead to deterministic magnetization switching without an external field. However, it is essential to improve OOP effective field for the efficient switching. In this work, the impact of interface oxidation on the generation of OOP effective field in a CuPt/ferromagnet heterostructure is systematically studied. By introducing an oxidized CuPt surface, it is found that the field&#8208;free switching performance shows remarkable improvement. OOP effective field measurement indicates that the oxidation treatment can enhance the OOP effective field by more than two times. It is also demonstrated that this oxidation&#8208;induced OOP SOT efficiency enhancement is independent of the device shapes, magnetic materials, or magnetization easy axis. This work contributes to improve the performance of SOT devices and provides an effective fabrication guidance for future spintronic devices that utilize OOP SOT.

         <title>A&#160;Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Based Approach for Solving Atomic Structures of Nanomaterials Combining Pair Distribution Functions with Density Functional Theory</title>

         <dc:description>
Determination of crystal structures of nanocrystalline compounds is a great challenge in solid&#8208;state chemistry. In&#160;this&#160;work, an algorithm is introduced,&#160;which&#160;is able to determine the crystal structure of an unknown compound by means of an on&#8208;the&#8208;fly trained machine&#160;learning model that combines density functional calculations with comparison of calculated and measured pair distribution functions for global optimization.








Abstract
Determination of crystal structures of nanocrystalline or amorphous compounds is a great challenge in solid&#8208;state chemistry and physics. Pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of X&#8208;ray or neutron total scattering&#160;data has proven to be a key element in tackling this challenge. However, in most cases, a reliable structural motif is needed as a&#160;starting configuration for structure refinements. Here, an algorithm that is able to determine the crystal structure of an unknown compound by means of an on&#8208;the&#8208;fly trained machine&#160;learning model,&#160;which&#160;combines density functional theory calculations with comparison of calculated and measured PDFs for global optimization in an artificial landscape, is presented. Due to the nature of this landscape, even metastable configurations and stacking disorders can be identified.

         <title>Versatile Assembly of Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network Foams Enabled by Tannin&#8211;Cellulose Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;phenolic network foams are prepared using tannin&#8211;cellulose nanofibers as a structured background. The method relies on ice&#8208;templating the nanofibers to promote the metal&#8211;phenolic networking in situ, during thawing in ethanol solutions of metal nitrates. This leads to strong and homogenous lightweight foams, whose properties are tailorable by adjusting the tannin type and content, as well as the metal ion.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN) foams are prepared using colloidal suspensions of tannin&#8208;containing cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) that are ice&#8208;templated and thawed in ethanolic media in the presence of metal nitrates. The MPN facilitates the formation of solid foams by air drying, given the strength and self&#8208;supporting nature of the obtained tannin&#8211;cellulose nanohybrid structures. The porous characteristics and (dry and wet) compression strength of the foams are rationalized by the development of secondary, cohesive&#160;metal&#8208;phenolic layers combined with a hydrogen bonding network involving the CNF. The shrinkage of the MPN foams is as low as 6% for samples prepared with 2.5&#8211;10% tannic acid (or condensed tannin at 2.5%) with respect to CNF content. The strength of the MPN foams reaches a maximum at 10% tannic acid (using Fe(III) ions), equivalent to a compressive strength 70% higher than that produced with tannin&#8208;free CNF foams. Overall, a straightforward framework is introduced to synthesize MPN foams whose physical and mechanical properties are tailored by the presence of tannins as well as the metal ion species that enable the metal&#8211;phenolic networking. Depending on the metal ion, the foams are amenable to modification according to the desired application.

         <title>Deciphering Adverse Detrapped Hole Transfer in Hot&#8208;Electron Photoelectric Conversion at Infrared Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Existing hot&#8208;carrier devices suffer from low efficiencies, particularly in the infrared region, and ambiguous physical mechanisms. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;the competitive interfacial transfer mechanisms of detrapped holes and hot electrons in hot&#8208;carrier devices are discovered. By eliminating the adverse detrapped&#8208;hole transfer, the external quantum efficiency of a hot&#8208;electron device can increase by over two orders of magnitude at 10&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Hot&#8208;carrier devices are promising alternatives for enabling path breaking photoelectric conversion. However, existing hot&#8208;carrier devices suffer from low efficiencies, particularly in the infrared region, and ambiguous physical mechanisms. In&#160;this&#160;work,&#160;the competitive interfacial transfer mechanisms of detrapped holes and hot electrons in hot&#8208;carrier devices are discovered. Through photocurrent polarity research and optical&#8208;pump&#8211;THz&#8208;probe (OPTP) spectroscopy, it is verified that detrapped hole transfer (DHT) and hot&#8208;electron transfer (HET) dominate the low&#8208; and high&#8208;density excitation responses, respectively. The photocurrent ratio assigned to DHT and HET increases from 6.6% to over 1133.3% as the illumination intensity decreases. DHT induces severe degeneration of the external quantum efficiency (EQE), especially at low illumination intensities. The EQE of a hot&#8208;electron device can theoretically increase by over two orders of magnitude at 10&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 through DHT elimination. The OPTP results show that competitive transfer arises from the carrier oscillation type and carrier&#8208;density&#8208;related Coulomb screening. The screening intensity determines the excitation weight and hot&#8208;electron cooling scenes and thereby the transfer dynamics.

         <title>Inhibiting Formation and Reduction of Li2CO3 to LiCx at Grain Boundaries in Garnet Electrolytes to Prevent Li Penetration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanism for Li penetration is discovered within Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) where Li2CO3 at the grain boundaries (GBs) of LLZO is reduced to an electron&#8208;conductive LiCx network. The ion/electron transfer properties of GBs within LLZO are regulated via F&#8208;doping and LiAlO2 infusion, which significantly reduce the formation of Li2CO3 and promote homogenous Li plating/stripping.








Abstract
Poor ion and high electron transport at the grain boundaries (GBs) of ceramic electrolytes are the primary reasons for lithium filament infiltration and short&#8208;circuiting of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASLMBs). Herein, it is discovered that Li2CO3 at the GBs of Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) sheets is reduced to highly electron&#8208;conductive LiCx during cycling, resulting in lithium penetration of LLZO. The ionic and electronic conductivity of the GBs within LLZO can be simultaneously tuned using sintered Li3AlF6. The generated LiAlO2 (LAO) infusion and F&#8208;doping at the GBs of LLZO (LAO&#8208;LLZOF) significantly reduce the Li2CO3 content and broaden the energy bandgap of LLZO, which decreases the electronic conductivity of LAO&#8208;LLZOF. LAO forms a 3D continuous ion transport network at the GB that significantly improves the total ionic conductivity. Lithium penetration within LLZO is suppressed and an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiFePO4/LAO&#8208;LLZOF/Li battery stably cycled for 5500 cycles at 3&#160;C. This work reveals the chemistry of Li2CO3 at the LLZO GBs during cycling, presents a novel lithium penetration mechanism within garnet electrolytes, and provides an innovative method to simultaneously regulate the ion and electron transport at the GBs in garnet electrodes for advanced ASLMBs.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Sub&#8208;Millimeter Nonlayered WO2 Nanoplates via a WSe2&#8208;Assisted Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality and nonlayered WO2 nanoplates with tunable thickness and lateral dimension by a WSe2&#8208;assisted strategy are reported. Electrical measurements demonstrate that&#160;the WO2 nanoplates exhibit metallic behavior with excellent conductivity, ultrahigh breakdown current density, and strong anisotropic resistance. Magnetotransport studies show quantum&#8208;interference&#8208;induced weak&#8208;localization behavior. These studies demonstrate that 2D&#160;metal oxides are promising candidates for interconnecting and other novel electronic devices.








Abstract
2D&#160;metal oxides (2DMOs) have stimulated tremendous attention due to their distinct electronic structures and abundant surface chemistry. However, it remains a standing challenge for the synthesis of 2DMOs because of their intrinsic 3D&#160;lattice structure and ultrahigh synthesis temperature. Here, a reliable WSe2&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy to grow nonlayered WO2 nanoplates with tunable thickness and lateral dimension is reported. Optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy studies demonstrate that the&#160;WO2 nanoplates exhibit a well&#8208;faceted rhombic geometry with a lateral dimension up to the sub&#8208;millimeter level (&#8776;135&#160;&#181;m), which is the largest size of 2DMO single crystals obtained by CVD to date. Scanning transmission electron microscopy studies reveal that the nanoplates are high&#8208;quality single crystals. Electrical measurements show the nanoplates exhibit metallic behavior with strong anisotropic resistance, outstanding conductivity of 1.1&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1, and breakdown current density of 7.1&#160;&#215;&#160;107&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. More interestingly, low&#8208;temperature magnetotransport studies demonstrate that the nanoplates show a quantum&#8208;interference&#8208;induced weak&#8208;localization effect. The developed WSe2&#8208;assisted strategy for the growth of WO2 nanoplates can enrich the library of 2DMO materials and provide a material platform for other property explorations based on 2D WO2.

         <title>Hydrogel Nanoarchitectonics of a Flexible and Self&#8208;Adhesive Electrode for Long&#8208;Term Wireless Electroencephalogram Recording and High&#8208;Accuracy Sustained Attention Evaluation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multichannel and wirelessly operated hydrogel electrode for long&#8208;term electroencephalography (EEG) signal recording and real&#8208;time sustained attention evaluation is presented. Due to the combined merits of conductivity, self&#8208;adhesion, low modulus, flexibility, and transparency of the hydrogel, it is able to construct an effective and stable bioelectrical interface for high&#8208;quality EEG signal acquisition.








Abstract
Hydrogels are ideal building blocks to fabricate the next generation of electrodes for acquiring high&#8208;quality physiological electrical signals, for example, electroencephalography (EEG). However, collection of EEG signals still suffers from electrode deformation, sweating, extensive body motion and vibration, and environmental interference. Herein, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinylpyrrolidone are selected to prepare a hydrogel network with tissue&#8208;like modulus and excellent flexibility. Additionally, polydopamine nanoparticles, obtained by polydopamine peroxidation, are integrated into the hydrogel to endow them with higher transparency, higher self&#8208;adhesion, and lower impedance. Consequently, a multichannel and wirelessly operated hydrogel electrode can establish a conformal and stable interface with tissue and illustrate high channel uniformity, low interfacial contact impedance, low power noise, long&#8208;term stability, and a tolerance to sweat and motion. Furthermore, the hydrogel electrode shows the unprecedented ability to classify the recorded high&#8208;quality prefrontal EEG signals into seven&#8208;category sustained attention with high accuracy (91.5%), having great potential applications in the assessment of human consciousness and in multifunctional diagnoses.

         <title>Widely Tunable Berry Curvature in the Magnetic Semimetal Cr1+&#948;Te2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Cr1+&#948;Te2 is shown to be a unique magnetic semimetal enabling widely tunable k&#8208;space Berry curvature near Fermi energy. The door has been opened for probing and tailoring the intertwined Berry curvature physics in real and momentum&#160;space in Cr1+&#948;Te2 epitaxial thin films and their heterostructures.








Abstract
Magnetic semimetals have increasingly emerged as lucrative platforms hosting spin&#8208;based topological phenomena in real and momentum spaces. Cr1+&#948;Te2 is a self&#8208;intercalated magnetic transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD), which exhibits topological magnetism and tunable electron filling. While recent studies have explored real&#8208;space Berry curvature effects, similar considerations of momentum&#8208;space Berry curvature&#160;are lacking. Here, the electronic structure and transport properties of epitaxial Cr1+&#948;Te2 thin films are systematically investigated over a range of doping, &#948; (0.33 &#8211; 0.71). Spectroscopic experiments reveal the presence of a characteristic semi&#8208;metallic band region, which shows a rigid like energy shift with &#948;. Transport experiments show that the intrinsic component of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is sizable and undergoes a sign flip across &#948;. Finally, density functional theory calculations establish a link between the doping evolution of the band structure and AHE: the AHE sign flip is shown to emerge from the sign change of the Berry curvature, as the semi&#8208;metallic band region crosses the Fermi energy. These findings underscore the increasing relevance of momentum&#8208;space Berry curvature in magnetic TMDs and provide a unique platform for intertwining topological physics in real and momentum spaces.

         <title>Thermoresponsive Electrolytes for Safe Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermoresponsive electrolyte is introduced into a working cell to relieve the exothermic reactions between electrodes and electrolytes, the internal short circuit. The critical temperature for thermal safety, &#8220;ignition point&#8221; of battery, and internal&#8208;short&#8208;circuit temperature of batteries with thermoresponsive electrolyte increase from 71.5, 100.3, and 126.3&#160;&#176;C to 137.4, 203.6, and 176.5&#160;&#176;C compared with routine electrolyte.








Abstract
Exploring advanced strategies in alleviating the thermal runaway of lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) is critically essential. Herein, a novel electrolyte system with thermoresponsive characteristics is designed to largely enhance the thermal safety of 1.0 Ah LMBs. Specifically, vinyl carbonate (VC) with azodiisobutyronitrile is introduced as a thermoresponsive solvent to boost the thermal stability of both the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and electrolyte. First, abundant poly(VC) is formed in SEI with thermoresponsive electrolyte, which is more thermally stable against lithium hexafluorophosphate compared to the inorganic components widely acquired in routine electrolyte. This increases the critical temperature for thermal safety (the beginning temperature of obvious self&#8208;heating) from 71.5 to 137.4&#160;&#176;C. The remained VC solvents can be polymerized into poly(VC) as the battery temperature abnormally increases. The poly(VC) can not only afford as a barrier to prevent the direct contact between electrodes, but also immobilize the free liquid solvents, thereby reducing the exothermic reactions between electrodes and electrolytes. Consequently, the internal&#8208;short&#8208;circuit temperature and &#8220;ignition point&#8221; temperature (the starting temperature of thermal runaway) of LMBs are largely increased from 126.3 and 100.3&#160;&#176;C to 176.5 and 203.6&#160;&#176;C. This work provides novel insights for pursuing thermally stable LMBs with the addition of various thermoresponsive solvents in commercial electrolytes.

         <dc:description>
NiSx&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2/Ni is elaborately designed for the efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to valuable 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), along with green hydrogen production. The reaction path and mechanism are comprehensively understood by ex/in situ characterization and theoretical calculations, and the high&#8208;valence Ni2+&#948; is identified as the real active species.








Abstract
An efficient NiSx&#8208;modified &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrode is reported for the selective oxidation reaction of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMFOR) with excellent electrocatalytic 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) selectivity (99.4%), conversion (97.7%), and Faradaic efficiency (98.3%). The decoration of NiSx will evoke high&#8208;valence Ni2+&#948; species in the reconstructed &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrode, which are the real active species for HMFOR. The generated NiSx/Ni(OH)O modulates the proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;transfer (PCET) process of HMFOR, where the electrocatalytically generated Ni(OH)O can effectively trap the protons from the CHO&#63743; end in HMF to realize electron transfer. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) competes with the HMFOR when NiSx/Ni(OH)O continues to accumulate, to generate the NiSx/NiOx(OH)y intermediate. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental results verify that the adsorption energy of HMF can be optimized through the increased NiSx composition for more efficient capture of protons and electrons in the HMFOR.

         <title>Revisiting Lithium&#8208; and Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage in Hard Carbon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive comparison of the lithium&#8208; and sodium&#8208;ion storage behaviors of hard carbon is conducted, yielding the key findings: the sloping voltage section is presented by the lithium&#8208;ion intercalation in the graphitic lattices of hard carbons, whereas it mainly arises from the chemisorption of sodium ions. The intercalation preference and the plateau capacity have an inverse correlation.








Abstract
The galvanostatic lithiation/sodiation voltage profiles of hard carbon anodes are simple, with a sloping drop followed by a&#160;plateau. However, a precise understanding of the corresponding redox sites and storage mechanisms is still elusive, which hinders further development in commercial applications. Here, a comprehensive comparison of the lithium&#8208; and sodium&#8208;ion storage behaviors of hard carbon is conducted, yielding the following key findings: 1) the sloping voltage section is presented by the lithium&#8208;ion intercalation in the graphitic lattices of hard carbons, whereas it mainly arises from the chemisorption of sodium ions on their inner surfaces constituting closed pores, even if the graphitic lattices are unoccupied; 2) the redox sites for the plateau capacities are the same as those for the closed pores regardless of the alkali ions; 3) the sodiation plateau capacities are mostly determined by the volume of the available closed pore, whereas the lithiation plateau capacities are primarily affected by the intercalation propensity; and 4) the intercalation preference and the plateau capacity have an inverse correlation. These findings from extensive characterizations and theoretical investigations provide a relatively clear elucidation of the electrochemical footprint of hard carbon anodes in relation to the redox mechanisms and storage sites for lithium and sodium ions, thereby providing a more rational design strategy for constructing better hard carbon anodes.

         <title>Super&#8208;Resolution Detection of DNA Nanostructures Using a Nanopore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glass nanopores with 3&#8211;4&#160;nm diameters demonstrate super&#8208;resolution single&#8208;molecule sensing capability, which can be used to detect DNA nanostructures separated only by 18&#160;bp (&#8776;6&#160;nm). The super&#8208;resolution is attributed to the electric field enhancement at the nanopore tip and the slowdown of the&#160;DNA, with great potential for label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution DNA sequence mapping and digital information storage.








Abstract
High&#8208;resolution analysis of biomolecules has brought unprecedented insights into fundamental biological processes and dramatically advanced biosensing. Notwithstanding the ongoing resolution revolution in electron microscopy and optical imaging, only a few methods are presently available for high&#8208;resolution analysis of unlabeled single molecules in their native states. Here, label&#8208;free electrical sensing of structured single molecules with a spatial resolution down to single&#8208;digit nanometers is demonstrated. Using a narrow solid&#8208;state nanopore, the passage of a series of nanostructures attached to a freely translocating DNA molecule is detected, resolving individual nanostructures placed as close as 6&#160;nm apart and with a surface&#8208;to&#8208;surface gap distance of only 2&#160;nm. Such super&#8208;resolution ability is attributed to the nanostructure&#8208;induced enhancement of the electric field at the tip of the nanopore. This work demonstrates a general approach to improving the resolution of single&#8208;molecule nanopore sensing and presents a critical advance towards label&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution DNA sequence mapping, and digital information storage independent of molecular motors.

     alt="Super-Resolution Detection of DNA Nanostructures Using a Nanopore"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glass nanopores with 3&#8211;4&#160;nm diameters demonstrate super-resolution single-molecule sensing capability, which can be used to detect DNA nanostructures separated only by 18&#160;bp (&#8776;6&#160;nm). The super-resolution is attributed to the electric field enhancement at the nanopore tip and the slowdown of the&#160;DNA, with great potential for label-free, high-resolution DNA sequence mapping and digital information storage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-resolution analysis of biomolecules has brought unprecedented insights into fundamental biological processes and dramatically advanced biosensing. Notwithstanding the ongoing resolution revolution in electron microscopy and optical imaging, only a few methods are presently available for high-resolution analysis of unlabeled single molecules in their native states. Here, label-free electrical sensing of structured single molecules with a spatial resolution down to single-digit nanometers is demonstrated. Using a narrow solid-state nanopore, the passage of a series of nanostructures attached to a freely translocating DNA molecule is detected, resolving individual nanostructures placed as close as 6&#160;nm apart and with a surface-to-surface gap distance of only 2&#160;nm. Such super-resolution ability is attributed to the nanostructure-induced enhancement of the electric field at the tip of the nanopore. This work demonstrates a general approach to improving the resolution of single-molecule nanopore sensing and presents a critical advance towards label-free, high-resolution DNA sequence mapping, and digital information storage independent of molecular motors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordinatively Stiffen and Toughen Hydrogels with Adaptable Crystal&#8208;Domain Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A homogeneous dynamic cross&#8208;linking design is developed to reconcile the stiffness&#8211;toughness trade&#8208;off for hydrogels via fully triggering both deformation&#8208;resisting and energy&#8208;dissipating capacities of strong yet dynamic cross&#8208;links. Using a solvent&#8208;exchange&#8208;assisted salting&#8208;out method, a class of sal&#8208;exogels with high number densities of crystalline domains embedded in homogeneous networks is constructed, which achieves coordinatively enhanced stiffness and toughness.








Abstract
Conventional hydrogels usually suffer from the inherent conflict between stiffness and toughness, severely hampering their applications as load&#8208;bearing materials. Herein, an adaptable crystal&#8208;domain cross&#8208;linking design is reported to overcome this inherent trade&#8208;off for hydrogels by taking full advantage of both deformation&#8208;resisting and energy&#8208;dissipating capacities of cross&#8208;linking points. Through solvent exchange to homogenize the polymer network, followed by salting out to foster crystallization, a class of sal&#8208;exogels with high number densities of uniform crystalline domains embedded in homogeneous networks is constructed. During the deformation, those adaptive crystalline domains initially survive to arrest deformation, while later gradually disentangle to efficiently dissipate energy, crucial to the realization of the desirable compatibility between stiffness and toughness. The resultant sal&#8208;exogel achieves coordinatively enhanced stiffness (52.3 &#177; 2.7&#160;MPa) and toughness (120.7 &#177; 11.7&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), reconciling the challenging trade&#8208;off between them. This finding provides a practical and universal route to design stiff and tough hydrogels and has a profound impact on many applications requiring hydrogels with such combined mechanical properties.

         <title>A&#160;Reconfigurable Optoelectronic Synaptic Transistor with Stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 Nanocrystals for Visuomorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wavelength&#8208;aware transistor memory is designed by incorporating air&#8208;stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals. On&#8208;demand creation of an&#160;artificial synapse and non&#8208;volatile memory in such homogeneous phototransistor that can be quickly reconfigured for a specific purpose by adjusting the wavelength of the incident light is demonstrated.








Abstract
Reconfigurable phototransistor memory attracts considerable attention for adaptive visuomorphic computing, with highly&#160;efficient sensing, memory, and processing functions integrated onto a single device. However, developing reconfigurable phototransistor memory remains a challenge due to the lack of an&#160;all&#8208;optically controlled transition between short&#8208;term plasticity (STP) and long&#8208;term plasticity (LTP). Herein, an air&#8208;stable Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystal (PNC)&#8208;based phototransistor memory is designed,&#160;which&#160;is capable of broadband photoresponses. Benefitting from the different electron capture ability of Zr&#8208;CsPbI3 PNCs to 650 and 405&#160;nm light, an&#160;artificial synapse and non&#8208;volatile memory can be created on&#8208;demand and quickly reconfigured within a single device for specific purposes. Owing to the optically reconfigurable and wavelength&#8208;aware operation between STP and LTP modes, the integrated blue feature extraction and target recognition can be demonstrated in a homogeneous neuromorphic vision sensor array. This work suggests a new way in developing perovskite optoelectronic transistors for highly efficient in&#8208;sensor computing.

         <title>4D&#8208;Printed Soft and Stretchable Self&#8208;Folding Cuff Electrodes for Small&#8208;Nerve Interfacing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric peripheral nerve interface that can fold itself to a cuff around small nerves during the implantation is presented. This actuation property, combined with the use of stretchable materials, makes the device robust and straightforward to use. The stimulation and recording capabilities are shown on small nerves in vivo.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve interfacing (PNI) has a high clinical potential for treating various diseases, such as obesity or diabetes. However, currently existing electrodes present challenges to the interfacing procedure, which limit their clinical application, in particular, when targeting small peripheral nerves (&lt;200&#160;&#181;m). To improve the electrode handling and implantation, a nerve interface that can fold itself to a cuff around a small nerve, triggered by the body moisture during insertion, is fabricated. This folding is achieved by printing a bilayer of a flexible polyurethane printing resin and a highly swelling sodium acrylate hydrogel using photopolymerization. When immersed in an aqueous liquid, the hydrogel swells and folds the electrode softly around the nerve. Furthermore, the electrodes are robust, can be stretched (&gt;20%), and bent to facilitate the implantation due to the use of soft and stretchable printing resins as substrates and a microcracked gold film as conductive layer. The straightforward implantation and extraction of the electrode as well as stimulation and recording capabilities on a small peripheral nerve in vivo are demonstrated. It is believed that such simple and robust to use self&#8208;folding electrodes will pave the way for bringing PNI to a broader clinical application.

         <title>A Materials Acceleration Platform for Organic Laser Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The accelerated discovery of two molecules with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic laser performance from screening 40&#160;candidates is made possible by the introduction of an automated platform encompassing automated synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be run fully end&#8208;to&#8208;end. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and accelerated discovery of materials.








Abstract
Conventional materials discovery is a laborious and time&#8208;consuming process that can take decades from initial conception of the material to commercialization. Recent developments in materials acceleration platforms promise to accelerate materials discovery using automation of experiments coupled with machine learning. However, most of the automation efforts in chemistry focus on synthesis and compound identification, with integrated target property characterization receiving less attention. In this work, an automated platform is introduced for the discovery of molecules as gain mediums for organic semiconductor lasers, a problem that has been challenging for conventional approaches. This platform encompasses automated lego&#8208;like synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be executed in a fully integrated end&#8208;to&#8208;end fashion. Using this workflow to screen organic laser candidates, discovered eight potential candidates for organic lasers is discovered. The lasing threshold of four molecules in thin&#8208;film devices and find two molecules with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance is tested. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and screening for accelerated materials development.

Energetic ions in the hydrothermal deposition lead to deep&#8208;level defects with high formation energy, while post&#8208;annealing with prolonged time enables defect transformation from high to low formation energy. A general principle regarding kinetically and thermodynamically controlled defect formation is uncovered and a guidance for materials synthesis is provided.








Abstract
Thermal treatment of inorganic thin films is a general and necessary step to facilitate crystallization and, in particular, to regulate the formation of point defects. Understanding the dependence of the defect formation mechanism on the annealing process is a critical challenge in terms of designing material synthesis approaches for obtaining desired optoelectronic properties. Herein, a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of defects in emerging Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell films is presented. A top&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar&#8208;cell film is adopted in this study to consolidate this investigation. This study reveals that, under hydrothermal conditions, the as&#8208;deposited Sb2(S,Se)3 film generates defects with a high formation energy, demonstrating kinetically favorable defect formation characteristics. Annealing at elevated temperatures leads to a two&#8208;step defect transformation process: 1) formation of sulfur and selenium vacancy defects, followed by 2) migration of antimony ions to fill the vacancy defects. This process finally results in the generation of cation&#8211;anion antisite defects, which exhibit low formation energy, suggesting a thermodynamically favorable defect formation feature. This study establishes a new strategy for the fundamental investigation of the evolution of deep&#8208;level defects in metal chalcogenide films and provides guidance for designing material synthesis strategies in terms of defect control.

         <title>Surfactant&#8208;Assisted Sulfonated Covalent Organic Nanosheets: Extrinsic Charge for Improved Ion Transport and Salinity&#8208;Gradient Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient ion transport through nanofluidic channels is critical to electrochemical energy conversion technology, however, limited by low intrinsic surface charges of channels. Herein, the tunable incorporations of extrinsic surface charge is demonstrated to improve ion transport properties, which are achieved by assembly of ionic surfactant and covalent organic nanosheets. The optimized ion channels exhibit a high&#8208;efficiency salinity&#8208;gradient energy conversion.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;governed ion transport is the vital property of nanofluidic channels for salinity&#8208;gradient energy harvesting and other electrochemical energy conversion technologies. 2D nanofluidic channels constructed by nanosheets exhibit great superiority in ion selectivity, but a high ion transport rate remains challenging due to the insufficiency of intrinsic surface charge density in nanoconfinement. Herein, extrinsic surface charge into nanofluidic channels composed of surfactant&#8208;assisted sulfonated covalent organic nanosheets (SCONs), which enable tunable ion transport behaviors, is demonstrated. The polar moiety of surfactant is embedded in SCONs to adjust in&#8208;plane surface charges, and the aggregation of nonpolar moiety results in the sol&#8208;to&#8208;gel transformation of SCON solution for membrane fabrication. The combination endows SCON/surfactant membranes with considerable water&#8208;resistance, and the designable extrinsic charges promise fast ion transport and high ion selectivity. Additionally, the SCON/surfactant membrane, serving as a power generator, exhibits huge potential in harvesting salinity&#8208;gradient energy where corresponding output power density can reach up to 9.08&#160;W m&#8722;2 under a 50&#8208;fold salinity gradient (0.5&#160;m NaCl|0.01&#160;m NaCl). The approach to extrinsic surface charge provides new and promising insight into regulating ion transport behaviors.

         <title>Colored Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells Exceeding 23.5% Efficiency Enabled by Luminescent Down&#8208;Shift Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, high photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) quantum dot (QD) films with different emission wavelengths are deposited on (silicon heterojunction) SHJ solar cells to alleviate the parasitic short&#8208;wavelength light absorption through the luminescence down&#8208;shift process. By utilizing inkjet printing technology, color&#8208;patterned SHJ solar cells are achieved, which can maintain a power conversion efficiency of 23.5% for more than 4 months.








Abstract
Colored solar panels, realized by depositing various reflection layers or structures, are emerging as power sources for building with visual aesthetics. However, these panels suffer from reduced photocurrent generation due to the less efficient light harvesting from visible light reflection and degraded power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, color&#8208;patterned silicon heterojunction solar cells are achieved by incorporating luminescent quantum dots (QDs) with high quantum yields as light converters to realize an asthenic appearance with high PCE. It is found that large bandgap (blue) QD layers can convert UV light into visible light, which can notably alleviate the parasitic absorption by the front indium tin oxide and doped amorphous silicon. Additionally, a universal optical path model is proposed to understand the light transmission process, which is suitable for luminescent down&#8208;shift devices. In this study, solar cells with a PCE exceeding 23.5% are achieved using the combination of a blue QD layer and a top low refractive index anti&#8208;reflection layer. Based on our&#160;best knoledge,the obtained PCE is the highest for a color&#8208;patterned solar cell. The results suggest an enhanced strategy involving incorporation of luminescent QDs with an optical path design for high&#8208;performance photovoltaic panels with visual aesthetics.

         <title>Lightweight 3D Graphene Metamaterials with Tunable Negative Thermal Expansion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A negatively thermal expanded 3D graphene metamaterial is created through a hyperbolically oriented freezing strategy under a dual temperature gradient along with orthogonal directions after &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8208;derived assembly among 2D graphene sheets. It has demonstrated tunable negative thermal expansion. Both experimental investigation and numerical simulation have cooperatively revealed the evolution mechanism of thermal&#8208;induced deformation at multiscale.








Abstract
In this study, a 3D graphene metamaterial (GM) showing negative thermal expansion is prepared using a strategy of hyperbolically oriented freezing under a dual temperature gradient along orthogonal directions after the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking&#8208;derived assembly of 2D graphene sheets. As the fundamental construction element of the 3D GM, the graphene sheet displays anomalous shrinking deformation with a thermal expansion coefficient of (&#8722;6.12 &#177; 0.28) &#215; 10&#8722;6 that is triggered by thermally induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrations of the C&#63743;C bonds. A combination of numerical simulations and experimental investigations validates that anomalous negative thermal expansion (NTE) behavior can be effectively delivered to scalable 3D GM candidates at larger dimensions beyond the basic 2D graphene sheets at the microscale. The multiscale design and optimization of the structural characterization of the 3D GM further realize the desirable regulation of the NTE performance with the NTE coefficient ranging from negative ((&#8722;7.5&#177; 0.65) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1) to near&#8208;zero values ((&#8722;0.8 &#177; 0.25) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1). This is attributed to the NTE&#8208;derived release regulation of the primary stress/strain of the microstructure, and the 3D GM exhibits high thermal stability while preserving the desirable structural robustness and fatigue resistance under thermo&#8208;mechanical coupling conditions. Therefore, this 3D GM offers promising potential for applications as protective skin, thermal actuator, smart switcher, and packing filler.

         <title>Switchable Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;Copolymer for Melt&#8208;Processing and Thermal Carbonization&#8212;3D Printing of Carbon Supercapacitor Electrodes with High Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyacrylonitrile copolymer is 3D patterned using melt&#8208;extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing. During prestabilization the structure is made infusible allowing thermal stabilization and carbonization without remelting. 3D printed grid&#8208;type supercapacitor electrodes exhibit high capacitance of up to 387 mF cm&#8722;2 after activation.








Abstract
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) represents the most widely used precursor for carbon fibers and carbon materials. Carbon materials stand out with their high mechanical performance, but they also show excellent electrical conductivity and high surface area. These properties render carbon materials suitable as electrode material for fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. However, PAN has to be processed from solution before being thermally converted to carbon, limiting its final format to fibers, films, and non&#8208;wovens. Here, a PAN&#8208;copolymer with an intrinsic plasticizer is presented to reduce the melting temperature and avoid undesired entering of the thermal carbonization regime. This plasticizer enables melt extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing (EAM). The plasticizer in the PAN&#8208;copolymer can be switched to increase the melting temperature after processing, allowing the 3D&#8208;melt&#8208;printed workpiece to be thermally carbonized after EAM. Melt&#8208;processing of the PAN copolymer extends the freedom&#8208;in&#8208;design of carbon materials to mold&#8208;free rapid prototyping, in the absence of solvents, which enables more economic and sustainable manufacturing processes. As an example for the capability of this material system, open meshed carbon electrodes are printed for supercapacitors that are metal&#8208; and binder&#8208;free with an optimized thickness of 1.5&#160;mm and a capacitance of up to 387 mF cm&#8722;2.

     alt="Switchable Polyacrylonitrile-Copolymer for Melt-Processing and Thermal Carbonization&#8212;3D Printing of Carbon Supercapacitor Electrodes with High Capacitance"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A polyacrylonitrile copolymer is 3D patterned using melt-extrusion-based additive manufacturing. During prestabilization the structure is made infusible allowing thermal stabilization and carbonization without remelting. 3D printed grid-type supercapacitor electrodes exhibit high capacitance of up to 387 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; after activation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) represents the most widely used precursor for carbon fibers and carbon materials. Carbon materials stand out with their high mechanical performance, but they also show excellent electrical conductivity and high surface area. These properties render carbon materials suitable as electrode material for fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors. However, PAN has to be processed from solution before being thermally converted to carbon, limiting its final format to fibers, films, and non-wovens. Here, a PAN-copolymer with an intrinsic plasticizer is presented to reduce the melting temperature and avoid undesired entering of the thermal carbonization regime. This plasticizer enables melt extrusion-based additive manufacturing (EAM). The plasticizer in the PAN-copolymer can be switched to increase the melting temperature after processing, allowing the 3D-melt-printed workpiece to be thermally carbonized after EAM. Melt-processing of the PAN copolymer extends the freedom-in-design of carbon materials to mold-free rapid prototyping, in the absence of solvents, which enables more economic and sustainable manufacturing processes. As an example for the capability of this material system, open meshed carbon electrodes are printed for supercapacitors that are metal- and binder-free with an optimized thickness of 1.5&#160;mm and a capacitance of up to 387 mF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Natural Shaping of Acellular Dermal Matrices for Implant&#8208;Based Breast Reconstruction via Expansile Kirigami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expansile kirigami acellular dermal matrix (ADM) offers natural shaping of implant&#8208;based breast reconstruction with securely holding the implant. Guided by finite element modeling, stretchability, curvature, and elasticity of kirigami ADM is precisely controlled. The developed kirigami ADM potentially offers patient&#8208;specific reconstruction while minimizing operative time and cost.








Abstract
To complete a successful and aesthetic breast reconstruction for breast cancer survivors, tissue reinforcing acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) are widely utilized to create slings/pockets to keep breast implants or autologous tissue transfer secured against the chest wall in the desired location. However, ADM sheets are 2D and cannot completely cover the entire implant without wrinkles. Here, guided by finite element modeling, a kirigami strategy is presented to cut the ADM sheets with locally and precisely controlled stretchability, curvature, and elasticity. Upon expansion, a single kirigami ADM sheet can conformably wrap the implant regardless of the shape and size, forming a natural teardrop shape; contour cuts prescribe the topographical height and fractal cuts in the center ensures horizontal expandability and thus conformability. This kirigami ADM can provide support to the reconstructed breast in the desired regions, potentially offering optimal outcomes and patient&#8208;specific reconstruction, while minimizing operative time and cost.

         <title>Regulating Charge Carrier Recombination in the Interconnecting Layer to Boost the Efficiency and Stability of Monolithic Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;dynamic management strategy for inorganic perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) is conducted to narrow the hole/electron density offset in the interconnecting layer, which contributes to a balanced charge carrier recombination thus reducing the energy loss of the TSCs. A promising 23.17% power conversion efficiency, an ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage of 2.15&#160;V, and robust operational stability are obtained.








Abstract
The charge carriers of single&#8208;junction solar cells can be fluently extracted and then collected by electrodes, leading to weak charge carrier accumulation and low energy loss (Eloss). However, in tandem solar cells (TSCs), it is a considerable challenge to obtain a balance between the densities of the holes and electrons extracted from the two respective subcells to facilitate an efficient recombination in the interconnecting layer (ICL). Herein, a charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;dynamic management strategy for inorganic perovskite/organic TSCs is proposed, centered on the simultaneous regulation of the defect states of CsPbI1.9Br1.1 perovskite in the front subcell and hole transport ability from the perovskite to ICL. The target hole density on the perovskite surface and the hole loss before reaching the ICL are significantly improved. As a result, the hole/electron density offset in the ICL can be effectively narrowed, leading to a balanced charge carrier recombination, which reduces the Eloss in TSCs. The resulting inorganic perovskite/organic 0.062&#8208;cm2 TSC exhibits a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.17% with an ultrahigh open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.15&#160;V, and the PCE of the 1.004&#8208;cm2 device (21.69%) exhibited a weak size&#8208;dependence. This charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;dynamic management strategy can also effectively enhance the operational and ultraviolet&#8208;light stabilities of the TSCs.

         <title>Enabling Durable Ultralow&#8208;k Capacitors with Enhanced Breakdown Strength in Density&#8208;Variant Nanolattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density&#8208;variant nanolattices exhibit bi&#8208;phase deformation by which the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region, acquiring high strength, and ductility like composites. This deformation improves the electrical breakdown strength of the density&#8208;variant nanolattice by &#8776;3.3&#8208;fold of the uniform&#8208;density nanolattice, while maintaining the ultralow&#8208;k&#160;of &#8776;1.2 with complete electric and dielectric stability and recoverability during 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain.








Abstract
Ultralow&#8208;k materials used in high voltage devices require mechanical resilience and electrical and dielectric stability even when subjected to mechanical loads. Existing devices with organic polymers suffer from low thermal and mechanical stability while those with inorganic porous structures struggle with poor mechanical integrity. Recently, 3D hollow&#8208;beam nanolattices have emerged as promising candidates that satisfy these requirements. However, their properties are maintained for only five stress cycles at strains below 25%. Here,&#160;we&#160;demonstrate that alumina nanolattices with different relative density distributions across their height elicit a deterministic mechanical response concomitant with a 1.5&#8211;3.3 times higher electrical breakdown strength than nanolattices with uniform density. These density&#8208;variant nanolattices exhibit an ultralow&#8208;k of &#8776;1.2, accompanied by complete electric and dielectric stability and mechanical recoverability over 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain.&#160;We&#160;explain the enhanced insulation and long&#8208;term cyclical stability by the bi&#8208;phase deformation where the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region as it is compressed before the higher&#8208;density region, allowing to simultaneously possess high strength and ductility like composites. This study highlights the superior electrical performance of the bi&#8208;phase nanolattice with a single interface in providing stable conduction and maximum breakdown strength.

         <title>Synthesis of L10&#8208;Iron Triad (Fe, Co, Ni)/Pt Intermetallic Electrocatalysts via a Phosphide&#8208;Induced Structural Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a novel synthesis of L10&#8208;iron triad (Fe, Co, Ni)/Pt nanoparticles as ORR electrocatalysts by using phosphide intermediate&#8208;induced structural phase transition. The formation of the L10 structure depends on the abundant P vacancies to accelerate the Pt diffusion into the M(iron triad)&#8208;rich skeletons, instead of the traditional route of intermetallic from solid solution.








Abstract
Structurally ordered L10&#8208;iron triad (Fe, Co, Ni)/Pt with a M(iron triad)/Pt ratio &#8776;1:1 has drawn increasing attention in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis and fuel cell technologies by virtue of the high performance derived from their strong surface strain. However, the synthesis of intermetallic L10&#8208;M(iron triad)Pt generally requires the accurate content control of the multicomponent and the sufficient thermal energy to overcome the kinetic barrier for atom diffusion. This work reports a synthesis of sub &#8776;5&#160;nm L10&#8208;intermetallic nanoparticles using phosphide intermediate&#8208;induced structural phase transition. Taking the L10&#8208;CoPt intermetallic, for example, the formation of the L10 structure depends on the Co2P intermediates can provide abundant P vacancies to accelerate the Pt diffusion into the orthorhombic Co&#8208;rich skeletons, instead of the traditional route of intermetallic from solid solution. L10&#8208;CoPt prepared by this method has a high degree of ordering and shows the broad adaptability of various Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts with different loading and states to improve their electrocatalytic performance. Additionally, the other L10&#8208;M(iron triad)Pt intermetallics, i.e., L10&#8208;NiPt and L10&#8208;FePt, are also prepared through this phosphide&#8208;induced phase transition. The findings provide a promising strategy for designing other intermetallic materials alloy materials using a structural phase transition induced by a second phase.

This work reports a synthesis of sub &#8776;5&#160;nm &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-intermetallic nanoparticles using phosphide intermediate-induced structural phase transition. Taking the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-CoPt intermetallic, for example, the formation of the &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; structure depends on the Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P intermediates can provide abundant P vacancies to accelerate the Pt diffusion into the orthorhombic Co-rich skeletons, instead of the traditional route of intermetallic from solid solution. &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-CoPt prepared by this method has a high degree of ordering and shows the broad adaptability of various Pt-based electrocatalysts with different loading and states to improve their electrocatalytic performance. Additionally, the other &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;(iron triad)Pt intermetallics, i.e., &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-NiPt and &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;1&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;-FePt, are also prepared through this phosphide-induced phase transition. The findings provide a promising strategy for designing other intermetallic materials alloy materials using a structural phase transition induced by a second phase.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MoS2&#8208;Mediated Epitaxial Plating of Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large area mono&#8208;oriented MoS2 is employed as the substrate for realizing epitaxial plating of zinc. The edges of MoS2 are proved to have an inducing effect on zinc deposition and thus facilitating the vertical growth of zinc. When only exposing basal plane of the large area mono&#8208;oriented MoS2, epitaxial zinc deposition with high (002) plane orientation is realized.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;based anodes (Li, Zn, etc.) are regarded as promising solutions for next&#8208;generation advanced batteries due to their high theoretical specific capacities. However, most of these metal anodes suffer from dendrite growth, which severely restricts their practical applications. Recently, epitaxial anode metal deposition by choosing a suitable substrate has received tremendous attention as an effective strategy to suppress dendrites. However, the epitaxial relationship between plated metal and the substrate has been a subject of debate. Herein, large&#8208;area, mono&#8208;orientated 2D material (MoS2) is used, for the first time, to electrodeposit truly epitaxial Zn anodes. The continuous (without edges) mono&#8208;orientated MoS2 films are shown to be an effective strategy for suppressing metal dendrites. In addition, the epitaxial nature of the electrodeposited Zn anode is proven by pole figure analysis, which provides the first demonstration of truly epitaxial Zn anode growth over large area as metal anode protection strategy through epitaxy.

         <title>A Twin S&#8208;Scheme Artificial Photosynthetic System with Self&#8208;Assembled Heterojunctions Yields Superior Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solar hydrogen generation using heterojunction photocatalysts imitating natural photosynthetic systems is fast emerging. The poor charge separation and futile charge transports routes in Z&#8208;Scheme heterojunctions; however, constitute a huge bottleneck for hydrogen evolution. A Twin S&#8208;Scheme artificial photosynthetic system is developed to overcome this bottleneck, which yields an outstanding hydrogen evolution rate and high apparent quantum efficiency.








Abstract
Designing heterojunction photocatalysts imitating natural photosynthetic systems has been a promising approach for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. However, in the traditional Z&#8208;Scheme artificial photosynthetic systems, the poor charge separation, and rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers remain a huge bottleneck. To rationally design S&#8208;Scheme (i.e., Step scheme) heterojunctions by avoiding the futile charge transport routes is therefore seen as an attractive approach to achieving high hydrogen evolution rates. Herein, a twin S&#8208;scheme heterojunction is proposed involving graphitic C3N4 nanosheets self&#8208;assembled with hydrogen&#8208;doped rutile TiO2 nanorods and anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. This catalyst shows an excellent photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 62.37&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and high apparent quantum efficiency of 45.9% at 365&#160;nm. The significant enhancement of photocatalytic performance is attributed to the efficient charge separation and transfer induced by the unique twin S&#8208;scheme structure. The charge transfer route in the twin S&#8208;scheme is confirmed by in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spin&#8208;trapping tests. Femtosecond transient absorption (fs&#8208;TA) spectroscopy, transient&#8208;state surface photovoltage (TPV), and other ex situ characterizations further corroborate the efficient charge transport across the catalyst interface. This work offers a new perspective on constructing artificial photosynthetic systems with S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions to enhance photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Photolithography&#8208;Based Microfabrication of Biodegradable Flexible and Stretchable Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient or biodegradable flexible and stretchable devices which degrade into benign components, especially in biofluids or aqueous solutions, can pave way for the next generation of eco&#8208;friendly electronics for both industrial and medical applications. A photolithography&#8208;based approach allows highly miniaturized and scalable fabrication of flexible/stretchable biodegradable devices using standard semiconductor manufacturing techniques.








Abstract
Biodegradable sensors based on integrating conductive layers with polymeric materials in flexible and stretchable forms have been established. However, the lack of a generalized microfabrication method results in large&#8208;sized, low spatial density, and low device yield compared to the silicon&#8208;based devices manufactured via batch&#8208;compatible microfabrication processes. Here, a batch fabrication&#8208;compatible photolithography&#8208;based microfabrication approach for biodegradable and highly miniaturized essential sensor components is presented on flexible and stretchable substrates. Up to 1600 devices are fabricated within a 1 cm2 footprint and then the functionality of various biodegradable passive electrical components, mechanical sensors, and chemical sensors is demonstrated on flexible and stretchable substrates. The results are highly repeatable and consistent, proving the proposed method's high device yield and high&#8208;density potential. This simple, innovative, and robust fabrication recipe allows complete freedom over the applicability of various biodegradable materials with different properties toward the unique application of interests. The process offers a route to utilize standard micro&#8208;fabrication procedures toward scalable fabrication of highly miniaturized flexible and stretchable transient sensors and electronics.

         <title>A Highly Crystalline Single Layer 2D Polymer for Low Variability and Excellent Scalability Molecular Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline single layer 2D polymers (SL&#8208;2DPs) are prepared and further used as an active layer in the memristor. The devices exhibit low variability, high reliability in terms of yield, stability and durability, nanometer scalability, as well as distinguished bending endurance, which verified the unambiguous role of SL&#8208;2DP film in diverse applications from high density information storage to ultra&#8208;thin flexible electronics.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale growth of highly crystalline single layer 2D polymers (SL&#8208;2DPs) and their subsequent integration into memristors is key to advancing the development of high&#8208;density data storage devices. However, leakage problems resulting from the porous structure of 2DPs continue to make such advances extremely challenging. Herein,&#160;we&#160;overcome this issue by incorporating long alkoxy chains into key molecular building blocks to obtain a highly crystalline 2DP, as visualized by scanning tunneling microscopy, and prevent metal permeation in the subsequent device fabrication process. SL&#8208;2DP memristors constructed via direct evaporation of the top electrodes exhibit low variability (&#963;Vset&#160;= 0.14) due to the single&#8208;monomer&#8208;thick feature together with the high regular structure and coordination ability which minimizes the stochastic spatial distribution of conductive filaments (CFs) in both vertical and lateral dimensions. The variability is further decreased to 0.04 by confining the formation and fracture of CFs to the interface through the utilization of bilayer junctions. Using peak force tunneling atomic force microscopy, the nanometer scalability (&lt; 50 nm2) and low power consumption of these molecular memristor devices are demonstrated.

         <title>Perovskite Solar Cell&#8208;Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Flexible Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Fast Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance flexible photodetector is realized by gating an organic electrochemical transistor with a perovskite solar cell, outperforming previously reported flexible photodetectors, which can be attributed to the high transconductance of the transistor. The device can monitor photoplethysmogram signals and peripheral oxygen saturation under ambient light and even remotely. This novel device design demonstrates great potential in emerging wearable optoelectronics.








Abstract
Photodetectors (PDs) are the building block of various imaging and sensing applications. However, commercially available PDs based on crystalline inorganic semiconductors cannot meet the requirements of emerging wearable/implantable applications due to their rigidity and fragility, which creates the need for flexible devices. Here, a high&#8208;performance flexible PD is presented by gating an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) with a perovskite solar cell. Due to the ultrahigh transconductance of the OECT, the device demonstrates a high gain of &#8776;106, a fast response time of 67&#160;&#181;s and an ultrahigh detectivity of 6.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1017 Jones to light signals under a low working voltage (&#8804;0.6&#160;V). Thanks to the ultrahigh sensitivity and fast response, the device can track photoplethysmogram signals and peripheral oxygen saturation under ambient light and even provide contactless remote sensing, offering a low&#8208;power and convenient way for continuous vital signs monitoring. This work offers a novel strategy for realizing high&#8208;performance flexible PDs that are promising for low&#8208;power, user&#8208;friendly and wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Perturbed Multiresonance TADF Emitter Enables High&#8208;Efficiency and Ultralow Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off Nonsensitized OLEDs with Pure Green Gamut</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;perturbation approach is developed for boosting the reverse intersystem crossing rate of multiresonance type B&#8211;N molecule by utilizing the spin&#8211;orbit coupling effect of a gold atom. The resultant emitter exhibits a short&#8208;lived thermally activated delayed fluorescence, which enables the fabrication of high&#8208;performance nonsensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diode with a high external quantum efficiency, little efficiency roll&#8208;off, and good color purity.








Abstract
Multiresonance (MR)&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters based on B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatics are desirable for ultrahigh&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and narrow bandwidth. But the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates of MR&#8208;TADF emitters are usually small, resulting in severe device efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness. To solve this issue, a sensitizer for the MR&#8208;TADF emitter has been required. Herein, a new MR&#8208;TADF emitter is developed through coordination of Au with B/N&#8208;embedded polycyclic ligand. Benefitting from the Au perturbation, the RISC rate is dramatically accelerated to 2.3 &#215; 107 s&#8722;1, leading to delayed fluorescence lifetime as short as 4.3 &#181;s. Meanwhile, the PLQY of 95% and full width at half maximum of 39&#160;nm (0.18&#160;eV) are essentially unchanged after metal coordination. Therefore, a high PLQY, short delayed fluorescence lifetime, and high color purity are concurrently realized in a single TADF emitter. Accordingly, vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs exhibit high&#8208;performance electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.8% without sensitization. The EQE is maintained as high as 32.3% at 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Furthermore, solution&#8208;processed OLED based on the emitter also achieves excellent performance with a maximum EQE of 25.7% and a small efficiency roll&#8208;off.

         <title>Ferromagnetic Flexible Electronics for Brain&#8208;Wide Selective Neural Recording</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel injectable class of flexible electronics with stable recording, omnidirectional steering, and precise navigating capabilities based on remote magnetic actuation is developed. Its functionality, stability, extensibility, and biocompatibility for large&#8208;scale electrophysiological monitoring the neural activities of distinct neuron populations in the rodent brains are successfully demonstrated in this study.








Abstract
Flexible microelectronics capable of straightforward implantation, remotely controlled navigation, and stable long&#8208;term recording hold great promise in diverse medical applications, particularly in deciphering complex functions of neural circuits in the brain. Existing flexible electronics, however, are often limited in bending and buckling during implantation, and unable to access a large brain region. Here, an injectable class of electronics with stable recording, omnidirectional steering, and precise navigating capabilities based on magnetic actuation is presented. After simple transcriptional injection, the rigid coatings are biodegraded quickly and the bundles of magnetic&#8208;nanoparticles&#8208;coated microelectrodes become separated, ultra&#8208;flexible, and magnetic actuated for further minimally invasive&#160;three&#8208;dimensional&#160;interpenetration in the brain. As proof of concept, this paradigm&#8208;shifting approach is demonstrated for selective and multiplexed neural activities recording across distant regions in the deep rodent brains. Coupling with optogenetic neural stimulation, the unique capabilities of this platform in electrophysiological readouts of projection dynamics in vivo are also demonstrated. The ability of these miniaturized, remotely controllable, and biocompatible ferromagnetic flexible electronics to afford minimally invasive manipulations in the soft tissues of the mammalian brain foreshadows applications in other organ systems, with great potential for broad utility in biomedical science and engineering.

         <title>Complex Living Materials Made by Light&#8208;Based Printing of Genetically Programmed Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;based printing can be exploited to shape bacteria&#8208;laden hydrogels into complex living materials. By combining a wild&#8208;type bioluminescent bacterium with a deliberately engineered E. coli strain, a living device is printed and used as a self&#8208;powered chemical sensor that simultaneously generate and absorb light through the metabolic activity of the embedded microorganisms.








Abstract
Living materials with embedded microorganisms can genetically encode attractive sensing, self&#8208;repairing, and responsive functionalities for applications in medicine, robotics, and infrastructure. While the synthetic toolbox for genetically engineering bacteria continues to expand, technologies to shape bacteria&#8208;laden living materials into complex 3D geometries are still rather limited. Here, it is shown that bacteria&#8208;laden hydrogels can be shaped into living materials with unusual architectures and functionalities using readily available light&#8208;based printing techniques. Bioluminescent and melanin&#8208;producing bacteria are used to create complex materials with autonomous chemical&#8208;sensing capabilities by harnessing the metabolic activity of wild&#8208;type and engineered microorganisms. The shaping freedom offered by printing technologies and the rich biochemical diversity available in bacteria provides ample design space for the creation and exploration of complex living materials with programmable functionalities for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Piezoelectric 1T Phase MoSe2 Nanoflowers and Crystallographically Textured Electrodes for Enhanced Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric 1T MoSe2/carbon cloth (CC) nanocomposite is fabricated on a crystallographically textured electrode through a facile solvothermal method. The generated piezoelectric field can serve as the zinc&#8208;ion piezo&#8208;electrochemical coupling accelerator to promote kinetics. By virtue of intrinsic piezoelectric effect and phase engineering strategy, this nanopiezocomposite possesses enhanced kinetics and desirable electrochemical performances at low temperatures.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for zinc&#8208;ion storage owing to their large interlayer spacings. However, their capabilities are still limited by sluggish kinetics and inferior conductivities. In this study, a facile one&#8208;pot solvothermal method is exploited to vertically plant piezoelectric 1T MoSe2&#160;nanoflowers on carbon cloth (CC) to fabricate crystallographically textured electrodes. The self&#8208;built&#8208;in electric field owing to the intrinsic piezoelectricity during the intercalation/deintercalation processes can serve as an additional piezo&#8208;electrochemical coupling accelerator to enhance the migration of Zn2+. Moreover, the expanded interlayer distance (9&#8211;10&#160;&#197;), overall high hydrophilicity, and conductivity of the 1T phase MoSe2&#160;also promoted the kinetics. These advantages endow the tailored 1T MoSe2/CC nanopiezocomposite with feasible Zn2+ diffusion and desirable electrochemical performances at room and low temperatures.

&lt;p&gt;The piezoelectric 1T MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/carbon cloth (CC) nanocomposite is fabricated on a crystallographically textured electrode through a facile solvothermal method. The generated piezoelectric field can serve as the zinc-ion piezo-electrochemical coupling accelerator to promote kinetics. By virtue of intrinsic piezoelectric effect and phase engineering strategy, this nanopiezocomposite possesses enhanced kinetics and desirable electrochemical performances at low temperatures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are regarded as promising cathode materials for zinc-ion storage owing to their large interlayer spacings. However, their capabilities are still limited by sluggish kinetics and inferior conductivities. In this study, a facile one-pot solvothermal method is exploited to vertically plant piezoelectric 1T MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;nanoflowers on carbon cloth (CC) to fabricate crystallographically textured electrodes. The self-built-in electric field owing to the intrinsic piezoelectricity during the intercalation/deintercalation processes can serve as an additional piezo-electrochemical coupling accelerator to enhance the migration of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, the expanded interlayer distance (9&#8211;10&#160;&#197;), overall high hydrophilicity, and conductivity of the 1T phase MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;also promoted the kinetics. These advantages endow the tailored 1T MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CC nanopiezocomposite with feasible Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion and desirable electrochemical performances at room and low temperatures. Moreover, 1T MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CC-based quasi-solid-state zinc-ion batteries are constructed to evaluate the potential of the proposed material in low-temperature flexible energy storage devices. This work expounds the positive effect of intrinsic piezoelectricity of TMDs on Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; migration and further explores the availabilities of TMDs in low-temperature wearable energy-storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier for Gene Therapy via Systemic Administration of GSH&#8208;Responsive Silica Nanocapsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of glutathione&#8208;responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) is created and screened for brain gene editing via systemic administration. SNCs conjugated with glucose and rabies virus glycoprotein peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass intact blood&#8211;brain barrier, enabling brain&#8208;wide delivery of various biologics (mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA, and Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein).








Abstract
CRISPR genome editing can&#160;potentially treat the root causes of many genetic diseases, including central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the promise of brain&#8208;targeted therapeutic genome editing relies on the efficient delivery of biologics bypassing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which represents a major challenge in the development of CRISPR therapeutics.&#160;We&#160;created and screened&#160;a library of glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) for brain targeted delivery of biologics via systemic administration. In vivo studies demonstrate that systemically delivered SNCs conjugated with glucose and rabies virus glycoprotein peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass the intact BBB, enabling brain&#8208;wide delivery of various biologics including CRISPR genome editors targeting different genes in both Ai14 reporter mice and wild&#8208;type mice. In particular, up to 28% neuron editing via systemic delivery of Cre mRNA in Ai14 mice, up to 6.1% amyloid precursor protein (App) gene editing (resulting in 19.1% reduction in the expression level of intact APP), and up to 3.9% tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene editing (resulting in 30.3% reduction in the expression level of TH) in wild&#8208;type mice are observed. This versatile SNC nanoplatform may offer a novel strategy for the treatment of CNS disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease.

         <title>Identification of the Origin for Reconstructed Active Sites on Oxyhydroxide for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The irreversible reconstruction behavior accompanied by copper dynamic evolution for cobalt iron layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) precatalyst to form CoFeCuOOH active species with high&#8208;valent Co species is reported, identifying the origin of reconstructed active sites and proposing oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;site mechanism during oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The regulation of atomic and electronic structures of active sites plays an important role in the rational design of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts toward electrocatalytic hydrogen generation. However, the precise identification of the active sites for surface reconstruction behavior during OER remains elusive for water&#8208;alkali electrolysis. Herein, irreversible reconstruction behavior accompanied by copper dynamic evolution for cobalt iron layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) precatalyst to form CoFeCuOOH active species with high&#8208;valent Co species is reported, identifying the origin of reconstructed active sites through operando UV&#8208;Visible (UV&#8211;vis), in situ Raman, and X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure (XAFS) spectroscopies. Density functional theory analysis rationalizes this typical electronic structure evolution causing the transfer of intramolecular electrons to form ligand holes, promoting the reconstruction of active sites. Specifically, unambiguous identification of active sites for CoFeCuOOH is explored by in situ 18O isotope&#8208;labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and supported by theoretical calculation, confirming mechanism switch to oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;site mechanism (OVSM) pathway on lattice oxygen. This work enables to elucidate the vital role of dynamic active&#8208;site generation and the representative contribution of OVSM pathway for efficient OER performance.

         <title>Engineered Phage with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Photosensitizer in Cocktail Therapy against Sepsis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy combining the aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer with phages is developed that not only selectively identifies bacterial species but also shows a powerful ability to kill pathogenic bacteria in sepsis diagnosis and treatment. This synergetic therapy strategy combining phage cocktail therapy and photodynamic therapy offers a strong &#8220;1&#160;+&#160;1&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8221; bactericidal efficacy in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Sepsis, a widely recognized disease, is characterized by multiple pathogen infections. Therefore, it is imperative to develop methods that can efficiently identify and neutralize pathogen species. Phage cocktail therapy utilizes the host specificity of phages to adapt to infect resistant bacteria. However, its low sterilization stability efficiency and lack of imaging units seriously restrict its application. Here, a novel strategy combining the aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer (AIE&#8208;PS) TBTCP&#8208;PMB with phages through a nucleophilic substitution reaction between benzyl bromide and sulfhydryl groups to remove pathogenic bacteria for sepsis treatment is proposed. This strategy retains the phage's host specificity while possessing AIE&#8208;PS characteristics with a fluorescence imaging function and reactive&#160;oxygen&#160;species (ROS) for detecting and sterilizing bacteria. This synergetic strategy combining phage cocktail therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows a strong &#8220;1&#160;+&#160;1&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8221; bactericidal efficacy and superior performance in sepsis mouse models with good biocompatibility. Furthermore, the strategy can quickly diagnose blood infections of clinical blood samples. This simple and accurate strategy provides a promising therapeutic platform for rapid pathogen detection and point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis. Moreover, it presents a new method for expanding the library of antibacterial drugs to develop new strain identification and improve infectious disease treatment, thereby demonstrating strong translational potential.

         <title>Interfacial Instability&#8208;Induced (3I) Adhesives through &#8220;Mediator&#8221; Solvent Diffusion for Robust Underoil Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A principle of interfacial instability&#8208;induced liquid replacement is proposed by innovatively introducing dual&#8208;soluble &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvents to develop new&#8208;type 3I adhesives, realizing instant and robust adhesion on different substrates and in diverse&#160;oils/organic solvents. This principle can be generally applied to different kinds of &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvents and adhesive polymers, shedding new light on the design of new&#8208;generation adhesives facing complex environments.








Abstract
Underoil adhesives are intensively needed in case of oil spill caused by pipeline rupture, but remain a challenge owing to the obstruction of oil layer or their swelling in oil. Herein, a general solvent diffusion principle is demonstrated by introducing dual&#8208;soluble &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvents to develop a new type of interfacial instability&#8208;induced (3I) adhesives, achieving effective underoil adhesion on various substrates and blocking the oil leakage within seconds. Microscopic characterization reveals a fast and dynamic solvent exchange process that destroys the oil layer by liquid&#8211;liquid interfacial diffusion between the &#8220;mediator&#8221; solvent and oil, enabling 3I adhesives to contact the solid surfaces directly. The principle of interfacial instability&#8208;induced liquid replacement is quite different from typical immiscible liquid replacement and is not restricted by the surface tension of solvents, surface energy, and roughness of solid surfaces, successfully directing the construction of a series of effective 3I adhesives with commercially available feedstocks. This study provides a unique clue for the design of next&#8208;generation adhesives in complex environments.

The principle of interfacial instability-induced liquid replacement is quite different from typical immiscible liquid replacement and is not restricted by the surface tension of solvents, surface energy, and roughness of solid surfaces, successfully directing the construction of a series of effective 3I adhesives with commercially available feedstocks. This study provides a unique clue for the design of next-generation adhesives in complex environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Simple screen&#8208;printing technology is used to fabricate a user&#8208;friendly, high&#8208;performance stamp&#8208;like paper&#8208;based TEG and TE array infrared display. The stamp&#8208;like paper&#8208;based TEG can be torn apart by hands with specific TE pairs, making it possible to fit different size of heat source surface. The TE infrared display realizes the encryption and decryption of information.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) devices exhibit considerable application potential in Internet of Things and personal health monitoring systems. However, TE self&#8208;powered devices are expensive and their fabrication process is complex. Therefore, large&#8208;scale preparation of the TE devices remains challenging. In this work, simple screen&#8208;printing technology is used to fabricate a user&#8208;friendly and high&#8208;performance paper&#8208;based TE device, which can be used in both stamp&#8208;like paper&#8208;based TE generators and infrared displays. When used as a paper&#8208;based TE generator, an output power of 940.8 &#181;W is achieved with a temperature difference of 40 K. The programmable infrared pattern based on the TE array display could be used to realize encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting properties. Moreover, a visual extraction algorithm is used to develop a mobile application for processing and decoding the infrared quick response code information. These findings offer an exciting approach to using paper&#8208;based TEGs in applications such as energy harvesting devices, optical encryption, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and dynamic infrared display.

         <title>Mechanical Janus Structures by Soft&#8211;Hard Material Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile engineering strategy of designing soft&#8211;hard materials integrated mechanical Janus structures by leveraging distinct mechanical properties between soft and hard phase materials is provided. Harnessing the unique rotation behavior of mechanical Janus structures leads to the assembly of superstructures with well&#8208;ordered organizations, opening an avenue for the future exploration of functional structures and devices with seamless soft&#8211;hard material integration.








Abstract
Engineering Janus structures that possess anisotropic features in functions have attracted growing attention for a wide range of applications in sensors, catalysis, and biomedicine, and are yet usually designed at the nanoscale with distinct physical or chemical functionalities in their opposite sides. Inspired by the seamless integration of soft and hard materials in biological structures, here a mechanical Janus structure composed of soft and hard materials with a dramatic difference in mechanical properties at an additively manufacturable macroscale is presented. In the combination of extensive experimental, theoretical, and computational studies, the design principle of soft&#8211;hard materials integrated mechanical Janus structures is established and their unique rotation mechanism is addressed. The systematic studies of assembling the Janus structure units into superstructures with well&#8208;ordered organizations by programming the local rotations are further shown, providing a direct route of designing superstructures by leveraging mechanical Janus structures with unique soft&#8211;hard material integration. Applications are conducted to demonstrate the features and functionalities of assembled superstructures with local ordered organizations in regulating and filtering acoustic wave propagations, thereby providing exemplification applications of mechanical Janus design in functional structures and devices.

         <title>The Use of Exchange Coupled Atom Qubits as Atomic&#8208;Scale Magnetic Field Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron spin qubits in silicon are shown to serve as magnetic field sensors at the atomic scale. The work presents a novel spectroscopy technique where a pair of exchange&#8208;coupled electron spins on phosphorus qubits in silicon is used to probe the local magnetic fields to determine the exact location of nuclear spins within the silicon chip.








Abstract
Phosphorus atoms in silicon offer a rich quantum computing platform where both nuclear and electron spins can be used to store and process quantum information. While individual control of electron and nuclear spins has been demonstrated, the interplay between them during qubit operations has been largely unexplored. This study investigates the use of exchange&#8208;based operation between donor bound electron spins to probe the local magnetic fields experienced by the qubits with exquisite precision at the atomic scale. To achieve this, coherent exchange oscillations are performed between two electron spin qubits, where the left and right qubits are hosted by three and two phosphorus donors, respectively. The frequency spectrum of exchange oscillations shows quantized changes in the local magnetic fields at the qubit sites, corresponding to the different hyperfine coupling between the electron and each of the qubit&#8208;hosting nuclear spins. This ability to sense the hyperfine fields of individual nuclear spins using the exchange interaction constitutes a unique metrology technique, which reveals the exact crystallographic arrangements of the phosphorus atoms in the silicon crystal for each qubit. The detailed knowledge obtained of the local magnetic environment can then be used to engineer hyperfine fields in multi&#8208;donor qubits for high&#8208;fidelity two&#8208;qubit&#160;gates.

         <title>A Molecular Engineering Strategy for Achieving Blue Phosphorescent Carbon Dots with Outstanding Efficiency above 50%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a molecular engineering strategy, more functional groups are modified on the surface of carbon dots embedded in the rigid silica network, which not only greatly boosts the spin&#8208;orbit coupling, improves the intersystem crossing rate, but also stabilizes the triplet excited state, resulting in efficient blue phosphorescence.








Abstract
Highly efficient emission has been a long&#8208;lasting pursuit for carbon dots (CDs) owing to their enormous potential in optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, their room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) performance still largely lags behind their outstanding fluorescence emission, especially in the blue&#160;spectral region. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency blue RTP CDs have been designed and constructed via a simple molecular engineering strategy, enabling CDs with an unprecedented phosphorescence quantum efficiency of to 50.17% and a long lifetime of 2.03 s. This treating route facilitates the formation of high&#8208;density (n, &#960;*) configurations in the CD &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugate system through the introduction of abundant functional groups, which can evoke a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and further promote the intersystem crossing from singlet to triplet excited states and radiative recombination from triplet excited states to ground state. With blue phosphorescent CDs as triplet donors, green, red, and white afterglow composites are successfully fabricated via effective phosphorescence F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. Importantly, the color temperature of the white afterglow emission can be widely and facilely tuned from cool white to pure white and warm white. Moreover, advanced information encryption, light illumination, and afterglow/dynamic visual display have been demonstrated when using these multicolor&#8208;emitting CD&#8208;based afterglow systems.

         <title>A Highly Efficacious Electrical Biofilm Treatment System for Combating Chronic Wound Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficacious electrical biofilm treatment system is developed for combating chronic wound bacterial infections. This system applies 75 mA cm&#8722;2 current to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery into biofilm&#8208;infected wounds simultaneously. As a result, this system can rapidly reduce biofilm density by 4&#8211;5 log10 scales using only 65 min treatment.








Abstract
Biofilm infection has a high prevalence in chronic wounds and can delay wound healing. Current treatment using debridement and antibiotic administration imposes a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. To address their limitations, a highly efficacious electrical antibiofilm treatment system is described in this paper. This system uses high&#8208;intensity current (75&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery into biofilm&#8208;infected wounds simultaneously. Combining these two effects, this system uses short treatments (&#8804;2&#160;h) to reduce bacterial count of methicillin&#8208;resistant S.&#160;aureus (MRSA) biofilm&#8208;infected ex vivo skin wounds from 1010 to 105.2 colony&#8208;forming&#160;units&#160;(CFU) g&#8722;1. Taking advantage of the hydrogel ionic circuit design, this system enhances the in vivo safety of high&#8208;intensity current application compared to conventional devices. The in vivo antibiofilm efficacy of the system is tested using a diabetic mouse&#8208;based wound infection model. MRSA biofilm bacterial count decreases from 109.0 to 104.6 CFU g&#8722;1 at 1 day post&#8208;treatment and to 103.3 CFU g&#8722;1 at 7 days post&#8208;treatment, both of which are below the clinical threshold for infection. Overall, this novel technology provides a quick, safe, yet highly efficacious treatment to chronic wound biofilm infections.

     alt="A Highly Efficacious Electrical Biofilm Treatment System for Combating Chronic Wound Bacterial Infections"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A highly efficacious electrical biofilm treatment system is developed for combating chronic wound bacterial infections. This system applies 75 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; current to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery into biofilm-infected wounds simultaneously. As a result, this system can rapidly reduce biofilm density by 4&#8211;5 log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; scales using only 65 min treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biofilm infection has a high prevalence in chronic wounds and can delay wound healing. Current treatment using debridement and antibiotic administration imposes a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. To address their limitations, a highly efficacious electrical antibiofilm treatment system is described in this paper. This system uses high-intensity current (75&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery into biofilm-infected wounds simultaneously. Combining these two effects, this system uses short treatments (&#8804;2&#160;h) to reduce bacterial count of methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;S.&#160;aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) biofilm-infected ex vivo skin wounds from 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5.2&lt;/sup&gt; colony-forming&#160;units&#160;(CFU) g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Taking advantage of the hydrogel ionic circuit design, this system enhances the in vivo safety of high-intensity current application compared to conventional devices. The in vivo antibiofilm efficacy of the system is tested using a diabetic mouse-based wound infection model. MRSA biofilm bacterial count decreases from 10&lt;sup&gt;9.0&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;4.6&lt;/sup&gt; CFU g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 day post-treatment and to 10&lt;sup&gt;3.3&lt;/sup&gt; CFU g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 7 days post-treatment, both of which are below the clinical threshold for infection. Overall, this novel technology provides a quick, safe, yet highly efficacious treatment to chronic wound biofilm infections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Zn Anodes with Triple Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;gradient electrode that well integrates gradient conductivity, zincophilicity, and porosity is facilely constructed for a dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. The triple&#8208;gradient design synergistically optimizes the electric field distribution, Zn2+ ion flux, and Zn deposition behavior, thus preventing dendrite growth and achieving long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are highly desirable for sustainable energy storage, but the undesired Zn dendrites growth severely shortens the cycle life. Herein, a triple&#8208;gradient electrode that simultaneously integrates gradient conductivity, zincophilicity, and porosity is facilely constructed for a dendrite&#8208;free Zn anode. The simple mechanical rolling&#8208;induced triple&#8208;gradient design effectively optimizes the electric field distribution, Zn2+ ion flux, and Zn deposition paths in the Zn anode, thus synergistically achieving a bottom&#8208;up deposition behavior for Zn metals and preventing the short circuit from top dendrite growth. As a result, the electrode with triple gradients delivers a low overpotential of 35&#160;mV and operates steadily over 400&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8208;2/2.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8208;2 and 250&#160;h at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2/1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8208;2, far surpassing the non&#8208;gradient, single&#8208;gradient and dual&#8208;gradient counterparts. The well&#8208;tunable materials and structures with the facile fabrication method of the triple&#8208;gradient strategy will bring inspiration for high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordinated Pd Site within Amorphous Palladium Selenide for Active, Selective, and Stable H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous PdSe2 nanoparticles (a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs) with low&#8208;coordinated Pd sites have been successfully prepared and applied as highly efficient catalysts for H2O2 electrosynthesis. The low&#8208;coordinated Pd sites with disordered arrangement in a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs canoptimize the adsorption toward oxygenated intermediate and suppress the cleavage of O&#8211;O bond, leading to&#160;significant enhancement on the catalytic performance toward H2O2 electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability are essential for the practical applications of H2O2 electrosynthesis technology, but it is still formidably challenging. It is reported that the low&#8208;coordinated structure of Pd sites in amorphous PdSe2 nanoparticles (a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs) can significantly boost the electrocatalytic synthesis of H2O2. Detailed investigations and theoretical calculations reveal that the disordered arrangement of Pd atoms in a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs can promote the activity, while the Pd sites with low&#8208;coordinated environment can optimize the adsorption toward oxygenated intermediate and suppress the cleavage of O&#8211;O bond, leading to a significant enhancement in both the H2O2 selectivity and productivity. Impressively, a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs/C exhibits high H2O2 selectivity over 90% in different pH electrolytes. H2O2 productivities with &#8776;3245.7, 1725.5, and 2242.1&#160;mmol gPd&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in 0.1&#160;m KOH, 0.1&#160;m HClO4, and 0.1&#160;m Na2SO4 can be achieved, respectively, in an H&#8208;cell electrolyzer, being a pH&#8208;universal catalyst for H2O2 electrochemical synthesis. Furthermore, the produced H2O2 can reach 1081.8&#160;ppm in a three&#8208;phase flow cell reactor after 2&#160;h enrichment in 0.1&#160;m Na2SO4, showing the great potential of a&#8208;PdSe2 NPs/C for practical H2O2 electrosynthesis.

         <title>Fast, Multi&#8208;Bit, and Vis&#8208;Infrared Broadband Nonvolatile Optoelectronic Memory with MoS2/2D&#8208;Perovskite Van der Waals Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique organic/inorganic alternating chain structure of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite enables the combination of the advantages of floating gate and charge trap memories to achieve fast, multi&#8208;bit, and vis&#8208;infrared broadband nonvolatile optoelectronic memory.








Abstract
Nonvolatile optoelectronic memory (NVOM) integrating the functions of optical sensing and long&#8208;term memory can efficiently process and store a large amount of visual scene information, which has become the core requirement of multiple intelligence scenarios. However, realizing NVOM with vis&#8208;infrared broadband response is still challenging. Herein, the room temperature vis&#8208;infrared broadband NVOM based on few&#8208;layer MoS2/2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite (2D&#8208;RPP) van der Waals heterojunction is realized. It is found that the 2D&#8208;RPP converts the initial n&#8208;type MoS2 into p&#8208;type and facilitates hole transfer between them. Furthermore, the 2D&#8208;RPP rich in interband states serves as an effective electron trapping layer as well as broadband photoresponsive layer. As a result, the dielectric&#8208;free MoS2/2D&#8208;RPP heterojunction enables the charge to transfer quickly under external field, which enables a large memory window (104&#160;V), fast write speed of 20 &#181;s, and optical programmable characteristics from visible light (405&#160;nm) to telecommunication wavelengths (i.e., 1550&#160;nm) at room temperature. Trapezoidal optical programming can produce up to 100 recognizable states (&gt;6 bits), with operating energy as low as 5.1 pJ per optical program. These results provide a route to realize fast, low power, multi&#8208;bit optoelectronic memory from visible to the infrared wavelength.

         <title>Rapid Melt&#8208;Quenching Enables General Synthesis of High&#8208;Loading Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Bicontinuous Nanoporous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile approach is developed for synthesizing nanoporous metal compound supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal loadings, representing a several&#8208;fold improvement of metal loading compared to benchmarks. Libraries of SACs can be synthesized by choosing various combinations of supporting matrixes and single atoms, thus achieving the synergistic catalysis.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have attracted extensive attention due to their unique atomic structures and extraordinary activities in catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the lack of general and efficient approaches for producing high&#8208;density single atoms on suitably tailored supporting matrixes hinders their industrial applications. Here, a rapid melt&#8208;quenching strategy with high throughput to synthesize single atoms with high metal&#8208;atom loadings of up to 9.7 wt% or 2.6 at% on nanoporous metal compounds is reported, representing several&#8208;fold improvements compared to benchmarks in the literature. Mechanism characterizations reveal that the high&#8208;temperature melting provides the essential liquid environment and activation energy to achieve the atomization of metals, while the following rapid&#8208;quenching pins the isolated metal atoms and stabilizes the coordination environment. In comparison with carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts, various collaboration combinations of single atoms and nanoporous metal compounds can be synthesized using the strategy, thus achieving efficient hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted H2 production. This synthesis protocol is highly compatible with automatic operation, which provides a feasible and general route to design and manufacture specific single&#8208;atom catalysts with tunable atomic metal components and supporting matrixes, thus promoting the deployment of single&#8208;atom catalysts for various energy technology applications.

         <title>Synthesis of MAPbBr3&#8208;Polymer Composite Films by Photolysis of DMF: Toward Transparent and Flexible Optical Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) with Hierarchical Multilevel Complexity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent optical PUFs with hierarchical patterns are prepared by the top&#8208;down photolithography in combination with the bottom&#8208;up phase separation process on MAPbBr3&#8208;PMMA/PS composite films. The hierarchical patterns consist of random&#8208;sized spot patterns (higher&#8208;level patterns) confined within randomly oriented bicontinuous patterns (lower&#8208;level patterns). To achieve such multilevel complex patterns, a synthetic method of MAPbBr3 NPs based on the photolysis of DMF is newly developed.








Abstract
Physical entities with inherent randomness have been investigated as anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Herein, a transparent and flexible optical PUF label associated with multilevel complexity is demonstrated by taking advantage of the optical properties of hierarchical morphologies of the composite film composed of metal halide perovskite nanoparticles (MAPbBr3 NPs) and the intrinsic spinodal&#8208;decomposition&#8208;like phase separation of polymer blend (PMMA/PS blend). Due to the combinatorial effects of the photolysis synthesis of MAPbBr3 and the thermodynamic instability of the PMMA/PS blend, randomized patterns emerge at two&#8208;level scales. These patterns are intrinsically non&#8208;deterministic, and therefore, the PUF labels from the multilevel random patterns are challenging to replicate. This is mainly attributed to random spot patterns (higher&#8208;level patterns) confined within intricate bicontinuous patterns (lower&#8208;level patterns).

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Syngas Evolution with Molecular Catalyst Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly active, durable, and selective catalysts for light&#8208;driven CO2 and water conversion to value&#8208;adding products are key toward a sustainable energy cycle. Such an all&#8208;in&#8208;one material is showcased, consisting of a metal&#8208;organic framework co&#8208;hosting two molecular catalysts. This assembly (nanozyme) harvests light, funnels energy to molecular sites, and enhances charge separation, thereby unlocking high photon efficiencies and adjustable syngas evolution.








Abstract
Syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, is a high&#8208;priority intermediate for producing several commodity chemicals, e.g., ammonia, methanol, and synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. Accordingly, parallel sunlight&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of CO2 and protons to syngas is a key step toward a sustainable energy cycle. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic systems and materials often fall short as application&#8208;oriented concurrent CO and H2 evolution requires challenging reaction conditions which can hamper stability, selectivity, and efficiency. Here a light&#8208;harvesting metal&#8208;organic framework hosting two molecular catalysts is engineered to yield colloidal, water&#8208;stable, versatile nanoreactors for photocatalytic syngas generation with highly controllable product ratios. In&#8208;depth fluorescence, X&#8208;ray, and microscopic studies paired with kinetic analysis show that the host delivers energy efficiently to active sites, conceptually yielding nanozymes. This unlocked sustained CO2 reduction and H2 evolution with benchmark turnover numbers and record incident photon conversions up to 36%, showcasing a highly active and durable all&#8208;in&#8208;one material toward application in solar energy&#8208;driven syngas generation.

Most reported self&#8208;healable batteries possess limited stretchability and unable to achieve full&#8208;device self&#8208;healability. Herein, an all&#8208;component self&#8208;bonding strategy is presented to obtain an all&#8208;eutectogel soft battery (AESB) that simultaneously achieves full&#8208;cell autonomous self&#8208;healability and omnidirectional intrinsic stretchability (&gt;1000% areal strain) even at &#8211;20&#160;&#176;C. The present work provides a general soft electronic material platform for fabricating next&#8208;generation self&#8208;healing stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation energy storage devices should be soft, stretchable, and self&#8208;healable. Previously reported self&#8208;healable batteries mostly possess limited stretchability and rely on healable electrodes or electrolytes rather than achieving full&#8208;device self&#8208;healability. Herein, an all&#8208;component self&#8208;bonding strategy is reported to obtain an all&#8208;eutectogel soft battery (AESB) that simultaneously achieves full&#8208;cell autonomous self&#8208;healability and omnidirectional intrinsic stretchability (&gt;1000% areal strain) over a broad temperature range (&#8722;20~60&#160;&#176;C). Without requiring any external stimulus, the five&#8208;layered soft battery can efficiently recover both its mechanical and electrochemical performance at full&#8208;cell level. The developed AESB can be easily configured into various 3D architectures with highly interfacial compatible eutectogel electrodes, electrolyte, and substrate, presenting an excellent opportunity for the development of embodied energy technologies. The present work provides a general and user&#8208;friendly soft electronic material platform for fabricating a variety of intrinsic self&#8208;healing stretchable multi&#8208;layered electronics, which are promising beyond the field of energy storage, such as displays, sensors, circuits, and soft robots.

         <title>Towards Efficient and Stable Donor&#8208;Acceptor Luminescent Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tri(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl(TTM) radical derivatives have been designed and synthesized. Donor substituents vary depending on the extent of conjugation and the number of nitrogen atoms. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the key to maximize photoluminescent quantum efficiency(PLQE) is to tune the right balance of the charge transfer energy with respect to both the ground&#8208;state and local&#8208;excitation state energies.








Abstract
In contrast to closed&#8208;shell luminescent molecules, the electronic ground state and lowest excited state in organic luminescent radicals are both spin doublet, which results in spin&#8208;allowed radiative transitions. Most reported luminescent radicals with high photoluminescent quantum efficiency (PLQE) have a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A&#8226;) chemical structure where an electron&#8208;donating group is covalently attached to an electron&#8208;withdrawing radical core (A&#8226;). Understanding the main factors that define the efficiency and stability of D&#8208;A&#8226; type luminescent radicals remains challenging. Here, we&#160;designed and synthesized a series of tri(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical derivatives with donor substituents varying by their extent of conjugation and their number of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms. The experimental results suggest that the luminescence efficiency and stability of the radicals are proportional to the degree of conjugation but inversely proportional to the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituents. These experimental trends are very well reproduced by density functional theory calculations. The theoretical results indicate that both the luminescence efficiency and radical stability are related to the energy difference between the charge transfer (CT) and local&#8208;excitation (LE) states, which decreases as either the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituent increases or its conjugation length decreases.

     alt="Towards Efficient and Stable Donor-Acceptor Luminescent Radicals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of tri(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl(TTM) radical derivatives have been designed and synthesized. Donor substituents vary depending on the extent of conjugation and the number of nitrogen atoms. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the key to maximize photoluminescent quantum efficiency(PLQE) is to tune the right balance of the charge transfer energy with respect to both the ground-state and local-excitation state energies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to closed-shell luminescent molecules, the electronic ground state and lowest excited state in organic luminescent radicals are both spin doublet, which results in spin-allowed radiative transitions. Most reported luminescent radicals with high photoluminescent quantum efficiency (PLQE) have a donor-acceptor (D&#8211;A&#8226;) chemical structure where an electron-donating group is covalently attached to an electron-withdrawing radical core (A&#8226;). Understanding the main factors that define the efficiency and stability of D-A&#8226; type luminescent radicals remains challenging. Here, we&#160;designed and synthesized a series of tri(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical derivatives with donor substituents varying by their extent of conjugation and their number of imine-type nitrogen atoms. The experimental results suggest that the luminescence efficiency and stability of the radicals are proportional to the degree of conjugation but inversely proportional to the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituents. These experimental trends are very well reproduced by density functional theory calculations. The theoretical results indicate that both the luminescence efficiency and radical stability are related to the energy difference between the charge transfer (CT) and local-excitation (LE) states, which decreases as either the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituent increases or its conjugation length decreases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Coherent THz Lattice Dynamics Coupled to Spins in the van der Waals Antiferromagnet FePS3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step toward the optical generation and control of coherent THz spin and lattice dynamics in 2D antiferromagnets. A coherent hybrid phonon&#8211;magnon mode is triggered in the 2D antiferromagnet FePS3 by pumping below the band gap in the presence of an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Coherent THz optical lattice and hybridized phonon&#8211;magnon modes are triggered by femtosecond laser pulses in the antiferromagnetic van der Waals semiconductor FePS3. The laser&#8208;driven lattice and spin dynamics are investigated in a bulk crystal as well as in a 380&#160;nm&#8208;thick exfoliated flake as a function of the excitation photon energy, sample temperature and applied magnetic field. The pump&#8208;probe magneto&#8208;optical measurements reveal that the amplitude of a coherent phonon mode oscillating at 3.2&#160;THz decreases as the sample is heated up to the N&#233;el temperature. This signal eventually vanishes as the phase transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, thus revealing its connection to the long&#8208;range magnetic order. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the optically triggered 3.2&#160;THz phonon hybridizes with a magnon mode, which is utilized to excite the hybridized phonon&#8211;magnon mode optically. These findings open a pathway toward the optical control of coherent THz photo&#8211;magnonic dynamics in a van der Waals antiferromagnet, which can be scaled down to the 2D limit.

         <title>Fibrillization of Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enables 19% Efficiency Pseudo&#8208;Bulk Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fibrillization of non&#8208;fullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO is realized by employing a conjugated fused&#8208;ring solvent additive 1&#8208;fluoronaphtalene that acts as the molecular bridge, which contributes to realize a power conversion efficiency of 19% in the pseudo&#8208;bulk heterojunction D18/L8&#8208;BO binary organic solar cell, featuring a high fill factor of 80% with improved charge transport.








Abstract
The structural order and aggregation of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) are critical toward light absorption, phase separation, and charge transport properties of their photovoltaic blends with electron donors, and determine the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, the fibrillization of small molecular NFA L8&#8208;BO with the assistance of fused&#8208;ring solvent additive 1&#8208;fluoronaphthalene (FN) to substantially improve device PCE is demonstrated. Molecular dynamics simulations show that FN attaches to the backbone of L8&#8208;BO as the molecular bridge to enhance the intermolecular packing , inducing 1D self&#8208;assembly of L8&#8208;BO into fine fibrils with a compact polycrystal structure. The L8&#8208;BO fibrils are incorporated into a pseudo&#8208;bulk heterojunction (P&#8208;BHJ) active layer with D18 as a donor, and show enhanced light absorption, charge transport, and collection properties, leading to enhanced PCE from 16.0% to an unprecedented 19.0% in the D18/L8&#8208;BO binary P&#8208;BHJ OSC, featuring a high fill factor of 80%. This work demonstrates a strategy for fibrillating NFAs toward the enhanced performance of OSCs.

         <title>Time&#8208;Dependent Polychrome Stereoscopic Luminescence Triggered by Resonance Energy Transfer between Carbon Dots&#8208;in&#8208;Zeolite Composites and Fluorescence Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique time&#8208;dependent polychrome stereoscopic luminescence system is successfully constructed by designing an efficient resonance energy transfer system in a 3D space, in which carbon dots&#8208;in&#8208;zeolite composites act as energy donors and fluorescence quantum dots act as energy acceptors. The luminescence system can carry eight layers of luminescence information involving four dimensions, realizing advanced time&#8211;space division multiplexing.








Abstract
Luminescence multiplexing shows promising application prospects in information security, yet even outstanding time division multiplexing can only carry limited luminescence information. Time&#8211;space division multiplexing can greatly expand the information capacity by simultaneously transferring luminescence information in both time and space dimensions. Herein, time&#8208;dependent polychrome stereoscopic luminescence system has been successfully developed by designing a 3D luminescence system based on resonance energy transfer (RET), in which afterglow lifetime easily regulated carbon dots&#8208;in&#8208;zeolite composites are used as energy donors and multicolor fluorescence quantum dots (QDs) as energy acceptors. Taking perovskite QDs (PeQDs) as example, by matching the energy donors with different afterglow lifetimes and the energy acceptors with different fluorescence colors, tunable afterglow emission of PeQDs with wavelength within 463&#8211;614&#160;nm and lifetime within 232&#8211;1500&#160;ms can be realized, in which the maximal RET efficiency reaches 95%. As a proof of concept, such novel luminescence system that carries eight layers of luminescence information involving four dimensions (time and 3D space) is successfully applied in advanced time&#8211;space division multiplexing. This work opens a new perspective for the application of time&#8208;space integrated luminescence systems in advanced information multiplexing.

         <title>Bionic Engineered Protein Coating Boosting Anti&#8208;Biofouling in Complex Biological Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel engineered BSA@PSBMA protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA and poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate), PSBMA) is developed for surface&#8208;independent coating and to remove the intrinsic limitation of native proteins as antifouling coatings in complex biological environments. High&#8208;efficient resistance to various biofoulants in complex conditions is achieved through using a bionic &#8220;vine&#8208;thorn&#8221; design to tune the interfacial interactions at the molecular scale.








Abstract
Implantable medical devices have been widely applied in diagnostics, therapeutics, organ restoration, and other biomedical areas, but often suffer from dysfunction and infections due to irreversible biofouling. Inspired by the self&#8208;defensive &#8220;vine&#8208;thorn&#8221; structure of climbing thorny plants, a zwitterion&#8208;conjugated protein is engineered via grafting sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA) segments on native bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein molecules for surface coating and antifouling applications in complex biological fluids. Unlike traditional synthetic polymers of which the coating operation requires arduous surface pretreatments, the engineered protein BSA@PSBMA (PolySBMA conjugated BSA) can achieve facile and surface&#8208;independent coating on various substrates through a simple dipping/spraying method. Interfacial molecular force measurements and adsorption tests demonstrate that the substrate&#8208;foulant attraction is significantly suppressed due to strong interfacial hydration and steric repulsion of the bionic structure of BSA@PSBMA, enabling coating surfaces to exhibit superior resistance to biofouling for a broad spectrum of species including proteins, metabolites, cells, and biofluids under various biological conditions. This work provides an innovative paradigm of using native proteins to generate engineered proteins with extraordinary antifouling capability and desired surface properties for bioengineering applications.

         <title>Single Zinc Atom Aggregates: Synergetic Interaction to Boost Fast Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The uniform dispersal of the high&#8208;loading Zn single atoms with short atomic spacing (&lt;1&#160;nm) on ordered N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube arrays (ZnN4&#8208;NC) are synthesized as the sulfur host for fast redox conversion in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. The cubes composed of arrayed carbon nanotubes provide channels for fast mass transfer in Li&#8208;S batteries under high&#8208;load conditions. Moreover, the synergistic enhancement effect induced by adjacent single atoms further promotes the rapid multi&#8208;step reaction of sulfur at high sulfur loadings. Consequently, the obtained Li&#8208;S batteries exhibit outstanding electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) pave new possibilities to improve the utilization efficiency of sulfur electrodes arising from polysulfide shuttle effects and sluggish kinetics due to their excellent applicability in atomic&#8208;scale reaction mechanisms and structure&#8208;activity relationships. Herein, nitrogen (N)&#8208;anchored SACs on the highly ordered N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube arrays are reported as the sulfur host for fast redox conversion in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. The cube structure of the aligned carbon nanotubes can promote the rapid mass transfer under high sulfur loadings, and abundant single&#8208;atom active sites further accelerate the conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). The synergistic enhancement effect induced by adjacent single atoms with interatomic distances &lt;1&#160;nm further accelerates the rapid multi&#8208;step reaction of sulfur at high sulfur loadings. As a result, the obtained Li&#8208;S batteries exhibit outstanding cycle stability with a high areal capacity of 5.6&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 after 100 cycles under a high sulfur loading of 7.2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 (electrolyte to sulfur ratio is &#8776;3.7&#160;mL&#160;g&#8722;1). Even assembled into a pouch cell, it still delivers a high capacity of 953.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.1&#160;C, contributing to the development of the practically viable Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Checkpoint Nano&#8208;PROTACs for Activatable Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The checkpoint nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs, NPRO) with phototherapeutic tumor regression and immunosuppressive protein degradation are developed for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy. NPRO&#8208;mediated therapy can not only improve tumor immunogenicity but also degrade SHP2 to block the immunosuppressive checkpoint signaling pathways (CD47/SIRP&#945; and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1), resulting in the activation of a synergistic antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Checkpoint immunotherapy holds great potential to treat malignancies via blocking the immunosuppressive signaling pathways, which however suffers from inefficiency and off&#8208;target adverse effects. Herein, checkpoint nano&#8208;proteolysis targeting chimeras (nano&#8208;PROTACs) in combination with photodynamic tumor regression and immunosuppressive protein degradation to block checkpoint signaling pathways for activatable cancer photo&#8208;immunotherapy are reported. These nano&#8208;PROTACs are composed of a photosensitizer (protoporphyrin IX, PpIX) and an Src homology 2 domain&#8208;containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2)&#8208;targeting PROTAC peptide (aPRO) via a caspase 3&#8208;cleavable segment. aPRO is activated by the increased expression of caspase 3 in tumor cells after phototherapeutic treatment and induces targeted degradation of SHP2 via the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system. The persistent depletion of SHP2 blocks the immunosuppressive checkpoint signaling pathways (CD47/SIRP&#945; and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1), thus reinvigorating antitumor macrophages and T cells. Such a checkpoint PROTAC strategy synergizes immunogenic phototherapy to boost antitumor immune response. Thus, this study represents a generalized PROTAC platform to modulate immune&#8208;related signaling pathways for improved anticancer therapy.

A series of conjugated polymers by side chain engineering and used as additive, which enable a record power conversion efficiency of 19.10% and decent high FF of 80.5% in layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processed organic solar cells.








Abstract
The morphology plays a key role in determining the charge generation and collection process, thus impacting the performances of organic solar cells (OSCs). The limited selection pool of additives to optimize the morphology of OSCs, especially for the emerging layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) OSCs, impeding the improvements of photovoltaic performances. Herein, a new method of using conjugated polymers as the additives to optimize the morphology for improving the photovoltaic performances of LbL&#8208;OSCs is reported. Four polymers of P&#63743;H, P&#63743;S, P&#63743;F, and P&#63743;Cl are developed with different side chains. These polymers exhibit poor performances as donor materials and additives in the BHJ devices, due to the unsuitable energy level alignment and unfavorable molecular interactions. By contrast, they can be served as efficient additives to optimize the PM6 fibril matrix for facilitating the penetration of BTP&#8208;eC9 and forming an intertwined D/A bicontinuous network with a vertical segregation. Such morphology is optimized by side chain engineering, which enables the progressive improvement of the charge separation and collection. As a result, adding a small amount of P&#63743;Cl as the additive, the optimized morphology contributes to a champion PCE of 19.10% with a high FF of 80.5%.

Heterostructural Nanolattice Capacitors
In article number 2208409, Julia R. Greer, Bong&#8208;Joong Kim, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate density&#8208;variant nanolattices that exhibit bi&#8208;phase deformation by which the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region. This deformation improves the electrical breakdown strength by &#8776;3.3 fold of the uniform&#8208;density nanolattice, while maintaining the ultralow&#8208;k of &#8776;1.2 with complete electric and dielectric stability and recoverability during 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain.

Microfabrication of Biodegradable Sensors
In article number 2207081, Levent Beker and co&#8208;workers report a photolithography&#8208;based microfabrication process for bioresorbable devices. Consecutive application of sacrificial, adhesion and protection layers enable the use of delicate conductive and insulating bioresorbable materials through standard microfabrication processes. Using this approach, high&#8208;density passive electric components and chemical sensors critical for transient electronics and implant applications are developed.

Photocatalytic Nanozymes
Highly active, efficient, and durable catalysts for light&#8208;driven carbon dioxide and water conversion to fuels are pivotal for a sustainable energy cycle. In article number 2207380, Philip M. Stanley, Julien Warnan, Roland A. Fischer, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a photocatalytic nanozyme that stems from the synergy between a metal&#8211;organic framework and two molecular catalysts to deliver enzyme&#8208;reminiscent behavior toward controllable syngas evolution and artificial photosynthesis.

Inter&#8208;Qubit Coupling
Due to their atomic nature, qubits based on electrons bound to phosphorus&#8208;doped silicon quantum dots have demonstrated strong inter&#8208;qubit coupling. In article number 2201625, Ludwik Kranz, Michelle Y. Simmons, and co&#8208;workers show how the inter&#8208;qubit coupling can be used as a metrology tool to determine the arrangement of phosphorus donors in two quantum dots. This technique allows for the optimization of two&#8208;qubit gates and is applicable for other dopant&#8208;based systems.

         <title>Stabilization and Performance Enhancement Strategies for Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into the recently emerged stability and activity enhancement strategies, widely applicable to the design and development of high&#8208;performance halide perovskite photocatalysts for H2 evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and organic synthesis reactions, is provided.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;powered photocatalytic fuel production and chemical synthesis are widely recognized as viable technological solutions for a sustainable energy future. However, the requirement of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts is a major bottleneck. Halide perovskites, a category of diversified semiconductor materials with suitable energy&#8208;band&#8208;enabled high&#8208;light&#8208;utilization efficiencies, exceptionally long charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;diffusion&#8208;length&#8208;facilitated charge transport, and readily tailorable compositional, structural, and morphological properties, have emerged as a new class of photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, and various organic synthesis reactions. Despite the noticeable progress, the development of high&#8208;performance halide perovskite photocatalysts (HPPs) is still hindered by several key challenges: the strong ionic nature and high hydrolysis tendency induce instability and an unsatisfactory activity due to the need for a coactive component to realize redox processes. Herein, the recently developed advanced strategies to enhance the stability and photocatalytic activity of HPPs are comprehensively reviewed. The widely applicable stability enhancement strategies are first articulated, and the activity improvement strategies for fuel production and chemical synthesis are then explored. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives associated with the application of HPPs in efficient production of fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals are presented, indicating the irreplaceable role of the HPPs in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>A Review of Scalable Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h&#8208;BN) Synthesis for Present and Future Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 6, February 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable approaches of high&#8208;quality mono/multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) synthesis are reviewed, the challenges and opportunities for each method are discussed, and their relevance to emerging applications is contextualized. Maintaining stoichiometric balance B:N = 1 in the growing crystal and enabling stacking order between layers emerge as the main challenges. Advances in these aspects will inform/guide the synthesis of other 2D materials with &gt;1 constituent element.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is a layered inorganic synthetic crystal exhibiting high temperature stability and high thermal conductivity. As a ceramic material it has been widely used for thermal management, heat shielding, lubrication, and as a filler material for structural composites. Recent scientific advances in isolating atomically thin monolayers from layered van der Waals crystals to study their unique properties has propelled research interest in mono/few layered h&#8208;BN as a wide bandgap insulating support for nanoscale electronics, tunnel barriers, communications, neutron detectors, optics, sensing, novel separations, quantum emission from defects, among others. Realizing these futuristic applications hinges on scalable cost&#8208;effective high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN synthesis. Here, the authors&#160;review scalable approaches of high&#8208;quality mono/multilayer h&#8208;BN synthesis, discuss the challenges and opportunities for each method, and contextualize their relevance to emerging applications. Maintaining a stoichiometric balance B:N = 1 as the atoms incorporate into the growing layered crystal and maintaining stacking order between layers during multi&#8208;layer synthesis emerge as some of the main challenges for h&#8208;BN synthesis and the development of processes to address these aspects can inform and guide the synthesis of other layered materials with more than one constituent element. Finally, the authors contextualize h&#8208;BN synthesis efforts along with quality requirements for emerging applications via a technological roadmap.

         <title>Perspectives of 2D MXene Tribology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The past two years have witnessed increased experimental and theoretical efforts toward studying MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties when used as lubricant additives, reinforcement phases in composites, or solid lubricant coatings.&#160;The most promising results in MXene tribology are summarized, future important problems to be pursued further are outlined, and methodological recommendations are provided.








Abstract
The large and rapidly growing family of 2D early transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes) raises significant interest in the materials science and chemistry of materials communities. Discovered a little more than a decade ago, MXenes have already demonstrated outstanding potential in various applications ranging from energy storage to biology and medicine. The past two years have witnessed increased experimental and theoretical efforts toward studying MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties when used as lubricant additives, reinforcement phases in composites, or solid lubricant coatings. Although research on the understanding of the friction and wear performance of MXenes under dry and lubricated conditions is still in its early stages, it has experienced rapid growth due to the excellent mechanical properties and chemical reactivities offered by MXenes that make them adaptable to being combined with other materials, thus boosting their tribological performance. In this perspective, the most promising results in the area of MXene tribology are summarized, future important problems to be pursued further are outlined, and methodological recommendations&#160;that could be useful for experts as well as newcomers to MXenes research, in particular, to the emerging area of MXene tribology, are provided.

         <title>Chemical Tuning Meets 2D Molecular Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical tuning including lithiation control and solvent coordination can significantly modify magnetic interaction in molecule&#8208;based magnets for high&#8208;temperature magnetic order and large coercivity. Through those technical routes and processing, 2D molecule&#8208;based magnets with an applicable magnetic performance of ferrites are demonstrated. The considerable energy product evidences its worth for obtaining practical molecule&#8208;based magnets.








Abstract
2D magnets provoke a surge of interest in large anisotropy in reduced dimensions and are promising for next&#8208;generation information technology where dynamic magnetic tuning is essential. Until recently, the crucial metal&#8208;organic magnet Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF with considerable high coercivity and high&#8208;temperature magnetic order opens up a new platform to control magnetism in metal&#8208;organic materials at room temperature. Here, an in&#8211;situ chemical tuning route is reported to realize the controllable transformation of low&#8208;temperature magnetic order into room&#8208;temperature hard magnetism in Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF. The chemical tuning via electrochemical lithiation and solvation/desolvation exhibits continuously variable magnetic features from cryogenic magnetism to the room&#8208;temperature optimum performance of coercivity (Hc) of 8500&#160;Oe and energy product of 0.6 MGOe. Such chemically flexible tunability of room&#8208;temperature magnetism is ascribed to the different degrees of lithiation and solvation that modify the stoichiometry and Cr&#8208;pyrazine coordination framework. Furthermore, the additively manufactured hybrid magnets show air stability and electromagnetic induction, providing potential applications. The findings here suggest chemical tuning as a universal approach to control the anisotropy and magnetism of 2D hybrid magnets at room temperature, promising for data storage, magnetic refrigeration, and spintronics.

         <title>Manipulating Charge&#8208;Transfer Kinetics of Lithium&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes in Halide All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode theoretically enables all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with high energy density owing to its high capacity. However, the low electronic conductivity and highly reactive lattice oxygen impede its application. By introducing conductive additives in electrodes and modifying the surface chemistry of LLO, high&#8208;efficiency electronic networks and stable LLO/electrolyte interfaces can be obtained, thus boosting the charge&#8208;transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Employing lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) as the cathode of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) is highly desired for realizing high energy density. However, the poor kinetics of LLO, caused by its low electronic conductivity and significant oxygen&#8208;redox&#8208;induced structural degradation, has impeded its application in ASSBs. Here, the charge transfer kinetics of LLO is enhanced by constructing high&#8208;efficiency electron transport networks within solid&#8208;state electrodes, which considerably minimizes electron transfer resistance. In addition, an infusion&#8208;plus&#8208;coating strategy is introduced to stabilize the lattice oxygen of LLO, successfully suppressing the interfacial oxidation of solid electrolyte (Li3InCl6) and structural degradation of LLO. As a result, LLO&#8208;based ASSBs exhibit a high discharge capacity of 230.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C and ultra&#8208;long cycle stability over 400 cycles. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the kinetics of LLO in solid&#8208;state electrodes, and affords a practically feasible strategy to obtain high&#8208;energy&#8208;density ASSBs.

However, the low electronic conductivity and highly reactive lattice oxygen impede its application. By introducing conductive additives in electrodes and modifying the surface chemistry of LLO, high-efficiency electronic networks and stable LLO/electrolyte interfaces can be obtained, thus boosting the charge-transfer kinetics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing lithium-rich layered oxide (LLO) as the cathode of all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) is highly desired for realizing high energy density. However, the poor kinetics of LLO, caused by its low electronic conductivity and significant oxygen-redox-induced structural degradation, has impeded its application in ASSBs. Here, the charge transfer kinetics of LLO is enhanced by constructing high-efficiency electron transport networks within solid-state electrodes, which considerably minimizes electron transfer resistance. In addition, an infusion-plus-coating strategy is introduced to stabilize the lattice oxygen of LLO, successfully suppressing the interfacial oxidation of solid electrolyte (Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and structural degradation of LLO. As a result, LLO-based ASSBs exhibit a high discharge capacity of 230.7 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1 C and ultra-long cycle stability over 400 cycles. This work provides an in-depth understanding of the kinetics of LLO in solid-state electrodes, and affords a practically feasible strategy to obtain high-energy-density ASSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Visualization of Magnetic Correlations in Frustrated Spinel ZnFe2O4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single crystal diffuse neutron scattering data on the frustrated magnet ZnFe2O4 are used to calculate the 3D magnetic difference pair distribution function, which provide a model&#8208;free reconstruction of the local magnetic correlations. Analysis of the correlation intensities gives insight into the possible underlying exchange mechanisms and a preferred spin&#8208;cluster model.








Abstract
Magnetic materials with the spinel structure (A2+B3+2O4) form the core of numerous magnetic devices, and ZnFe2O4 constitutes a peculiar example where the nature of the magnetism is still unresolved. Susceptibility measurements revealed a cusp around Tc&#160;= 13 K resembling an antiferromagnetic transition, despite the positive Curie&#8211;Weiss temperature determined to be &#920;CW&#160;= 102.8(1) K. Bifurcation of field&#8208;cooled and zero&#8208;field&#8208;cooled data below Tc in conjunction with a frequency dependence of the peak position and a non&#8208;zero imaginary component below Tc shows it is in fact associated with a spin&#8208;glass transition. Highly structured magnetic diffuse neutron scattering from single crystals develops between 50&#160;K and 25&#160;K revealing the presence of magnetic disorder which is correlated in nature. Here, the 3D&#8208;m&#916;PDF method is used to visualize the local magnetic ordering preferences, and ferromagnetic nearest&#8208;neighbor and antiferromagnetic third nearest&#8208;neighbor correlations are shown to be dominant. Their temperature dependence is extraordinary with some flipping in sign and a strongly varying correlation length. The correlations can be explained by orbital interaction mechanisms for the magnetic pathways and a preferred spin cluster. This study demonstrates the power of the 3D&#8208;m&#916;PDF method in visualizing complex quantum phenomena thereby providing a way to obtain an atomic&#8208;scale understanding of magnetic frustration.

         <title>Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells via Improved Sequential Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) via the two&#8208;step sequential deposition show advantages of easy fabrication and decent performance repeatability. Whereas, it is still challenging to implement this technique in the inverted PSCs. Here, an improved sequential two&#8208;step method for inverted PSCs is demonstrated by a binary modulation system and a champion efficiency of 23.4% is realized with remarkable device stability.








Abstract
Inverted&#8208;structure metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attractive advantages like low&#8208;temperature processability and outstanding device stability. The two&#8208;step sequential deposition method shows the benefits of easy fabrication and decent performance repeatability. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to achieve high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs with similar or equal power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) compared to the regular&#8208;structure counterparts via this deposition method. Here, an improved two&#8208;step sequential deposition technique is demonstrated via treating the bottom organic hole&#8208;selective layer with the binary modulation system composed of a polyelectrolyte and an ammonium salt. Such improved sequential deposition method leads to the spontaneous refinement of up and buried interfaces for the perovskite films, contributing to high film quality with significantly reduced defect density and better charge transportation. As a result, the optimized PSCs show a large enhancement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage by 100&#160;mV and a dramatic lift in the PCE from 18.1% to 23.4%, delivering the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances for inverted PSCs. Moreover, good operational and thermal stability is achieved upon the improved inverted PSCs. This innovative strategy helps gain a deeper insight into the perovskite crystal growth and defect modulation in the inverted PSCs based on the two&#8208;step sequential deposition method.

         <title>A MgFe&#8208;LDH Nanosheet&#8208;Incorporated Smart Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel with Controllable Growth Factor Releasing Capability for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart injectable thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel composed of bone morphogenetic protein 2&#8208;functionalized MgFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide&#160;nanosheets and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB&#8208;loaded chitosan/silk fibroin hydrogel is designed and constructed to achieve the sequential release of dual growth factors and sustained release of bioactive Mg2+/Fe3+ ions for highly efficient bone regeneration.








Abstract
Although growth factor (GF)&#8208;loaded hydrogels have been explored as promising materials in repairing bone defects, it still remains challenging to construct smart hydrogels with excellent gelation/mechanical properties as well as controllable GF releasing capability. Herein, the incorporation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP&#8208;2)&#8208;functionalized MgFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets into chitosan/silk fibroin (CS) hydrogels loaded with platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB (PDGF&#8208;BB) to construct a smart injectable thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel (denoted as CSP&#8208;LB), which can achieve a burst release of PDGF&#8208;BB and a sustained release of BMP&#8208;2, for highly efficient bone regeneration is reported. The incorporation of MgFe&#8208;LDH in CS hydrogel not only shortens the gelation time and decreases sol&#8211;gel transition temperature, but also enhances the mechanical property of the hydrogel. Because of the sequential release of dual&#8208;GFs and sustained release of bioactive Mg2+/Fe3+ ions, the in vitro experiments prove that the CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel exhibits excellent angiogenic and osteogenic properties compared with the CS hydrogel. In vivo experiments further prove that the CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel can significantly enhance bone regeneration with higher bone volume and mineral density than that of the CS hydrogel. This smart thermo&#8208;sensitive CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel possesses excellent gelation capability and angiogenic and osteogenic properties, thus providing a promising minimally invasive solution for bone defect treatment.

         <title>Ultrahigh Strain&#8208;Insensitive Integrated Hybrid Electronics Using Highly Stretchable Bilayer Liquid Metal Based Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive hybrid integrated electronics constructed by a self&#8208;formed amphiphilic bilayer highly stretchable conductor is reported based on liquid metal composite and peeling strategy. The amphiphilic bilayer conductor can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics, anchor well with substrates, and shows ultrahigh conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healability, and interconnect functions. The unique materials hold the potential for strain&#8208;resilient integrated bioelectronics and wearables.








Abstract
Human&#8208;interfaced electronic systems require strain&#8208;resilient circuits. However, present integrated stretchable electronics easily suffer from electrical deterioration and face challenges in forming robust multilayered soft&#8208;rigid hybrid configurations. Here, a bilayer liquid&#8208;solid conductor (b&#8208;LSC) with amphiphilic properties is introduced to reliably interface with both rigid electronics and elastomeric substrates. The top liquid metal can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics at a resistance 30% lower than the traditional tin&#8208;soldered rigid interface. The bottom polar composite comprising liquid metal particles and polymers can not only reliably interface with elastomers but also help the b&#8208;LSC heal after breakage. The b&#8208;LSC can be scalably fabricated by printing and subsequent peeling strategies, showing ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive conductivity (maximum 22&#160;532&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), extreme stretchability (2260%), and negligible resistance change under ultra&#8208;high strain (0.34 times increase under 1000% strain). It can act as stretchable vertical interconnect access for connecting multilayered layouts and can be scalably and universally fabricated on various substrates with a resolution of &#8776;200&#160;&#181;m. It is demonstrated that it can construct stretchable sensor arrays, multi&#8208;layered stretchable displays, highly integrated haptic user&#8208;interactive optoelectric E&#8208;skins, visualized heaters, robot touch sensing systems, and wireless powering for wearable electronics.

However, present integrated stretchable electronics easily suffer from electrical deterioration and face challenges in forming robust multilayered soft-rigid hybrid configurations. Here, a bilayer liquid-solid conductor (b-LSC) with amphiphilic properties is introduced to reliably interface with both rigid electronics and elastomeric substrates. The top liquid metal can self-solder its interface with rigid electronics at a resistance 30% lower than the traditional tin-soldered rigid interface. The bottom polar composite comprising liquid metal particles and polymers can not only reliably interface with elastomers but also help the b-LSC heal after breakage. The b-LSC can be scalably fabricated by printing and subsequent peeling strategies, showing ultra-high strain-insensitive conductivity (maximum 22&#160;532&#160;S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), extreme stretchability (2260%), and negligible resistance change under ultra-high strain (0.34 times increase under 1000% strain). It can act as stretchable vertical interconnect access for connecting multilayered layouts and can be scalably and universally fabricated on various substrates with a resolution of &#8776;200&#160;&#181;m. It is demonstrated that it can construct stretchable sensor arrays, multi-layered stretchable displays, highly integrated haptic user-interactive optoelectric E-skins, visualized heaters, robot touch sensing systems, and wireless powering for wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Electronics for Prognostic Monitoring of Methylated Circulating Tumor DNAs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable device with self&#8208;healing electronics is developed for highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective analysis of methylated ctDNAs from transdermal extracted interstitial fluid (ISF), which is demonstrated as a skin patch device for monitoring the disease indicative biomarker. Especially, the device is featured with a flexible construction and remains electrically functional significant structural defects are induced by bending or distortion from everyday usage.








Abstract
Methylated circulating DNAs (ctDNAs) have recently been reported as a promising biomarker for early cancer diagnostics, but limited tools are currently available for continuous and dynamic profiling of ctDNAs and their methylation levels, especially when such assays need to be conducted in point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) scenarios. Here, a self&#8208;healing bioelectronic patch (iMethy) is developed that combines transdermal interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and field effect transistor&#8208;based (FET&#8208;based) biosensing for dynamic monitoring of methylated ctDNAs as a prognostic approach for cancer risk management. The projection micro&#8208;stereolithography&#8208;based 3D patterning of an Eutectic Gallium&#8208;Indium (EGaIn) circuit with an unprecedented 10&#160;&#181;m resolution enables the construction of self&#8208;healing EGaIn microfluidic circuits that remain conductive under 100% strain and self&#8208;healing under severe destruction. In combination with continuous transdermal ISF sampling of methylated ctDNAs, iMethy can detect ctDNAs as low as 10&#8722;16&#160;m in cellular models and is capable of phenotypic analysis of tumor growth in rodent animals. As the first demonstration of a wearable device for real&#8208;time in vivo analysis of disease&#8208;indicative biomarkers, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study well demonstrated the potential of the iMethy platform for cancer risk management based on dynamic transdermal surveillance of methylated ctDNAs via a painless and self&#8208;administrable procedure.

         <title>Unlock the Potassium Storage Behavior of Single&#8208;Phased Tungsten Selenide Nanorods via Large Cation Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, in/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations are performed to investigate the role of tunnel cations in governing the charge storage performances of electrodes by focusing on K&#8208;ions in layer&#8208;structured WSe2. It clearly reveals that the pre&#8208;intercalated K&#8208;ions inside interlayers of WSe2 increases the electronic conductivity, and improves K&#8208;ion diffusivity, having fast kinetics response during the K&#8208;ion (de)insertion.








Abstract
Metal chalcogenide anodes with a layered structure have been regarded as potential K&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy density for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, their development is impeded by the slow K&#8208;ion transport kinetics and poor structural stability. In this work, the energy&#8208;storage behavior is investigated first and decisively associated them with the capacity&#8208;degradation of the promising layer&#8208;structured WSe2 from an integrated chemical and physical point of view. Then, a single&#8208;phased WSe2 with pre&#8208;intercalated high K content (SP&#8208;KxWSe2) is designed to overcome the capacity&#8208;degradation issue fundamentally. Theoretical calculations clarify the beneficial effect of K&#8208;ions inside the interlayer of WSe2 on boosting its electrochemical performance, including increasing the electronic conductivity, promoting the K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and improving the structural stability. The novel design enables the K&#8208;ions pre&#8208;intercalated WSe2 anode material to exhibit a high reversible specific capacity of 211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 and superior cycling stability (89.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). Especially, the K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor, assembled from the anode of SP&#8208;KxWSe2 and the cathode of porous activated carbon, delivers superior energy&#8208;density up to 175&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, high power&#8208;density as well as exceptional cycling stability.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Doped P&#8208;Type InAs Nanocrystal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;synthesis doping of InAs nanocrystals with Zn enables the fabrication of heavy metal free, RoHS compliant nanocrystal&#8208;based field effect transistors, which exhibit either n&#8208; or p&#8208;type characteristics. Advanced structural characterization of the doped nanocrystals highlights the importance of Zn dopant chemistry on the doping efficiency. This study sets the stage for future development of nanocrystals&#8208;based opto&#8208;electronics applications.








Abstract
Doped heavy metal&#8208;free III&#8211;V semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) are of great interest both from the fundamental aspects of doping in highly confined structures, and from the applicative side of utilizing such building blocks in the fabrication of p&#8211;n homojunction devices. InAs nanocrystals (NCs), that are of particular relevance for short&#8208;wave IR detection and emission applications, manifest heavy n&#8208;type character poising a challenge for their transition to p&#8208;type behavior. The p&#8208;type doping of InAs NCs is presented with Zn &#8211; enabling control over the charge carrier type in InAs QDs field effect transistors. The post&#8208;synthesis doping reaction mechanism is studied for Zn precursors with varying reactivity. Successful p&#8208;type doping is achieved by the more reactive precursor, diethylzinc. Substitutional doping by Zn2+ replacing In3+ is established by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis. Furthermore, enhanced near infrared&#160;photoluminescence is observed due to surface passivation by Zn as indicated from elemental mapping utilizing high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy corroborated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy study. The demonstrated ability to control the carrier type, along with the improved emission characteristics, paves the way towards fabrication of optoelectronic devices active in the short&#8208;wave infrared region utilizing heavy&#8208;metal free nanocrystal building blocks.

         <title>Precisely Constructed Metal Sulfides with Localized Single&#8208;Atom Rhodium for Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Activation and Direct Methanol Coupling to Ethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst composed of alternately lined wurtzite and zinc&#8208;blende segments in one dimension and single&#8208;atom Rh selectively located on the wurtzite segment demonstrates record&#8208;breaking performances for the selective conversion of methanol to ethylene glycol via preferential C&#8722;H activation. The regularly lined heterojunctions facilitate the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers, and the single&#8208;atom Rh catalyzes methanol adsorption and activation.








Abstract
Although there are many studies on photocatalytic environmental remediation, hydrogen evolution, and chemical transformations, less success has been achieved for the synthesis of industrially important and largely demanded bulk chemicals using semiconductor photocatalysis, which holds great potential to drive unique chemical reactions that are difficult to implement by the conventional heterogeneous catalysis. The performance of semiconductors used for photochemical synthesis is, however, usually unsatisfactory due to limited efficiencies in light harvesting, charge&#8208;carrier separation, and surface reactions. The precise construction of heterogeneous photocatalysts to facilitate these processes is an attractive but challenging goal. Here, single&#8208;atom rhodium&#8208;doped metal sulfide nanorods composed of alternately stacked wurtzite/zinc&#8208;blende segments are successfully designed and fabricated, which demonstrate record&#8208;breaking efficiencies for visible light&#8208;driven preferential activation of C&#8722;H bond in methanol to form ethylene glycol (EG), a key bulk chemical used for the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer. The wurtzite/zinc&#8208;blende heterojunctions lined regularly in one dimension accelerate the charge&#8208;carrier separation and migration. Single&#8208;atom rhodium selectively deposited onto the wurtzite segment with photogenerated holes accumulated facilitates methanol adsorption and C&#8722;H activation. The present work paves the way to harnessing photocatalysis for bulk chemical synthesis with structure&#8208;defined semiconductors.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Induced Defects Liberate the Latent Reversible Capacity of Lithium Titanate Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic defects in quenched lithium titanate anodes enable reversible extraction of Li ions that are unextractable in pristine state, thus facilitating these native Li ions to participate in electrochemical cycling, which leads to a sustained capacity of 202 mAh g&#8722;1 in the 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;V range with excellent rate capability and cycling stability.








Abstract
Interest in defect engineering for lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) materials is sparked by its ability to tailor electrical conductivity and introduce extra active sites for electrochemical reactions. However, harvesting excessive intrinsic defects in the bulk of the electrodes rather than near their surface remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Here, a versatile strategy of quenching is demonstrated, which is exercised in lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12, LTO), a renowned anode for LIBs, to achieve off&#8208;stoichiometry in the interior region. In situ synchrotron analysis and atomic&#8208;resolution microscopy reveal the enriched oxygen vacancies and cation redistribution after ice&#8208;water quenching, which can facilitate the native unextractable Li ions to participate in reversible cycling. The fabricated LTO anode delivers a sustained capacity of 202 mAh g&#8722;1 in the 1.0&#8211;2.5&#160;V range with excellent rate capability and overcomes the poor cycling stability seen in conventional defective electrodes. The feasibility of tuning the degree of structural defectiveness via quenching agents is also proven, which can open up an intriguing avenue of research to harness the intrinsic defects for improving the energy density of rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Partially Nitrided Ni Nanoclusters Achieve Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO at Ultralow Overpotential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes supported partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters catalyst achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2RR to CO, and reaches CO Faraday efficiency &#8805; 99.0% at overpotential of only 166&#160;mV, much lower than of the isolated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst, with the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9%.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising strategy to lower CO2 emission while producing value&#8208;added chemicals. A great challenge facing CO2RR is how to improve energy efficiency by reducing overpotentials. Herein, partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters (NiNx) immobilized on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) for CO2RR are reported, which achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9% with CO Faraday efficiency &gt;99.0% to date. Interestingly, NiNx/NCNT affords a CO generation rate of 43.0&#160;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at a low potential of &#8722;0.572&#160;V (vs RHE). DFT calculations reveal that the NiNx nanoclusters favor *COOH formation with lower Gibbs free energy than isolated Ni single&#8208;atom, hence lowering CO2RR overpotential. As NiNx/NCNT is applied to a membrane electrode assembly system coupled with oxygen evolution reaction, a cell voltage of only 2.13&#160;V is required to reach 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with total energy efficiency of 62.2%.

         <title>Low&#8208;Voltage Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Transistor Amplifiers for Ultrasensitive Electrophysiological Signal Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is developed to fabricate intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors (ISOTFTs) with low operating voltage below 5 V, 100% strain tolerance, and excellent operational stability. Further, the transistor amplifier shows a high gain of 90 V V&#8722;1 and ultrasensitive detection for human electro&#8208;oculogram signals.








Abstract
Stretchability is a prerequisite for electronic skin devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable thin&#8208;film transistors do not possess sufficiently low operating voltages and good stability, significantly limiting their use in real&#8208;world biomedical applications. Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is proposed to form a hybrid polymer dielectric with 620% tensile strain and large&#8208;area film uniformity (&gt;A4 paper size). Using the hybrid polymer dielectrics, the prepared intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors demonstrate a low operating voltage below 5&#160;V, 100% strain tolerance, and excellent operational stability, as well as a high on&#8208;current/off&#8208;current ratio of 105 and a steep subthreshold slope of 500&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. Based on this device technology, an amplifier with a high gain of 90&#160;V V&#8722;1 among the highest values of reported stretchable transistors is realized. This amplifier is at the first time applied to detect human electrophysical signals with an output signal amplitude of over 0.2&#160;V, which even outperforms other types of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic amplifiers for human electrophysiology monitoring. This stretchable device technology sufficiently meets the safety and portability requirements of wearable biomedical applications, opening a new opportunity to e&#8208;skin with signal control and amplification capabilities.

         <title>Shape Morphing Directed by Spatially Encoded, Dually Responsive Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Micro&#8208;Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape morphing from nonresponsive elastomer films can be preprogrammed by spatially embedding anisotropic shape&#8208;changing micro&#8208;actuators with certain orientations and height distributions, offering a robust pathway to simultaneously control in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane bending. This work will broaden the material palette for shape&#8208;morphing&#8208;based applications such as soft robotics, smart wearables, displays, and sensors.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with intrinsic molecular anisotropy can be programmed to morph shapes under external stimuli. However, it is difficult to program the position and orientation of individual mesogenic units separately and locally, whether in&#8208;plane or out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, since each mesogen is linked to adjacent ones through the covalently bonded polymer chains. Here, dually responsive, spindle&#8208;shaped micro&#8208;actuators are synthesized from LCE composites, which can reorient under a magnetic field and change the shape upon heating. When the discrete micro&#8208;actuators are embedded in a conventional and nonresponsive elastomer with programmed height distribution and in&#8208;plane orientation in local regions, robust and complex shape morphing induced by the cooperative actuations of the locally distributed micro&#8208;actuators, which corroborates with finite element analysis, are shown. The spatial encoding of discrete micro&#8208;actuators in a nonresponsive matrix allows to decouple the actuators and the matrix, broadening the material palette to program local and global responses to stimuli for applications including soft robotics, smart wearables, and sensors.

         <title>Embedded 3D Printing of Multimaterial Polymer Lattices via Graph&#8208;Based Print Path Planning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graph theory&#8208;based algorithm, termed Automated Eulerian Route Optimization (AERO), is developed to automate the embedded 3D printing of periodic and stochastic lattices with hundreds of struts. This integrated method is used to construct multi&#8208;material polymer lattices with tailored mechanical properties.








Abstract
Recent advances in computational design and 3D printing enable the fabrication of polymer lattices with high strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio and tailored mechanics. To date, 3D lattices composed of monolithic materials have primarily been constructed due to limitations associated with most commercial 3D printing platforms. Here, freeform fabrication of multi&#8208;material polymer lattices via embedded three&#8208;dimensional (EMB3D) printing is demonstrated. An algorithm is developed first that generates print paths for each target lattice based on graph theory. The effects of ink rheology on filamentary printing and the effects of the print path on resultant mechanical properties are then investigated. By co&#8208;printing multiple materials with different mechanical properties, a broad range of periodic and stochastic lattices with tailored mechanical responses can be realized opening new avenues for constructing architected matter.

         <title>Elucidating the Origins of High Preferential Crystal Orientation in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation process to form quasi&#8208;2D&#160;perovskites is thermodynamically controlled using the methylammonium chloride additive to achieve films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without degradation. Combining microscopic, macroscopic, and spectrographic observations, the thermodynamics enabling preferential crystal growth are inferred.








Abstract
Incorporating large organic cations to form&#160;2D&#160;and mixed 2D/3D structures significantly increases the stability of perovskite solar cells. However, due to their low electron mobility, aligning the organic sheets to ensure unimpeded charge transport is critical to rival the high performances of pure 3D systems. While additives such as methylammonium chloride (MACl) can enable this preferential orientation, so far, no complete description exists explaining how they influence the nucleation process to grow highly aligned crystals. Here, by investigating the initial stages of the crystallization, as well as partially and fully formed perovskites grown using MACl, the origins underlying this favorable alignment are inferred. This mechanism is studied by employing 3&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells. Upon assisting the crystallization with MACl, films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding moisture levels of 97% relative humidity for 10&#160;h without significant changes in the crystal structure are achieved. Finally, by combining macroscopic, microscopic, and spectroscopic studies, the nucleation process leading to highly oriented perovskite films is elucidated. Understanding this mechanism will aid in the rational design of future additives to achieve more defect tolerant and stable perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Merging Passivation in Synthesis Enabling the Lowest Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss for PbS Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive lead sulfide colloidal quantum dot (PbS CQD) inks. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc)) of 0.71&#160;V and efficiency of 13.3%, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells.








Abstract
The high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss arising from insufficient surface passivation is the main factor that limits the efficiency of current lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots (PbS CQDs) solar cell. Here, synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive PbS CQD inks by introducing multifunctional ligands to well coordinate the complicated CQDs surface with the thermodynamically optimal configuration. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading to an order lower surface trap density and beneficial doping behavior compared to the control sample. The obtained CQD inks show the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24% for all photovoltaic PbS CQD inks, which is more than twice the reported average PLQY value of &#8776;10%. As a result, a high Voc of 0.71&#160;V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3% is achieved, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells with PCE &gt;10%, comparable to that of perovskite solar cells. This work provides valuable insights into the future CQDs passivation strategies and also demonstrates the great potential for the direct&#8208;synthesis protocol of PbS CQDs.

         <title>A Gate Programmable van der Waals Metal&#8208;Ferroelectric&#8208;Semiconductor Vertical Heterojunction Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Prototypical gate&#8208;programmable memory that seamlessly integrates the functionality of both ferroelectric memristor and metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS&#8208;FET), in a vertical fashion is demonstrated. Its memristive characteristics can be quenched (enabled), by setting the Fermi level of MoS2 inside (outside) of its band gap via a top gate, yielding a gate programmable non&#8208;volatile memory for multi&#8208;bit data storage and more.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity, one of the keys to realize non&#8208;volatile memories owing to the remanent electric polarization, is an emerging phenomenon in the 2D limit. Yet the demonstrations of van der Waals (vdW) memories using 2D ferroelectric materials as an ingredient are very limited. Especially, gate&#8208;tunable ferroelectric vdW memristive device, which holds promises in future multi&#8208;bit data storage applications, remains challenging. Here, a gate&#8208;programmable multi&#8208;state memory is shown by vertically assembling graphite, CuInP2S6, and MoS2 layers into a metal(M)&#8208;ferroelectric(FE)&#8208;semiconductor(S) architecture. The resulted devices seamlessly integrate the functionality of both FE&#8208;memristor (with ON&#8211;OFF ratios exceeding 105 and long&#8208;term retention) and metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS&#8208;FET). Thus, it yields a prototype of gate tunable giant electroresistance with multi&#8208;levelled ON&#8208;states in the FE&#8208;memristor in the vertical vdW assembly. First&#8208;principles calculations further reveal that such behaviors originate from the specific band alignment between the FE&#8208;S interface. Our&#160;findings pave the way for the engineering of ferroelectricity&#8208;mediated memories in future implementations of 2D&#160;nanoelectronics.

         <title>Conversion of Classical Light Emission from a Nanoparticle&#8208;Strained WSe2 Monolayer into Quantum Light Emission via Electron Beam Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectrally overlapping mid&#8208;gap emitters from deterministically positioned, nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers are converted into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched emitters using electron beam irradiation. The localized emission before and after irradiation are compared as a function of strain magnitude to assign the spectral transformation to the suppression of weakly coupled mid&#8208;gap state&#8208;strain pairs through strongly coupled mid&#8208;gap state&#8208;strain pairs introduced through electron beam irradiation.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state single photon emitters (SPEs) within atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted interest as scalable quantum light sources for quantum photonic technologies. Among TMDs, WSe2 monolayers (MLs) are promising for the deterministic fabrication and engineering of SPEs using local strain fields. The ability to reliably produce isolatable SPEs in WSe2 is currently impeded by the presence of numerous spectrally overlapping states that occur at strained locations. Here nanoparticle (NP) arrays with precisely defined positions and sizes are employed to deterministically create strain fields in WSe2 MLs, thus enabling the systematic investigation and control of SPE formation. Using this platform, electron beam irradiation at NP&#8208;strained locations transforms spectrally overlapped sub&#8208;bandgap emission states into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched quantum emitters.

     alt="Conversion of Classical Light Emission from a Nanoparticle-Strained WSe2 Monolayer into Quantum Light Emission via Electron Beam Irradiation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spectrally overlapping mid-gap emitters from deterministically positioned, nanoparticle-strained WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers are converted into isolatable, anti-bunched emitters using electron beam irradiation. The localized emission before and after irradiation are compared as a function of strain magnitude to assign the spectral transformation to the suppression of weakly coupled mid-gap state-strain pairs through strongly coupled mid-gap state-strain pairs introduced through electron beam irradiation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state single photon emitters (SPEs) within atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted interest as scalable quantum light sources for quantum photonic technologies. Among TMDs, WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers (MLs) are promising for the deterministic fabrication and engineering of SPEs using local strain fields. The ability to reliably produce isolatable SPEs in WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is currently impeded by the presence of numerous spectrally overlapping states that occur at strained locations. Here nanoparticle (NP) arrays with precisely defined positions and sizes are employed to deterministically create strain fields in WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MLs, thus enabling the systematic investigation and control of SPE formation. Using this platform, electron beam irradiation at NP-strained locations transforms spectrally overlapped sub-bandgap emission states into isolatable, anti-bunched quantum emitters. The dependence of the emission spectra of WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MLs as a function of strain magnitude and exposure time to electron beam irradiation is quantified and provides insight into the mechanism for SPE production. Excitons selectively funnel through strongly coupled sub-bandgap states introduced by electron beam irradiation, which suppresses spectrally overlapping emission pathways and leads to measurable anti-bunched behavior. The findings provide a strategy to generate isolatable SPEs in 2D materials with a well-defined energy range.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Agglomeration of Single&#8208;Atom Platinum in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single atoms (SAs) supported on TiO2 surfaces form clusters and undergo reduction (by photogenerated electrons) to a metallic state over the course of a photocatalytic reaction. Although this process affects &gt;90% of the loaded Pt SAs, Pt SA&#8208;TiO2 photocatalysts show stable H2 production. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations suggest Pt SA interaction with H adatom as a destabilizing factor.








Abstract
With recent advances in the field of single&#8208;atoms (SAs) used in photocatalysis, an unprecedented performance of atomically dispersed co&#8208;catalysts has been achieved. However, the stability and agglomeration of SA co&#8208;catalysts on the semiconductor surface may represent a critical issue in potential applications. Here, the photoinduced destabilization of Pt SAs on the benchmark photocatalyst, TiO2, is described. In aqueous solutions within illumination timescales ranging from few minutes to several hours, light&#8208;induced agglomeration of Pt SAs to ensembles (dimers, multimers) and finally nanoparticles takes place. The kinetics critically depends on the presence of sacrificial hole scavengers and the used light intensity. Density&#8208;functional theory&#160;calculations attribute the light induced destabilization of the SA Pt species to binding of surface&#8208;coordinated Pt with solution&#8208;hydrogen (adsorbed H atoms), which consequently weakens the Pt SA bonding to the TiO2 surface. Despite the gradual aggregation of Pt SAs into surface clusters and their overall reduction to metallic state, which involves &gt;90% of Pt SAs, the overall photocatalytic H2 evolution remains virtually unaffected.

         <title>Targeting Theranostics of Atherosclerosis by Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform via Photoacoustic Imaging and Three&#8208;In&#8208;One Integrated Lipid Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic nanoplatform PLCDP@PMH is constructed with atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsiveness, which indicates a plaque&#8208;specific photoacoustic diagnosis and a three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic strategy of integrated lipid management via reducing lipid uptake, enhancing lipid efflux, and actuating lipid removal. PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the diagnosis of early&#8208;stage plaques, the inhibition of atherosclerosis progression, and the reversal of formed lesions.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis, as a life&#8208;threatening cardiovascular disease with chronic inflammation and abnormal lipid enrichment, is often difficult to treat timely due to the lack of obvious symptoms. In this work, a theranostic nanoplatform is constructed for the noninvasive in vivo diagnosis, plaque&#8208;formation inhibition, and the lesion reversal of atherosclerosis. A three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic complex is constructed and packaged along with a polymeric photoacoustic probe into nanoparticles named as PLCDP@PMH, which indicates an atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsive degradation. The photoacoustic probe suggests a lesion&#8208;specific imaging on atherosclerotic mice with an accurate and distinct recognition of plaques. At the same time, the three&#8208;in&#8208;one complex performs an integrated lipid management through the inhibition of macrophages M1&#8208;polarization, liver X receptor (LXR)&#8208;mediated up&#8208;regulation of ATP&#8208;binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1) and the cyclodextrin&#8208;assisted lipid dissolution, which lead to the reduced lipid uptake, enhanced lipid efflux, and actuated lipid removal. The in vivo evaluations reveal that PLCDP@PMH can suppress the lesion progression and further reverse the formed plaques under a diet without high fat. Hence, PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the theranostics of early&#8208;stage atherosclerosis and delivers an impressive potential on the reversal of formed atherosclerotic lesions.

         <title>Modulating the Site Density of Mo Single Atoms to Catch Adventitious O Atoms for Efficient H2O2 Oxidation with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo single atoms (SAs) on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) catch the adventitious O atoms in air, forming the O coordination around SAs. The site density of O&#8208;Covered Mo&#8208;SAs can be modulated by the dopants of carbon source with different structures and amounts. Such O coordination of Mo&#8208;SAs endows RPCN surface with the enrich electrons under irradiation, promoting the advanced oxidation process with photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition.








Abstract
Coordination environment and site density have great impacts on the catalytic performance for single atoms (SAs). Herein, the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) is modulated via a local carbonization strategy to controllably catch adventitious O atoms from open environment. The addition of melamine derivants with hydrocarbyl chains induces local carbonization during RPCN pyrolysis. These local carbonization regions bring abundant graphitic N3C to anchor Mo&#8208;SAs, and most of Mo&#8208;SAs catch the O atoms in air, forming the O2&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;N3 coordination. The dopants of carbon source with different structures and amounts can modulate the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs, therefore controlling the amounts of coordinated O atoms. Furthermore, coordinated O atoms around Mo&#8208;SAs construct the catalytic environment with Lewis base and gather photo&#8208;generated electrons under light. Such O&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;SAs endow RPCN materials (Mo&#8208;RPCN) with a strong ability for hydrogen abstraction, leading to the 99.51% ratio (28.8&#160;mmol&#160;min&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1) rate for thioanisole conversion with H2O2 assisted advance oxidation technology. This work brings a new sight on the coordinated atoms dominant oxidation process.

         <title>Carbon Nanocage with Maximum Utilization of Atomically Dispersed Iron as Efficient Oxygen Electroreduction Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical meso&#8208;/microporous N/S co&#8208;doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 is prepared via nano&#8208;emulsion induced polymerization self&#8208;assembly method, and employed as efficient oxygen electroreduction nanoreactor. The significance of well&#8208;developed nanostructure and porosity toward maximizing utilization of active sites and ensuring fast mass transfer is addressed for highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalyst by systematical experiments and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology.








Abstract
As key parameters of electrocatalysts, the density and utilization of active sites determine the electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction. Unfortunately, prevalent oxygen electrocatalysts fail to maximize the utilization of active sites due to inappropriate nanostructural design. Herein, a nano&#8208;emulsion induced polymerization self&#8208;assembly strategy is employed to prepare hierarchical meso&#8208;/microporous N/S co&#8208;doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4 (denoted as Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC). In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology reveals the density of available active sites for Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC reach to 3.57&#160;&#215;&#160;1014 sites cm&#8722;2, representing more than threefold improvement compared to micropore&#8208;dominant Micro&#8208;FeNSC counterpart (1.07&#160;&#215;&#160;1014 sites cm&#8722;2). Additionally, the turnover frequency of Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC is also improved to 0.69 from 0.50 e&#8722; site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for Micro&#8208;FeNSC. These properties motivate Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC as efficient oxygen electroreduction electrocatalyst, in terms of outstanding half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V), remarkable kinetic mass specific activity (68.65 A g&#8722;1), and excellent robustness. The assembled Zn&#8211;air batteries with Meso/Micro&#8208;FeNSC deliver high peak power density (264.34&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), large specific capacity (814.09&#160;mA h g&#8722;1), and long cycle life (&gt;200&#160;h). This work sheds lights on quantifying active site density and the significance of maximum utilization of active sites for rational design of advanced catalysts.

     alt="Carbon Nanocage with Maximum Utilization of Atomically Dispersed Iron as Efficient Oxygen Electroreduction Nanoreactor"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical meso-/microporous N/S co-doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is prepared via nano-emulsion induced polymerization self-assembly method, and employed as efficient oxygen electroreduction nanoreactor. The significance of well-developed nanostructure and porosity toward maximizing utilization of active sites and ensuring fast mass transfer is addressed for highly efficient single-atom catalyst by systematical experiments and in situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As key parameters of electrocatalysts, the density and utilization of active sites determine the electrocatalytic performance toward oxygen reduction reaction. Unfortunately, prevalent oxygen electrocatalysts fail to maximize the utilization of active sites due to inappropriate nanostructural design. Herein, a nano-emulsion induced polymerization self-assembly strategy is employed to prepare hierarchical meso-/microporous N/S co-doped carbon nanocage with atomically dispersed Fe&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (denoted as Meso/Micro-FeNSC). In situ scanning electrochemical microscopy technology reveals the density of available active sites for Meso/Micro-FeNSC reach to 3.57&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; sites cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, representing more than threefold improvement compared to micropore-dominant Micro-FeNSC counterpart (1.07&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; sites cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Additionally, the turnover frequency of Meso/Micro-FeNSC is also improved to 0.69 from 0.50 e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; site&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for Micro-FeNSC. These properties motivate Meso/Micro-FeNSC as efficient oxygen electroreduction electrocatalyst, in terms of outstanding half-wave potential (0.91&#160;V), remarkable kinetic mass specific activity (68.65 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and excellent robustness. The assembled Zn&#8211;air batteries with Meso/Micro-FeNSC deliver high peak power density (264.34&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), large specific capacity (814.09&#160;mA h g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and long cycle life (&amp;gt;200&#160;h). This work sheds lights on quantifying active site density and the significance of maximum utilization of active sites for rational design of advanced catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Impermeable Atomic Layer Deposition for Sputtering Buffer Layer in Efficient Semi&#8208;Transparent and Tandem Solar Cells via Activating Unreactive Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic layer deposition (ALD) growth mode on the commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM is activated from island growth to layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mode by introducing reaction sites. As a result, the excellent stability, efficient semi&#8208;transparent device, and perovskite/silicon tandem device with reaction sites are available.








Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) turns out to be particularly attractive technology for the sputtering buffer layer when preparing the semi&#8208;transparent (ST) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and the tandem solar cells. ALD process turns to be island growth when the substrate is unreactive with the ALD reactants, resulting in the pin&#8208;hole layer, which causes an adverse effect on anti&#8208;sputtering. Here, p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PSCs with ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer are conducted. The commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PVK solar cell is an unreactive substrate that prevents the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth for the ALD SnOx. PCBM layer is activated by introducing reaction sites to form impermeable ALD layers. By introducing reaction sites/ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer, the authors succeed to fabricate ST&#8208;PSCs and perovskite/silicon (double&#8208;side polished) tandem solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.25% and 23.31%, respectively. Besides, the unencapsulated device with reaction sites maintains more than 99% of the initial PCE after aging over 5100 h. This work opens a promising avenue to prepare impermeable layer for stable PSCs, ST&#8208;PSCs, tandem solar cells, and the related scale&#8208;up solar cells.

         <title>Strategic Synthesis of 2D and&#160;3D Conducting Polymers and Derived Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategic synthesis technique based on a bicontinuous microemulsion system is developed to design nanostructures of conducting polymers including 2D, 3D, and nanocomposites with tailored electrical properties and morphologies.








Abstract
In recent decades, there has been a great deal of interest in conducting polymers due to their broad applications. At the same time, various synthetic techniques have been developed to produce various nanostructures of the conducting polymers with their fascinating properties. However, the techniques for the manufacture of 2D nanosheets are either complex or expensive. No comprehensive approach for constructing 2D and 3D materials or their composites has been documented. Herein, a simple and scalable synthetic protocol is reported for the design of 2D, 3D, and related conducting polymer nanocomposites by interface manipulation in a bicontinuous microemulsion system. In this method, diverse bicontinuous thin layers of oil and water are employed to produce 2D nanosheets of conducting polymers. For the fabrication of 3D polypyrrole (PPY) and their composites, specially designed linkers of the monomers are applied to lock the 3D networks of the conducting polymers and their composites. The technique can be extended to the fabrication of most conducting polymer composites, being cost&#8208;effective and easily scalable. The optimum electrical conductivity obtained for 2D PPY nanosheets is 219&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, the highest literature value reported to date to the best of knowledge.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix Secretion Mechanically Reinforces Interlocking Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a bioinspired interlocking interface produced by electrostatic flocking. Such an interface can sustain cell growth, and the perpendicularly aligned flocked fibers can mitigate cell death caused by compression. In addition, the secreted extracellular matrix from seeded cells significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the interface.








Abstract
Drawing inspiration for biomaterials from biological systems has led to many biomedical innovations. One notable bioinspired device, Velcro, consists of two substrates with interlocking ability. Generating reversibly interlocking biomaterials is an area of investigation, as such devices can allow for modular tissue engineering, reversibly interlocking biomaterial interfaces, or friction&#8208;based coupling devices. Here, a biaxially interlocking interface generated using electrostatic flocking is reported. Two electrostatically flocked substrates are mechanically and reversibly interlocked with the ability to resist shearing and compression forces. An initial high&#8208;throughput screen of polyamide flock fibers with varying diameters and fiber lengths is conducted to elucidate the roles of different fiber parameters on scaffold mechanical properties. After determining the most desirable parameters via weight scoring, polylactic acid (PLA) fibers are used to emulate the ideal scaffold for in vitro use. PLA flocked scaffolds are populated with osteoblasts and interlocked. Interlocked flocked scaffolds improved cell survivorship under mechanical compression and sustained cell viability and proliferation. Additionally, the compression and shearing resistance of cell&#8208;seeded interlocking interfaces increased with increasing extracellular matrix deposition. The introduction of extracellular matrix&#8208;reinforced interlocking interfaces may serve as binders for modular tissue engineering, act as scaffolds for engineering tissue interfaces, or enable friction&#8208;based couplers for biomedical applications.

         <title>Intrinsic Charge Polarization in Bi19S27Cl3 Nanorods Promotes Selective C&#63743;C Coupling Reaction during Photoreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of intrinsic charge polarization has been efficiently exploited for the C&#63743;C coupling reaction. The selected catalyst, Bi19S27Cl3&#160;has three suitably arranged Bi centers with asymmetric charge distribution. The charge polarized Bi centers facilitate the formation of COCOH* intermediate which has been realized as the crucial step for synthesizing ethanol from CO2.








Abstract
Obtaining multi&#8208;carbon products via CO2&#160;photoreduction is a major catalytic challenge involving multielectron&#8208;mediated C&#63743;C bond formation. Complex design of multicomponent interfaces that are exploited to achieve this chemical transformation, often leads to untraceable deleterious changes in the interfacial chemical environment affecting CO2&#160;conversion efficiency and product selectivity. Alternatively, robust metal centers having asymmetric charge distribution can effectuate C&#63743;C coupling reaction through the stabilization of intermediates, for desired product selectivity. However, generating inherent charge distribution in a single component catalyst is a difficult material design challenge. Here, a novel photocatalyst, Bi19S27Cl3, is presented which selectively converts CO2&#160;to a C2&#160;product, ethanol, in high yield under visible light irradiation. Structural analysis through transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the presence of charge polarized bismuth centers in Bi19S27Cl3. The intrinsic electric field induced by charge polarized bismuth centers renders better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pair. Furthermore, charge polarized centers yield better adsorption of CO* intermediate and accelerate the rate determining C&#63743;C coupling step through the formation of OCCOH intermediate. Formation of these intermediates is experimentally mapped by in&#160;situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation.

Here, a novel photocatalyst, Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is presented which selectively converts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;to a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;product, ethanol, in high yield under visible light irradiation. Structural analysis through transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the presence of charge polarized bismuth centers in Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The intrinsic electric field induced by charge polarized bismuth centers renders better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pair. Furthermore, charge polarized centers yield better adsorption of CO* intermediate and accelerate the rate determining C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C coupling step through the formation of OCCOH intermediate. Formation of these intermediates is experimentally mapped by in&#160;situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Asperities for Pressure&#8208;Tunable Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many applications require on&#8208;demand control of adhesion at an interface without significant power consumption. In this work, a new form of adhesive termed &#8220;pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive&#8221; (PTA) is presented. PTAs are elastomeric surfaces patterned with stiff, axisymmetric asperities. The adhesive force of the PTA increases with increasing applied preload. The pressure&#8208;tunable adhesion is demonstrated for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling.








Abstract
Control of adhesion is important in a host of applications including soft robotics, pick&#8208;and&#8208;place manufacturing, wearable devices, and transfer printing. While there are adhesive systems with discrete switchability between states of high and low adhesion, achieving continuously variable adhesion strength remains a challenge. In this work, a pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive (PTA) that is based on the self&#8208;assembly of stiff microscale asperities on an elastomeric substrate is presented. It is demonstrated that the adhesion strength of the PTA increases with the applied compressive preload due to the unique contact formation mechanism caused by the asperities. Additionally, a contact mechanics model is developed to explain the resulting trends. For a specific PTA design, the critical pull&#8208;off force can be increased from 0.4 to 30&#160;mN by increasing the applied preload from 1 to 30&#160;mN. Finally, the applicability of precision control of adhesion strength is demonstrated by utilizing the PTA for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling. The approach in pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive design based on self&#8208;assembly of asperities presents a scalable and versatile approach that is applicable to a variety of material systems having different mechanical or surface properties.

         <title>New Method for Preparing ZnO Layer for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and environmentally friendly method, through boric acid, to remove the residual amine in zinc oxide (ZnO) without decomposing ZnO is reported. Consequently, the optimized tandem organic solar cells (OSCs) output of 19.56% power conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term illumination stability of OSCs are significantly improved.








Abstract
Owing to outstanding optoelectronic properties and simple preparation, zinc oxide (ZnO) has widely been used in organic solar cells (OSCs). Although versatile cathode interface materials have been designed in past, ZnO remains indispensable owing to its excellent overall performance. Therefore, solving the persistent problem of residual amine reacting with non&#8208;fullerene acceptors will make ZnO superior over other materials, and thus improve the performance and energy budget of OSCs. Herein, a simple, effective, and economical method for removing residual amine in ZnO without distorting ZnO is reported. By accurately comparing the alkalinities of ZnO and residual amine, boric acid (BA) is selected as the amine&#8208;removing agent because of its suitable acidic dissociation constant. Moreover, the high water solubility of BA ensures that the post&#8208;cleaning process can be easily performed. The work function, electron extraction, and stability of cathode interface layer are optimized through rinsing them with BA. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of OSCs under long&#8208;term illumination are significantly improved. The optimal 0.04&#160;and 1.00&#160;cm2&#160;single&#8208;junction OSCs are based on PBDB&#8208;TF:HDO&#8208;4Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9&#160;bulk heterojunction output 18.40% and 17.42% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, tandem OSCs based on the BA&#8208;treated ZnO exhibit a 19.56% PCE, demonstrating the reliability of this method.

         <title>Manipulating the Formation of 2D/3D Heterostructure in Stable High&#8208;Performance Printable CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ X&#8208;ray scattering is applied to investigate the structure evolution pathway of the 2D phase atop 3D perovskite. By manipulating the phase transition pathway, the gradient distribution from 3D to n&#160;= 2 and n&#160;= 1 phase is realized in final films which helps charge separation and extraction, finally concurrently boosted the device stability and efficiency.








Abstract
Manipulating the formation process of the 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure, including its nucleation/growth dynamics and phase transition pathway, plays a critical role in controlling the charge transport between 2D and 3D crystals, and consequently, the scalable fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. Herein, the structural evolution and phase transition pathways of the ligand&#8208;dependent 2D perovskite atop the 3D surface are revealed using time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray scattering. The results show that the ligand size and shape have a critical influence on the final 2D structure. In particular, ligands with smaller sizes and more reactive sites tend to form the n&#160;= 1 phase. Increasing the ligand size and decreasing the reactive sites promote the transformation from 3D to n&#160;= 3 and n&#160;&lt; 3 phases. These findings are useful for the rational design of the phase distribution in 2D perovskites to balance the charge transport and stability of the perovskite films. Finally, solar cells based on ambient&#8208;printed CsPbI3 with n&#8208;butylammonium iodide treatment achieve an improved efficiency of 20.33%, which is the highest reported value for printed inorganic perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;Selective Antigen&#8208;Presentation by Supramolecular Chiral Polymer Micelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral polymer micelles are prepared by complexing antigens with chiral amino acid modified polyethyleneimine. D&#8208;chiral micelles present the lowest cytotoxicity while promoting the highest activation levels of dendritic cells and antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells compared to those of L&#8208;chiral and achiral micelles. Immunoactivation mediated by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in biological systems, which is closely related to biological functions, life processes, and even the pathogenesis of diseases. However, the interface between the chirality of synthetic materials and organisms, particularly the immune system, remains poorly understood. Here, supramolecular chiral polymer micelles (SCPMs) are prepared by complexing antigenic proteins with chiral amino acid&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine. The introduction of chirality not only reduces the toxicity of cationic polymer, but also benefits cell uptake and antigen presentation. Especially, D&#8208;chirality presents the lowest cytotoxicity, while promoting the highest expression level of costimulatory molecules on dendritic cells compared to L&#8208;chirality and achirality. The superiority of D&#8208;chirality to stimulate dendritic cell maturation is supported by immunization with D&#8208;SCPMs, which achieves significant antigen&#8208;specific proliferation of T cells in the spleen, lymph nodes, and tumor of mice. Chirality&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation are demonstrated by D&#8208;SCPMs self&#8208;assembled from chiral alkaline histidine or neutral phenylalanine modified polyethyleneimine and tumor associated ovalbumin or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike 1 antigenic protein. Immunoactivation enabled by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.

         <title>A Molecularly Tailored Photosensitizer with an Efficiency of 13.2% for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>

Dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) is demonstrated as an efficient &#960;&#8208;linker for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells. Endowed with the hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination, yielding a record power conversion efficiency of 13.2% and an outstanding stability under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h.








Abstract
Photosensitizers yielding superior photocurrents are crucial for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Herein, two molecularly tailored organic sensitizers are presented, coded ZS4 and ZS5, through judiciously employing dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8243;,3&#8243;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) as the &#960;&#8208;linker and hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) or naphthalene&#8208;fused&#8208;quinoxaline (NFQ) as the auxiliary electron&#8208;accepting unit, respectively. Endowed with the HPQ acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination as compared to ZS5. As a result, ZS4&#8208;based DSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% under standard AM1.5G sunlight, with a high short&#8208;circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05&#160;V and a fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. Remarkably, DSCs sensitized with ZS4 exhibit an outstanding stability, retaining 95% of their initial PCE under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h. It is believed that&#160;this is a new record efficiency reported so far for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based DSCs using a single sensitizer. The work highlights the importance of developing molecularly tailored photosensitizers for highly efficient DSCs with copper electrolyte.

         <title>Sulfonium&#8208;Cations&#8208;Assisted Intermediate Engineering for Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of sulfonium cation on the evolution of intermediates in quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites are investigated. It is found that the undesired intermediate can be suppressed with a favorable intermediate promoted after treatment, leading to improved film quality and enhanced device performance with superior photovoltaic efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D&#160;Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites with superior stability are admirable candidates for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) toward commercialization. However, the device performance remains unsatisfactory due to the disordered crystallization of perovskites. In this work, the effects of sulfonium cations on the evolution of intermediates and photovoltaic properties of 2D RP perovskites are investigated. The introduction of sulfonium cations leads to preferred intermediate transformation and improved film quality of perovskites. The resulting devices deliver a champion efficiency of 19.08% at room temperature and 20.52% at 180&#160;K, due to reduced recombination and enhanced charge transport. More importantly, the unencapsulated device maintains 84% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 40&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h. This work helps to gain a comprehensive understanding of the crystallization process of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites and provides a simple strategy to modulate the intermediates of perovskites.

         <title>Discovery of Type II Interlayer Trions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first observation of Type II interlayer trions by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic system&#8208;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure is reported. Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions.








Abstract
In terms of interlayer trions, electronic excitations in van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) can be classified into Type I (i.e., two identical charges in the same layer) and Type II (i.e., two identical charges in the different layers). Type I interlayer trions are investigated theoretically and experimentally. By contrast, Type II interlayer trions remain elusive in vdWHs, due to inadequate free charges, unsuitable band alignment, reduced Coulomb interactions, poor interface quality, etc. Here, the first observation of Type II interlayer trions is reported by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic system&#8212;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure (1L&#160;+&#160;2L HS). Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned and observed via PL spectroscopy. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions, which is highly correlated with the transition dipole moment of pentacene. The results pave the way to develop excitonic devices and all&#8208;optical circuits using atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic bilayers.

         <title>Ultrastable Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Fuel Cell Electrocatalysts by Eliminating Non&#8208;Coordinating Nitrogen and Regulating Coordination Structures at High Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastable Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C electrocatalyst for the oxygen electroreduction in proton exchange membrane fuel cells is developed by virtue of high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis chemistry at above 1100&#160;&#176;C, which enables the regulation of atomic coordination structures of Fe centers and the elimination of non&#8208;coordinating nitrogen dopants producing detrimental peroxide byproduct.








Abstract
Pyrolyzed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials have attracted considerable interest as one of the most active noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Despite significant progress is made in improving their catalytic activity during past decades, the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts still suffer from fairly poor electrochemical and storage stability, which greatly hurdles their practical application. Here, an effective strategy is developed to greatly improve their catalytic stability in PEMFCs and storage stability by virtue of previously unexplored high&#8208;temperature synthetic chemistry between 1100 and 1200&#160;&#176;C. Pyrolysis at this rarely adopted temperature range not only enables the elimination of less active nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon sites that generate detrimental peroxide byproduct but also regulates the coordination structure of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C from less stable D1 (O&#8211;FeN4C12) to a more stable D2 structure (FeN4C10). The optimized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits excellent stability in PEMFCs (&gt;80% performance retention after 30&#160;h under H2/O2 condition) and no activity loss after 35 day storage while maintaining a competitive ORR activity and PEMFC performance.

         <title>Controlled Desiccation of Preprinted Hydrogel Scaffolds Toward Complex 3D Microarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By printing highly shrinkable hydrogel scaffolds as templates via a low&#8208;resolution extrusion 3D printer, complex 3D architectures with micron&#8208;level resolution are successfully fabricated. This technique is capable of manufacturing a wider range of material types and reveals the opportunity for hydrogel to assist 3D microfabrication.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) is the key to creating a wide variety of 3D structures with unique and programmable functionalities. Direct ink writing is one of the widely used AM technologies with numerous printable materials. However, the extrude&#8208;based method is limited by low fabrication resolution, which is confined to printing macrostructures. Herein, a new AM strategy is reported, using a low&#8208;cost extrusion 3D printer, to create 3D microarchitectures at the macroscopic level through controlled desiccation of preprinted hydrogel scaffolds followed by infilling objective components. A printable hydrogel with a high&#8208;water content ensures maximum shrinkage (&#8776;99.5% in volume) of the printed scaffolds to achieve high resolution. Stable covalent cross&#8208;linking and a suitable drying rate enable uniform shrinkage of the scaffolds to retain their original architectures. Particularly, this method can be adapted to produce liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based 3D circuits and nanocomposite&#8208;based microrobots, indicating its capability to fabricate functional and complex 3D architectures with micron&#8208;level resolution from different material systems.

         <title>Hofmeister Effect&#8208;Enhanced Hydration Chemistry of Hydrogel for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar&#8208;Driven Interfacial Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid hydrogel (PMH) judiciously integrated by modified needle coke as solar absorber with polyvinyl alcohol as hydratable matrix and its implementation as evaporator for solar desalination are reported. The Hofmeister chaotropic ions can interfere hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks of PMH and strengthen corresponding hydration chemistry, thus delivering a lowered water vaporization enthalpy and an elevated evaporation performance of PMH in brine.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation technology holds great potential for mitigating the global water scarcity due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Lowering the vaporization enthalpy of water is key to boost the performance of solar&#8208;driven desalination. Herein, a highly hydratable hydrogel (PMH) network, consisting of modified needle coke as photothermal material and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as hydratable matrix, is crafted via simple physical cross&#8208;linking method. When capitalizing on the PMH as evaporator for 3.5&#160;wt% NaCl solution, a high evaporation rate of 3.18&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;under one sun illumination is deliver ed, unexpectedly outperforming that in pure water (2.53&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1). More importantly, the PMH shows a robust desalination durability, thus enabling a self&#8208;cleaning system. Further investigations reveal that the outstanding evaporation performance of PMH in brine roots in its hydrability tuned by chaotropic Cl&#8722;, wherein the Cl&#8722; can mediate the hydration chemistry of PVA in PMH and suppress related crystallinity, thus contributing to the increased content of intermediate water and the lowered vaporization enthalpy of brine. This work first scrutinizes the Hofmeister effect on the evaporation behavior of PMH evaporator in brine and provides insights for high&#8208;efficiency solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination.

         <title>Intrinsic Interfacial Dynamic Engineering of Zincophilic Microbrushes via Regulating Zn Deposition for Highly Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel structural and chemical design is proposed to anchor zincophilic microbrushes uniformly on zinc plates. By the interfacial engineering of guiding layer, zinc ion deposition is efficiently regulated, resulting in suppressed dendrite formation and hindered side reactions. These rational coverings consequently lead to satisfactory anode stability for aqueous zinc ion battery.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc ion batteries are promising efficient energy storage systems due to remarkable safety and satisfactory capacity. However, zinc metal anode instability including dendrite growth and side reactions severely hinders widespread applications. Herein, zincophilic microbrushes have been in situ anchored on zinc plates through simple freeze&#8208;drying and mild reduction of graphene oxide, successfully overcoming these thorny issues. By introducing suitable oxygen&#8208;containing groups, the microbrushes exhibit a good affinity for zinc ions, thereby providing sufficient depositing sites, promoting zinc plating and stripping during cycling, and suppressing side reactions. The delicate zincophilic microbrushes can not only function as protective layer to guide the deposition of zinc ions, but also act as high&#8208;speed pathways to redistribute the zinc ion flux for rapid kinetics. Consequently, the microbrushes&#8208;covered zinc anode displays long lifespan and good durability, whenever in symmetric cell or full battery tests. This work paves a feasible bridge to design advanced aqueous anodes by architecting both structures and compositions of metal coverings.

         <title>Janus Microdroplets with Tunable Self&#8208;Recoverable and Switchable Reflective Structural Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus microdroplets consisting of chiral nematic liquid crystals and silicone oil are synthesized, showing a large area of reflective colors compared with the spherical microdroplets. The reflective colors can be tuned by the chiral dopant concentration, the viewing angle, and magnetic field&#8208;responsive orientation of the droplets. Their suspension can be applied to&#160;self&#8208;recoverable displays, magnetic tracking, and data encryption.








Abstract
Microdroplets made from chiral liquid crystals (CLCs) can display reflective structural colors. However, the small area of reflection and their isotropic shape limit their performance. Here, Janus microdroplets are synthesized through phase separation between CLCs and silicone oil. The as&#8208;synthesized Janus microdroplets show primary structural colors with &#8776;14 times larger area compared to their spherical counterparts at a specific orientation; the orientation and thus the colored/transparent states can be switched by applying a magnetic field. The color of the Janus microdroplets can be tuned ranging from red to violet by varying the concentration of the chiral dopant in the CLC phase. Due to the density difference between the two phases, the Janus microdroplets prefer to orientate the silicone oil side up vertically, enabling the self&#8208;recoverable structural color after distortion. The Janus microdroplets can be dispersed in aqueous media to track the configuration and speed of magnetic objects. They can also be patterned as multiplexed labels for data encryption. The magnetic field&#8208;responsive Janus CLC microdroplets presented here offer new insights to generate and switch reflective colors with high color saturation. It also paves the way for broader applications of CLCs, including anti&#8208;counterfeiting, data encryption, display, and untethered speed sensors.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Luminescence of CsPbX3 Nanocrystals Triggered by Chiral Carbon Dots</title>

         <dc:description>
Chiral carbon dots (Ch&#8208;CDs) trigger circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of CsPbBr3&#160;nanocrystals. Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;retains emission characteristics of the CsPbBr3&#160;with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and meanwhile has special CPL. By anion exchange, CPL can cover almost the entire visible light band. This is the first report of chiral perovskite which is induced by other chiral nanomaterials.








Abstract
Chiral carbon dots (Ch&#8208;CDs) trigger the full&#8208;color circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) of CsPbX3&#160;nanocrystals (NCs). Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;NCs are successfully synthesized via simple ligand&#8208;assisted coprecipitation of Ch&#8208;CDs and metal halides precursors at room temperature. Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;retains emission characteristics of the CsPbBr3&#160;with near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and meanwhile has special CPL, with a maximum luminescence dissymmetric factor (glum) of &#8722;3.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, which is induced by Ch&#8208;CDs. This is the first report of chiral perovskite which is induced by other chiral nanomaterials. By anion exchange, CPL can cover almost the entire visible light band. Surprisingly, the chiral signal of Ch&#8208;CDs&#8208;CsPbBr3&#160;NCs is in&#8208;versed under excitation state, which can be induced by the charge transfers between Ch&#8208;CDs and perovskite NCs. The combination of perovskites and Ch&#8208;CDs pave away for the design of new chiral perovskite on multifunctional applications.

Ch-CDs-CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;NCs are successfully synthesized via simple ligand-assisted coprecipitation of Ch-CDs and metal halides precursors at room temperature. Ch-CDs-CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;retains emission characteristics of the CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;with near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield, and meanwhile has special CPL, with a maximum luminescence dissymmetric factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt;) of &#8722;3.1&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is induced by Ch-CDs. This is the first report of chiral perovskite which is induced by other chiral nanomaterials. By anion exchange, CPL can cover almost the entire visible light band. Surprisingly, the chiral signal of Ch-CDs-CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;NCs is in-versed under excitation state, which can be induced by the charge transfers between Ch-CDs and perovskite NCs. The combination of perovskites and Ch-CDs pave away for the design of new chiral perovskite on multifunctional applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Regenerated LiFePO4 from Spent Cathode by Elevating the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe in regenerated LiFePO4 (RSLFP@NC), which effectively restrains Fe migration and the formation of antisite defects during cycling. Therefore, the regenerated LFP shows excellent cycling performance with &#8776;80% retention after 1000&#160;cycles, which is better than the cycling performance of pristine LiFePO4.








Abstract
A large amount of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) has been produced in recent years because it is one of the most widely used cathode materials for electric vehicles. The traditional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling methods are doubted because of the economic and environmental benefits; the direct regeneration method is considered a promising way to recycle spent LFP. However, the performance of regenerated LFP by direct recycling is not ideal due to the migration of Fe ions during cycling and irreversible phase transition caused by sluggish Li+ diffusion. The key to addressing the challenge is to immobilize Fe atoms in the lattice and improve the Li+ migration capability during cycling. In this work, spent LFP is regenerated by using environmentally friendly ethanol, and its cycling stability is promoted by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe atoms via construction of a heterogeneous interface between LFP and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. The Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions during cycling is suppressed due to the elevated d&#8208;band center. The Li+ diffusion kinetics in the regenerated LFP are improved, leading to an excellent reversibility of the phase transition. Therefore, &#160;the regenerated LFP exhibits an ultrastable cycling performance at a high rate of 10&#160;C with &#8776;80% capacity retention after 1000&#160;cycles.

Perovskite Solar Cells
In article 2208061, Lukas E. Lehner, Martin Kaltenbrunner, and co&#8208;workers report the controlled nucleation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites at the liquid&#8211;air interface of the precursor solution. Restricting the initial crystal growth to the surface of the liquid results in highly aligned perovskite thin films with improved charge transport, enabling efficient solar cells with excellent stability.

All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries
The application of a lithium&#8208;rich layered oxide (LLO) cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) has been hampered by its low electronic conductivity and the high reactivity of its lattice oxygen. In article number 2207234, Ruizhi Yu, Jiantao Wang, Xifei Li, Chandra Veer Singh, Xueliang Sun, and co&#8208;workers successfully address this by introducing an appropriate amount of conductive additives to the solid&#8208;state electrodes and manipulating the surface chemistry, realizing long&#8208;cycle&#8208;life LLO&#8208;based ASSBs.

Cathode Materials
The cycling performance of regenerated LiFePO4 by the direct recycling method is generally not ideal due to the migration of iron (Fe) ions during cycling. In article number 2208034, Zheng Liang, Guangmin Zhou, Hui&#8208;Ming Cheng, and co&#8208;workers report long&#8208;life regenerated LiFePO4 from the spent cathode. Fe&#8211;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions is suppressed by elevating the d&#8208;band center of the Fe. Therefore, excellent cycle performance of LiFePO4 is realized and this strategy provides a guideline for achieving good performance of regenerated LiFePO4.

Pressure&#8208;Tunable Adhesives
In article number 2207337, Chelsea Davis and co&#8208;workers show that pressure&#8208;tunable adhesives (PTAs) demonstrate variable adhesive separation forces depending on the application pressure used to form the interface. PTAs are formed by annealing a polymer film on a silicone surface so that it dewets, forming polygonal clusters. The large gray circle is the flat face of a cylindrical probe about to make contact with the PTA during a probe&#8208;tack adhesion experiment.

         <title>The Promise of Soft&#8208;Matter&#8208;Enabled Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Despite recent rapid growth, traditional synthetic approaches to quantum materials have limited architectural control beyond the atomic scale. By contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can tailor structures over a wide range of length scales. This review explores opportunities for soft matter to impact quantum material synthesis, highlighting existing work at the interface, and offering perspectives on soft&#8208;matter&#8208;enabled quantum materials.








Abstract
The field of quantum materials has experienced rapid growth over the past decade, driven by exciting new discoveries with immense transformative potential. Traditional synthetic methods to quantum materials have, however, limited the exploration of architectural control beyond the atomic scale. By contrast, soft matter self&#8208;assembly can be used to tailor material structure over a large range of length scales, with a vast array of possible form factors, promising emerging quantum material properties at the mesoscale. This review explores opportunities for soft matter science to impact the synthesis of quantum materials with advanced properties. Existing work at the interface of these two fields is highlighted, and perspectives are provided on possible future directions by discussing the potential benefits and challenges which can arise from their bridging.

         <title>Block Copolymer Self&#8208;Assembly Directed Synthesis of Porous Materials with Ordered Bicontinuous Structures and Their Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article overviews the progress of the studies on block copolymer self&#8208;assembly guided synthesis of bicontinuous porous materials, with the emphases on their synthetic strategies, structural control, and potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.








Abstract
Porous materials with their ordered bicontinuous structures have attracted great interest owing to ordered periodic structures as well as 3D interconnected network and pore channels. Bicontinuous structures may favor efficient mass diffusion to the interior of materials, thus increasing the utilization ratio of active sites. In addition, ordered bicontinuous structures confer materials with exceptional optical and magnetic properties, including tunable photonic bandgap, negative refraction, and multiple equivalent magnetization configurations. The attractive structural advantages and physical properties have inspired people to develop strategies for preparing bicontinuous&#8208;structured porous materials. Among a few synthetic approaches, the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers represents a versatile strategy to prepare various bicontinuous&#8208;structured functional materials with pore sizes and lattice parameters ranging from 1 to 500&#160;nm. This article overviews progress in this appealing area, with an emphasis on the synthetic strategies, the structural control (including topologies, pore sizes, and unit cell parameters), and their potential applications in energy storage and conversion, metamaterials, photonic crystals, cargo delivery and release, nanoreactors, and biomolecule selection.

         <title>Pivotal Routes for Maximizing Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cell Performance: Photon Propagation Management and Carrier Kinetics Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 5, February 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic understanding of the mechanism of photon propagation and carrier kinetics of semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) is critical for the development of high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;PSCs. In this paper, the key factors affecting the high light utilization of ST&#8208;PSCs are deeply discussed from the theoretical analysis, and the recent advances from the view of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation of ST&#8208;PSCs are summarized, which provides guidance for promoting the rapid development and further commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) are ideal candidates for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and tandem solar cells (TSCs) owing to their tunable bandgap and high visible transparency. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ST&#8208;PSCs is close to 15% with an average visible transmittance of over 20%, which still lags far behind the PCE of normal opaque PSCs. This can be attributed to the poor light utilization efficiency (LUE) of ST&#8208;PSCs. Herein, the pivotal routes for maximizing LUE of ST&#8208;PSCs in terms of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation are systematically rationalized. First, the fundamental theoretical analyses on optical processes and electronic properties are provided. Then, insights on photon propagation management measures and carrier kinetics regulation strategies are provided. Furthermore, a summary of the promising commercial application of ST&#8208;PSCs in BIPV and TSCs is provided. Finally, the main progress of ST&#8208;PSCs is briefly summarized, and the directions for the commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs are proposed.
