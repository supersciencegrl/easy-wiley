         <title>Construction of Ultrathin S&#8208;scheme Heterojunctions of Single Ni Atom&#8208;immobilized Ti&#8208;MOF and BiVO4 for CO2 Photoconversion nearly 100% to CO by Pure Water</title>

Abstract
To rationally design single&#8208;atom MOF&#8208;involved photocatalysts remains an ongoing challenge for efficient CO2 conversion. Here, we exploit the cuppy microstructures, consisting of Ti(IV)&#8208;oxo node and three linked carboxylic moieties, in single&#8208;coordination&#8208;layer Ti2(H2dobdc)3 MOF (NTU&#8208;9) to immobilize abundant single Ni(II) sites (Ni@MOF). The coupling of Ni@MOF with BiVO4 (BVO) nanosheets by H&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced assembly process obtains wide&#8208;spectrum two&#8208;dimension heterojunctions. Optimal heterojunction exhibits competitive performance and enables around 66&#8208;fold CO2 conversion of that for BVO nanoparticles by pure water, with nearly 100% CO selectivity. The exceptional photoactivity is attributed to favorable S&#8208;scheme charge transfer from BVO to MOF then to single Ni(II) sites. Noteworthily, single Ni(II) sites anchored by Ti(IV)&#8208;oxo node and vicinal carboxylic moieties serving as unique local microenvironment (LME) are found to synergistically catalyze CO2 conversion. Specifically, the hydroxyl groups of carboxylic moieties can form H&#8208;bonds with CO2 to promote its adsorption on single Ni(II) sites, and also can provide accessible protons to facilitate H&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. Moreover, the CO desorption and subsequent CO2 adsorption on single Ni(II) sites with LME is proved thermodynamically favored hence dominates high CO selectivity. This work highlights the significance of modulating the LME of single atoms to rationally design photocatalysts for realizing carbon neutralization.

         <title>Charge Transport in Twisted Organic Semiconductor Crystals of Modulated Pitch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of temperature&#8208;dependent, growth&#8208;induced twisting of crystallites of a monocomponent organic semiconductor, 2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (BDT), on charge mobility is analyzed. Organic field&#8208;effect transistor measurements and electrical potential simulation suggest that the twisting&#8208;enhanced mobility is mainly controlled by the organization of fibers in the film, not their individual forms.








Abstract
Many molecular crystals (approximately one third) grow as twisted, helicoidal ribbons from the melt, and this preponderance is even higher in restricted classes of materials, for instance, charge&#8208;transfer complexes. Previously, twisted crystallites of such complexes present an increase in carrier mobilities. Here, the effect of twisting on charge mobility is better analyzed for a monocomponent organic semiconductor, 2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;dodecyl&#8208;2&#8208;thienyl)&#8208;thiazolo[5,4&#8208;d]thiazole (BDT), that forms twisted crystals with varied helicoidal pitches and makes possible a correlation of twist strength with carrier mobility. Films are analyzed by X&#8208;ray scattering and Mueller matrix polarimetry to characterize the microscale organization of the polycrystalline ensembles. Carrier mobilities of organic field&#8208;effect transistors are five times higher when the crystals are grown with the smallest pitches (most twisted), compared to those with the largest pitches, along the fiber elongation direction. A tenfold increase is observed along the perpendicular direction. Simulation of electrical potential based on scanning electron microscopy images and density functional theory suggests that the twisting&#8208;enhanced mobility is mainly controlled by the fiber organization in the film. A greater number of tightly packed twisted fibers separated by numerous smaller gaps permit better charge transport over the film surface compared to fewer big crystallites separated by larger gaps.

         <title>Responsive Hydrogels Based on Triggered Click Reactions for Liver Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;linked hydrophilic polymer chains that can form gels are widely utilized for biomedical applications, such as drug delivery. Various studies have also demonstrated the effects of particle size and surface morphology on drug release from particles in liver cancer therapy. Mechanistic understandings of responsive hydrogels in responsive stimuli are provided, by which better clinical choices may be approached.








Abstract
Globally, liver cancer, which is one of the major cancers worldwide, has attracted the growing attention of technological researchers for its high mortality and limited treatment options. Hydrogels are soft 3D network materials containing a large number of hydrophilic monomers. By adding moieties such as nitrobenzyl groups to the network structure of a cross&#8208;linked nanocomposite hydrogel, the click reaction improves drug&#8208;release efficiency in vivo, which improves the survival rate and prolongs the survival time of liver cancer patients. The application of a nanocomposite hydrogel drug delivery system can not only enrich the drug concentration at the tumor site for a long time but also effectively prevents the distant metastasis of residual tumor cells. At present, a large number of researches have been working toward the construction of responsive nanocomposite hydrogel drug delivery systems, but there are few comprehensive articles to systematically summarize these discoveries. Here, this systematic review summarizes the synthesis methods and related applications of nanocomposite responsive hydrogels with actions to external or internal physiological stimuli. With different physical or chemical stimuli, the structural unit rearrangement and the controlled release of drugs can be used for responsive drug delivery in different states.

         <title>Engineering the Ni&#63743;N&#63743;C Catalyst Microenvironment Enabling CO2 Electroreduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The working microenvironment of electrocatalysts influences the activity and selectivity. In this work, the working microenvironment of a structurally engineered Ni&#63743;N&#63743;C catalyst for acidic CO2 electrolysis is probed and optimized by adding hydrophobic poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) nanoparticles in the catalytic layer of a gas&#8208;diffusion electrode. The PTFE&#8208;modified electrode displays substantially decreased overpotential, nearly 100% CO selectivity, and outstanding water&#8208;flooding&#8208;resistant ability.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis in acid has emerged as a promising route to achieve high CO2 utilization due to the inhibition of undesired carbonate formation that generally occurs in alkaline or neutral conditions. However, the efficiency and stability of this system need to be further improved through tailoring of the electrocatalyst and its working environment. Here, a working microenvironment of structurally engineered Ni&#63743;N&#63743;C catalyst for acidic CO2 electrolysis is probed and optimized by adding hydrophobic poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) nanoparticles in the catalytic layer of gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes. The PTFE&#8208;modified electrode delivers nearly 100% CO Faradaic efficiency at an industry&#8208;relevant current density of 250&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and a high single&#8208;pass CO2 utilization of 75.7% at a current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under 20 sccm CO2 gas flow rate. Moreover, compared to a conventional electrode without added PTFE, the PTFE&#8208;modified electrode exhibits a substantially enhanced water&#8208;flooding&#8208;resistant ability. Mechanistic investigations reveal that a moderate PTFE modification can optimize the local CO2/H2O ratio in the catalytic layer, favoring the reduction of the diffusion layer thickness and the formation of a highly active and stable solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas interfacial microenvironment.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Radiation&#8208;Driven Ultrafast Crystallization of Perovskite Films Under Heavy Humidity for Efficient Inverted Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabricating high&#8208;quality perovskite film in the ambient air is significantly important for upcoming commercial production. Here, the perovskite crystallization process by a two&#8208;step sequential solution deposition in a glovebox and air is systematically studied. Thermal&#8208;radiation&#8208;assisted ultrafast conversion from the intermediates to perovskite is demonstrated, and a comparable performance for the device from the glovebox is acheived.








Abstract
Fabricating perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in air is conducive to low&#8208;cost commercial production; nevertheless, it is rather difficult to achieve comparable device performance as that in an inert atmosphere because of the poor moisture toleration of perovskite materials. Here, the perovskite crystallization process is systematically studied using two&#8208;step sequential solution deposition in an inert atmosphere (glovebox) and air. It is found that moisture can stabilize solvation intermediates and prevent their conversion into perovskite crystals. To address this issue, thermal radiation is used to accelerate perovskite crystallization for integrated perovskite films within 10&#160;s in air. The as&#8208;formed perovskite films are compact, highly oriented with giant grain size, superior photoelectric properties, and low trap density. When the films are applied to PSC devices, a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.8% is obtained, one of the best results for air&#8208;processed inverted PSCs under high relative humidity (60&#160;&#177;&#160;10%). This work substantially assists understanding and modulation to perovskite crystallization kinetics under heavy humidity. Also, the ultrafast conversion strategy by thermal radiation&#160;provides unprecedented opportunities to manufacture high&#8208;quality perovskite films for low&#8208;temperature, eco&#8208;friendly, and air&#8208;processed efficient inverted PSCs.

         <title>MoSe2&#8208;VSe2&#8208;NbSe2 Ternary Alloy Nanosheets to Boost Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>

Abstract
Alloying of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a pioneering method for engineering electronic structures with expanded applications. In this study, MoSe2&#8208;VSe2&#8208;NbSe2 ternary alloy nanosheets were synthesized via a colloidal reaction. The composition was successfully tuned over a wide range to adjust the 2H&#8208;1T phase transition. The alloy nanosheets consisted of miscible atomic structures at all compositions, which is distinct from the immiscible binary alloys. Compared to each binary alloy, the ternary alloys displayed higher electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic electrolyte. The HER performance exhibited a volcano&#8208;type composition dependence, which is correlated with the experimental d&#8208;band center. Spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory calculations consistently predicted the homogenous atomic distributions. The Gibbs free energy of H adsorption and the activation barrier support that miscible ternary alloying greatly enhances the HER performance.

         <title>Fully Textured, Production&#8208;line Compatible Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Approaching 29% Efficiency</title>

Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising avenues for achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics with low costs. However, the highest certified efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on economically matured silicon heterojunction technology (HJT) with fully textured wafer was only 25.2% due to incompatibility between the limitation of fabrication technology which was not compatible with the production&#8208;line silicon wafer. Here, we develop a molecular&#8208;level nanotechnology by designing NiOx/2PACz ([2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid) as a ultrathin hybrid hole transport layer above ITO recombination junction, to serve as a vital pivot for achieving a conformal deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite layer on top. The NiOx interlayer facilitates a uniform self&#8208;assembly of 2PACz molecules onto the fully textured surface, thus avoiding direct contact between ITO and perovskite top&#8208;cell for a minimal shunt loss. As a result of such interfacial engineering, the fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells obtain a certified efficiency of 28.84% on a 1.2&#8208;cm2 masked area, which is the highest performance to date based on the fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible HJT. This work advances commercially promising photovoltaics with high performance and low costs by adopting a meticulously designed HTL/perovskite interface.

         <title>Nondestructive photopatterning of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free quantum dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electroluminescence from quantum dots (QDs) is a suitable photon source for futuristic displays offering hyper&#8208;realistic images with free&#8208;form factors. Accordingly, a nondestructive and scalable process capable of rendering multicolored QD patterns on a scale of several micrometers needs to be established. Here, we report nondestructive direct photopatterning for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free QDs using branched light&#8208;driven ligand crosslinkers (LiXers) containing multiple azide units. The branched LiXers effectively interlock QD films via photocrosslinking native aliphatic QD surface ligands without compromising the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of QDs. Using branched LiXers with six sterically engineered azide units, we achieved RGB QD patterns on the micrometer scale. The photocrosslinking process did not affect the photoluminescence and electroluminescence characteristics of QDs and extended the device lifetime. This nondestructive method can be readily adapted to industrial processes and make an immediate impact on display technologies, as it uses widely available photolithography facilities and high&#8208;quality heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free QDs with aliphatic ligands.

         <title>Universal Hopping Motion Protected by Structural Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A scaling law elucidates the universality in nature, presiding over many physical phenomena which seem unrelated. Thus, exploring the universality class of scaling law in a particular system enlightens its physical nature in relevance to other systems and sometimes unearths an unprecedented new dynamic phase. Here, we investigate the dynamics of weakly driven magnetic skyrmions and compare its scaling law with the motion of a magnetic domain wall (DW) creep. We find that the skyrmion does not follow the scaling law of the DW creep in 2&#8208;dimensional space but instead shows a hopping behavior similar to that of the particle&#8208;like DW in 1&#8208;dimensional confinement. In addition, the hopping law satisfies even when a topological charge of the skyrmion is removed. Therefore, the distinct scaling behavior between the magnetic skyrmion and the DW stems from a general principle beyond the topological charge. We demonstrate that the hopping behavior of skyrmions originates from the bottleneck process induced by DW segments with diverging collective lengths, which is inevitable in any closed&#8208;shape spin structure in 2&#8208;dimension. This work reveals that the structural topology of magnetic texture determines the universality class of its weakly driven motion, which is distinguished from the universality class of magnetic DW creep.

Here, we investigate the dynamics of weakly driven magnetic skyrmions and compare its scaling law with the motion of a magnetic domain wall (DW) creep. We find that the skyrmion does not follow the scaling law of the DW creep in 2-dimensional space but instead shows a hopping behavior similar to that of the particle-like DW in 1-dimensional confinement. In addition, the hopping law satisfies even when a topological charge of the skyrmion is removed. Therefore, the distinct scaling behavior between the magnetic skyrmion and the DW stems from a general principle beyond the topological charge. We demonstrate that the hopping behavior of skyrmions originates from the bottleneck process induced by DW segments with diverging collective lengths, which is inevitable in any closed-shape spin structure in 2-dimension.

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles as Controllable Two&#8208;way Adaptors to Activate Macrophage Phagocytosis for Improved Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The most immune cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) closely resemble immunosuppressive M2&#8208;polarized macrophages. Moreover, tumor cells exhibit high expression of CD47 &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal, which obstructs macrophage phagocytosis. The precise and efficient activation of TAMs is a promising approach to tumor immunotherapy; however re&#8208;education of macrophages remain a challenge.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most immune cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) closely resemble immunosuppressive M2-polarized macrophages. Moreover, tumor cells exhibit high expression of CD47 &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal, which obstructs macrophage phagocytosis. The precise and efficient activation of TAMs is a promising approach to tumor immunotherapy; however re-education of macrophages remain a challenge. Bacteria-derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are highly immunogenic nanovesicles that can robustly stimulate macrophages. Here, we report an OMV-based controllable two-way adaptor, in which a CD47 nanobody (CD47nb) was fused onto OMV surface (OMV-CD47nb), with the outer surface coated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer containing diselenide bonds (PEG/Se) to form PEG/Se@OMV-CD47nb. The PEG/Se layer modification not only mitigated the immunogenicity of OMV-CD47nb, thereby remarkedly increasing the dose that could be administered safely through intravenous injection, but also equipped the formulation with radiation-triggered controlled release of OMV-CD47nb. Application of radiation to tumors in mice injected with the nanoformulation resulted in remodeling of TME. As two-way adaptors, OMV-CD47nb activated TAM phagocytosis of tumor cells via multiple pathways, including induction of M1 polarization and blockade of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs resulted in the stimulation of T cell-mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Crossover Effects in Lithium&#8208;metal Batteries with a Localized High Concentration Electrolyte and High&#8208;nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
While crossover effects, such as transition&#8208;metal dissolution, are well&#8208;understood in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, there is a limited understanding of the effect of crossed&#8208;over chemical species in cells with oxide cathodes and lithium&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, the effects of cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode and anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode crossover are explored in cells with a high&#8208;nickel cathode, lithium&#8208;metal anode, and a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE). Dramatic differences are found among cells; a lithium&#8208;metal anode paired with a high&#8208;nickel cathode has three times less solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth than a lithium&#8208;metal anode paired with lithium metal. Meanwhile, the cathode paired with lithium metal has 2 &#8211; 3 times higher capacity fade than the same cathode paired with graphite. Decomposition and crossover of the FSI salt is identified as the main source of these changes. The fluorine in the salt is first stripped off at the lithium&#8208;metal anode, and the remaining sulfur and nitrogen cross over to the cathode. Although the reduction in fluorine content harms the surface stability of the cathode, the lithium&#8208;metal anode benefits from the increased fluorine content. Because the lithium&#8208;metal anode is typically the bottleneck for cells with thin lithium, crossover is a major factor in the enhanced performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries with LHCE.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Responsive Cluster Metal&#8208;organic Framework Nanoparticle for Enhanced Tumor Accumulation and Antitumor Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As a result of the deficient tumor&#8208;specific antigens, potential off&#8208;target effect, and influence of protein corona, the metal&#8208;organic framework nanoparticles have inadequate accumulation in the tumor tissues, limiting the therapeutic effects. In this work, a pH&#8208;responsive linker (L) is prepared by covalently modifying oleylamine (OA) with 3&#8208;(bromomethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;furandione (MMfu) and poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG). Then, the L is embedded into a solid lipid nano&#8208;shell to coat apilimod (Ap)&#8208;loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework (Ap&#8208;ZIF) to form Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L. Under the tumor microenvironment, the hydrophilic PEG and MMfu are removed, exposing the hydrophobic OA on Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L, increasing their uptake in cancer cells and accumulation in the tumor. ZIF@SLN#L nanoparticle induced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ap released from Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L significantly promoted intracellular ROS and lactate dehydrogenase generation. Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L inhibited tumor growth, increased the survival rate in mice, activated the tumor microenvironment, and improved the infiltration of macrophages and T cells in the tumor, as demonstrated in two different tumor&#8208;bearing mice after injections with Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#TL. Furthermore, mice showed normal physiological responses of the main organs and the normal serum level in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase after treatment with the nanoparticles. Overall, this pH&#8208;responsive targeting strategy improves nanoparticle accumulation in tumors with enhanced therapeutic effects.

         <title>Priority and Prospect of Sulfide&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) employing sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) promise sustainable energy storage systems with energy&#8208;dense integration and critical intrinsic safety, yet they still require cost&#8208;effective manufacturing and the integration of thin membrane&#8208;based SE separators into large&#8208;format cells to achieve scalable deployment. In this review, based on an overview of sulfide SE materials, we expound on why implementing a thin membrane&#8208;based separator is the priority for mass production of ASSLBs and identify critical criteria for capturing a high&#8208;quality thin sulfide SE membrane. Moreover, from the aspects of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration, we describe the major challenges and associated strategies to meet these criteria throughout the whole manufacturing chain to provide a realistic assessment of the current status of sulfide SE membranes. Finally, future directions and prospects for scalable and manufacturable sulfide SE membranes for ASSLBs are presented.

         <title>Integrated Ideal&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite/Bulk&#8208;Heterojunction Solar Cells with Efficiencies &gt; 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Here, we report a highly efficient integrated ideal&#8208;bandgap perovskite/bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cell (IPBSC) with an inverted architecture, featuring the near infrared (NIR) polymer DTBTI based bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) layer atop guanidinium bromide (GABr)&#8208;modified FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 perovskite film as the photoactive layer. The IPBSC shows cascade&#8208;like energy level alignment between charge&#8208;extraction&#8208;layer/perovskite/BHJ and efficient passivation effect of BHJ on perovskite. Thanks to the well&#8208;matched energy level alignment and high&#8208;quality ideal bandgap&#8208;based perovskite film, an efficient charge transfer occurs between the charge&#8208;extraction&#8208;layer/perovskite/BHJ. Moreover, the NIR polymer DTBTI on the perovskite film leads to an improved NIR light response for the IPBSC. In addition, the O, S and N atoms in the DTBTI polymer yield a strong interaction with perovskite, which is conducive to reducing the defects of the perovskite and suppressing charge recombination. As a result, the solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.27% (certificated value at 23.4% with 0.283&#8208;volt voltage loss), currently the recorded efficiency for both IPBSCs and Pb&#8208;Sn alloyed PSCs, and which is over the highest efficiency of perovskite&#8211;organic tandem solar cell. Moreover, the thermal, humidity and long&#8208;term operational stabilities of the IPBSCs have also been significantly improved compared with the control PSCs. Especially, the optimized IPBSC device retains 90% of the original efficiency under continuous illumination for 1000&#160;h with maximum power point (MPP) tracking in nitrogen&#8208;filled test box. This work provides a novel but simple and cost&#8208;effective strategy to close or even break the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;scale Observation of Grain Boundary Dominated Unsynchronized Phase Transition in Polycrystalline Cu2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase transition is a physical phenomenon that attracts great interest of researchers. Although the theory of second&#8208;order phase transition is well&#8208;established, their atomic&#8208;scale dynamics in polycrystalline materials remains elusive.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase transition is a physical phenomenon that attracts great interest of researchers. Although the theory of second-order phase transition is well-established, their atomic-scale dynamics in polycrystalline materials remains elusive. In this work, second-order phase transitions in polycrystalline Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se at the transition temperature are directly observed by in-situ aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. Phase transitions in microcrystalline Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se start at the grain boundaries and extend inside the grains. This phenomenon is more pronounced in nano-sized grains. Analysis of phase transitions in nanocrystalline Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se with different grain boundaries demonstrates that grain boundary energy dominates unsynchronized phase transition behavior. This suggests that the energy of grain boundaries is the key factor influencing the energetic barrier for initiation of phase transition. Our findings advance atomic-scale understanding of second-order phase transitions, which is crucial for the control of this process in polycrystalline materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Structural Reconstruction of Catalysts in Electroreduction Reaction: Identifying, Understanding, and Manipulating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamental insights of the structural reconstruction in electroreduction catalysts is illustrated. Special attention is paid to efficient strategies to design satisfactory cathodic catalysts including the modulation of its component and morphological features for resolving the internal inducements, the regulation of the electrolytes, gas atmosphere, and potential for resisting the external inducements.








Abstract
Electroreduction transformation of small molecules (CO2, N2, and H2O) into chemical feedstocks offers a promising approach to eliminate carbon emissions and harness renewable energy. Most cathodic catalysts often undergo structural transformation under operating electroreduction conditions. These structural reconstructions are reflected in changes in their catalytic activity. In&#8208;depth understanding of the change of active sites and influence parameters of reconstruction behaviors is an essential precondition for the design of highly efficient catalysts. Despite the previous achievements, comprehensive insight toward the structural evolution mechanism in cathodic catalysts, compared to anode ones, under reaction conditions is still lacking. Herein, an overview of structural reconstruction for cathodic catalysts in terms of fundamental mechanisms, reconstruction process, advanced characterizations, and influencing parameters is provided. On this basis, the typical strategies for manipulating the structural reconfiguration of catalysts are also explicitly discussed from the catalyst structure and working environment. By delivering the mechanism, strategies, insights, and techniques, this review will provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural reconstruction of cathodic catalysts in electroreduction reactions and future guidelines for their rational development.

         <title>Prospects for Simultaneously Capturing Carbon Dioxide and Harvesting Water from Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capturing carbon dioxide alongside water in direct air capture (DAC) operations can alleviate water stress while also providing net negative greenhouse gas emissions. The immense volumes of air processed by DAC units suggest that significant quantities of water can be removed alongside carbon dioxide. Material and process considerations toward realizing this enticing target are critically discussed.








Abstract
Mitigation of anthropogenic climate change is expected to require large&#8208;scale deployment of carbon dioxide removal strategies. Prominent among these strategies is direct air capture with sequestration (DACS), which encompasses the removal and long&#8208;term storage of atmospheric CO2&#160;by purely engineered means. Because it does not require arable land or copious amounts of freshwater, DACS is already attractive in the context of sustainable development, but opportunities to improve its sustainability still exist. Leveraging differences in the chemistry of CO2&#160;and water adsorption within porous solids, here, the prospect of simultaneously removing water alongside CO2&#160;in direct air capture operations is investigated. In many cases, the co&#8208;adsorbed water can be desorbed separately from chemisorbed CO2&#160;molecules, enabling efficient harvesting of water from air. Depending upon the material employed and process conditions, the desorbed water can be of sufficiently high purity for industrial, agricultural, or potable use and can thus improve regional water security. Additionally, the recovered water can offset a portion of the costs associated with DACS. In this Perspective, molecular&#8208; and process&#8208;level insights are combined to identify routes toward realizing this nascent yet enticing concept.

Abstract
The learning and inference efficiencies of an artificial neural network represented by a cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array can be achieved using a selector (1S), with high selectivity (Ion/Ioff) and sufficient death region, stacked vertically on a synaptic memristor (1&#160;M). This can prevent a sneak current in the memristor array. A selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped conductive Cu filaments in the resistive switching layer was precisely fabricated by designing the Cu ion concentration depth profile of the CuGeSe layer as a filament source, TiN barrier layer, and Ge3Se7 switching layer. The selector performed super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching with a selectivity of &gt;&#160;107, death region of &#8722;0.70&#8211;0.65&#160;V, holding time of 300&#160;ns, switching speed of 25&#160;ns, and endurance cycle of &gt;&#160;106. In addition, the mechanism of switching was proven by the formation of conductive Cu filaments between the CuGeSe and Ge3Se7 layers under a positive bias on the top Pt electrode and an automatic rupture of the filaments after the holding time. Particularly, a spiking deep neural network using our designed 1S1M cross&#8208;point array improved the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology classification accuracy by &#8776; 3.8% by eliminating the sneak current in the cross&#8208;point array during the inference process.

         <title>Fabrication of Bragg Mirrors by Multilayer Inkjet Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully inkjet&#8208;printed Bragg mirrors are fabricated by alternately depositing poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) composite thin&#8208;film layers. The Bragg mirrors are tunable in color/spectrum by simply adjusting the printing parameters. With precise control of the layer thickness and uniformity, the reflectance of the printed Bragg mirrors reaches 99% with ten bilayers only.








Abstract
Bragg mirrors are widely applied in optical and photonic devices due to their capability of light management. However, the fabrication of Bragg mirrors is mainly accomplished by physical and chemical vapor deposition processes, which are costly and do not allow for lateral patterning. Here, the fabrication of Bragg mirrors by fully inkjet printing is reported. The photonic bandgap of Bragg mirrors is tailored by adjusting the number of bilayers in the stack and the layer thickness via simply varying printing parameters. An ultrahigh reflectance of 99% is achieved with the devices consisting of ten bilayers only, and the central wavelength of Bragg mirrors is tuned from visible into near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Inkjet printing allows for fabricating Bragg mirrors on various substrates (e.g., glass and foils), in different sizes and variable lateral patterns. The printed Bragg mirrors not only exhibit a high reflection at designed wavelengths but also show an outstanding homogeneity in color over a large area. The approach thus enables additive manufacturing for various applications ranging from microscale photonic elements to enhanced functionality and aesthetics in large&#8208;area displays and solar technologies.

         <title>Stoichiometric Post&#8208;Modification of Hydrogel Microparticles Dictates Neural Stem Cell Fate in Microporous Annealed Particle Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between tetrazine and norbornene is used to create plain microgels for stoichiometric post&#8208;modification with various peptides to control neural progenitor cell growth and differentiation in vitro. YIGSR peptide presentation leads to neurosphere formation while IKVAV leads to stem cell spreading and differentiation.








Abstract
Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are generated from assembled hydrogel microparticles (microgels). It has been previously demonstrated that MAP scaffold&#160;are porous, biocompatible, and recruit neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to the stroke cavity after injection into the stroke core. Here, the goal is to study NPC fate inside MAP&#160;scaffolds in vitro. To create plain microgels that can later be converted to contain different types of bioactivities, the inverse electron&#8208;demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between tetrazine and norbornene is utilized, which allows the post&#8208;modification of plain microgels stoichiometrically. As a result of adhesive peptide attachment, NPC spreading leads to contractile force generation which can be recorded by tracking microgel displacement. Alternatively, non&#8208;adhesive peptide integration results in neurosphere formation that grows within the void space&#160;of MAP scaffolds. Although the formed neurospheres do not impose a contractile force on the scaffolds, they are seen to continuously transverse the scaffolds. It is concluded that MAP scaffolds&#160;&#160;can be engineered to either promote neurogenesis or enhance stemness depending on the chosen post&#8208;modifications of the microgels, which can be key in modulating their phenotypes in various applications in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;The inverse electron-demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between tetrazine and norbornene is used to create plain microgels for stoichiometric post-modification with various peptides to control neural progenitor cell growth and differentiation in vitro. YIGSR peptide presentation leads to neurosphere formation while IKVAV leads to stem cell spreading and differentiation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are generated from assembled hydrogel microparticles (microgels). It has been previously demonstrated that MAP scaffold&#160;are porous, biocompatible, and recruit neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to the stroke cavity after injection into the stroke core. Here, the goal is to study NPC fate inside MAP&#160;scaffolds in vitro. To create plain microgels that can later be converted to contain different types of bioactivities, the inverse electron-demand Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between tetrazine and norbornene is utilized, which allows the post-modification of plain microgels stoichiometrically. As a result of adhesive peptide attachment, NPC spreading leads to contractile force generation which can be recorded by tracking microgel displacement. Alternatively, non-adhesive peptide integration results in neurosphere formation that grows within the void space&#160;of MAP scaffolds. Although the formed neurospheres do not impose a contractile force on the scaffolds, they are seen to continuously transverse the scaffolds. It is concluded that MAP scaffolds&#160;&#160;can be engineered to either promote neurogenesis or enhance stemness depending on the chosen post-modifications of the microgels, which can be key in modulating their phenotypes in various applications in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Dinuclear&#8208;Type Catalysis in Cu1&#8211;C3N4 Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dinuclear&#8208;type nitrile&#8211;azide cycloaddition in a 21 wt% carbon&#8208;nitride&#8208;supported copper single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu1&#8211;C3N4) is demonstrated by reducing the inter&#8208;atom distance within the diffusion length of reactants, thus transforming the catalytic pathway from a poorly active single&#8208;site to dinuclear&#8208;type mechanism.








Abstract
Reducing particle size in supported metal catalysts to single&#8208;atom level isolates the active metal sites and maximizes the atomic utilization efficiency. However, the large inter&#8208;atom distance, particularly in low&#8208;loading single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC), is not favorable for a complex reaction where two (or more) reactants have to be activated. A key question is how to control the inter&#8208;atom distances to promote dinuclear&#8208;type coactivation at the adjacent metal sites. Here, it is reported that reducing the average inter&#8208;atom distance of copper SACs supported on carbon nitride (C3N4) to 0.74 &#177; 0.13&#160;nm allows these catalysts to exhibit a dinuclear&#8208;type catalytic mechanism in the nitrile&#8211;azide cycloaddition. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure study reveals a dynamic ligand exchange process between nitrile and azide, followed by their coactivation on dinuclear Cu SAC sites to form the tetrazole product. This work highlights that reducing the nearest&#8208;neighbor distance of SAC allows the mechanistic pathway to diversify from single&#8208;site to multisite catalysis.

         <title>Manipulating Hierarchical Orientation of Wet&#8208;Spun Hybrid Fibers via Rheological Engineering for Zn&#8208;Ion Fiber Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With entropy&#8208;driven volume&#8208;exclusion effects, the rheological behavior of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanowire dispersions is regulated through the introduction of graphene oxide (GO) flakes. A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber Zn&#8208;ion battery is assembled to integrate into a wearable self&#8208;powered system, incorporating a GaAs solar cell to deliver a high overall efficiency (9.80%).








Abstract
Wet&#8208;spinning is a promising strategy to fabricate fiber electrodes for real commercial fiber battery applications, according to its great compatibility with large&#8208;scale fiber production. However, engineering the rheological properties of the electrochemical active materials to accommodate the viscoelasticity or liquid crystalline requirements for continuous wet&#8208;spinning remains a daunting challenge. Here, with entropy&#8208;driven volume&#8208;exclusion effects, the rheological behavior of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) nanowire dispersions is regulated through introducing 2D graphene oxide (GO) flakes in an optimal ratio. By optimizing the viscoelasticity and liquid&#8208;crystalline behavior of the spinning dope, the wet&#8208;spun hybrid fibers display controlled hierarchical orientation. The wet&#8208;spun V2O5/rGO hybrid fiber with the optimal 10:1 mass fraction (V2O5/rGO10:1) exhibits a highly oriented nanoblock arrangement, enabling efficient Zn&#8208;ion migration and an excellent Zn&#8208;ion storage capacity of 486.03 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. A half&#8208;meter long quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber Zn&#8208;ion battery is assembled with a polyacrylamide gel electrolyte and biocompatible Ecoflex encapsulation. The thus&#8208;derived fiber Zn&#8208;ion battery is integrated into a wearable self&#8208;powered system, incorporating a highly efficient GaAs solar cell, which delivers a record&#8208;high overall efficiency (9.80%) for flexible solar charging systems.

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;Free and Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Battery Enabled by Ultrathin, 2D Shield&#8208;Defensive, and Single Lithium&#8208;Ion Conducting Polymeric Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel ultrathin shield&#8208;defensive polymeric membrane obtained by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking of 2D molecular brushes is successfully utilized to achieve long&#8208;cycling lithium metal batteries. For the molecular brushes, single lithium&#8208;ion conducting side&#8208;chains facilitate uniform lithium deposition, and rigid 2D extended aromatic backbones provide a superb layer upon layer protection function to prevent the dendrite growth at high current densities.








Abstract
Polymeric membranes are considered as promising materials to realize safe and long&#8208;life lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, they are usually based on soft 1D linear polymers and thus cannot effectively inhibit piercing of lithium dendrites at high current density. Herein, single lithium&#8208;ion conducting molecular brushes (GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi) are successfully designed and fabricated with a new 2D &#8220;soft&#8211;hard&#8211;soft&#8221; hierarchical structure by grafting hairy lithium polystyrenesulfonate (PSSLi) chains on both sides of graphene oxide (GO) sheets. The ultrathin GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi membrane is further constructed by evaporation&#8208;induced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembly of GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi molecular brushes. Unlike conventional soft 1D linear polymeric structure, the rigid 2D extended aromatic structure of intralayer GO backbones can bear the shield effect of preventing the dendrites possibly generated at high current density from piercing. More importantly, such a shield effect can be significantly strengthened by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking of 2D molecular brushes. On the other hand, the 3D interconnected interlayer channels and the soft single lithium&#8208;ion conducting PSSLi side&#8208;chains on the surface of channels provide rapid lithium&#8208;ion transportation pathways and homogenize lithium&#8208;ion flux. As a result, LMBs with GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi membrane possess long&#8208;term reversible lithium plating/striping (6&#160;months) at high current density.

         <title>Rashba&#8211;Edelstein Effect in the h&#8208;BN Van Der Waals Interface for Magnetization Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current&#8208;induced spin&#8211;orbit&#160;torque&#160;(SOT) is observed in the h&#8208;BN/SrRuO3 bilayer structure, where the h&#8208;BN is an insulator with negligible spin&#8211;orbit&#160;coupling. This SOT is strong enough to induce the switching of magnetization in SrRuO3. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest a giant Rashba effect at the interface between h&#8208;BN and SrRuO3 (110)pc thin film, which leads to the observed SOT based on a tight&#8208;binding model.








Abstract
Van der Waals materials are attracting great attention in the field of spintronics due to their novel physical properties. For example, they are utilized as spin&#8208;current generating materials in spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) devices, which offers an electrical way to control the magnetic state and is promising for future low&#8208;power electronics. However, SOTs have mostly been demonstrated in vdW materials with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC). Here, the observation of a current&#8208;induced SOT in the h&#8208;BN/SrRuO3 bilayer structure is reported, where the vdW material (h&#8208;BN) is an insulator with negligible SOC. Importantly, this SOT is strong enough to induce the switching of the perpendicular magnetization in SrRuO3. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest a giant Rashba effect at the interface between vdW material and SrRuO3 (110)pc thin film, which leads to the observed SOT based on a simplified tight&#8208;binding model. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the current&#8208;induced magnetization switching can be modulated by the electric field. This study paves the way for exploring the current&#8208;induced SOT and magnetization switching by integrating vdW materials with ferromagnets.

&lt;p&gt;Current-induced spin&#8211;orbit&#160;torque&#160;(SOT) is observed in the h-BN/SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bilayer structure, where the h-BN is an insulator with negligible spin&#8211;orbit&#160;coupling. This SOT is strong enough to induce the switching of magnetization in SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. First-principles calculations suggest a giant Rashba effect at the interface between h-BN and SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (110)&lt;sub&gt;pc&lt;/sub&gt; thin film, which leads to the observed SOT based on a tight-binding model.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals materials are attracting great attention in the field of spintronics due to their novel physical properties. For example, they are utilized as spin-current generating materials in spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) devices, which offers an electrical way to control the magnetic state and is promising for future low-power electronics. However, SOTs have mostly been demonstrated in vdW materials with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC). Here, the observation of a current-induced SOT in the h-BN/SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bilayer structure is reported, where the vdW material (h-BN) is an insulator with negligible SOC. Importantly, this SOT is strong enough to induce the switching of the perpendicular magnetization in SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. First-principles calculations suggest a giant Rashba effect at the interface between vdW material and SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (110)&lt;sub&gt;pc&lt;/sub&gt; thin film, which leads to the observed SOT based on a simplified tight-binding model. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the current-induced magnetization switching can be modulated by the electric field. This study paves the way for exploring the current-induced SOT and magnetization switching by integrating vdW materials with ferromagnets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visualizing Ultrafast Defect&#8208;Controlled Interlayer Electron&#8211;Phonon Coupling in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defects open a new ultrafast interlayer electron&#8211;phonon coupling in WS2/graphene heterostructures, which involves a three&#8208;body collision between electrons in WS2 and both acoustic phonons and defects in graphene. This ultrafast process is directly visualized by femtosecond transient absorption microscopy. Through controlling the defect density in graphene, the interlayer electron&#8211;phonon scattering time ranges from 7.1 to 2.4 ps.








Abstract
Engineering ultrafast interlayer coupling provides access to new quantum phenomena and novel device functionalities in atomically thin van der Waals heterostructures. However, due to all the atoms of a monolayer material being exposed at the interfaces, the interlayer coupling is extremely susceptible to defects, resulting in high energy dissipation through heat and low device performance. The study of how defects affect the interlayer coupling at ultrafast and atomic scales remains a challenge. Here, using femtosecond transient absorption microscopy, a new defect&#8208;induced ultrafast interlayer electron&#8211;phonon coupling pathway is identified in a WS2/graphene heterostructure, involving a three&#8208;body collision between electrons in WS2 and both acoustic phonons and defects in graphene. This interaction manifests as the reduced defect&#8208;related Raman resonant activity and the accelerated electron&#8211;phonon scattering time from 7.1 to 2.4&#160;ps. Furthermore, the ultrafast interlayer coupling process is directly imaged. These insights will advance the fundamental knowledge of heat dissipation in nanoscale devices, and enable new ways to dynamically manipulate electrons and phonons via defects in van der Waals heterostructures.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Glass for Low&#8208;Cost White&#8208;Light Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of amorphous molecular materials for white&#8208;light generation (WLG) by means of continuous&#8208;wave infrared lasers is introduced, denoted as &#8220;cluster&#8208;glass&#8221;. For their fabrication, compounds of the general formula [(PhSi)(CH2)3(PhSn)E3] (E&#160;=&#160;S, Se, Te) are synthesized in pure and crystalline form and reversibly transformed into amorphous, robust glasses of any shape by mild heating. The materials and WLG properties of the cluster&#8208;glasses are studied by a combined experimental and quantum chemical study.








Abstract
The development of efficient and high&#8208;brilliance white&#8208;light sources is an essential contribution to innovative emission technologies. Materials exhibiting strong nonlinear optical properties, in particular second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) or white&#8208;light generation (WLG), have therefore been investigated with great activity in recent times. While many new approaches have been reported until now, the processability of the compounds remains a challenge. Here, a new class of materials, denoted as &#8220;cluster&#8208;glass&#8221;, which do not only show superior white&#8208;light emission properties upon irradiation by an inexpensive continuous&#8208;wave infrared laser diode, but can be easily accommodated in size and shape by formation of robust glassy solids, is introduced. The cluster&#8208;glass materials are fabricated by mild heating from crystalline powders of adamantane&#8208;type clusters exhibiting a quaternary, inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid cluster core [(PhSi)(CH2)3(PhSn)E3] (E&#160; = &#160;S, Se, Te). The process is fully reversible and preserves the integrity of the clusters in the glass, as proven by solution spectroscopy and recrystallization. Theoretical studies corroborate the importance of the quaternary nature of the cluster cores for the observed structural and optical phenomena. Thanks to these findings, high&#8208;brilliance white&#8208;light sources can be synthesized in form of stable, robust glass of any shape, which ultimately renders them suitable for everyday's applications.

         <title>Multiple&#8208;Resonance Extension and Spin&#8208;Vibronic&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Based Narrowband Blue Organic Fluorescence Emitters with Over 30% Quantum Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
An indolo[3,2,1&#8208;jk]carbazole&#8208;derived extended multiple&#8208;resonance structure, driven by the spin&#8208;vibronic model, is designed to reduce the gap between the singlet and triplet excited states and to increase absolute photoluminescence quantum yield. Pure blue organic&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency over 30% and a narrow full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm are realized with extended multiple&#8208;resonance emitters.








Abstract
Achieving narrow&#8208;bandwidth emission and high external quantum efficiency (EQE) simultaneously is a challenge for next&#8208;generation blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). In this study, novel multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters are developed by fusing an indolocarbazole unit with two carbazole skeletons using para&#8208;oriented nitrogen atoms. The resulting rigid and planar &#960;&#8208;system without electron&#8208;accepting atoms exhibits pure blue photoluminescence at 470&#160;nm, reaching a 100% quantum yield with a full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm. Higher&#8208;level quantum chemistry calculations confirm an MR effect within the extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation and an enhanced triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet crossover (104 s&#8722;1) through a reduced energy gap (&#916;EST) coupled with large spin&#8208;vibronic coupling mediated by low&#8208;lying triplet excited states. An OLED fabricated using the MR&#8208;TADF emitter with CIE color coordinates of (0.12, 0.16) exhibits a record high EQE of 30.9% and a small FWHM of 23&#160;nm. With further optimization of the device structure, a high EQE of 33.8% is achieved without additional outcoupling enhancements owing to the near&#8208;perfect horizontal alignment of the emitting dipoles.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Dot Perovskite Spectrometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;dot perovskite spectrometer is demonstrated, which first breaks the long&#8208;standing restriction of footprint&#8208;resolution. The control of ion migration in the perovskite is the key of the spectrum richness and cyclic stability. Without any optical and mechanical structure, the spectrum can be recognized by a single detector through the bias stimulated photogain modulation.








Abstract
There are significant applications for miniature on&#8208;chip spectrometers in many fields. However, at present, on&#8208;chip spectrometers have to utilize an integrated strategy to achieve spectral analysis, which undoubtedly squanders the photosensitive area and adds pressure to the miniaturization of the spectrometer. Here, a unique spectrometer design that adopts a single detection point with in situ modulation realized by the photogain control at various bias voltages is demonstrated. With micrometer&#8208;level footprints, this single&#8208;dot spectrometer processes a resolution of about 5&#160;nm and a response time down to about 197 &#181;s. This is the first in situ perovskite modulation strategy that breaks the footprint&#8208;resolution restriction of spectrum analysis and demonstrates a new design direction for functional perovskite devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are significant applications for miniature on-chip spectrometers in many fields. However, at present, on-chip spectrometers have to utilize an integrated strategy to achieve spectral analysis, which undoubtedly squanders the photosensitive area and adds pressure to the miniaturization of the spectrometer. Here, a unique spectrometer design that adopts a single detection point with in situ modulation realized by the photogain control at various bias voltages is demonstrated. With micrometer-level footprints, this single-dot spectrometer processes a resolution of about 5&#160;nm and a response time down to about 197 &#181;s. This is the first in situ perovskite modulation strategy that breaks the footprint-resolution restriction of spectrum analysis and demonstrates a new design direction for functional perovskite devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Stretchable Transducer for Wearable Continuous Monitoring of Respiratory Patterns in Humans and Animals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bio&#8208;inspired composite silicone transducer, consisting of an air channel encapsulated within a silicone elastomer, measures mechanical forces applied to its surface during respiration. The transducer technology reported is suitable for use with furry animals (pets and laboratory animals) and humans for unobtrusive monitoring of respiration over fur or clothing.








Abstract
A bio&#8208;inspired continuous wearable respiration sensor modeled after the lateral line system of fish is reported which is used for detecting mechanical disturbances in the water. Despite the clinical importance of monitoring respiratory activity in humans and animals, continuous measurements of breathing patterns and rates are rarely performed in or outside of clinics. This is largely because conventional sensors are too inconvenient or expensive for wearable sensing for most individuals and animals. The bio&#8208;inspired air&#8208;silicone composite transducer (ASiT) is placed on the chest and measures respiratory activity by continuously measuring the force applied to an air channel embedded inside a silicone&#8208;based elastomeric material. The force applied on the surface of the transducer during breathing changes the air pressure inside the channel, which is measured using a commercial pressure sensor and mixed&#8208;signal wireless electronics. The transducer produced in this work are extensively characterized and tested with humans, dogs, and laboratory rats. The bio&#8208;inspired ASiT may enable the early detection of a range of disorders that result in altered patterns of respiration. The technology reported can also be combined with artificial intelligence and cloud computing to algorithmically detect illness in humans and animals remotely, reducing unnecessary visits to clinics.

         <title>W Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for CH4 Photooxidation in Water Vapor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass fabrication of low&#8208;cost tungsten single atom photocatalysts is achieved by directly calcining urea and sodium tungstate under atmosphere. These single&#8208;atom photocatalysts can manage H2O2 in situ generation and decomposition into &#183;OH to achieve highly efficient CH4 photooxidation in water vapor, and the products can be facilely switched from HCOOH to CH3OH by the liquid&#8211;solid phase transition.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven high&#8208;efficiency and direct conversion of methane into high&#8208;value&#8208;added liquid oxygenates against overoxidation remains a great challenge. Herein, facile and mass fabrication of low&#8208;cost tungsten single&#8208;atom photocatalysts is achieved by directly calcining urea and sodium tungstate under atmosphere (W&#8208;SA&#8208;PCN&#8208;m, urea amount m&#160;= 7.5, 15, 30, and 150&#160;g). The single&#8208;atom photocatalysts can manage H2O2 in situ generation and decomposition into &#183;OH, thus achieving highly efficient CH4 photooxidation in water vapor under mild conditions. Systematic investigations demonstrate that integration of multifunctions of methane activation, H2O2 generation, and decomposition into one photocatalyst can dramatically promote methane conversion to C1 oxygenates with a yield as high as 4956 &#181;mol gcat&#8722;1, superior to that of the most reported non&#8208;precious photocatalysts. Liquid&#8211;solid phase transition can induce the products to facilely switch in&#160;from HCOOH to CH3OH by pulling the catalyst above water with CH3OH/HCOOH ratio from 10% (in H2O) to 80% (above H2O).

         <title>Turbostratic Boron&#8211;Carbon&#8211;Nitrogen and Boron Nitride by Flash Joule Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Turbostratic boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen and boron nitride compounds with various chemical compositions can be prepared by the ultrafast and solvent&#8208;free flash Joule heating method. The obtained flash boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen (f&#8208;BCN) is easily exfoliated via various mechanical methods. Compared to commercial hexagonal boron nitride nanoplates, flash boron nitride sheets demonstrate more stable dispersibility in aqueous solution. Furthermore, the addition of f&#8208;BCN as barrier fillers in poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposites shows higher corrosion protection efficiency, &#8776;97.3% in 0.5 m H2SO4 and &#8776;92.1% in 3.5 wt% NaCl (aq).








Abstract
Turbostratic layers in 2D materials have an interlayer misalignment. The lack of alignment expands the intrinsic interlayer distances and weakens the optical and electronic interactions between adjacent layers. This introduces properties distinct from those structures with well&#8208;aligned lattices and strong coupling interactions. However, direct and rapid synthesis of turbostratic materials remains a challenge owing to their thermodynamically metastable properties. Here, a flash Joule heating (FJH) method to achieve bulk synthesis of boron&#8211;carbon&#8211;nitrogen ternary compounds with turbostratic structures by a kinetically controlled ultrafast cooling process that takes place within milliseconds (103&#160;to&#160;104 K s&#8722;1) is reported. Theoretical calculations support the existence of turbostratic structures and provide estimates of the energy barriers with respect to conversion into the corresponding well&#8208;aligned counterparts. When using non&#8208;carbon conductive additives, a direct synthesis of boron nitride is possible. The turbostratic nature facilitates mechanical exfoliation and more stable dispersions. Accordingly, the addition of flash products to a poly(vinyl alcohol) nanocomposite film coating a copper surface greatly improves the copper's resistance to corrosion in 0.5 m sulfuric acid or 3.5 wt% saline solution. FJH allows the use of bulk materials as reactants and provides a rapid approach to large quantities of the hitherto hard&#8208;to&#8208;access turbostratic materials.

         <title>Fast Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetection Using III&#8211;V Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphoteric liganding strategy is developed to simultaneously address In and As dangling bonds on InAs colloidal quantum dot (CQD) surfaces, which provides passivation and charge transport for low&#8208;permittivity CQD solids. The resulting photodiodes achieve a response time faster than 2 ns&#8212;the fastest photodiode among previously&#160;reported CQD photodiodes&#8212;combined with an external quantum efficiency of 30% at 940 nm.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for infrared (IR) light detection due to their tunable bandgap and their solution processing; however, to date, the time response of CQD IR photodiodes is inferior to that provided by Si and InGaAs. It is reasoned that the high permittivity of II&#8211;VI CQDs leads to slow charge extraction due to screening and capacitance, whereas III&#8211;Vs&#8212;if their surface chemistry can be mastered&#8212;offer a low permittivity and thus increase potential for high&#8208;speed operation. In initial studies, it is found that the covalent character in indium arsenide (InAs) leads to imbalanced charge transport, the result of unpassivated surfaces, and uncontrolled heavy doping. Surface management using amphoteric ligand coordination is reported, and it is found that the approach addresses simultaneously the In and As surface dangling bonds. The new InAs CQD solids combine high mobility (0.04 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) with a 4&#215; reduction in permittivity compared to PbS CQDs. The resulting photodiodes achieve a response time faster than 2&#160;ns&#8212;the fastest photodiode among previously reported CQD photodiodes&#8212;combined with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30% at 940&#160;nm.

         <title>Versatile Sequential Casting Processing for Highly Efficient and Stable Binary Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sequential casting (SC) processing is practical and universal for device performance improvement in both fullerene&#8208; and nonfullerene&#8208;based systems of organic solar cells (OSCs). A swelling&#8211;intercalation phase&#8208;separation model is proposed to interpret the morphology evolution during SC processing. Notably, a champion efficiency of 18.86% (certified as 18.44%) is reached from SC processing, representing the highest value among binary OSCs.








Abstract
Forming an ideal bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology is a critical issue governing the photon to electron process in organic solar cells (OSCs). Complementary to the widely&#8208;used blend casting (BC) method for BHJ construction, sequential casting (SC) can also enable similar or even better morphology and device performance for OSCs. Here, BC and SC methods on three representative donor:acceptor (D:A) blends are utilized, that is, PM6:PC71BM, PM6:IT&#8208;4F and PM6:L8&#8208;BO. Higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in all cases by taking advantage of beneficial morphology from SC processing are achieved, and a champion PCE of 18.86% (certified as 18.44%) based on the PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend is reached, representing the record value among binary OSCs. The observations on phase separation and vertical distribution inspire the proposal of the swelling&#8211;intercalation phase&#8208;separation model to interpret the morphology evolution during SC processing. Further, the vertical phase segregation is found to deliver an improvement of device performance via affecting the charge transport and collection processes, as evidenced by the D:A&#8208;ratio&#8208;dependent photovoltaic properties. Besides, OSCs based on SC processing show advantages on device photostability and upscale fabrication. This work demonstrates the versatility and efficacy of the SC method for BHJ&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>Brain Co&#8208;Delivery of Temozolomide and Cisplatin for Combinatorial Glioblastoma Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glioblastoma (GBM) cell membrane camouflaged biomimetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with pH&#8208;sensitive polymer as core are developed for effective temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin (CDDP) brain&#8208;targeting co&#8208;delivery, achieving effective antitumor efficacy in both U87MG&#8208; and TMZ&#8208;resistant U251R orthotopic mice models with negligible side effects.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an intractable malignancy with high recurrence and mortality. Combinatorial therapy based on temozolomide (TMZ) and cisplatin (CDDP) shows promising potential for GBM therapy in clinical trials. However, significant challenges include limited blood&#8211;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) penetration, poor targeting of GBM tissue/cells, and systemic side effects, which hinder its efficacy in GBM therapy. To surmount these challenges,&#160;new GBM&#8208;cell membrane camouflaged and pH&#8208;sensitive biomimetic nanoparticles (MNPs) inspired by the fact that cancer cells readily pass the BBB and localize with homologous cells, are developed. This study's results show that MNPs can efficiently co&#8208;load TMZ and CDDP, transport these across the BBB to specifically target GBM. Incorporation of pH&#8208;sensitive polymer then allows for controlled release of drug cargos at GBM sites for combination drug therapy. Mice bearing orthotopic U87MG or drug&#8208;resistant U251R GBM tumor and treated with MNPs@TMZ+CDDP show a potent anti&#8208;GBM effect, greatly extending the survival time relative to mice receiving single&#8208;drug loaded nanoparticles. No obvious side effects are apparent in histological analyses or blood routine studies. Considering these results, the study's new nanoparticle formulation overcomes multiple challenges currently limiting the efficacy of combined TMZ and CDDP GBM drug therapy and appears to be a promising strategy for future GBM combinatorial chemotherapy.

         <title>A Superconducting&#8208;Material&#8208;Based Maglev Generator Used for Outer&#8208;Space</title>

Superconducting materials&#8212;which work best in cold environments, such as those found in outer space&#8212;are shown to provide a mechanism to harvest energy that does not require light. A superconducting magnetic levitation (maglev) magnetoelectric generator can convert mechanical impact to electricity.








Abstract
Solar cells are conventionally used to harvest energy in outer space, but they are ineffective in dark locations. Here, it is shown that superconducting materials&#8212;which work best in cold environments, such as those found in outer space&#8212;provide a mechanism to harvest energy that does not require light. A superconducting magnetic levitation (maglev) magnetoelectric generator (SMMG) can convert mechanical impacts to electricity at its working temperature &lt;90 K. The SMMG device consists of a permanent magnet, a conductive coil, and a superconducting layer (SL). Owing to the existence of the SL, the permanent magnet levitates over the SL and rapidly returns to an equilibrium height after being displaced by a mechanical impact. The impact changes the gap between the levitated magnet and the coil, resulting in a variation in magnetic flux that induces electrical current in the coil. Thus, the SMMG converts low&#8208;frequency (&lt;3.7&#160;Hz) mechanical energy to electricity. The output maximum peak voltage, peak power, and peak power density of the SMMG are 4.3&#160;V, 35&#160;mW, and 17.8&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively, with a load resistance of 300 &#937;. The SMMG can charge a capacitor of 10&#160;000 &#181;F to 3.8&#160;V with a continuous impact, which is sufficient to power critical wireless communication. The superconductor works best in cold environments and therefore is well&#8208;suited for providing electricity to sensors and communication devices in outer space, particularly in places where the sun may not reach.

         <title>A Top&#8208;Down Strategy to Engineer ActiveLayer Morphology for Highly Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile top&#8208;down strategy to control the all&#8208;polymer solar cell (all&#8208;PSC) morphology is developed by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processing. Optimal intermixing of polymer components and improved molecular packing of bottom layer and top layer can be achieved by choosing a suitable top&#8208;layer processing solvent. Consequently, a favorable morphology with gradient vertical composition distribution is realized, affording a high all&#8208;PSC efficiency of 17.0%.








Abstract
A major challenge hindering the further development of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) employing polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors is the relatively low fill factor (FF) due to the difficulty in controlling the active&#8208;layer morphology. The issues typically arise from oversized phase separation resulting from the thermodynamically unfavorable mixing between two macromolecular species, and disordered molecular orientation/packing of highly anisotropic polymer chains. Herein, a facile top&#8208;down controlling strategy to engineer the morphology of all&#8208;polymer blends is developed by leveraging the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LBL) deposition. Optimal intermixing of polymer components can be achieved in the two&#8208;step process by tuning the bottom&#8208;layer polymer swelling during top&#8208;layer deposition. Consequently, both the molecular orientation/packing of the bottom layer and the molecular ordering&#160;of the top layer can be optimized with a suitable top&#8208;layer&#160;processing solvent. A favorable morphology with gradient vertical composition distribution for efficient charge transport and extraction is therefore realized, affording a high all&#8208;PSC efficiency of 17.0% with a FF of 76.1%. The derived devices also possess excellent long&#8208;term thermal stability and can retain &gt;90% of their initial efficiencies after being annealed at 65&#160;&#176;C for 1300 h. These results validate the distinct advantages of employing an LBL processing protocol to fabricate high&#8208;performance all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Synergistic Crystallization and Passivation by a Single Molecular Additive for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By simultaneous control of the intermediate phase during crystallization of the perovskite film and surface passivation using a single&#160;molecule additive N,N&#8208;dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydroiodide (DIAI), which has multiple functional groups, an impressive device photoelectric conversion efficiency as high as 24.13% with negligible hysteresis is obtained. The bare device without any encapsulation maintains 94.1% of its initial efficiency after ambient exposure for over 1000 h.








Abstract
With its power conversion efficiency surpassing those of all other thin&#8208;film solar cells only a few years after its invention, the perovskite solar cell has become a superstar. Controlling the intermediate phase of crystallization is a key to obtaining high&#8208;quality perovskite films. Herein, a single molecule additive, N,N&#8208;dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydroiodide (DIAI), is incorporated into the perovskite precursor to eliminate the influence of intermediate phases. By taking advantage of the interaction of DIAI and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the intermediate phase FAI&#8208;PbI2&#8208;DMSO complex is eliminated, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 is entirely converted to the desired &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 during the crystallization step, resulting in enlarged grain size and improved crystalline quality. This is the first observation in the solution method that FAPbI3 can be obtained without an intermediate phase for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, DIAI is effective at passivating surface defects, resulting in reduced defect density, increased carrier lifetime, and improved device efficiency and stability. The champion device achieves an efficiency of 24.13%. Furthermore, the bare device without any encapsulation maintains 94.1% of its initial efficiency after ambient exposure over 1000h. This work contributes a strategy of synergistic crystallization and passivation to directly form &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 from the precursor solution without the influence of intermediate impurities for high&#8208;performance perovskite applications.

         <title>Walking Dead Tumor Cells for Targeted Drug Delivery Against Lung Metastasis of Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cell&#8208;based drug delivery system is developed by anchoring anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies and doxorubicin&#8208;loaded liposomes on tumor cell corpses to treat lung metastatic TNBC. The cell platform, named &#8220;walking dead tumor cells&#8221;, promotes lung&#8208;metastasis&#8208;targeted drug delivery and enables temporal release of drugs via bioinspired&#8208;activation and nano&#8208;backpack. Improved therapeutic efficacy against lung metastasis is achieved by the platform in mouse models.








Abstract
Lung metastasis is challenging in patients with triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). Surgery is always not available due to the dissemination of metastatic foci and most drugs are powerless because of poor retention at metastatic sites. TNBC cells generate an inflamed microenvironment and overexpress adhesive molecules to promote invasion and colonization. Herein, &#8220;walking dead&#8221; TNBC cells are developed through conjugating anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 (programmed death protein 1 inhibitor) and doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded liposomes onto cell corpses for temporal chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against lung metastasis. The walking dead TNBC cells maintain plenary tumor antigens to conduct vaccination effects. Anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibodies are conjugated to cell corpses via reduction&#8208;activated linker, and DOX&#8208;loaded liposomes are attached by maleimide&#8211;thiol coupling. This anchor strategy enables rapid release of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 upon reduction conditions while long&#8208;lasting release of DOX at inflamed metastatic sites. The walking dead TNBC cells improve pulmonary accumulation and local retention of drugs, reprogram the lung microenvironment through damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and PD&#8208;1 blockade, and prolong overall survival of lung metastatic 4T1 and EMT6&#8208;bearing mice. Taking advantage of the walking dead TNBC cells for pulmonary preferred delivery of chemotherapeutics and checkpoint inhibitors, this study suggests an alternative treatment option of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy to augment the efficacy against lung metastasis.

         <title>Identifying the Correlation between Structural Parameters and Anisotropic Magnetic Properties in I&#63743;Mn&#63743;V Semiconductors: A Possible Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive study of the single&#8208;crystal growth of I&#63743;Mn&#63743;V (I: alkali metals and V: pnictogen elements) compound series, physical property measurements of their intrinsic anisotropic character, and their theoretical electronic and magnetic structures suggests a possible room&#8208;temperature magnetic semiconductor. These experimental and computational results broaden the scope of intrinsic magnetic semiconductors in quasi&#8208;2D layer&#8208;structured systems for spintronics.








Abstract
Layer&#8208;structured materials are of central importance in a wide range of research fields owing to their unique properties originating from their two dimensionality and anisotropy. Herein, quasi&#8208;2D layer&#8208;structured I&#63743;Mn&#63743;V (I: alkali metals and V: pnictogen elements) compounds are investigated, which are potential antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductors. Single crystals of I&#63743;Mn&#63743;V compounds are successfully grown using the self&#8208;flux method and their electronic and magnetic properties are analyzed in correlation with structural parameters. Combined with theoretical calculations, the structural analysis indicates that the variation in the bonding angle between V&#63743;Mn&#63743;V is responsible for the change in the orbital hybridization of Mn and V, predominantly affecting their anisotropic semiconducting properties. Anisotropy in the magnetic properties is also found, where AFM ordering is expected to occur in the in&#8208;plane direction, as supported by spin&#8211;structure calculations. Furthermore, a possible ferromagnetic (FM) transition is discussed in relation to the vacancy defects. This study provides a candidate material group for AFM and FM spintronics and a basis for exploring magnetic semiconductors in quasi&#8208;2D layer&#8208;structured systems.

         <title>Ultrafast Sintering for Ceramic&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microwave&#8208;assisted ultrafast sintering technique is used to densify various ceramic electrolytes and co&#8208;sinter electrode&#8211;electrolyte integration, which has advantages of ultrashort sintering time (&#8776;25 s), energy&#8208;saving, suppressed Li/Na element loss, compact electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, restrained element cross&#8208;diffusion, and so on. This method may extend to other ceramic multilayer&#8208;based solid devices.








Abstract
Long processing time and high temperatures are often required in sintering ceramic electrolytes, which lead to volatile element loss and high cost. Here, an ultrafast sintering method of microwave&#8208;induced carbothermal shock to fabricate various ceramic electrolytes in seconds is reported. Furthermore, it is also possible to integrate the electrode and electrolyte in one step by simultaneous co&#8208;sintering. Based on this ultrafast co&#8208;sintering technique, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery with a high areal capacity is successfully achieved, realizing a promising electrochemical performance at room temperature. This method can extend to other various ceramic multilayer&#8208;based solid devices.

         <title>Formulating High&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Cycle Heterostructured Layered Oxide Cathodes by Local Chemistry and Orbital Hybridization Modulation for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An abnormal heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries&#160;(SIBs) is successfully constructed, and its dynamic formation process, intrinsic structural properties, and electrochemical behavior are elucidated by a series of in situ characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations. The concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating heterostructured cathode materials by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation is further demonstrated.








Abstract
It is still very urgent and challenging to simultaneously develop high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycle oxide cathodes for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) because of the sluggish kinetics and complex multiphase evolution during cycling. Here, the concept of accurately manipulating structural evolution and formulating high&#8208;performance heterostructured biphasic layered oxide cathodes by local chemistry and orbital hybridization modulation is reported. The P2&#8208;structure stoichiometric composition of the cathode material shows a layered P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type heterostructure that is explicitly evidenced by various macroscale and atomic&#8208;scale techniques. Surprisingly, the heterostructured cathode displays excellent rate performance, remarkable cycling stability (capacity retention of 82.16% after 600 cycles at 2&#160;C), and outstanding compatibility with hard carbon anode because of the integrated advantages of intergrowth structure and local environment regulation. Meanwhile, the formation process from precursors during calcination and the highly reversible dynamic structural evolution during the Na+ intercalation/deintercalation process are clearly articulated by a series of in situ characterization techniques. Also, the intrinsic structural properties and corresponding electrochemical behavior are further elucidated by the density of states and electron localization function of density functional theory calculations. Overall, this strategy, which finely tunes the local chemistry and orbitals hybridization for high&#8208;performance SIBs, will open up a new field for other materials.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Mixing Enhanced Proximity Effect in Aluminum&#8208;Based Superconductor&#8211;Semiconductor Hybrids</title>

In superconducting quantum circuits, aluminum is one of the most widely used materials. Aluminum&#8208;based devices suffer from poor magnetic field compatibility. In this article, this limitation is resolved by showing that adatoms of heavy elements (e.g., platinum) increase the critical field of thin aluminum films by more than a factor of two.








Abstract
In superconducting quantum circuits, aluminum is one of the most widely used materials. It is currently also the superconductor of choice for the development of topological qubits. However, aluminum&#8208;based devices suffer from poor magnetic field compatibility. Herein, this limitation is resolved by showing that adatoms of heavy elements (e.g., platinum) increase the critical field of thin aluminum films by more than a factor of two. Using tunnel junctions, it is shown that the increased field resilience originates from spin&#8208;orbit scattering introduced by Pt. This property is exploited in the context of the superconducting proximity effect in semiconductor&#8211;superconductor hybrids, where it is shown that InSb nanowires strongly coupled to Al/Pt films can maintain superconductivity up to 7&#160;T. The two&#8208;electron charging effect is shown to be robust against the presence of heavy adatoms. Additionally, non&#8208;local spectroscopy is used in a three&#8208;terminal geometry to probe the bulk of hybrid devices, showing that it remains free of sub&#8208;gap states. Finally, it is demonstrated that proximitized semiconductor states maintain their ability to Zeeman&#8208;split in an applied magnetic field. Combined with the chemical stability and well&#8208;known fabrication routes of aluminum, Al/Pt emerges as the natural successor to Al&#8208;based systems and is a compelling alternative to other superconductors, whenever high&#8208;field resilience is required.

         <title>Electrical Sensing of the Thermal and Light&#8208;Induced Spin Transition in Robust Contactless Spin&#8208;Crossover/Graphene Hybrid Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid devices formed by sublimable spin&#8208;crossover molecules deposited over graphene are fabricated. The novel device preparation protocol used results in fast and efficient photoinduced spin transitions, and is even enhanced in devices with a contactless configuration. This methodology allows further integration of spin&#8208;crossover molecules in thermal&#160;or light&#8208;addressable spintronic and straintronic devices based on 2D materials.








Abstract
Hybrid devices based on spin&#8208;crossover (SCO)/2D heterostructures grant a highly sensitive platform to detect the spin transition in the molecular SCO component and tune the properties of the 2D material. However, the fragility of the SCO materials upon thermal treatment, light irradiation, or contact with surfaces and the methodologies used for their processing have limited their applicability. Here, an easily processable and robust SCO/2D hybrid device with outstanding performance based on the sublimable SCO [Fe(Pyrz)2] molecule deposited over chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene is reported, which is fully compatible with electronics industry protocols. Thus, a novel methodology based on growing an elusive polymorph of [Fe(Pyrz)2] (tetragonal phase) over graphene is developed that allows a fast and effective light&#8208;induced spin transition in the devices (&#8776;50% yield in 5&#160;min) to be detected electrically. Such performance can be enhanced even more when a flexible polymeric layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) is inserted in between the two active components in a contactless configuration, reaching a &#8776;100% yield in 5&#160;min.

         <title>Studying Plasmon Dispersion of MXene for Enhanced Electromagnetic Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plasmon in MXene plays a role in the electromagnetic absorption, but such an effect has not yet been quantitatively analyzed due to the lack of knowledge of the MXene's plasmon dispersion, which is challengeable to measure for optical methods. The plasmon dispersions for individual MXene nanoflakes with varied thicknesses are measured using high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy.








Abstract
2D metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) are promising candidates for electromagnetic (EM) shielding, saturable absorption, thermal therapy, and photocatalysis owing to their excellent EM absorption. The plasmon resonances in metallic MXene micro/nanostructures may play an important role in enhancing the EM absorption; however, their contribution has not been determined due to the lack of a precise understanding of its plasmon behavior. Here, the use of high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy to measure the plasmon dispersion of MXene films with different thicknesses is reported, enabling accurate analysis of the EM absorption of complex MXene structures in a wide frequency range via a theoretical model. The EM absorption of MXene can be excited at the desired frequency by controlling the momentum (e.g., the sizes of the nanoflakes for EM excitation) as the strength can be enhanced by increasing the layer number and the interlayer distance in MXene. For example, a 3&#160;nm interlayer distance can nearly double the plasmon&#8208;enhanced EM absorption in MXene nanostructures. These findings can guide the design of advanced ultrathin EM absorption materials for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Tuning Organic Electrochemical Transistor Threshold Voltage using Chemically Doped Polymer Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modifying the work function of gate electrodes in organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) via chemical doping makes threshold voltage an independently tunable parameter from channel properties, thereby retaining the electrochemical, transport, and amplifying properties of the OECT. This enables simultaneously low&#8208;power and electrochemically stable enhancement mode OECTs.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have shown promise as transducers and amplifiers of minute electronic potentials due to their large transconductances. Tuning the OECT threshold voltage is important to achieve low&#8208;powered devices with amplification properties within the desired operational voltage range. However, traditional design approaches have struggled to decouple channel and materials properties from threshold voltage, thereby compromising on several other OECT performance metrics, such as electrochemical stability, transconductance, and dynamic range. In this work, simple solution&#8208;processing methods are utilized to chemically dope polymer gate electrodes, thereby controlling their work function, which in turn tunes the operation voltage range of the OECTs without perturbing their channel properties. Chemical doping of initially air&#8208;sensitive polymer electrodes further improves their electrochemical stability in ambient conditions. Thus, OECTs that are simultaneously low&#8208;powered and electrochemically resistant to oxidative side reactions under ambient conditions are demonstrated. This approach shows that threshold voltage, which is once interwoven with other OECT properties, can in fact be an independent design parameter, expanding the design space of OECTs.

&lt;p&gt;Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have shown promise as transducers and amplifiers of minute electronic potentials due to their large transconductances. Tuning the OECT threshold voltage is important to achieve low-powered devices with amplification properties within the desired operational voltage range. However, traditional design approaches have struggled to decouple channel and materials properties from threshold voltage, thereby compromising on several other OECT performance metrics, such as electrochemical stability, transconductance, and dynamic range. In this work, simple solution-processing methods are utilized to chemically dope polymer gate electrodes, thereby controlling their work function, which in turn tunes the operation voltage range of the OECTs without perturbing their channel properties. Chemical doping of initially air-sensitive polymer electrodes further improves their electrochemical stability in ambient conditions. Thus, OECTs that are simultaneously low-powered and electrochemically resistant to oxidative side reactions under ambient conditions are demonstrated. This approach shows that threshold voltage, which is once interwoven with other OECT properties, can in fact be an independent design parameter, expanding the design space of OECTs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Construction of Nucleophilic Carbonyl&#8208;Containing Interphase toward Ultrastable Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilic carbonyl&#8208;containing interphase with strong zincphilicity and dendrite suppression ability is rationally designed as a spontaneous construction of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on a Zn anode, facilitating homogeneous Zn deposition and leading to the long&#8208;term stability of aqueous ZIBs. The cross&#8208;linking H&#8208;bond network formed by the electronegative carbonyl oxygen can bind water molecules while regulating the Zn&#8208;ion desolvation process and mitigating side reactions.








Abstract
Multifunctional interfacial engineering on the Zn anode to conquer dendrite growth, hydrogen evolution, and the sluggish kinetics associated with Zn deposition is highly desirable for boosting the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a spontaneous construction of carbonyl&#8208;containing layer on a Zn anode (Zn@ZCO) is rationally designed as an ion redistributor and functional protective interphase. It has strong zincphilicity and dendrite suppression ability due to the significant interaction of the highly electronegative and highly nucleophilic carbonyl oxygen, favoring ion transport and homogenizing Zn deposition effectively. On the other side, the hydrogen bond formed by the proton acceptor of oxygen atom in ZCO regulates the Zn&#8208;ion desolvation process at the interfaces, thus bounding water activity and then mitigating water&#8208;induced parasitic reactions. Consequently, the Zn@ZCO anode exhibits an extended cycling lifespan of 5000&#160;h (&gt;208&#160;days) with a dendrite&#8208;free surface and negligible by&#8208;products. More encouragingly, the effectiveness is also convincing in NH4V4O10&#8208;based full&#8208;cells with excellent rate performance and cyclic stability. The stabilized Zn anode enabled by the strategy of spontaneous construction of functional solid electrolyte interphase brings forward a facile and instructive approach toward high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Driven Design of a Cationic Accelerator for High&#8208;Performance Electrolytic MnO2&#8211;Zn Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A cationic accelerator effectively facilitates rapid cations migration in an electrolyte and adequate charge transfer at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, benefiting the deposition/dissolution processes of both Mn2+ and Zn2+ cations to simultaneously improve the kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions, thereby enabling high&#8208;performance MnO2&#8211;Zn batteries with high energy efficiency and long&#8208;term cycle stability.








Abstract
Aqueous electrolytic MnO2&#8211;Zn batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy&#8208;storage devices for their cost effectiveness, high output voltage, and safety, but their electrochemical performance is limited by the sluggish kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions. To overcome this critical challenge, herein, a cationic accelerator (CA) strategy is proposed based on the prediction of first&#8208;principles calculations. Poly(vinylpyrrolidone) is utilized as a model to testify the rational design of the CA strategy. It manifests that the CA effectively facilitates rapid cations migration in electrolyte and adequate charge transfer at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, benefiting the deposition/dissolution processes of both Mn2+ and Zn2+ cations to simultaneously improve kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions. The resulting MnO2&#8211;Zn battery regulated by CA exhibits large reversible capacities of 455 mAh g&#8211;1 and 3.64 mAh cm&#8211;2 at 20 C, as well as a long lifespan of 2000 cycles with energy density retention of 90%, achieving one of the best overall performances in the electrolytic MnO2&#8211;Zn batteries. This comprehensive work integrating theoretical prediction with experimental studies provides opportunities to the development of high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Switchable Unipolar&#8208;Barrier Van der Waals Heterostructures with Natural Anisotropy for Full Linear Polarimetry Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A twisted unipolar barrier van der Waals heterostructure with bias&#8208;switchable natural polarization photoresponse is successfully designed, which enables full linear polarimetry detection from 0 to 180&#176;. Moreover, polarimetric imaging is further demonstrated with this developed photodetector in the mid&#8208;infrared range.








Abstract
Polarization&#8208;resolved photodetection in a compact footprint is of great interest for ultraminiaturized polarimeters to be used in a wide range of applications. However, probing the states of polarization (SOP) in materials with natural anisotropy are usually weak, limited by the material's natural dichroism or diattenuation. Here, a twisted unipolar&#8208;barrier van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) to construct a bias&#8208;switchable polarization detection for retrieval of full SOP (from 0 to 180&#176;) for linear polarized incident light is reported. As a demonstration example, this study realizes the concept in a b&#8208;AsP/WS2/b&#8208;AsP vdWH relying on the natural anisotropic properties of the materials without using additional plasmonic/metasurface nanostructures to realize linear polarimetry in the mid&#8208;infrared range. Polarimetric imaging is further demonstrated with the developed linear polarimetry by directly displaying the Jones&#8208;vector&#8208;described SOP distribution of certain target object. This method, with the capabilities of detecting full linear SOP, is promising for the next&#8208;generation on&#8208;chip miniaturized polarimeters.

         <title>Conjugated Polymers for Microwave Applications: Untethered Sensing Platforms and Multifunctional Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
The active reconfigurability of different microwave resonating structures is achieved through an emerging family of high&#8208;performance organic mixed&#8208;conductors, characterized by superior charge&#8208;transport properties and redox&#8208;tunability. This novel class of microwave devices displays optimal modulation performances, as well as the potential for unique functionalities in the contexts of autonomous bioelectronics and of reconfigurable microwave optics.








Abstract
In the past two decades, organic electronic materials have enabled and accelerated a large and diverse set of technologies, from energy&#8208;harvesting devices and electromechanical actuators, to flexible and printed (opto)electronic circuitry. Among organic (semi)conductors, organic mixed ion&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) are now at the center of renewed interest in organic electronics, as they are key drivers of recent developments in the fields of bioelectronics, energy storage, and neuromorphic computing. However, due to the relatively slow switching dynamics of organic electronics, their application in microwave technology, until recently, has been overlooked. Nonetheless, other unique properties of OMIECs, such as their substantial electrochemical tunability, charge&#8208;modulation range, and processability, make this field of use ripe with opportunities. In this work, the use of a series of solution&#8208;processed intrinsic OMIECs is demonstrated to actively tune the properties of metamaterial&#8208;inspired microwave devices, including an untethered bioelectrochemical sensing platform that requires no external power, and a tunable resonating structure with independent amplitude&#8208; and frequency&#8208;modulation. These devices showcase the considerable potential of OMIEC&#8208;based metadevices in autonomous bioelectronics and reconfigurable microwave optics.

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells Breaking 19% via Manipulating the Vertical Component Distribution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance binary photovoltaic devices based on D18 and L8&#8208;BO are constructed via manipulating the vertical component distribution in a sequential deposition (SD) process. After tuning the spin&#8208;coating speeds of film deposition, the optimal SD device affords a record power conversion efficiency of 19.05% (certified, 18.9%) for binary single&#8208;junction organic solar cells, much higher than that of the corresponding blend casting device (18.14%).








Abstract
The variation of the vertical component distribution can significantly influence the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), mainly due to its impact on exciton dissociation and charge&#8208;carrier transport and recombination. Herein, binary devices are fabricated via sequential deposition (SD) of D18 and L8&#8208;BO materials in a two&#8208;step process. Upon independently regulating the spin&#8208;coating speeds of each layer deposition, the optimal SD device shows a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05% for binary single&#8208;junction OSCs, much higher than that of the corresponding blend casting (BC) device (18.14%). Impressively, this strategy presents excellent universality in boosting the photovoltaic performance of SD devices, exemplified by several nonfullerene acceptor systems. The mechanism studies reveal that the SD device with preferred vertical components distribution possesses high crystallinity, efficient exciton splitting, low energy loss, and balanced charge transport, resulting in all&#8208;around enhancement of photovoltaic performances. This work provides a valuable approach for high&#8208;efficiency OSCs, shedding light on understanding the relationship between photovoltaic performance and vertical component distribution.

Plasmon Dispersion of MXenes
Plasmons in MXenes play a role in electromagnetic absorption, but the effect has never been quantitatively analyzed due to the lack of plasmon dispersion. In article number 2201120, Xiaoxia Yang, Peng Gao, Qing Dai, and co&#8208;workers report the use of high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution electron&#8208;energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy to measure the plasmon dispersion of suspended MXenes. These ultrathin MXenes with broadband absorption provide a promising platform for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

Organic Solar Cells
Forming an ideal bulk heterojunction morphology is a critical issue governing the photon to electron process in organic solar cells (OSCs). In article number 2203379, Lijian Zuo, Hongzheng Chen, and co&#8208;workers show how sequential&#8208;casting (SC) processing is practical and universal for improvement of device performance in both fullerene&#8208; and nonfullerene&#8208;based systems, in which the donor and acceptor are deposited sequentially. The fabricated OSCs show advantages regarding device performance, photostability and upscale fabrication. Such a film spin&#8208;coating method is analogous to the traditional Chinese pancake making process.

The evolution of TENG&#8208;based active sensors is outlined with primary focus on chemical and biosensors. Comprehensive discussion on the device mechanism, applications, sensing parameters is provided and the challenges in the field detailed.








Abstract
The demand for portable and wearable chemical or biosensors and their expeditious development in recent years has created a scientific challenge in terms of their continuous powering. As a result, mechanical energy harvesters such as piezoelectric and triboelectric generators (TEGs) have been explored recently either as sensors or harvesters to store charge in small, but long&#8208;life, energy&#8208;storage devices to power the sensors. The use of energy harvesters as sensors is particularly interesting, as with such multifunctional operations it is possible to reduce the number devices needed in a system, which also helps overcome the integration complexities. In this regard, TEGs are promising, particularly for energy autonomous chemical and biological sensors, as they can be developed with a wide variety of materials, and their mechanical energy to electricity conversion can be modulated by various analytes. This review focuses on this interesting dimension of TEGs and presents various self&#8208;powered active chemical and biological sensors. A brief discussion about the development of TEG&#8208;based physical, magnetic, and optical sensors is also included. The influence of environmental factors, various figures of merit, and the significance of TEG design are explained in context with the active sensing. Finally, the key applications, challenges, and future perspective of chemical and biological detection via TEGs are discussed with a view to drive further advances in the field of self&#8208;powered sensors.

         <title>Pushing the Natural Frontier: Progress on the Integration of Biomaterial Cues toward Combinatorial Biofabrication and Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress on the use of naturally derived materials is reviewed, as well as the integration of cell&#8208;driving cues ranging from biochemical ligands to mechanical properties and the underestimated role of cell&#8211;cell interactions, highlighting unreported synergies and antagonistic combinations, highlighting recent high&#8208;throughput discovery tools toward combinatorial biofabrication and tissue engineering.








Abstract
The engineering of fully functional, biological&#8208;like tissues requires biomaterials to direct cellular events to a near&#8208;native, 3D niche extent. Natural biomaterials are generally seen as a safe option for cell support, but their biocompatibility and biodegradability can be just as limited as their bioactive/biomimetic performance. Furthermore, integrating different biomaterial cues and their final impact on cellular behavior is a complex equation where the outcome might be very different from the sum of individual parts. This review critically analyses recent progress on biomaterial&#8208;induced cellular responses, from simple adhesion to more complex stem cell differentiation, looking at the ever&#8208;growing possibilities of natural materials modification. Starting with a discussion on native material formulation and the inclusion of cell&#8208;instructive cues, the roles of shape and mechanical stimuli, the susceptibility to cellular remodeling, and the often&#8208;overlooked impact of cellular density and cell&#8211;cell interactions within constructs, are delved into. Along the way, synergistic and antagonistic combinations reported in vitro and in vivo are singled out, identifying needs and current lessons on the development of natural biomaterial libraries to solve the cell&#8211;material puzzle efficiently. This review brings together knowledge from different fields envisioning next&#8208;generation, combinatorial biomaterial development toward complex tissue engineering.

         <title>Changing Fate: Reprogramming Cells via Engineered Nanoscale Delivery Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 33, August 18, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanomaterials enabling cell reprogramming provide a new paradigm for the restoration of healthy tissue and organs. Future clinical interventions will no longer require invasive surgery, or pharmaceutical regimens; it can be achieved through the controlled reprograming of regenerative cells. The authors review the multiscale delivery vehicles that can support and precisely deliver the raw genetic material and transformative vectors required.








Abstract
The incorporation of nanotechnology in regenerative medicine is at the nexus of fundamental innovations and early&#8208;stage breakthroughs, enabling exciting biomedical advances. One of the most exciting recent developments is the use of nanoscale constructs to influence the fate of cells, which are the basic building blocks of healthy function. Appropriate cell types can be effectively manipulated by direct cell reprogramming; a robust technique to manipulate cellular function and fate, underpinning burgeoning advances in drug delivery systems, regenerative medicine, and disease remodeling. Individual transcription factors, or combinations thereof, can be introduced into cells using both viral and nonviral delivery systems. Existing approaches have inherent limitations. Viral&#8208;based tools include issues of viral integration into the genome of the cells, the propensity for uncontrollable silencing, reduced copy potential and cell specificity, and neutralization via the immune response. Current nonviral cell reprogramming tools generally suffer from inferior expression efficiency. Nanomaterials are increasingly being explored to address these challenges and improve the efficacy of both viral and nonviral delivery because of their unique properties such as small size and high surface area. This review presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research in cell reprogramming, focused on recent breakthroughs in the deployment of nanomaterials as cell reprogramming delivery tools.

         <title>Large Room Temperature Anomalous Transverse Thermoelectric Effect in Kagome Antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Kagome magnets possess several novel non&#8208;trivial topological features owing to the strong correlation between topology and magnetism, that extends to their applications in the field of thermoelectricity. Conventional thermoelectric (TE) devices use the Seebeck effect to convert heat into electrical energy. In contrast, transverse thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect are attracting recent attention due to their unique transverse geometry, which uses a single material to eliminate the need for a multitude of electrical connections compared to conventional TE devices. In this study, we obtain a large anomalous transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8764; 2 &#956;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in a kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 single crystal. The obtained value is larger than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials and comparable with ferromagnetic systems. The large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) can be attributed to the net Berry curvature near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the ANE of the AFM YMn6Sn6 exceeds the magnetization scaling relationship of conventional ferromagnets. Our results clearly illustrate that AFM material YMn6Sn6 is an ideal topological material for room&#8208;temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.

         <title>Fingerprints Indicating Superior Properties of Internal Interfaces in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;poor and Cu&#8208;rich Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorbers are investigated using correlative microscopy based on the atom probe tomography technique. With that, typical fingerprints for superior properties of internal interfaces necessary for maintaining a lower recombination activity in the cell are discovered. These are Cu&#8208;depleted and Cd&#8208;enriched Cu(In,Ga)Se2 absorber surfaces, as well as negative Cu factor (&#8710;&#946;) and high Na content at the grain boundaries.








Abstract
Growth of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) absorbers under Cu&#8208;poor conditions gives rise to incorporation of numerous defects into the bulk, whereas the same absorber grown under Cu&#8208;rich conditions leads to a stoichiometric bulk with minimum defects. This suggests that CIGS absorbers grown under Cu&#8208;rich conditions are more suitable for solar cell applications. However, the CIGS solar cell devices with record efficiencies have all been fabricated under Cu&#8208;poor conditions, despite the expectations. Therefore, in the present work, both Cu&#8208;poor and Cu&#8208;rich CIGS cells are investigated, and the superior properties of the internal interfaces of the Cu&#8208;poor CIGS cells, such as the p&#8211;n junction and grain boundaries, which always makes them the record&#8208;efficiency devices, are shown. More precisely, by employing a correlative microscopy approach, the typical fingerprints for superior properties of internal interfaces necessary for maintaining a lower recombination activity in the cell is discovered. These are a Cu&#8208;depleted and Cd&#8208;enriched CIGS absorber surface, near the p&#8211;n junction, as well as&#160;a negative Cu factor (&#8710;&#946;) and high Na content (&gt;1.5 at%) at the grain boundaries. Thus, this work provides key factors governing the device performance (efficiency), which can be considered in the design of next&#8208;generation solar cells.

         <title>Ultrathin Suspended Chiral Metasurfaces for Enantiodiscrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;aligned suspended chiral bilayer metasurface is developed with single&#8208;step electron beam lithography. A huge optical chirality of 221&#176;&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 is achieved by the freestanding metasurfaces with overall thickness of 100&#160;nm. The bilayer metasurface demonstrates label&#8208;free discrimination of chiral molecules at zeptomoles level with orders of magnitude larger than conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy.








Abstract
Chiral metasurfaces can exhibit a strong circular dichroism, but it is limited by the complicated fabrication procedure and alignment errors. Here, a new type of self&#8208;aligned suspended chiral bilayer metasurface with only one&#8208;step electron beam lithography exposure is demonstrated. A significant optical chirality of 221&#176;&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 can be realized using suspended metasurfaces with a thickness of 100&#160;nm. Furthermore, this study experimentally demonstrates that such a structure is capable of label&#8208;free discrimination of the chiral molecules at zeptomole level, exhibiting a much higher sensitivity (orders of magnitude) compared to the conventional circular dichroism spectroscopy. The fundamental principles for chiral sensing using molecules&#8211;metasurfaces interactions are explored. Benefiting from the giant chiroptical response, the proposed metadevice may offer promising applications for ultrathin circular polarizers, chiral molecular detectors, and asymmetry information processing.

         <title>Noncovalent Polymerization&#8208;Activated Ultrastrong Near&#8208;Infrared Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Energy Transfer Assembly in Aqueous Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient noncovalent polymerization&#8208;activated phosphorescence&#8208;harvesting system is successfully constructed in aqueous solution based on the stepwise confinement of cucurbit[7]uril and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;grafted hyaluronic acid, which shows high phosphorescence energy transfer efficiency accompanied by a long&#8208;lived near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emitting performance, and is ultimately applied for NIR&#160;targeted imaging of cancer cells.








Abstract
Noncovalent macrocycle&#8208;confined supramolecular purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is a current research hotspot. Herein, a high&#8208;efficiency noncovalent polymerization&#8208;activated near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;emissive RTP&#8208;harvesting system in aqueous solution based on the stepwise confinement of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;grafted hyaluronic acid (HACD), is reported. Compared with the dodecyl&#8208;chain&#8208;bridged 6&#8208;bromoisoquinoline derivative (G), the dumbbell&#8208;shaped assembly G&#8834;CB[7] presents an appeared complexation&#8208;induced RTP signal at 540&#160;nm via the first confinement of CB[7]. Subsequently, benefitting from the stepwise confinement encapsulation of the &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin cavity, the subsequent noncovalent polymerization of the binary G&#8834;CB[7] assembly enabled by HACD can contribute to the further&#8208;enhanced RTP emission intensity approximately eight&#160;times in addition to an increased lifetime from 59.0&#160;&#181;s to 0.581&#160;ms. Moreover, upon doping a small amount of two types of organic dyes, Nile blue or tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)porphyrin as an acceptor into the supramolecular confinement assembly G&#8834;CB[7]&#8202;@&#8202;HACD, efficient RTP energy transfer occurs accompanied by a long&#8208;lived NIR&#8208;emitting performance (680 and 710&#160;nm) with a high donor/acceptor ratio. Intriguingly, the prepared RTP&#8208;harvesting system is successfully applied for targeted NIR imaging of living tumor cells by utilizing the targeting ability of hyaluronic acid, which provides a new strategy to create advanced water&#8208;soluble NIR phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Integrated Three&#8208;dimensional Hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity Design for Artificial Sweating Skin (i&#8208;TRANS) Mimicking Human Body Perspiration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Artificial skins reproducing properties of human skin are emerging and significant for study in various areas, such as robotics, medicine, textiles, etc. Perspiration, as one of the most imperative thermoregulation functions of human skin, is gaining increasing attention, but how to realize ideal artificial skin for perspiration simulation remains challenging. Here, we propose an integrated three&#8208;dimensional hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design for artificial sweating skin (i&#8208;TRANS). Based on normal fibrous wicking materials, the selective surface modification with gradient of Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) creates hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both lateral and vertical directions. With the additional help of bottom hydrophilic Nylon 6 nanofibers, the constructed i&#8208;TRANS is able to transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top surface, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation. This fairly comparable simulation not only presents new insights for replicating skin properties, but also provides proper in vitro testing platforms for perspiration&#8208;relevant research, greatly avoiding unwanted interference from the &#8220;skin&#8221; layer. In addition, the facile, fast and cost&#8208;effective fabrication approach and versatile usage of i&#8208;TRANS can further facilitate its application.

         <title>Tackling Disorder in &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) is attracting increasing attention in applications such as power electronics and photodetectors due to its rich structural space and resulting electronic structure. This work explores the influence of structural disorder on a range of crucial material parameters of &#947;&#8208;phase Ga2O3 by combining density functional theory and machine learning with a range of experimental probes.








Abstract
Ga2O3 and its polymorphs are attracting increasing attention. The rich structural space of polymorphic oxide systems such as Ga2O3 offers potential for electronic structure engineering, which is of particular interest for a range of applications, such as power electronics. &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3 presents a particular challenge across synthesis, characterization, and theory due to its inherent disorder and resulting complex structure&#8211;electronic&#8208;structure relationship. Here, density functional theory is used in combination with a machine&#8208;learning approach to screen nearly one million potential structures, thereby developing a robust atomistic model of the &#947;&#8208;phase. Theoretical results are compared with surface and bulk sensitive soft and hard X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy experiments representative of the occupied and unoccupied states of &#947;&#8208;Ga2O3. The first onset of strong absorption at room temperature is found at 5.1&#160;eV from spectroscopic ellipsometry, which agrees well with the excitation maximum at 5.17&#160;eV obtained by photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy, where the latter shifts to 5.33&#160;eV at 5&#160;K. This work presents a leap forward in the treatment of complex, disordered oxides and is a crucial step toward exploring how their electronic structure can be understood in terms of local coordination and overall structure.

         <title>Wireless Miniature Magnetic Phase&#8208;Change Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Wireless miniature soft actuators are promising for various potential high&#8208;impact applications in medical, robotic grippers, and artificial muscles. However, these miniature soft actuators are currently constrained by a small output force and low work capacity. To address such challenges, we report a miniature magnetic phase&#8208;change soft composite actuator. This soft actuator exhibits an expanding deformation and enables up to a 70 N output force and 175.2 J/g work capacity under remote magnetic radio frequency heating, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. To demonstrate its capabilities, we first design a wireless soft robotic device that can withstand 0.24 m/s fluid flows in an artery phantom. By integrating it with a thermally&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer and bistable metamaterial sleeve, we design a wireless reversible bistable stent towards for future potential angioplasty applications. Moreover, it can additionally locomote inside and jump out of granular media. At last, the phase&#8208;change actuator can realize programmable bending deformations when a specifically designed magnetization profile is encoded, enhancing its shape&#8208;programming capability. Such a miniature soft actuator provides an approach to enhance the mechanical output and versatility of magnetic soft robots and devices, extending their medical and other potential applications.

To demonstrate its capabilities, we first design a wireless soft robotic device that can withstand 0.24 m/s fluid flows in an artery phantom. By integrating it with a thermally-responsive shape-memory polymer and bistable metamaterial sleeve, we design a wireless reversible bistable stent towards for future potential angioplasty applications. Moreover, it can additionally locomote inside and jump out of granular media. At last, the phase-change actuator can realize programmable bending deformations when a specifically designed magnetization profile is encoded, enhancing its shape-programming capability. Such a miniature soft actuator provides an approach to enhance the mechanical output and versatility of magnetic soft robots and devices, extending their medical and other potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>&#8220;Red Carbon&#8221;: A Rediscovered Covalent Crystalline Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon suboxide (C3O2) is a unique molecule able to polymerize spontaneously into highly conjugated light&#8208;absorbing structures at temperatures as low as 0 &#176;C. Despite obvious advantages, little is known about the nature and the functional properties of this carbonaceous material. In this work, we aim to bring &#8220;red carbon&#8221;, a forgotten polymeric semiconductor, back to the community's attention. A solution polymerization process is adapted to simplify the synthesis and control the structure. This allows us to obtain this crystalline covalent material at low temperatures. Both spectroscopic and elemental analyses support the chemical structure represented as conjugated ladder polypyrone ribbons. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a crystalline structure of AB stacks of polypyrone ribbons and identify the material as a direct bandgap semiconductor with a medium bandgap that is further confirmed by optical analysis. The material shows promising photocatalytic performance using blue light. Moreover, the simple condensation&#8208;aromatization route described here allows the straightforward fabrication of conjugated ladder polymers and could be inspiring for the synthesis of carbonaceous materials at low temperatures in general.

         <title>Magnetic skyrmions with unconventional helicity polarization in a van der Waals ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Skyrmion helicity, which defines the spin swirling direction, is a fundamental parameter that may be utilized to encode data bits in future memory devices. Generally, in centrosymmetric ferromagnets, dipole skyrmions with helicity of &#8722;&#960;/2 and &#960;/2 are degenerate in energy, leading to equal populations of both helicities. On the other hand, in chiral materials where the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) is prevailing and the dipolar interaction is negligible, only a preferred helicity is selected by the type of DMI. However, whether there is a rigid boundary between these two regimes remains an open question. Herein, we report the observation of dipole skyrmions with unconventional helicity polarization in a van der Waals ferromagnet Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2. Combining magnetometry, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, electrical transport measurements, and micromagnetic simulations, we demonstrate that the short&#8208;range superstructures in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 results in a localized DMI contribution, which breaks the degeneracy of the opposite helicities and leads to the helicity polarization. Therefore, the helicity feature in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 is controlled by both the dipolar interaction and DMI that the former leads to Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions with helicity of &#177;&#960;/2 whereas the latter breaks the helicity degeneracy. This work provides new insights into the skyrmion topology in van der Waals materials.

         <title>Shaping 90 wt% NanoMOFs into Robust Multifunctional Aerogels Using Tailored Bio&#8208;Based Nanofibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sustainable material strategy is reported to fabricate wet&#8208;stable, mechanically robust, and elastic multifunctional nanoMOF&#8208;CNF aerogels with the highest reported nanoMOF loading of 90&#160;wt%, enabled by high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cationic CNFs. The carbonized and non&#8208;carbonized aerogels are effectively demonstrated for water purification, CO2 and CH4 gas storage and separation, flame retardancy, and energy storage.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are hybrid porous crystalline networks with tunable chemical and structural properties. However, their excellent potential is limited in practical applications by their hard&#8208;to&#8208;shape powder form, making it challenging to assemble MOFs into macroscopic composites with mechanical integrity. While a binder matrix enables hybrid materials, such materials have a limited MOF content and thus limited functionality. To overcome this challenge, nanoMOFs are combined with tailored same&#8208;charge high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) to manufacture robust, wet&#8208;stable, and multifunctional MOF&#8208;based aerogels with 90 wt% nanoMOF loading. The porous aerogel architectures show excellent potential for practical applications such as efficient water purification, CO2 and CH4 gas adsorption and separation, and fire&#8208;safe insulation. Moreover, a one&#8208;step carbonization process enables these aerogels as effective structural energy&#8208;storage electrodes. This work exhibits the unique ability of high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CNFs to bind large amounts of nanoMOFs in structured materials with outstanding mechanical integrity&#8212;a quality that is preserved even after carbonization. The demonstrated process is simple and fully discloses the intrinsic potential of the nanoMOFs, resulting in synergetic properties not found in the components alone, thus paving the way for MOFs in macroscopic multifunctional composites.

         <title>Dramatic Enhancement of Thermoelectric Performance in PbTe by Unconventional Grain Shrinking in the Sintering Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with the traditional grain growth of pristine PbTe, a cleavage&#8208;fracture strategy for grain shrinking is developed in a Pb0.98Sb0.02Te sample during sintering. A hierarchical grain&#8208;boundary structure forms during grain shrinking process and a record&#8208;high ZT value of &#8776;1.9 is obtained at 815 K, which is &#8776;2.2 times that of pristine PbTe.








Abstract
Nanostructure engineering is a key strategy for tailoring properties in the fields of batteries, solar cells, thermoelectrics, and so on. Limited by grain coarsening, however, the nanostructure effect gradually degrades during the materials&#8217; manufacturing and in&#8208;service period. Herein, a strategy of cleavage&#8208;fracture for grain shrinking is developed in a Pb0.98Sb0.02Te sample during sintering, and the grain size remains stable after repeated tests. Moreover, the initial grain boundary is filled by fractured slender grains and enriched by dislocations, evolving into a hierarchical grain&#8208;boundary structure. The lattice thermal conductivity (klat) is greatly reduced to approach the amorphous limit. As a result, a record&#8208;high ZT value of &#8776;1.9 is obtained at 815 K in the n&#8208;type Pb0.98Sb0.02Te sample and a decent efficiency of 6.7% in thermoelectric device. This strategy for grain shrinking will shed light on the application of nanostructure engineering under high temperature and extreme conditions in other material systems.

         <title>In Situ Characterization of the Protein Corona of Nanoparticles In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Most standard characterization techniques cannot capture the subtle complexity of the protein corona. A novel approach using differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) on a simple fluorescence microscope makes possible simultaneous measurements of protein adsorption, particle size, and fractal dimension of aggregates. The new insights obtained from this technique shed light on the protein corona (PC) complexity within in vitro and in vivo setups.








Abstract
A new theoretical framework that enables the use of differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) in fluorescence imaging mode to quantify in situ protein adsorption onto nanoparticles (NP) while simultaneously monitoring for NP aggregation is proposed. This methodology is used to elucidate the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the protein corona (PC) in vitro and in vivo. The results show that protein adsorption triggers particle aggregation over a wide concentration range and that the formed aggregate structures can be quantified using the proposed methodology. Protein affinity for polystyrene (PS) NPs is observed to be dependent on particle concentration.

     alt="In Situ Characterization of the Protein Corona of Nanoparticles In Vitro and In Vivo"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most standard characterization techniques cannot capture the subtle complexity of the protein corona. A novel approach using differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) on a simple fluorescence microscope makes possible simultaneous measurements of protein adsorption, particle size, and fractal dimension of aggregates. The new insights obtained from this technique shed light on the protein corona (PC) complexity within in vitro and in vivo setups.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new theoretical framework that enables the use of differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) in fluorescence imaging mode to quantify in situ protein adsorption onto nanoparticles (NP) while simultaneously monitoring for NP aggregation is proposed. This methodology is used to elucidate the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the protein corona (PC) in vitro and in vivo. The results show that protein adsorption triggers particle aggregation over a wide concentration range and that the formed aggregate structures can be quantified using the proposed methodology. Protein affinity for polystyrene (PS) NPs is observed to be dependent on particle concentration. For complex protein mixtures, this methodology identifies that the PC composition changes with the dilution of serum proteins, demonstrating a Vroman effect never quantitatively assessed in situ on NPs. Finally, DDM allows monitoring of the evolution of the PC in vivo. This results show that the PC composition evolves significantly over time in zebrafish larvae, confirming the inherently dynamic nature of the PC. The performance of the developed methodology allows to obtain quantitative insights into nano-bio interactions in a vast array of physiologically relevant conditions that will serve to further improve the design of nanomedicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A simple Preheating&#8208;pyrolysis Strategy Leading to Superior ORR Activity in Fe&#8208;N/Carbon black</title>

Abstract
Maintaining high catalytic activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while reducing costs has been a long&#8208;standing effort to promote the application of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs). Here, we enhanced the binding of nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands and carbon black by controlling the pyrolysis conditions of a FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), carbon black mixture, which significantly improved the ORR catalytic activity of the pyrolysis products. We proposed the preheating as a process improvement method to use a heat treatment at a temperature between the melting and boiling points of phen before high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, which achieved an effective combination of phen and carbon black, enhanced the interaction between phen and ferrous ions. This method substantially increased the number of FeNx active centers in the pyrolysis product, resulting in an impressive Fe&#8208;N/C catalyst with half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) up to 0.93&#160;V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density (jL) of 5.9&#160;mA/cm2 and no obvious decay after 20000 cyclic voltammetry cycles in 0.1&#160;M KOH, which are all among the best reported data to date. The interaction between the ratio of Fe/phen and the pyrolysis conditions was also investigated. Under the right conditions cheap raw materials can also generate highly catalytically active sites, all these advantages may provide promise for future applications.

         <title>Direct Exciton Harvesting from a Bound Triplet Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Singlet fission is commonly defined as the generation of two triplet excitons from a single absorbed photon. However, ambiguities within this definition arise due to the complexity of the various double triplet states that exist in SF chromophores and corresponding interconversion processes. To clarify this process, singlet fission is frequently depicted as sequential two&#8208;step conversion in which a singlet exciton decays into a bound triplet pair biexciton state which dissociates into two &#8220;free&#8221; triplet excitons. However, this model discounts the potential for direct harvesting from the coupled biexciton state. Here, we demonstrate that individual triplet excitons can be extracted directly from a bound triplet pair. We demonstrate that due to the requirement for geminate triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation in intramolecular singlet fission compounds, unique spectral and kinetic signatures can be used to quantify triplet pair harvesting yields. We achieve an internal quantum efficiency for triplet exciton transfer from the triplet pair of greater than 50%, limited only by the solubility of the compounds. The harvesting process is not dependent on the net multiplicity of the triplet pair state, suggesting that an explicit, independent dissociation step is not a requirement for using triplet pairs to do chemical or electrical work.

         <title>Electret&#8208;powered Skin&#8208;attachable Auditory Sensor that Functions in Harsh Acoustic Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Auditory sensors have shortcomings with respect to not only personalization with wearability and portability but also detecting a human voice clearly in a noisy environment or when a mask covers the mouth. In this work, we exploited an electret&#8208;powered and hole patterned polymer diaphragm into a skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor for the first time. The optimized charged electret diaphragm induces a voltage bias of &gt;400&#160;V against the counter electrode, which reduces the necessity of a bulky power source and enables the capacitive sensor to show high sensitivity (2.2&#160;V/Pa) with incorporation of an elastomer nanodroplet seismic mass. The sophisticated capacitive structure with low mechanical damping enabled a flat frequency response (80&#8211;3000&#160;Hz) and good linearity (50&#8211;80&#160;dBSPL). The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragms help our skin&#8208;attachable sensor detect only neck&#8208;skin vibration rather than dynamic air pressure, enabling a person's voice to be detected in a harsh acoustic environment. The sensor operated reliably even in the presence of surrounding noise and when the user was wearing a gas mask. Therefore, our sensor shows strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications such as cough monitoring and voice dosimetry.

         <title>Achieving Sustainable and Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Battery by Leaf&#8208;Bioinspired Nanofluidic Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In nature, living systems have evolved integrated structures, matching optimized nanofluidics to adapt to external conditions. In rechargeable batteries, high&#8208;capacity electrodes are often plagued by the crucial and universal bottleneck of dissolution and shuttle of active substance into electrolyte, posing obstacles of inevitable capacity degradation. Introducing the concept of intelligent nanofluidics to electrodes, we proposed a leaf&#8208;bioinspired electrode configuration with hierarchical architecture to tackle this problem. This integrated structure with fine&#8208;tuned surface pores and unobstructed interior porous media, could spatially control the anisotropic nanofluidic flux, in an efficient and self&#8208;protectable way: tailoring the outflow across the electrode's surface and free transport in interior, to ensure speedy and stable energy conversion. As proofs of concept, applications of sustainable electrodes rejuvenated from fallen leaf and spent commercial batteries, are designed with leaf&#8208;bioinspired architecture. Both K&#8208;CoS2 and K&#8208;S battery systems show advanced steady cycling with effectively mitigated shuttle issues in this smart architecture (0.15% and 0.21% capacity decay per cycle), even at high areal mass loading, when compared with open porous structure (0.60% and 0.39%). This work may pave a new way from a biomimetic view to integrated electrode engineering with regulated surface shielding to conquer the universal dissolution&#8208;shuttle problems facing high&#8208;capacity materials.

         <title>Fully Depleted Self&#8208;Aligned Heterosandwiched Van Der Waals Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;operating highly sensitive mid&#8208;wave infrared (MWIR) photodetectors are utilized in a large number of important applications including night vision, communications, and optical radar. Many previous studies have demonstrated uncooled MWIR photodetectors using two&#8208;dimentional narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductors. To date, most of these works utilize atomically thin flakes, simple van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, or atomically thin p&#8208;n junctions as absorbers, which have difficulty meeting the requirements for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MWIR photodetectors with a blackbody response. Here, we report a fully depleted self&#8208;aligned MoS2&#8208;BP&#8208;MoS2 vdW heterostructure sandwiched between two electrodes. This new type of photodetector exhibits competitive performance, including a high blackbody peak photoresponsivity up to 0.77 A/W and low noise&#8208;equivalent power of 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;14&#160;W/Hz1/2, in the MWIR region. A peak specific detectivity of 8.61&#160;&#215; 1010 cmHz1/2/W under blackbody radiation was achieved at room temperature in the MWIR region. Importantly, the effective detection range of our device is twice that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MWIR photodetectors. Furthermore, the device presents an ultra&#8208;fast response of &#8764;4 &#956;s both in the visible and short&#8208;wavelength infrared bands. These results provide an ideal platform for realizing broadband and highly sensitive room&#8208;temperature MWIR photodetectors.

Furthermore, the device presents an ultra-fast response of &#8764;4 &#956;s both in the visible and short-wavelength infrared bands. These results provide an ideal platform for realizing broadband and highly sensitive room-temperature MWIR photodetectors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Spleen&#8208;Targeted Glabridin&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles Regulate Polarization of Monocyte/Macrophage (Mo/M&#966;) for the Treatment of Cerebral Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>

Abstract
During cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion (I&#8208;R) injury, the infiltration of monocyte/macrophages (Mo/M&#966;) into the ischemic penumbra causes inflammatory damage but also regulates tissue repair in the penumbra. The regulation and balance of Mo/M&#966; polarization has been considered as a potential therapeutic target for treating cerebral I&#8208;R injury. Herein, our findings demonstrated that glabridin (Gla)&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (i.e., NPGla&#8208;5k) could effectively inhibit M1&#8208;polarization and enhance M2&#8208;polarization of Mo/M&#966;. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging showed that NPGla&#8208;5k could selectively accumulate in the spleen following intravenous injection. Spleen&#8208;targeted Cy5&#8208;NPGla&#8208;5k can colocalize with peripheral macrophages in the penumbra at 24&#160;h after tail vein injection. Interestingly, NPGla&#8208;5k treatment could reduce inflammatory damage, protect dying neurons and improve nervous system function. The protective effect of spleen&#8208;targeted NPGla&#8208;5k against cerebral I&#8208;R injury in mice encourages an exploration of their use for clinical treatment of patients with cerebral I&#8208;R injury.

         <title>In Situ Growth of Covalent Organic Framework Nanosheets on Graphene as the Cathode for Long&#8208;Life High&#8208;Capacity Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sophisticated covalent organic framework (COF)&#160;predesign and synthetic strategy, with the assistance of materials processing technology, results in a new COF&#8208;based high&#8208;performance organic cathode for practical lithium&#8208;ion batteries, with a specific capacity of 285&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at current density of 0.2&#160;C, and retained capacity of 170&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 after 6000 cycles at 5&#160;C.








Abstract
The poor electronic and ionic conductivities of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) severely restrict the development of COF&#8208;based electrodes for practical rechargeable batteries, therefore inspiring more research interest from the direction of both material synthesis and technology. Herein, a dual&#8208;porous COF, USTB&#8208;6, with good crystallinity and rich redox&#8208;active sites is conceived and fabricated by the polymerization of 2,3,8,9,14,15&#8208;hexa(4&#8208;formylphenyl)diquinoxalino [2,3&#8208;a:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;c]phenazine and 2,7&#8208;diaminopyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone. In particular, the heterogeneous polymerization of the same starting materials in the presence of graphene affords uniformly dispersed COF nanosheets with a thickness of 8.3&#160;nm on a conductive carbon substrate, effectively enhancing the electronic conductivity of the COF&#8208;based electrode. Such a graphene&#8208;supported USTB&#8208;6 nanosheets cathode when used in a lithium&#8208;ion battery exhibits a specific capacity of 285&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.2&#160;C and excellent rate performance with a prominent capacity of 188&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;C. More importantly, a capacity of 170&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 is retained by using the USTB&#8208;6 nanosheets cathode after 6000 cycles charge and discharge measurement at 5&#160;C.

         <title>Unlocking Layered Double Hydroxide as a High&#8208;Performance Cathode Material for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trinary layered double hydroxide (LDH) with hydrogen vacancies is proposed as a new cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. With the existence of H vacancies and the synergy of trinary transitional metal cations in LDH, the electrode exhibits a high reversible capacity of 328 mAh g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling stability over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 85%.








Abstract
Advanced cathode materials play an important role in promoting aqueous battery technology for safe energy storage. Transition metal double hydroxides are usually elusive as a stable cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their unstable crystal structure, sluggish ion transportation, and insufficient active sites for zinc&#8208;ion storage. Here, a trinary layered double hydroxide (LDH) with hydrogen vacancies (Ni3Mn0.7Fe0.3&#8208;LDH) is reported as a new cathode material for AZIBs. A reversible high capacity up to 328 mAh g&#8722;1 can be obtained and cycle stably over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 85%. Experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the hydrogen vacancies in LDH can expose lattice oxygen atoms as active sites for zinc&#8208;ion storage and accelerate ion diffusion by reducing the electrostatic interactions between zinc ions and the host structure. In addition, the synergy of the trinary transitional metal cations can suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion of manganese (III) oxide octahedron and enable long cycle stability. This work provides not only a series of high&#8208;performance cathode materials for AZIBs but also a novel materials design strategy that can be extended to other multi&#8208;valence metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Determination of Crystallographic Orientation and Exposed Facets of Titanium Oxide Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2 nanosheets with dominant {001} and {111} facets are identified by transmission electron microscopy, which are very close because of similar morphology and lattice parameters. The importance of the determination of exposed facets, which is the prerequisite of surface performance study, is emphasized and a paradigm applied to all nanocrystalline materials is given.








Abstract
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocrystals have attracted great attention in heterogeneous photocatalysis and photoelectricity fields for decades. However, contradicting conclusions on the crystallographic orientation and exposed facets of TiO2 nanocrystals frequently appear in the literature. Herein, using anatase TiO2 nanocrystals with highly exposed {001} facets as a model, the misleading conclusions that exist on anatase nanocrystals are clarified. Although TiO2&#8208;001 nanocrystals are recognized to be dominated by {001} facets, in fact, anatase nanocrystals with both dominant {001} and {111} facets always co&#8208;exist due to the similarities in the lattice fringes and intersection angles between the two types of facets (0.38&#160;nm and 90&#176; in the [001] direction, 0.35&#160;nm and 82&#176; in the [111] direction). A paradigm for determining the crystallographic orientation and exposed facets based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, which provides a universal methodology to nanomaterials for determining the orientation and exposed facets, is also given.

         <title>Supramolecular Nitric Oxide Depot for Hypoxic Tumor Vessel Normalization and Radiosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular nitric oxide (NO) depot (SupraNO) for &#946;&#8208;galactosidase&#8208;controlled NO release is reported. SupraNO can provide low&#8208;dose NO continuously and release a large amount of NO immediately on&#8208;demand providing an effective solution for both vessel normalization by low&#8208;dose long&#8208;time NO supply and radiosensitization by temporary high&#8208;dose stimulation in hypoxic tumor.








Abstract
In cancer radiotherapy, the lack of fixed DNA&#160;damage by oxygen in hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors often leads to severe radioresistance. Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent radiosensitizer that acts in two ways. It can directly react with the radical DNA thus fixing the damage. It also normalizes the abnormal tumor vessels, thereby increasing blood perfusion and oxygen supply. To achieve these functions, the dosage and duration of NO treatment need to be carefully controlled, otherwise it will lead to the exact opposite outcomes. However, a delivery method that fulfills both requirements is still lacking. A NO depot is designed for the control of NO releasing both over quantity and duration for hypoxic tumor vessel normalization and radiosensitization. In B16&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the depot can provide low dosage NO continuously and release large amount of NO immediately before irradiation for a short period of time. These two modes of treatment work in synergy to reverse the radioresistance of B16&#160;tumors more efficiently than releasing at single dosage.

         <title>Wireless Stand&#8208;Alone Trimodal Interactive Display Enabled by Direct Capacitive Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wireless stand&#8208;alone trimodal interactive display is presented where finger touch is displayed with three types of outputs of field&#8208;induced electroluminescence, inverse piezoelectric sound, and tactile vibration remotely powered by unique alternating current (AC)&#8208;to&#8208;AC power transfer based on direct capacitive coupling, making the device potentially suitable for a smart three&#8208;mode braille display.








Abstract
With recent advances in interactive displays, the development of a stand&#8208;alone interactive display with no electrical interconnection is of great interest. Here, a wireless stand&#8208;alone interactive display (WiSID), enabled by direct capacitive coupling, consisting of three layers: two in&#8208;plane metal electrodes separated by a gap, a composite layer for field&#8208;induced electroluminescence (EL) and inverse piezoelectric sound, and a stimuli&#8208;responsive layer, from bottom to top, is presented. Alternating current power necessary for field&#8208;induced EL and inverse piezoelectric sound is wirelessly transferred from a power unit, with two in&#8208;plane electrodes remotely separated from the WiSID. The unique in&#8208;plane power transfer through the stimuli&#8208;sensitive polar bridge allows stand&#8208;alone operation of the WiSID, making it suitable for the wireless dynamic monitoring of medical fluids. Moreover, a haptic wireless stand&#8208;alone trimodal interactive display mounted on a human finger is demonstrated, whereby touch is wirelessly displayed in various outputs of EL, inverse piezoelectric sound, and tactile vibration, making it suitable for a wireless three&#8208;mode smart braille display.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Mixed&#8208;Phase Domain Architectures and Topological Transitions in Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is numerically and experimentally shown that, by controlling strontium content and in turn manipulating strain, topologically non&#8208;trivial phase arrangements appear in hierarchical, mixed&#8208;phase domains structure of Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3. These phases showcase a variety of pattern defects that can be manipulated via thermal treatment. In turn, the dielectric response, which is strongly correlated with domain structure, can be widely varied.








Abstract
The potential for creating hierarchical domain structures, or mixtures of energetically degenerate phases with distinct patterns that can be modified continually, in ferroelectric thin films offers a pathway to control their mesoscale structure beyond lattice&#8208;mismatch strain with a substrate. Here, it is demonstrated that varying the strontium content provides deterministic strain&#8208;driven control of hierarchical domain structures in Pb1&#8722;xSrxTiO3&#160;solid&#8208;solution thin films wherein two types, c/a and a1/a2, of nanodomains can coexist. Combining phase&#8208;field simulations, epitaxial thin&#8208;film growth, detailed structural, domain, and physical&#8208;property characterization, it is observed that the system undergoes a gradual transformation (with increasing strontium content) from droplet&#8208;like a1/a2&#160;domains in a c/a domain matrix, to a connected&#8208;labyrinth geometry of c/a domains, to a disconnected labyrinth structure of the same, and, finally, to droplet&#8208;like c/a domains in an a1/a2&#160;domain matrix. A relationship between the different mixed&#8208;phase modulation patterns and its topological nature is established. Annealing the connected&#8208;labyrinth structure leads to domain coarsening forming distinctive regions of parallel c/a and a1/a2&#160;domain stripes, offering additional design flexibility. Finally, it is found that the connected&#8208;labyrinth domain patterns exhibit the highest dielectric permittivity.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Regulated Electrostatic Shielding Layer toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Building stable electrolytes is very crucial for constructing stable Zn batteries as hydrogen reaction and the dendritic growth of Zn&#8208;metal anodes. Here, a rare metal salts additive (CeCl3) is employed to stabilize the electrolyte in Zn batteries via the formation of a self&#8208;regulated electrostatic shielding layer. The rare metal salts additive strategy affords emerging chances for rational electrolyte design for stable Zn batteries.








Abstract
Although aqueous Zn batteries have become a more sustainable alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries owing to their intrinsic security, their practical applications are limited by dendrite formation and hydrogen reactions. The first application of a rare earth metal type addition to Zn batteries, cerium chloride (CeCl3), as an effective, low&#8208;cost, and green electrolyte additive that facilitates the formation of a dynamic electrostatic shielding layer around the Zn protuberance to induce uniform Zn deposition is presented. After introducing CeCl3 additives, the electrochemical characterizations, in situ optical microscopy observation, in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, along with density functional theory calculations, and finite element method simulations reveal resisted Zn dendritic growth and enhanced electrolyte stability. As a result, the Zn&#8211;Zn cells using the CeCl3 additive exhibit a long cycling stability of 2600 h at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, an impressive cumulative areal capacity of 3.6 Ah cm&#8722;2 at 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and a high Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.7%. The fact that the Zn&#8211;LiFePO4 cells with proposed electrolyte retain capacity significantly better than the additive&#8208;free case is even more exciting.

         <title>Toward Tissue&#8208;Like Material Properties: Inducing In Situ Adaptive Behavior in Fibrous Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature's gels, intracellular and extracellular are highly adaptive, which is very difficult to recreate in the lab. In this work, a synthetic fibrous network, functional cross&#8208;linkers, and a tailorable interaction between the two components are used to reversibly manipulate mechanical properties on&#8208;demand.








Abstract
The materials properties of biological tissues are unique. Nature is able to spatially and temporally manipulate (mechanical) properties while maintaining responsiveness toward a variety of cues; all without majorly changing the material's composition. Artificial mimics, synthetic or biomaterial&#8208;based are far less advanced and poorly reproduce the natural cell microenvironment. A viable strategy to generate materials with advanced properties combines different materials into nanocomposites. This work describes nanocomposites of a synthetic fibrous hydrogel, based on polyisocyanide (PIC), that is noncovalently linked to a responsive cross&#8208;linker. The introduction of the cross&#8208;linker transforms the PIC gel from a static fibrous extracellular matrix mimic to a highly dynamic material that maintains biocompatibility, as demonstrated by in situ modification of the (non)linear mechanical properties and efficient self&#8208;healing properties. Key in the material design is cross&#8208;linking at the fibrillar level using nanoparticles, which, simultaneously may be used to introduce more advanced properties.

&lt;p&gt;Nature's gels, intracellular and extracellular are highly adaptive, which is very difficult to recreate in the lab. In this work, a synthetic fibrous network, functional cross-linkers, and a tailorable interaction between the two components are used to reversibly manipulate mechanical properties on-demand.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The materials properties of biological tissues are unique. Nature is able to spatially and temporally manipulate (mechanical) properties while maintaining responsiveness toward a variety of cues; all without majorly changing the material's composition. Artificial mimics, synthetic or biomaterial-based are far less advanced and poorly reproduce the natural cell microenvironment. A viable strategy to generate materials with advanced properties combines different materials into nanocomposites. This work describes nanocomposites of a synthetic fibrous hydrogel, based on polyisocyanide (PIC), that is noncovalently linked to a responsive cross-linker. The introduction of the cross-linker transforms the PIC gel from a static fibrous extracellular matrix mimic to a highly dynamic material that maintains biocompatibility, as demonstrated by in situ modification of the (non)linear mechanical properties and efficient self-healing properties. Key in the material design is cross-linking at the fibrillar level using nanoparticles, which, simultaneously may be used to introduce more advanced properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Orientated Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solid with a high orientation and substantially diminished nonradiative recombination is constructed using precursor engineering accompanied by a chemical stripping treatment of the PQDs. Consequently, the resultant inorganic PQD solar cell (PQDSC) delivers a high power conversion efficiency of up to 16.25%, among the highest efficiencies of inorganic PQDSCs.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) have emerged&#160;as competitive optoelectronic materials for photovoltaic applications due to their ideal bandgap energy, high defect tolerance, and solution processability. However, the highly dynamic surface and imperfect cubic structure of PQDs generally result in unfavorable charge&#8208;carrier transport within the PQD solids and serious nonradiative recombination. Herein, a highly orientated PQD solid is demonstrated using precursor engineering accompanied by a chemical stripping treatment (CST). A combination of systematic experimental studies and theoretical calculations is conducted to fundamentally understand the resurfacing of PQDs using the CST approach. The results reveal that the highly ordered PQDs can result in a high orientation of PQD solids, significantly promoting charge&#8208;carrier transport within the PQD solids. Meanwhile, the ideal cubic&#8208;structured PQD with an iodine&#8208;rich surface dramatically decreases surface trap states, thereby substantially diminishing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Consequently, the inorganic PQD solar cell delivers a power conversion efficiency of up to 16.25%. This work provides a feasible avenue to construct highly orientated PQD solids with improved photophysical properties for high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Advances in Colloidal Building Blocks: Toward Patchy Colloidal Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microspheres, colloidal clusters, spherical patchy particles, patchy colloidal clusters, and asymmetric patchy clusters have been developed sequentially. They can be assembled into opals, the laves phase, colloidal molecules or chains, colloidal cubic diamonds, and colloidal chiral structures, respectively.








Abstract
The scalable synthetic route to colloidal atoms has significantly advanced over the past two decades. Recently, colloidal clusters with DNA&#8208;coated cores called &#8220;patchy colloidal clusters&#8221; have been developed, providing a directional bonding with specific angle of rotation due to the shape complementarity between colloidal clusters. Through a DNA&#8208;mediated interlocking process, they are directly assembled into low&#8208;coordination colloidal structures, such as cubic diamond lattices. Herein, the significant progress in recent years in the synthesis of patchy colloidal clusters and their assembly in experiments and simulations is reviewed. Furthermore, an outlook is given on the emerging approaches to the patchy colloidal clusters and their potential applications in photonic crystals, metamaterials, topological photonic insulators, and separation membranes.

         <title>Enriched&#8208;Bromine Surface State for Stable Sky&#8208;Blue Spectrum Perovskite QLEDs With an EQE of 14.6%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enriched&#8208;bromine surface state is controlled by employing PbBr2 stock solution for anion&#8208;exchange based on Cd&#8208;doping perovskite quantum dots (QDs), which shows good passivation to the vacancy defects, resulting in boosted optical properties and stability. The stable sky&#8208;blue spectrum quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) based on the controlled QDs are conducted with a record EQE of 14.6% and current efficiency (CE) of 19.9 Cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Halogen vacancies are of great concern in blue&#8208;emitting perovskite quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes because they affect their efficiency and spectral shift. Here, an enriched&#8208;bromine surface state is realized using a facile strategy that employs a PbBr2 stock solution for anion exchange based on Cd&#8208;doped perovskite quantum dots. It is found that the doped Cd ions are expected to reduce the formation energy of halogen vacancies filled by the external bromine ions, and the excess free bromine ions in solution are enriched in the surface by anchoring with halogen vacancies as sites, accompanied with the shedding of surface long&#8208;chain ligands during the anion exchange process, resulting in a Br&#8208;rich and &#8220;neat&#8221; surface. Moreover, the surface state exhibits good passivation of the surface defects of the controlled perovskite QDs and simultaneously increases the exciton binding energy, leading to excellent optical properties and stability. Finally, the sky&#8208;blue emitting perovskite quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) (490&#160;nm) are conducted with a record external quantum efficiency of 14.6% and current efficiency of 19.9&#160;cd A&#8722;1. Meanwhile, the electroluminescence spectra exhibit great stability with negligible shifts under a constant operating voltage from 3 to 7&#160;V. This strategy paves the way for improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite QLEDs.

         <title>Surface Lattice Plasmon Resonances by Direct In Situ Substrate Growth of Gold Nanoparticles in Ordered Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanoparticle plasmonic ordered arrays are fabricated by an unconventional in situ approach where gold precursors are reduced directly at specific pre&#8208;patterned locations on substrates. Nanoparticle morphology and array periodicity are easily tuned using this method. The substrates exhibit far&#8208;field plasmonic coupling via the emergence of lattice plasmon resonances, constituting a major step forward for in situ growth techniques.








Abstract
Precise arrangements of plasmonic nanoparticles on substrates are important for designing optoelectronics, sensors and metamaterials with rational electronic, optical and magnetic properties. Bottom&#8208;up synthesis offers unmatched control over morphology and optical response of individual plasmonic building blocks. Usually, the incorporation of nanoparticles made by bottom&#8208;up wet chemistry starts from batch synthesis of colloids, which requires time&#8208;consuming and hard&#8208;to&#8208;scale steps like ligand exchange and self&#8208;assembly. Herein, an unconventional bottom&#8208;up wet&#8208;chemical synthetic approach for producing gold nanoparticle ordered arrays is developed. Water&#8208;processable hydroxypropyl cellulose stencils facilitate the patterning of a reductant chemical ink on which nanoparticle growth selectively occurs. Arrays exhibiting lattice plasmon resonances in the visible region and near infrared (quality factors of &gt;20) are produced following a rapid synthetic step (&lt;10&#160;min), all without cleanroom fabrication, specialized equipment, or self&#8208;assembly, constituting a major step forward in establishing in situ growth approaches. Further, the technical capabilities of this method through modulation of the particle size, shape, and array spacings directly on the substrate are demonstrated. Ultimately, establishing a fundamental understanding of in situ growth has the potential to inform the fabrication of plasmonic materials; opening the door for in situ growth fabrication of waveguides, lasing platforms, and plasmonic sensors.

         <title>Surface co&#8208;Modification of Halide Anion and Potassium Cation Promotes High&#8208;rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethanol Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The high&#8208;rate electrochemical CO2 conversion to ethanol with high partial current density is attractive but challenging, which requires competing with other reduction products as well as hydrogen evolution. In this work, we demonstrate the in&#8208;situ reconstruction of KCuF3 perovskite under CO2 electroreduction conditions to fabricate a surface fluorine&#8208;bonded, single potassium atom&#8208;modified Cu(111) nanocrystal (K&#8208;F&#8208;Cu&#8208;CO2). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the co&#8208;modification of both F and K atoms on Cu(111) surface can promote the ethanol pathway via stabilization of C&#8722;O bond and selective hydrogenation of C = C bond in CH2 = CHO* intermediate, while the single modification of either F or K is less effective. The K&#8208;F&#8208;Cu&#8208;CO2 electrocatalyst exhibited an outstanding CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol partial current density of 423 &#177; 30 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 with the corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 52.9 &#177; 3.7%, and a high electrochemical stability at large current densities, thus suggesting an attractive means of surface co&#8208;modification of halide anion and alkali&#8208;metal cation on Cu catalysts for high&#8208;rate CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol electrosynthesis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-rate electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; conversion to ethanol with high partial current density is attractive but challenging, which requires competing with other reduction products as well as hydrogen evolution. In this work, we demonstrate the &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; reconstruction of KCuF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction conditions to fabricate a surface fluorine-bonded, single potassium atom-modified Cu(111) nanocrystal (K-F-Cu-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the co-modification of both F and K atoms on Cu(111) surface can promote the ethanol pathway via stabilization of C&#8722;O bond and selective hydrogenation of C = C bond in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = CHO* intermediate, while the single modification of either F or K is less effective. The K-F-Cu-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalyst exhibited an outstanding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol partial current density of 423 &#177; 30 mA&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; with the corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 52.9 &#177; 3.7%, and a high electrochemical stability at large current densities, thus suggesting an attractive means of surface co-modification of halide anion and alkali-metal cation on Cu catalysts for high-rate CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-ethanol electrosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Perovskite or Not Perovskite? A Deep Learning Approach to Automatically Identify New Hybrid Perovskites from X&#8208;ray Diffraction Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Determining the crystal structure is a critical step in the discovery of new functional materials. This process is time consuming and requires extensive human expertise in crystallography. Here, we developed a machine learning based approach which enables to determine automatically if an unknown material is of perovskite type from powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. After training a deep learning model on a dataset of known compounds, the structure types of new unknown compounds could be predicted using their experimental powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. This strategy was used to distinguish perovskite&#8208;type materials in a series of new hybrid lead halides. After validation, our approach was shown to accurately identify perovskites (accuracy of 92% with convolutional neural network). From the identification of the key features of the patterns used to discriminate perovskite versus non&#8208;perovskite, crystallographers could learn how to quickly identify low dimensional perovskites from X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns.

         <title>Molecularly Distorted Local Structure in Bi2CuO4 Oxide to Stabilize Lattice Oxygen for Efficient Formate Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an economically feasible way for converting green energy into valuable chemical feedstocks and fuels. Great progress have been achieved in understanding and synthesis of oxidized&#8208;based precatalysts; however, their dynamical changes of local structure under operando conditions still hinder their further applications. Here, we report a molecularly distorted Bi2CuO4 precatalyst for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) results and theoretical calculations suggest that the distorted structure with molecularly like [CuO4]6&#8211; unit rotation is more conducive to the structural stability of the sample. Operando XAFS and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) results prove that quite a bit of lattice oxygen can remain in the distorted sample after CO2RR. The electrochemical measurements of the distorted sample show an excellent activity and selectivity with a high formate partial current density of 194.6&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 at an extremely low overpotential of &#8211;400&#160;mV. Further in&#8208;situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate the retained oxygen could optimize the adsorption of *OCHO intermediate for the enhanced CO2RR performance.

         <title>Tropocollagen Inspired Hierarchical Spiral Structure of Organic Fibers in Epoxy Bulk for Three&#8208;dimensional High Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymers are usually considered thermal insulators; however, significant enhancements in thermal conductivity (k) have been observed in oriented fibers and films. Despite being advantageous in real&#8208;world applications, extending the linear thermal&#8208;transport advantage of polymers into the three&#8208;dimensional space in bulk materials is still limited due to the spatially interfacial phonon&#8208;conduction barriers. Herein, inspired by the structure of tropocollagen, we discovered that weaving hierarchically arranged poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers with a spiral configuration into an epoxy matrix can yield a three&#8208;dimensionally continuous thermal pathway. This achieves both a through&#8208;plane k of 10.85&#160;W/m K and an in&#8208;plane k of 7.15&#160;W/m K. Theoretical molecular simulations in combination with classical nonlinear modeling attribute the above spatially thermally conductive achievement to not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral and weaving structure of PBO, but also the noncrystalline chains that carry overlapping phonon density of states, thus thermally bridging adjacent high&#8208;k crystals in the PBO fiber. Consequently, the interfacial thermal resistance among high&#8208;k PBO crystals is suppressed to be on the order of 10&#8211;10 m2 K/W in both the through&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane directions. Other advantages include being lightweight, mechanically strong, flexible, and non&#8208;combustible. This material creates opportunities for organic polymers in high&#8208;performance thermal management applications.

         <title>Multispectral large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray Imaging Enabled by Stacked Metal Halide Scintillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Conventional energy&#8208;integration black&#8208;white X&#8208;ray imaging lacks spectral information of X&#8208;ray photons. Although X&#8208;ray spectra (energy) can be distinguished by photon&#8208;counting technique typically with CdZnTe detectors, it is very challenging to be applied to large&#8208;area flat&#8208;panel X&#8208;ray imaging (FPXI). Herein, we design multi&#8208;layer stacked scintillators of different X&#8208;ray absorption capabilities and scintillation spectrums, in this scenario, the X&#8208;ray energy can be discriminated by detecting the emission spectra of each scintillator, therefore the multispectral X&#8208;ray imaging can be easily obtained by color or multispectral visible&#8208;light camera in one single shot of X&#8208;ray. To verify this idea, stacked multilayer scintillators based on several emerging metal halides were fabricated in the cost&#8208;effective and scalable solution process, and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept multispectral (or multi&#8208;energy) FPXI were experimentally demonstrated. The dual&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray image of a &#8220;bone&#8208;muscle&#8221; model clearly showed the details that were invisible in conventional energy&#8208;integration FPXI. By stacking four layers of specifically designed multilayer scintillators with appropriate thicknesses, a prototype FPXI with four energy channels was realized, proving its extendibility to multispectral or even hyperspectral X&#8208;ray imaging. This study provides a facile and effective strategy to realize multispectral large&#8208;area flat&#8208;panel X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Thin Film Lithium/Lithium&#8208;Ion Microbatteries for Powering the Internet of Things</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As the world steps into the era of Internet of Things (IoT), numerous miniaturized electronic devices requiring autonomous micropower sources will be connected to the internet. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state thin&#8208;film lithium/lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries (TFBs) combining solid&#8208;state battery architecture and thin&#8208;film manufacturing are regarded as ideal on&#8208;chip power sources for IoT&#8208;enabled microelectronic devices. However, unlike commercialized lithium&#8208;ion batteries, TFBs are still in the immature state, and new advances in materials, manufacturing, and structure are required to improve their performance. In this review, we discuss the current status and existing challenges of TFBs for practical application in internet&#8208;connected devices for the IoT. Recent progress in thin&#8208;film deposition, electrode and electrolyte materials, interface modification, and 3D architecture design is comprehensively summarized and discussed, with emphasis on state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies to improve the areal capacity and cycling stability of TFBs. Moreover, to be suitable power sources for IoT devices, the design of next&#8208;generation TFBs should consider multiple functionalities, including wide working temperature range, good flexibility, high transparency, and integration with energy&#8208;harvesting systems. Perspectives on designing practically accessible TFBs are provided, which may guide the future development of reliable power sources for IoT devices

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world steps into the era of Internet of Things (IoT), numerous miniaturized electronic devices requiring autonomous micropower sources will be connected to the internet. All-solid-state thin-film lithium/lithium-ion microbatteries (TFBs) combining solid-state battery architecture and thin-film manufacturing are regarded as ideal on-chip power sources for IoT-enabled microelectronic devices. However, unlike commercialized lithium-ion batteries, TFBs are still in the immature state, and new advances in materials, manufacturing, and structure are required to improve their performance. In this review, we discuss the current status and existing challenges of TFBs for practical application in internet-connected devices for the IoT. Recent progress in thin-film deposition, electrode and electrolyte materials, interface modification, and 3D architecture design is comprehensively summarized and discussed, with emphasis on state-of-the-art strategies to improve the areal capacity and cycling stability of TFBs. Moreover, to be suitable power sources for IoT devices, the design of next-generation TFBs should consider multiple functionalities, including wide working temperature range, good flexibility, high transparency, and integration with energy-harvesting systems. Perspectives on designing practically accessible TFBs are provided, which may guide the future development of reliable power sources for IoT devices

Abstract
High room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivities, large Li+&#8211;ion transference numbers, and good compatibility with both Li metal anodes and high&#8211;voltage cathodes of the solid electrolytes are the essential requirement for practical solid&#8211;state lithium metal batteries. Herein, we report a unique &#8220;superconcentrated ionogel&#8211;in&#8211;ceramic&#8221; (SIC) electrolyte prepared by an in&#8211;situ thermally initiated radical polymerization. Solid&#8211;state static 7Li nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and molecular dynamics simulation reveal the roles of ceramic in Li+ local environments and transport in the SIC electrolyte. The SIC electrolyte not only exhibits an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 1.33&#215;10&#8211;3 S cm&#8211;1 at 25 &#176;C, but also a Li+&#8211;ion transference number as high as 0.89, together with a low electronic conductivity of 3.14&#215;10&#8211;10 S cm&#8211;1 and a wide electrochemical stability window of 5.5&#160;V versus Li/Li+. Applications of the SIC electrolyte in Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 and Li||LiFePO4 batteries further demonstrate the high rate and long cycle life. Our study therefore provides a promising hybrid electrolyte for safe and high energy lithium metal batteries.

         <title>4D Printing of Freestanding Liquid Crystal Elastomers via Hybrid Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) are appealing candidates among active materials for 4D printing, due to their reversible, programmable, and rapid actuation capabilities. Recent progress has been made on direct ink writing (DIW) or digital light processing (DLP) to print LCEs with certain actuation. However, it remains a challenge to achieve complicated structures, such as spatial lattices with large actuation, due to the limitation of printing LCEs on the build platform or the previous layer. Herein, we propose a novel method to 4D print freestanding LCEs on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by using laser&#8208;assisted DIW with an actuation strain up to &#8208;40%. This process is further hybridized with the DLP method for optional structural or removable supports to create active 3D architectures in a one&#8208;step additive process. We demonstrate that various objects, including hybrid active lattices, active tensegrity, an actuator with tunable stability, and 3D spatial LCE lattices, can be additively fabricated. The combination of DIW&#8208;printed functionally freestanding LCEs with the DLP&#8208;printed supporting structures thus provides new design freedom and fabrication capability for applications including soft robotics, smart structures, active metamaterials, and smart wearable devices.

         <title>Cationic Polysaccharide Conjugates as Antibiotic Adjuvants Resensitize Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria and Prevent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent years, traditional antibiotic efficacy has rapidly diminished due to the advent of multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria which pose severe threats to human life and globalized healthcare. Currently, the development cycle of new antibiotics cannot match the ongoing MDR infection crisis. Therefore, novel strategies are required to resensitize MDR bacteria to existing antibiotics. In this study, novel cationic polysaccharide conjugates Dextran&#8208;graft&#8208;Poly(5&#8208;(1,2&#8208;dithiolan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;guanidinoethyl)pentanamide) (Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn) were synthesized using disulfide exchange polymerization. Critically, bacterial membranes and efflux pumps were disrupted by a sub&#8208;inhibitory concentration of Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30, which enhanced rifampicin (RIF) accumulation inside bacteria and restored its efficacy. Combined Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 and RIF prevented bacterial resistance in bacteria cultured over 30 generations. Furthermore, Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 restored RIF effectiveness, reduced inflammatory reactions in a pneumonia&#8208;induced mouse model, and exhibited excellent in vivo biological absorption and degradation capabilities. As an antibiotic adjuvant, Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 provides a novel resensitizing strategy for RIF against MDR bacteria and bacterial resistance. Our Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 research provides a solid platform for future MDR applications.

         <title>Flat&#8208;Zigzag Interface Design of Chalcogenide Heterostructure towards Ultra&#8208;Low Volume Expansion for High&#8208;Performance Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Heterostructure construction of layered metal chalcogenides can boost their alkali&#8208;metal storage performance, where the charge transfer kinetics could be promoted by the built&#8208;in electric fields. However, these heterostructures usually undergo interface separation due to severe layer expansion, especially for large&#8208;size potassium accommodation, resulting in the deconstruction of heterostructures and battery performance fading. Herein, we firstly present a stable interface design strategy that two metal chalcogenides with totally different layer&#8208;morphologies are stacked to form large K+ transport channels, rendering ultra&#8208;low interlayer expansion. As a proof of concept, the flat&#8208;zigzag MoS2/Bi2S3 heterostructures stacked with zigzag&#8208;morphology Bi2S3 and flat&#8208;morphology MoS2 present an ultra&#8208;low expansion ratio (1.98%) versus MoS2 (9.66%) and Bi2S3 (9.61%), which deliver an ultrahigh potassium storage capacity of above 600 mAh/g and capacity retention of 76% after 500 cycles, together with the built&#8208;in electric field of heterostructures. Once the heterostructures are used as an anode for potassium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (K&#8208;DIBs), it achieves a superior full&#8208;cell capacity of &#8764;166 mAh/g (based on anodes) with a capacity retention of 71% after 400 cycles, which is an outstanding performance among the reported K&#8208;DIBs. This proposed interface stacking strategy may offer a new way toward stable heterostructure design for metal ions storage and transport applications.

         <title>An Ultrahigh Rate and Stable Zinc Anode by Facet&#8208;Matching&#8208;Induced Dendrite Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of dendrite regulation,&#160;growing tiny, identical, and homogeneously distributed Zn dendrites by facet matching of Cu(111)/Zn(002),&#160;can achieve reversible Zn plating/stripping and long&#8208;life Zn anode at ultrahigh current densities.








Abstract
Resource&#8208;abundant metal (e.g., zinc) batteries feature intrinsic advantages of safety and sustainability. Their practical feasibility, however, is impeded by the poor reversibility of metal anodes, typically caused by the uncontrollable dendrite enlargement. Significant effort is exerted to completely prevent dendrites from forming, but this seems less effective at high current densities.

&lt;p&gt;The strategy of dendrite regulation,&#160;growing tiny, identical, and homogeneously distributed Zn dendrites by facet matching of Cu(111)/Zn(002),&#160;can achieve reversible Zn plating/stripping and long-life Zn anode at ultrahigh current densities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource-abundant metal (e.g., zinc) batteries feature intrinsic advantages of safety and sustainability. Their practical feasibility, however, is impeded by the poor reversibility of metal anodes, typically caused by the uncontrollable dendrite enlargement. Significant effort is exerted to completely prevent dendrites from forming, but this seems less effective at high current densities. Herein, this work presents an alternative dendrite regulation strategy of forming tiny, homogeneously distributed, and identical zinc dendrites by facet matching, which effectively avoids undesirable dendrite enlargement. Confirmed by multiscale theoretical screening and characterization, the regularly exposed Cu(111) facets at the ridges of a copper nanowire are capable of such dendrite regulation by forming a low-mismatched Zn(002)/Cu(111) interface. Consequently, reversible zinc electroplating/stripping is achieved at an unprecedentedly high rate of 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for over 30&#160;000 cycles, corresponding to an accumulative areal capacity up to 30 Ah cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. A full cell using this anode shows a high capacity of 308.3 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high capacity retention of 91.4% after 800 cycles. This strategy is also viable for magnesium and aluminum anodes, thus opening up a promising and universal avenue toward long-life and high-rate metal anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergizing Hydrogen Spillover and Deprotonation by the Internal Polarization Field in a MoS2/NiPS3 Vertical Heterostructure for Boosted Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The internal polarization field (IPF) in a bicomponent MoS2/NiPS3 electrocatalyst can engineer both interfacial hydrogen spillover (HSo) and dual&#8208;path deprotonation (DeP) to empower the catalyst with a bifunctional water&#8208;splitting activity. This research puts forward the IPF as the criterion in the rational design of HSo/DeP&#8208;unified non&#8208;precious catalysts for highly efficient water electrolysis.








Abstract
Hydrogen spillover (HSo) has emerged to upgrade the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of Pt&#8208;support electrocatalysts, but it is not applicable to the deprotonated oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Non&#8208;precious catalysts that can perform well in both HSo and deprotonation (DeP) are extremely desirable for a sustainable hydrogen economy. Herein, an affordable MoS2/NiPS3 vertical heterostructure catalyst is presented to synergize HSo and DeP for efficient water electrolysis. The internal polarization field (IPF) is clarified as the driving force of HSo in HER electrocatalysis. The HSo from the MoS2 edge to NiPS3 can activate the NiPS3 basal plane to boost the HER activity of the MoS2/NiPS3 heterostructure (112&#160;mV vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2), while for OER, the IPF in the heterostructure can facilitate the hydroxyl diffusion and render MoS2&#8208;to&#8208;NiPS3/P&#8208;to&#8208;S dual&#8208;pathways for DeP. As a result, the stacking of OER&#8208;inactive MoS2 on the NiPS3 surface still brings intriguing OER enhancements. With them serving as electrode couples, the overall water splitting is attested stably with a cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This research puts forward the IPF as the criterion in the rational design of HSo/DeP&#8208;unified non&#8208;precious catalysts for efficient water electrolysis.

         <title>All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystal Photoelectric Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

The preferred (100) surface engineering of CsPbBr3 perovskite single&#8208;crystals enables a low surface bandgap energy (2.33&#160;eV) and high&#8208;rate carrier mobility up to 241&#160;&#181;m2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, inherently boosting their light&#8208;harvesting and carrier transport capability. Meanwhile, polar (111) surface engineering induces &#8776;0.16&#160;eV upward surface&#8208;band bending and ultrahigh surface defect density of 1.49&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, which may be beneficial for enhancing surface&#8208;defects&#8208;catalyzed reactions.








Abstract
Engineering surface structure can precisely and effectively tune the optoelectronic properties of halide perovskites, but are incredibly challenging. Herein, the design and fabrication of uniform all&#8208;inorganic CsPbBr3 cubic/tetrahedral single&#8208;crystals are reported with precise control of the (100) and (111) surface anisotropy, respectively. By combining&#160;with theoretical calculations, it is demonstrated that the preferred (100) surface engineering of the CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystals enables a lowest surface bandgap energy (2.33&#160;eV) and high&#8208;rate carrier mobility up to 241&#160;&#181;m2&#160;V&#8208;1&#160;s&#8208;1, inherently boosting their light&#8208;harvesting and carrier&#8208;transport capability. Meanwhile, the polar (111) surface induces &#8776;0.16&#160;eV upward surface&#8208;band bending and ultrahigh surface defect density of 1.49&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8208;3, which is beneficial for enhancing surface&#8208;defects&#8208;catalyzed reactions. The work highlights the anisotropic surface engineering for boosting perovskite optoelectronic devices and beyond.

         <title>Polarized Cu&#8211;Bi Site Pairs for Non&#8208;Covalent to Covalent Interaction Tuning toward N2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;confined doping strategy is developed to prepare Bi24O31Br10 materials incorporating isolated Cu (Fe, Co, Ni) atoms. The polarized Cu&#8211;Bi site pairs favor better electron delocalization for effective N2 activation, and can work as reactive sites to tune the non&#8208;covalent interactions of the intermediates, optimize the covalent bond order in N&#63743;N, and alter the hydrogenation pathways.








Abstract
A universal atomic layer confined doping strategy is developed to prepare Bi24O31Br10 materials incorporating isolated Cu atoms. The local polarization can be created along the Cu&#63743;O&#63743;Bi atomic interface, which enables better electron delocalization for effective N2 activation. The optimized Cu&#8208;Bi24O31Br10 atomic layers show 5.3&#215; and 88.2&#215; improved photocatalytic nitrogen fixation activity than Bi24O31Br10 atomic layer and bulk Bi24O31Br10, respectively, with the NH3 generation rate reaching 291.1&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in pure water. The polarized Cu&#8211;Bi site pairs can increase the non&#8208;covalent interaction between the catalyst's surface and N2 molecules, then further weaken the covalent bond order in N&#63743;N. As a result, the hydrogenation pathways can be altered from the associative distal pathway for Bi24O31Br10 to the alternating pathway for Cu&#8208;Bi24O31Br10. This strategy provides an accessible pathway for designing polarized metal site pairs or tuning the non&#8208;covalent interaction and covalent bond order.

         <title>Tuning Zn&#8208;Ion Solvation Chemistry with Chelating Ligands toward Stable Aqueous Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability constant (K) of ligand, which reflects its interaction with Zn ions, is proposed to ean ideal parameter to decode how the solvation chemistry intrinsically regulates the corrosion current density and nucleation overpotential of a stable Zn anode, toward long&#8208;life aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Changing the solvation sheath of hydrated Zn ions is an effective strategy to stabilize Zn anodes to obtain a practical aqueous Zn&#8208;ion battery. However, key points related to the rational design remain unclear including how the properties of the solvent molecules intrinsically regulate the solvated structure of the Zn ions. This study proposes the use of&#160;a stability constant (K), namely, the equilibrium constant of the complexation reaction, as a universal standard to make an accurate selection of ligands in the electrolyte to improve the anode stability. It is found that K greatly impacts the corrosion current density and nucleation overpotential. Following this, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid with a superhigh K effectively suppresses Zn corrosion and induces uniform Zn&#8208;ion deposition. As a result, the anode has an excellent stability of over 3000&#160;h. This work presents a general principle to stabilize anodes by regulating the solvation chemistry, guiding the development of novel electrolytes for sustainable aqueous batteries.

         <title>Tailoring the Desorption Behavior of Hygroscopic Gels for Atmospheric Water Harvesting in Arid Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygroscopic gel is developed for atmospheric water harvesting in arid climates by integrating a hygroscopic salt, LiCl, with a cross&#8208;linked hydrophilic polymeric network, polyacrylamide. The interactions between the polymer network and the captured water increase the free/weakly bonded water content compared with pure salt sorbent, lowering the desorption heat to achieve a high water yield of &#8776;7&#160;g g&#8722;1 per day in a 20% relative humidity environment.








Abstract
The ubiquitous nature of atmospheric moisture makes it a significant water resource available at any geographical location. Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) technology, which extracts moisture from the ambient air to generate clean water, is a promising strategy to realize decentralized water production. The high water uptake by&#160;salt&#8208;based sorbents makes them attractive for AWH, especially in arid environments. However, they often have relatively high desorption heat, rendering water release an energy&#8208;intensive process. A &#160;LiCl&#8208;incorporating polyacrylamide hydrogel (PAM&#8211;LiCl)&#160;capable of effective moisture harvesting from arid environments is proposed. The interactions between the hydrophilic hydrogel network and the captured water generate more free and weakly bonded water, significantly lowering the desorption heat compared with conventional neat salt sorbents. Benefiting from the affinity for swelling of the polymer backbones, the developed PAM&#8211;LiCl achieves a high water uptake of &#8776;1.1&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20%&#160;RH with fast sorption kinetics of &#8776;0.008&#160;g g&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1&#160;and further demonstrates a daily water yield up to &#8776;7&#160;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at this condition. These findings provide a new pathway for the synthesis of materials with efficient water absorption/desorption properties, to reach energy&#8208;efficient water release for AWH in arid climates.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Assisted In Situ Recrystallization for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable crystallization is particularly significant for tin perovskites because their fast crystallization rate usually causes high trap density and low photoluminescence quantum efficiency, thus resulting in low light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) efficiencies. In this work, a vapor&#8208;assisted spin&#8208;coating technique is developed to retard crystallization and improve the external quantum efficiency of tin perovskite LEDs up to 5.3%.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskites are a promising candidates to replace their toxic lead&#8208;based counterparts in optoelectronic applications, such as light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the development of tin perovskite LEDs is slow due to the challenge of obtaining high&#8208;quality tin perovskite films. Here, a vapor&#8208;assisted spin&#8208;coating method is developed to achieve high&#8208;quality tin perovskites and high&#8208;efficiency LEDs. It is revealed that solvent vapor can lead to in situ recrystallization of tin perovskites during the film&#8208;formation process, thus significantly improving the crystalline quality with reduced defects. An antioxidant additive is further introduced to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ and increase the photoluminescence quantum efficiency up to &#8776;30%, which is an approximately fourfold enhancement in comparison with that of the control method. As a result, efficient tin perovskite LEDs are achieved with a peak external quantum efficiency of 5.3%, which is among the highest efficiency of lead&#8208;free perovskite LEDs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;ion batteries are a typical electrochemical system controlled by ion&#8208;insertion dynamics. The recent progress on the investigation of battery dynamics at various scales is reviewed, via newly developed visualization techniques that provide powerful tools to make the &#8220;black&#8208;box&#8221; into a &#8220;see&#8208;through&#8221; battery.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries, the most&#8208;popular secondary battery, are typically electrochemical systems controlled by ion&#8208;insertion dynamics. The battery dynamics involve mass transport, charge transfer, ion&#8211;electron coupled reactions, electrolyte penetration, ion solvation, and interfacial evolution. However, it is difficult for the traditional electrochemical methods to capture the accurate and individual details of the dynamic processes in &#8220;black box&#8221; batteries; instead, only the net result of multi&#8208;factors on the whole scale. Recently, different advanced visualization techniques have been developed, which provide powerful tools to track and monitor the internal real&#8208;time dynamic processes, giving intuitive details and fine information at various scales from crystal lattice, single particle, electrode to cell level. Here, the recent progress on the investigation of electrochemical dynamics in battery materials are reviewed, via developed techniques across wide timescales and space&#8208;scales, including the dynamic process inside the active particle, kinetics issues at the electrode/electrolyte interface, dynamic inhomogeneity in the electrode, and dynamic transportation at the cell level. Finally, the fundamental principles to improve the battery dynamics are summarized and new technologies for future more stringent conditions are highlighted. In prospect, this review opens sight on the battery interior for a clearer, deeper, and more thorough understanding of the dynamics.

         <title>Heteroepitaxial Growth of B5&#8208;Site&#8208;Rich Ru Nanoparticles Guided by Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Low&#8208;Temperature Ammonia Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active Ru catalyst with abundant active sites for ammonia dehydrogenation, which is essential for utilizing ammonia as a hydrogen carrier, is prepared by a novel synthesis method. A highly active Ru catalyst with a unique atomic structure is designed to induce the formation of hexagonal planar&#8208;shaped Ru nanoparticles with abundant B5 sites by utilizing 2D hexagonal boron nitride as a template support.








Abstract
Ruthenium is one of the most active catalysts for ammonia dehydrogenation and is essential for the use of ammonia as a hydrogen storage material. The B5&#8208;type site on the surface of ruthenium is expected to exhibit the highest catalytic activity for ammonia dehydrogenation, but the number of these sites is typically low. Here, a B5&#8208;site&#8208;rich ruthenium catalyst is synthesized by exploiting the crystal symmetry of a hexagonal boron nitride support. In the prepared ruthenium catalyst, ruthenium nanoparticles are formed epitaxially on hexagonal boron nitride sheets with hexagonal planar morphologies, in which the B5 sites predominate along the nanoparticle edges. By activating the catalyst under the reaction condition, the population of B5 sites further increases as the facets of the ruthenium nanoparticles develop. The electron density of the Ru nanoparticles also increases during catalyst activation. The synthesized catalyst shows superior catalytic activity for ammonia dehydrogenation compared to previously reported catalysts. This work demonstrates that morphology control of a catalyst via support&#8208;driven heteroepitaxy can be exploited for synthesizing highly active heterogeneous catalysts with tailored atomic structures.

         <title>Efficient and Stable 3D/2D Perovskite Solar Cells through Vertical Heterostructures with (BA)4AgBiBr8 Nanosheets</title>

Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have drawn great attention due to their high processability and superior photovoltaic properties. However, their further development is often hindered by severe non&#8208;radiative recombination at interfaces that decreases power conversion efficiency (PCE). To this end, we developed a facile strategy to construct a 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to reduce the energy loss in PVSCs. The heterostructure was contrived through the van der Waal integration of 2D perovskite ((BA)4AgBiBr8) nanosheets onto the surface of 3D FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites. The large bandgap of (BA)4AgBiBr8 enables the formation of type I heterojunction with 3D FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites, which serves as a barrier to suppress the trap&#8208;assisted recombination at the interface. As a result, a satisfying PCE of 24.48% was achieved with an improved open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.13&#160;V to 1.17&#160;V. Moreover, the 2D perovskite nanosheets could effectively mitigate the iodide ion diffusion from perovskite to the metal electrode, hence enhancing the device stability. 3D/2D architectured devices retained &#8764;90% of their initial PCE under continuous illumination or heating after 1000 hours, which are superior to 3D&#8208;based devices. This work provides an effective and controllable strategy to construct 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to simultaneously boost the efficiency and stability of PVSCs.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Anode&#8208;less All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries via the Conversion Reaction of Metal Fluorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) that employ anode&#8208;less electrodes have drawn attention from across the battery community because they offer competitive energy densities and a markedly improved cycle life. Nevertheless, the composite matrices of anode&#8208;less electrodes impose a substantial barrier for lithium ion diffusion and inhibit operation at room temperature. To overcome this drawback, here, we exploit the conversion reaction of metal fluorides because metallic nanodomains formed during this reaction induce an alloying reaction with lithium ions for uniform and sustainable lithium (de)plating. Lithium fluoride (LiF), another product of the conversion reaction, prevents the agglomeration of the metallic nanodomains and also protects the electrode from fatal lithium dendrite growth. A systematic analysis identified silver fluoride (AgF) as the most suitable metal fluoride because the silver nanodomains can accommodate the solid&#8208;solution mechanism with a low nucleation overpotential. AgF&#8208;based full&#8208;cells attain reliable cycling at 25&#176;C even with an exceptionally high areal capacity of 9.7 mAh cm&#8208;2 (areal loading of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 = 50&#160;mg cm&#8210;2). These results offer useful insights into designing materials for anode&#8208;less electrodes for sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs.

         <title>Dynamic Liquid Metal Catalysts for Boosted Lithium Polysulfides Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Designing efficient electrocatalysts with high electro&#8208;conductivity, strong chemisorption, and superior catalytical efficiency to realize rapid kinetics of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion process is crucial for practical lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery applications. Unfortunately, most current electrocatalysts cannot maintain long&#8208;term stability due to the possible failure of catalytic sites. Herein, we report a novel dynamic electrocatalytic strategy with the liquid metal (i.e., gallium&#8208;tin, EGaSn) to facilitate LiPSs redox reaction. The combined theoretical simulations and microstructure experiment analysis reveal that Sn atoms dynamically distributed in the liquid Ga matrix act as the main active catalytic center. Meanwhile, Ga provides a uniquely dynamic environment to maintain the long&#8208;term integrity of the catalytic system. With the participation of EGaSn, a tailor&#8208;made 2 Ah Li&#8208;S pouch cell with a specific energy density of 307.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is realized. This work opens up new opportunities for liquid phase binary alloys as electrocatalysts for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Edge&#8208;site Engineering of Defective Fe&#8208;N4 nanozymes with Boosted Catalase&#8208;like Performance for Retinal Vasculopathies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Extensive efforts have been devoted to refining metal sites for optimizing the catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SANzymes), while the contribution of the defect environment neighboring metal sites lacks attention. Herein, an iron&#8208;based SANzyme (Fe&#8208;SANzyme) is rationally designed by edge&#8208;site engineering, which intensively exposes edge&#8208;hosted defective Fe&#8208;N4 atomic sites anchored in hierarchical mesoporous structures. The Fe&#8208;SANzyme exhibits excellent catalase&#8208;like activity capable of efficiently catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 and H2O, with a catalytic kinetic KM value superior to that of natural catalase and reported nanozymes. The mechanistic studies depict that the defects introduce notable charge transfer from the Fe atom to the carbon matrix, making the central Fe more activated to strengthen the interaction with H2O2 and weaken the O&#8208;O bond. By performing catalase&#8208;like catalysis, the Fe&#8208;SANzyme significantly scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviates oxidative stress, thus eliminating the pathological angiogenesis in animal models of retinal vasculopathies without affecting the repair of normal vessels. This work provides a new way to refine SANzymes by engineering the defect environment and geometric structure around metal sites, and demonstrates the potential therapeutic effects of the nanozyme on retinal vasculopathies.

         <title>Atomically Thin Synapse Networks on Van Der Waals Photo&#8208;Memtransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report a new type of an atomically thin synaptic network on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, where each ultra&#8208;small cell (&#8764; 2&#160;nm thick) built with trilayer WS2 semiconductor acts as a gate&#8208;tunable photoactive synapse, i.e., a photo&#8208;memtransistor. A train of ultraviolet (UV) pulses onto the WS2 memristor generates dopants in atomic&#8208;level precision by direct light&#8208;lattice interactions, along with the gate&#8208;tunability, leading to the accurate modulation of the channel conductance for potentiation and depression of the synaptic cells. Such synaptic dynamics can be explained by a parallel atomistic resistor network model. In addition, we show that such device scheme can generally be realized in other two&#8208;dimensional vdW semiconductors, such as MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2 and WSe2. Demonstration of our atomically thin photo&#8208;memtransistor arrays, where the synaptic weights can be tuned for the atomistic defect density, provides implications for a new type of artificial neural networks for parallel matrix computations with an ultra&#8208;high integration density.

         <title>Approaching The External Quantum Efficiency Limit in two&#8208;Dimensional Photovoltaic Devices</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for realizing ultrathin and high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of most 2D photovoltaic devices face great challenge in exceeding 50% and 3% due to the low efficiency of photo&#8208;carrier separation and collection. Here, we demonstrate photovoltaic devices with defect&#8208;free interface and recombination&#8208;free channel based on 2D WS2, showing high EQE of 92% approaching the theoretical limit and high PCE of 5.0%. The high performances are attributed to the van der Waals (vdW) metal contact without interface defects and Fermi&#8208;level pinning, and the fully depleted channel without photo&#8208;carrier recombination, leading to intrinsic photo&#8208;carrier separation and collection with high efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our strategy can be extended to other TMDs such as MoSe2 and WSe2 with EQE of 92% and 94%, respectively. This work proposes a universal strategy for building high&#8208;performance 2D photovoltaic devices. The nearly&#8208;ideal EQE provides great potential for PCE approaching the S&#8208;Q limit.

         <title>3D Printing Flexible Sodium Ion Micro&#8208;batteries with Ultrahigh Areal Capacity and Robust Rate Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Rechargeable sodium ion micro&#8208;batteries (NIMBs) constructed using low&#8208;cost and abundant raw materials in planar configuration with both cathode and anode on the same substrate, hold promises for powering coplanar microelectronics, but are hindered by the low areal capacity owing to thin microelectrodes. Here, a prototype of planar and flexible 3D&#8208;printed NIMBs is demonstrated with three&#8208;dimensionally interconnected conductive thick microelectrodes for ultrahigh areal capacity and boosted rate capability. Rationally optimized 3D printable inks with appropriate viscosities and high conductivity allowed the multi&#8208;layer printing of NIMB electrodes reaching a very high thickness of &#8764;1200&#160;&#956;m while maintaining effective ion and electron transfer pathways in them. Consequently, the 3D&#8208;printed NIMBs deliver superior areal capacity of 4.5 mAh cm&#8211;2 (2&#160;mA cm&#8211;2), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art printed micro&#8208;batteries. The NIMBs showed enhanced rate capability with 3.6 mAh cm&#8211;2 at 40&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and robust long&#8208;term cycle life up to 6000 cycles. Furthermore, the planar NIMB microelectrodes despite the large thickness exhibit decent mechanical flexibility under various bending conditions. This work opens a new avenue for construction of high&#8208;performance NIMBs with thick microelectrodes capable of powering flexible microelectronics.

         <title>Revival of Ferroelectric Memories Based on Emerging Fluorite&#8208;Structured Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Over the last few decades, the research on ferroelectric memories has been limited due to their dimensional scalability and incompatibility with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The discovery of ferroelectricity in fluorite&#8208;structured oxides revived interest in the research on ferroelectric memories, with inducing nanoscale nonvolatility in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gate insulators by minute doping and thermal treatment. The potential of this approach has been demonstrated by the fabrication of sub&#8208;30&#160;nm electronic devices. Nonetheless, to realize practical applications, various technical limitations, such as insufficient reliability including endurance, retention, and imprint, as well as large device&#8208;to&#8208;device&#8208;variation, require urgent solutions. Furthermore, such limitations should be considered based on targeting devices as well as applications. Various types of ferroelectric memories including ferroelectric random&#8208;access&#8208;memory, ferroelectric field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistor, and ferroelectric tunnel junction should be considered for classical nonvolatile memories as well as emerging neuromorphic computing and processing&#8208;in&#8208;memory. Therefore, from the viewpoint of materials science, this review covers the recent research focusing on the ferroelectric memories from the history of conventional approaches to the future prospects.

         <title>Eliminating Micropore Confinement Effect of Carbonaceous Electrode for Promoting Zn&#8208;Ion Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs) is promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage by integrating the attributes of supercapacitors and zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the insufficient Zn2+ storage active sites of carbonaceous cathode materials and the mismatch of pore sizes with charge carriers led to unsatisfactory Zn2+ storage capability. Herein, we&#160; report new insights for boosting Zn2+ storage capability of activated nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon materials (ANHPC&#8208;x) by effectively eliminating micropore confinement effect and synchronously elevate the utilization of active sites. Therefore, the best&#8208;performed ANHPC&#8208;2 delivers impressive electrochemical properties for ZICs in terms of excellent capacity (199.1 mAh g&#8722;1), energy density (155.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), and durability (65000 cycles). Systematic ex situ&#160; characterizations together with in situ&#160; electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and Raman spectra measurements manifest that the remarkable electrochemical performance is assigned to the synergism of Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8722; co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and reversible chemical adsorption. Furthermore, the ANHPC&#8208;2&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZIC demonstrates excellent electrochemical capability with ultralong lifespan up to 100 000 cycles. This work not only provides a promising strategy to improve the Zn2+ storage capability of carbonaceous materials but also sheds lights on charge storge mechanism and advanced electrode materials design for ZICs toward practical applications.

         <title>Balanced interfacial ion concentration and migration steric hindrance promoting high&#8208;efficiency deposition/dissolution battery chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;liquid transition reaction lays the foundation of many electrochemical energy storage systems with high capacity, but realizing high efficiency of this reaction remain a challenge. Herein, in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics, this work demonstrates the significant role of both interfacial H+ ion concentration and Mn2+ ion migration steric hindrance for the high&#8208;efficiency deposition/dissolution chemistry of zinc&#8208;manganese batteries. Specially, the introduction of formate anions can buffer the generated interfacial H+ to stabilize interfacial potential according to the Nernst equation, which stimulates high capacity. Compared with acetate and propionate anions, formate anion also provides high adsorption density on cathode surface due to the small spatial hindrance, which can shield the electrostatic repulsion during the process of Mn2+ migration at the interface. Particularly for the desolvation of interfacial Mn2+ ions, the formate anion&#8208;induced lower energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during the step&#8208;by&#8208;step desolvation process results in the lower polarization and higher electrochemical reversibility for MnO2/Mn2+ deposition/dissolution chemistry. The in&#8208;situ tests and theoretical calculations verify that the electrolyte with formate anions achieved a good balance between ion concentration and ion migration steric hindrance. It exhibits both the high energy density of 531.26&#160;W h kg&#8211;1 and long cycle life of more than 300 cycles without obvious decay. This work points out a promising way for the interface design of practical energy storage system based on solid&#8208;liquid interfacial transition reaction with high energy density.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic&#8208;Ferromagnetic Heterostructure&#8208;based Field&#8208;Free Terahertz Emitters</title>

Abstract
Recently, ferromagnetic heterostructure spintronic terahertz (THz) emitters have been recognized as one of the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation THz sources, owing to their peculiarities of high efficiency, high stability, low cost, ultrabroad bandwidth, controllable polarization, and high scalability. Despite the substantial efforts, they rely on external magnetic fields to initiate the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion, which hitherto greatly limits its proliferation as practical devices. Here, we innovate a unique antiferromagnetic&#8208;ferromagnetic (IrMn3|CoFeB) heterostructure and demonstrate that it can efficiently generate THz radiation without any external magnetic field. We assign it to the exchange bias or interfacial exchange coupling effect and enhanced anisotropy. By precisely balancing the exchange bias effect and the enhanced THz radiation efficiency, an optimized 5.6&#8208;nm&#8208;thick IrMn3|CoFeB|W tri&#8208;layer heterostructure is successfully realized, yielding an intensity surpassing that of Pt|CoFeB|W. Moreover, the intensity of THz emission is further boosted by togethering the tri&#8208;layer sample and bi&#8208;layer sample Besides, the THz polarization may be flexibly controlled by rotating the sample azimuthal angle, manifesting sophisticated active THz field manipulation capability. The field&#8208;free coherent THz emission we demonstrate here shines light on the development of spintronic THz optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Technological breakthroughs in chip fabrication, transfer, and color conversion for high performance micro&#8208;LED display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The implementation of high efficiency and high&#8208;resolution displays has been the focus of considerable research interest. Recently, micro&#8208;LEDs, which are inorganic light&#8208;emitting diodes of size less than 100 &#956;m2, have emerged as a promising display technology owing to their superior features and advantages over other displays like liquid crystal displays and organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Although many companies have introduced micro&#8208;LED displays since 2012, obstacles to mass production still exist. Three major challenges, i.e., low quantum efficiency, time consuming transfer, and complex color conversion, have been overcome with technological breakthroughs to realize cost&#8208;effective micro&#8208;LED displays. In the review, methods for improving the degraded quantum efficiency of GaN based micro&#8208;LEDs induced by the size effect are examined, including wet chemical treatment, passivation layer adoption, LED structure design, and growing LEDs in self&#8208;passivated structures. Novel transfer technologies, including pick&#8208;up transfer and self&#8208;assembly methods, for developing large&#8208;area micro&#8208;LED displays with high yield and reliability are discussed in depth. Quantum dots as color conversion materials for high color purity, and deposition methods such as electrohydrodynamic jet printing or contact printing on micro&#8208;LEDs have also been addressed. This review presents current status and critical challenges of micro&#8208;LED technology and promising technical breakthroughs for commercialization of high performance displays.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Nanoradiosensitizer Enhances Radiotherapy and Delivers STING Agonists to Potentiate Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Despite potent preclinical antitumor activity, activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) has shown modest therapeutic effects in clinical studies. Many STING agonists including 2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) show poor pharmacokinetic properties for sustaining STING activation in tumors and achieving optimal antitumor efficacy. Improved delivery of STING agonists and their effective combination with other treatments are needed to enhance their therapeutic effects. Herein, we report a two&#8208;dimensional nanoplatform, cGAMP/MOL, via conjugating cGAMP to a nanoscale metal&#8208;organic layer (MOL) for simultaneous STING activation and radiosensitization. The MOL not only exhibits strong radiosensitization effects for enhanced cancer killing and induction of immunogenic cell death, but also retains cGAMP in tumors for sustained STING activation. Compared to free cGAMP, cGAMP/MOL elicits stronger STING activation and regresses local tumors upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Further combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor bridges innate and adaptive immune systems by activating the tumor microenvironment to elicit systemic antitumor responses.

         <title>Recent Progress in Strain Engineering on Van der Waals 2D Materials: Tunable Electrical, Electrochemical, Magnetic and Optical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Strain engineering is a promising way to tune the electrical, electrochemical, magnetic, and optical properties of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, with the potential to achieve high&#8208;performance 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices ultimately. This review discusses the experimental and theoretical results from recent advances in the strain engineering of 2D materials. We summarize some novel methods to induce strain and then highlight the tunable electrical, and optical/optoelectronic properties of 2D materials via strain engineering including particularly the previously less discussed strain tuning of superconducting, magnetic, and electrochemical properties. Also, the future perspectives of strain engineering are given for its potential applications in functional devices. The state of the survey presents the ever&#8208;increasing advantages and popularity of strain engineering for tuning properties of 2D materials. It provides suggestions and insights for further research and applications in optical, electronic, and spintronic devices.

         <title>Mechanically Active Materials and Devices for Bio&#8208;Interfaced Pressure Sensors &#8211; A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pressures generated by external forces or by internal body processes represent parameters of critical importance in diagnosing physiological health and in anticipating injuries. Examples span intracranial hypertension from traumatic brain injuries, high blood pressure from poor diet, pressure&#8208;induced skin ulcers from immobility, and edema from congestive heart failure. Pressures measured on the soft surfaces of vital organs or within internal cavities of the body can provide essential insights into patient status and progression. Challenges lie in the development of high&#8208;performance pressure sensors that can softly interface with biological tissues to enable safe monitoring for extended periods of time. This review focuses on recent advances in mechanically active materials and structural designs for classes of soft pressure sensors that have some proven uses in these contexts. The discussions include applications of such sensors as implantable and wearable systems, with various unique capabilities in wireless continuous monitoring, minimally invasive deployment, natural degradation in biofluids and/or multiplexed spatiotemporal mapping. A concluding section summarizes challenges and future opportunities for this growing field of materials and biomedical research.

         <title>Reversible phase transition for durable formamidinium&#8208;dominated perovskite photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phase instability (especially phase transition) is one of the major obstacles to the wide application of formamidinium (FA)&#8208;dominated perovskite solar cells (PSCs). An in&#8208;depth investigation on relevant phase transition kinetics is urgently needed to explore more effective phase stabilization strategies. Herein for the first time, we monitored the reversible phase transition process of FA1&#8211;xCsxPbI3 perovskite between photoactive phase (&#945; phase) and non&#8208;photoactive phase (&#948; phase) under humidity, as well as the reversible healing of the degraded devices. Moreover, through in&#8208;situ atomic force microscope (AFM) characterization, the kinetic transition between &#945; and &#948; phase was revealed to be the &#8220;nucleation&#8211;growth transition&#8221; process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was employed to analyze the thermodynamic origin of phase transition, where the driving force for &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#948; transition was associated with configurational enthalpy, while the &#948;&#8208;to&#8208;&#945; transition was dominated by the temperature&#8208;related vibrational entropy. The &#945; phase of FA1&#8211;xCsxPbI3 could be finally stabilized at elevated temperature (e.g., 60&#176;C) under high humidity due to the increased nucleation barrier, and the resulting non&#8208;encapsulated PSCs retained over 90% of their initial efficiency after aging at 60&#176;C and 60% relative humidity (RH) for 1000 hours. Our finding provided a deepened understanding on the phase transition process of FA1&#8211;xCsxPbI3 from both thermodynamics and kinetics points of view, which also presented an effective means to stabilize the &#945; phase of FA&#8208;dominated perovskites and devices for practical applications.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was employed to analyze the thermodynamic origin of phase transition, where the driving force for &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-to-&lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt; transition was associated with configurational enthalpy, while the &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;-to-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt; transition was dominated by the temperature-related vibrational entropy. The &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt; phase of FA&lt;sub&gt;1&#8211;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cs&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; could be finally stabilized at elevated temperature (e.g., 60&#176;C) under high humidity due to the increased nucleation barrier, and the resulting non-encapsulated PSCs retained over 90% of their initial efficiency after aging at 60&#176;C and 60% relative humidity (RH) for 1000 hours. Our finding provided a deepened understanding on the phase transition process of FA&lt;sub&gt;1&#8211;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cs&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from both thermodynamics and kinetics points of view, which also presented an effective means to stabilize the &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt; phase of FA-dominated perovskites and devices for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Filler&#8208;Integrated Composite Polymer Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) utilizing fillers as the promoting component bridge the gap between solid polymer electrolytes and inorganic solid electrolytes. The integration of fillers into the polymer matrices has been demonstrated as a prevailing strategy to enhance Li&#8208;ion transport and assist in constructing Li+&#8208;conducting electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface layer, which addresses the two key barriers of solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs): low ionic conductivity of electrolyte and high interfacial impedance. Recent review articles have largely focused on the performance of a broad spectrum of CPEs and the general effects of fillers on SSLBs device. Recognizing this, in this review, after briefly presenting the categories of fillers (traditional and emerged) and the promoted ionic conducting mechanisms in CPEs, we seek to assess the progress in the interfacial structure design principle, with the emphasis on the crucial influence of filler size, concentration and hybridization strategies on filler&#8208;polymer interface that is the most critical to Li&#8208;ion transport. The latest exciting advances on filler&#8208;enabled in&#8208;situ generation of a Li+&#8208;conductive layer at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to greatly reduce the interfacial impedance are further elaborated. Finally, we discuss the challenges to be addressed, outline research directions and provide a future vision for developing advanced CPEs for high&#8208;performing SSLBs.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles in Biosystems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic protein&#8208;mimicking properties of nanoparticles (NPs) have great potential in biological and biomedical applications. Representative categories of protein&#8208;mimicking NPs that act as mimics of enzymes, mimics of fluorescent proteins, interacting partners of specific proteins or DNA sequences, and mimics of protein scaffolds in biosystems are summarized.








Abstract
Proteins are essential elements for almost all life activities. The emergence of nanotechnology offers innovative strategies to create a diversity of nanoparticles (NPs) with intrinsic capacities of mimicking the functions of proteins. These artificial mimics are produced in a cost&#8208;efficient and controllable manner, with their protein&#8208;mimicking performances comparable or superior to those of natural proteins. Moreover, they can be endowed with additional functionalities that are absent in natural proteins, such as cargo loading, active targeting, membrane penetrating, and multistimuli responding. Therefore, protein&#8208;mimicking NPs have been utilized more and more often in biosystems for a wide range of applications including detection, imaging, diagnosis, and therapy. To highlight recent progress in this broad field, herein, representative protein&#8208;mimicking NPs that fall into one of the four distinct categories are summarized: mimics of enzymes (nanozymes), mimics of fluorescent proteins, NPs with high affinity binding to specific proteins or DNA sequences, and mimics of protein scaffolds. This review covers their subclassifications, characteristic features, functioning mechanisms, as well as the extensive exploitation of their great potential for biological and biomedical purposes. Finally, the challenges and prospects in future development of protein&#8208;mimicking NPs are discussed.

         <title>Herpesvirus&#8208;Mimicking DNAzyme&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles as a Mitochondrial DNA Stress Inducer to Activate Innate Immunity for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herpesvirus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (Vir&#8208;ZM@TD) that activate antitumor innate immunity are reported. DNAzyme&#8208;loaded manganese&#8209;doped zeolitic imidazolate frameworks&#8209;90 (ZIF&#8208;90) nanoparticles (ZM@TD) mimic the virus nucleocapsid containing the genome; the erythrocyte membrane mimics the viral envelope; and two functional peptides, RGD and HA2 peptides, resemble the surface glycoprotein spikes of herpesvirus. The system effectively primes cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated innate immunity with 68% complete regression of primary tumors and extends the median survival time of 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice by 32 days.








Abstract
Virus&#8208;based immunotherapy is a promising approach to treat tumor. Closely mimicking the structure and sequential infection processes of natural viruses is highly desirable for effective tumor immunotherapy but remains challenging. Here, inspired by the robust innate immunity induced by herpesvirus, a herpesvirus&#8208;mimicking nanoparticle (named Vir&#8208;ZM@TD) is engineered for tumor therapy by mimicking the structure and infection processes of herpesvirus. In this biomimetic system, DNAzyme&#8208;loaded manganese&#8209;doped zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8209;90 (ZIF&#8208;90) nanoparticles (ZM@TD) mimic the virus nucleocapsid containing the genome; the erythrocyte membrane mimics the viral envelope; and two functional peptides, RGD and HA2 peptides, resemble the surface glycoprotein spikes of herpesvirus. Vir&#8208;ZM@TD can both effectively evade rapid clearance in the blood circulation and closely mimic the serial infection processes of herpesvirus, including specific tumor targeting, membrane fusion&#8208;mediated endosomal escape, and TFAM (transcription factor A, mitochondrial) deficiency&#8208;triggered mitochondrial DNA stress, as well as the release of manganese ions (Mn2+) from organelles into the cytosol, ultimately effectively priming cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated innate immunity with 68% complete regression of primary tumors and extending by 32 days the median survival time of 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Scale Integration Design of Sn&#8208;ZnO Catalyst Towards Efficient and Stable CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO is a potential sustainable strategy for alleviating CO2 emissions and producing valuable fuels. In the quest to resolve its current problems of low energy efficiency and insufficient durability, we propose a dual&#8208;scale design strategy by implanting non&#8208;noble active Sn&#8208;ZnO heterointerface inside the nanopores of high&#8208;surface&#8208;area carbon nanospheres (Sn&#8208;ZnO@HC). The metal d&#8208;bandwidth tuning of Sn and ZnO alters the extent of substrate&#8208;molecule orbital mixing, facilitating the break of the *COOH intermediate and the yield of CO. Furthermore, the confinement effect of tailored nanopores results in beneficial pH distribution in the local environment around the Sn&#8208;ZnO nanoparticles and protects them against leaching and aggregating. Through integrating electronic and nanopore scale control, Sn&#8208;ZnO@HC achieves a quite low potential of &#8208;0.53&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode with 91% Faradaic efficiency for CO and ultralong stability of 240 hours. This work provides proof of concept for the multiscale design of electrocatalysts.

In the quest to resolve its current problems of low energy efficiency and insufficient durability, we propose a dual-scale design strategy by implanting non-noble active Sn-ZnO heterointerface inside the nanopores of high-surface-area carbon nanospheres (Sn-ZnO@HC). The metal d-bandwidth tuning of Sn and ZnO alters the extent of substrate-molecule orbital mixing, facilitating the break of the *COOH intermediate and the yield of CO. Furthermore, the confinement effect of tailored nanopores results in beneficial pH distribution in the local environment around the Sn-ZnO nanoparticles and protects them against leaching and aggregating. Through integrating electronic and nanopore scale control, Sn-ZnO@HC achieves a quite low potential of -0.53&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode with 91% Faradaic efficiency for CO and ultralong stability of 240 hours. This work provides proof of concept for the multiscale design of electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Unlocking Interfacial Electron Transfer of Ruthenium Phosphides by Homologous Core&#8211;Shell Design toward Efficient Hydrogen Evolution and Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A system where homologous core&#8211;shell RuP@RuP2 nanoparticles are well dispersed on functional carbon nanosheets (RuP@RuP2/C) is synthesized via a phosphatization&#8208;controlled phase&#8208;transformation strategy. The emergent interfacial functionality enables very efficient electron transfer from the RuP core to the RuP2 shell, leading to accelerated hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics of RuP@RuP2/C toward high&#8208;efficiency alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation, which are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions (HER/HOR) in alkaline electrolytes is of critical importance for realizing renewable hydrogen technologies. Ruthenium phosphides (RuPx) are promising candidates to substitute Pt&#8208;based electrodes; however, great challenges still remain in their electronic structure regulation for optimizing intermediate adsorption. Herein, it is reported that a homologous RuP@RuP2 core&#8211;shell architecture constructed by a phosphatization&#8208;controlled phase&#8208;transformation strategy enables strong electron coupling for optimal intermediate adsorption by virtue of the emergent interfacial functionality. Density functional theory calculations show that the RuP core and RuP2 shell present efficient electron transfer, leading to a close to thermoneutral hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy of 0.04&#160;eV. Impressively, the resulting material exhibits superior HER/HOR activities in alkaline media, which outperform the benchmark Pt/C and are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts. The present work not only provides an efficient and cost&#8208;effective bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalyst, but also offers a new synthetic protocol to rationally synthesize homologous core&#8211;shell nanostructures for widespread applications.

&lt;p&gt;A system where homologous core&#8211;shell RuP@RuP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles are well dispersed on functional carbon nanosheets (RuP@RuP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C) is synthesized via a phosphatization-controlled phase-transformation strategy. The emergent interfacial functionality enables very efficient electron transfer from the RuP core to the RuP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shell, leading to accelerated hydrogen adsorption/desorption kinetics of RuP@RuP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/C toward high-efficiency alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation, which are among the best reported bifunctional hydrogen electrocatalysts.

         <title>Potassium&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Intrinsic Defects in Porous Carbons for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fabrication of intrinsic carbon defects is usually tangled with doping effects, and the identification of their unique roles in catalysis remains a tough task. Herein, a K+&#8208;assisted synthetic strategy is developed to afford porous carbon (K&#8208;defect&#8208;C) with abundant intrinsic defects and complete elimination of heteroatom via direct pyrolysis of K+&#8208;confined metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF). The positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurement and scanning transmission electron microscopy jointly illustrate the existence of abundant 12&#8208;vacancy&#8208;type carbon defects (V12) in K&#8208;defect&#8208;C. Remarkably, the K&#8208;defect&#8208;C achieves ultrahigh CO Faradaic efficiency (99%) at &#8208;0.45&#160;V in CO2 electroreduction, far surpassing MOF&#8208;derived carbon without K+ etching. Theoretical calculations reveal that the V12 defects in K&#8208;defect&#8208;C favor the CO2 adsorption and significantly accelerate the formation of rate&#8208;determining COOH* intermediate, thereby promoting CO2 reduction. This work develops a novel strategy to generate intrinsic carbon defects and provides new insights into their critical role in catalysis.

         <title>MOF&#8208;Based Chemiresistive Gas Sensors: Toward New Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The sensing performances of gas sensors must be improved and diversified to enhance the quality of life by ensuring health, safety, and convenience. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which exhibit an extremely high surface area, abundant porosity, and unique surface chemistry, provide a promising framework for facilitating gas sensor innovations. Enhanced understanding of conduction mechanisms of MOFs has facilitated their use as gas sensing materials, and various types of MOFs have been developed by examining the compositional and morphological dependences and implementing catalyst incorporation and light activation. Owing to their inherent separation and absorption properties and catalytic activity, MOFs have been applied as molecular sieves, absorptive filtering layers, and heterogeneous catalysts. In addition, oxide&#8208; or carbon&#8208;based sensing materials with complex structures or catalytic composites can be derived by the appropriate post&#8208;treatment of MOFs. This review discusses the effective techniques to design optimal MOFs, in terms of computational screening and synthesis methods. Moreover, the mechanisms through which the distinctive functionalities of MOFs as sensing materials, heterostructures, and derivatives can be incorporated in gas sensor applications are presented.

         <title>Controllable Heterogenous Seeding&#8208;Induced Crystallization for High&#8208;Efficiency FAPbI3&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells Over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogenous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization is introduced to assist perovskite growth. Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl(methyl)phosphonium tetrafluoroborate is introduced into the precursor to form a low&#8208;solubility complex with PbI2, which serve as seed to induce perovskite crystallization during solvent evaporation. The hetero&#8208;SiC process is a proven effective way to manipulate the nucleation process and crystal growth, visualized by several in situ measurement tools.








Abstract
The addition of small seeding particles into a supersaturated solution is one among the most effective approaches to obtain high&#8208;quality semiconductor materials via increased crystallization rates. However, limited study is conducted on this approach for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells. Here, a new strategy&#8212;&#8220;heterogenous seeding&#8208;induced crystallization (hetero&#8208;SiC)&#8221; to assist the growth of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite&#160;is proposed. In this work, di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl(methyl)phosphonium tetrafluoroborate is directly introduced into the precursor, which forms a low&#8208;solubility complex with PbI2. The low&#8208;solubility complex can serve as the seed to induce crystallization of the perovskite during the solvent&#8208;evaporation process. Various in situ measurement&#160;tools are used to visualize the hetero&#8208;SiC process, which is shown to be an effective way of manipulating the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites. The hetero&#8208;SiC process greatly improves the film quality, reduces film defects, and suppresses nonradiative recombination. A hetero&#8208;SIC proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device exhibits outstanding performance with 24.0% power conversion efficiency (PCE), well over the control device with 22.2% PCE. Additionally, hetero&#8208;SiC perovskite solar cell (PSC) stability under light illumination is enhanced and the PSC retains 84% of its initial performance after 1400 h of light illumination.

         <title>Controllable Inverse Photoconductance in Semiconducting Nanowire Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interesting phenomenon in that Te nanowires (NWs) behave with&#160;a&#160;negative photoresponse to positive photoresponse under enlarged optical intensities from the UV to VIS&#8211;IR region is reported. The inverse photoconductance can be attributed to the competition between the photoconductive effect and oxygen desorption effect. Moreover, the influence of the size of Te NWs and their layers is also discussed.








Abstract
As a typical p&#8208;type semiconductor, tellurium (Te) has been widely studied for the construction of photodetectors. However, only the positive photoconductance of Te&#8208;based photodetectors based on the photoconductive effect has been observed in the reported literature. Herein, an unusual but interesting phenomenon, in&#160;that tellurium nanowires (NWs) behave with&#160;negative photoresponse to positive photoresponse under enlarged optical intensities from the UV to VIS&#8211;IR region is reported. According to the experiments and simulations, adsorbed oxygen on the surface of Te NWs plays a significant role in the abnormal photoresponse. The inverse photoconductance can be attributed to the competition between the photoconductive effect and the oxygen desorption effect. Moreover, the influence of the size and layers of Te NWs is also discussed. This inverse photoconductance phenomenon is further explored by introducing the Te&#8211;Au heterojunction system. Hot&#8208;electron injection at the Te&#8211;Au heterojunction interface induces a more obvious tendency to behave with a negative photoresponse. These findings will be beneficial for potential applications of Te&#8208;NW&#8208;based photodetectors.

         <title>Microstructured BN composites with internally designed high thermal conductivity paths for 3D electronic packaging</title>

Abstract
Miniaturized and high&#8208;power density 3D electronic devices pose new challenges on thermal management. Indeed, prompt heat dissipation in electrically insulating packaging is currently limited by the thermal conductivity achieved by thermal interface materials (TIMs) and by their capability to direct the heat towards heat sinks. Here, we create high thermal conductivity BN&#8208;based composites able to conduct heat intentionally towards specific areas by locally orienting magnetically functionalized BN microplatelets using magnetically assisted slip casting (MASC). The obtained thermal conductivity along the direction of alignment is unusually high, up to 12.1&#160;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 thanks to a high concentration of 62.6 vol% of BN in the composite, a low concentration in polymeric binder and a high degree of alignment. The BN composites have a low density of 1.3&#160;g cm&#8211;3, a high stiffness of 442.3&#160;MPa and are electrically insulating. Uniquely, we demonstrate our approach with proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept composites having locally graded orientations of BN microplatelets to direct the heat away from two vertically stacked heat sources. Rationally designing the microstructure of TIMs to direct heat strategically provides a promising solution for efficient thermal management in 3D integrated electronics.

         <title>Enhanced Photoconductivity at Dislocations in SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dislocations can boost the photoconductivity in oxide semiconductors. Well&#8208;ordered, high&#8208;density dislocation arrays dedicatedly produced in Fe&#8208;doped SrTiO3 single crystals show manyfold increased photoconductivity in the regions around dislocation compared to the dislocation free regions of the sample.








Abstract
Dislocations are 1D crystallographic line defects and are usually seen as detrimental to the functional properties of classic semiconductors. It is shown here that this not necessarily accounts for oxide semiconductors in which dislocations are capable of boosting the photoconductivity. Strontium titanate single crystals are controllably deformed to generate a high density of ordered dislocations of two slip systems possessing different mesoscopic arrangements. For both slip systems, nanoscale conductive atomic force microscope investigations reveal a strong enhancement of the photoconductivity around the dislocation cores. Macroscopic in&#8208;plane measurements indicate that the two dislocation systems result in different global photoconductivity behavior despite the similar local enhancement. Depending on the arrangement, the global photoresponse can be increased by orders of magnitude. Additionally, indications for a bulk photovoltaic effect enabled by dislocation&#8208;surrounding strain fields are observed for the first time. This proves that dislocations in oxide semiconductors can be of large interest for tailoring photoelectric functionalities. Direct evidence that electronic transport is confined to the dislocation core points to a new emerging research field.

         <title>Three&#8208;Tier Hierarchical Structures for Extreme Pool Boiling Heat Transfer Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extreme pool boiling performance is achieved by manipulating liquid&#8211;vapor transport at three length scales by engineering surface structures: 1) at millimeter scale, bubble coalescence is minimized and the complete capillary wicking is exploited with separated nucleation sites, 2) at micrometer scale, microcavities promote vapor nucleation, and 3) at nanometer scale, nanostructures extend the liquid&#8211;vapor interface for enhanced evaporation.








Abstract
Boiling is an effective energy&#8208;transfer process with substantial utility in energy applications. Boiling performance is described mainly by the heat&#8208;transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF). Recent efforts for the simultaneous enhancement of HTC and CHF have been limited by an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between them&#8212;HTC enhancement requires high nucleation&#8208;site density, which can increase bubble coalescence resulting in limited CHF enhancement. In this work, this trade&#8208;off is overcome by designing three&#8208;tier hierarchical structures. The bubble coalescence is minimized to enhance the CHF by defining nucleation sites with microcavities interspersed within hemi&#8208;wicking structures. Meanwhile, the reduced nucleation&#8208;site density is compensated for by incorporating nanostructures that promote evaporation for HTC enhancement. The hierarchical structures demonstrate the simultaneous enhancement of HTC and CHF up to 389% and 138%, respectively, compared to a smooth surface. This extreme boiling performance can lead to significant energy savings in a variety of boiling applications.

         <title>Green Electrosynthesis of 5,5&#8242;&#8208;Azotetrazolate Energetic Materials Plus Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Production Using Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique coupling system for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production and green electrosynthesis of energetic materials (EMs) is developed. The coupling system displays an ultralow cell voltage of 1.35&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, representing a reduction of 410&#160;mV relative to overall water splitting. This strategy solves the problems of high&#8208;energy&#8208;consumption hydrogen production and the hazardous traditional synthesis conditions of EMs.








Abstract
Water electrolysis involves two parallel reactions, that is, oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER), in which sluggish OER is a significant limiting step that results in high energy consumption. Coupling the thermodynamically favorable electrooxidation of organic alternatives to value&#8208;added fine chemicals HER is a promising approach for the simultaneous cost&#8208;effective production of value&#8208;added chemicals and hydrogen. Here, a new coupling system for the green electrochemical synthesis of organic energetic materials (EMs) plus hydrogen production using single&#8208;atom catalysts is introduced. The catalysts are prepared by the facile galvanostatic deposition of ruthenium single atoms on the molybdenum selenide and reveal a low HER overpotential of 38.9&#160;mV at &#8722;10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in an alkaline medium. Importantly, the cell voltage of water electrolysis can be significantly reduced to only 1.35&#160;V at a current of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 by coupling water splitting with the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole to synthesize 5,5&#8242;&#8208;azotetrazolate energetic material. These materials are traditionally synthesized under harsh conditions involving a strong oxidizing agent, high&#8208;temperature conditions, and difficult separation of by&#8208;products. This study provides a green and efficient method of synthesizing organic EMs while simultaneously producing hydrogen.

         <title>Structure and Evolution of Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Hybrid Electrolytes Formed Inside Electrochemical Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state batteries created by in situ polymerization of a liquid monomer provide a path toward practical electrochemical cells in flexible form factors. In this work, the synthesis and electrochemical properties of hybrid solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes formed inside a battery cell using ring&#8208;opening polymerization of DOL&#8208;nanoparticle suspensions are reported. The electrolytes are evaluated in battery cells utilizing both intercalation and conversion cathodes.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) formed inside an electrochemical cell by polymerization of a liquid precursor provide a promising strategy for overcoming problems with electrolyte wetting in solid&#8208;state batteries. Hybrid solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (HSPEs) created by in situ polymerization of a conventional liquid precursor containing electrochemically inert nanostructures are of particular interest because they offer a mechanism for selectively reinforcing or adding&#160;new&#160;functionalities&#160;to the electrolyte&#8212;removing the need for high degrees of polymerization. The synthesis, structure, chemical kinetics,&#160;ion&#8208;transport&#160;properties&#160;and electrochemical characteristics of HSPEs created by Al(OTf)3&#8208;initiated polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) containing hairy, nano&#8208;sized SiO2&#160;particles are reported. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals the particles are well&#8208;dispersed in&#160;liquid&#160;DOL. Strong interaction between poly(ethylene glycol) molecules tethered to the SiO2&#160;particles and poly(DOL) lead to co&#8208;crystallization&#8212;anchoring the nanoparticles in their host It also enables polymerization&#8211;depolymerization processes in DOL to be studied and controlled. The utility of the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed HSPE, is demonstrated first in Li|HSPE|Cu half cells, which manifest Coulombic efficiencies (CE) values approaching 99%. HSPEs are also demonstrated in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur&#8211;polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) composite full&#8208;cell batteries. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed Li|HSPE|SPAN cells show good cycling stability and thus provide a promising path toward all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

HSPEs are also demonstrated in solid-state lithium&#8211;sulfur&#8211;polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) composite full-cell batteries. The in-situ-formed Li|HSPE|SPAN cells show good cycling stability and thus provide a promising path toward all-solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magneto&#8211;Electric&#8211;Optical Coupling in Multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;Based Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magneto&#8211;electric&#8211;optical coupling is realized in multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;based films at room temperature by engineering ferroelastic switching. The reversible ferroelastic switching is ubiquitous in BiFeO3&#8208;based films with flexible strain states and domain patterns, which is determined by the photoinduced electric field and symmetry mismatch in films. This work provides a framework for multi&#8208;field&#8208;driven magnetoelectric memories with low power consumption.








Abstract
Manipulating ferroic orders and realizing their coupling in multiferroics at room temperature are promising for designing future multifunctional devices. Single external stimulation has been extensively proved to demonstrate the ability of ferroelastic switching in multiferroic oxides, which is crucial to bridge the ferroelectricity and magnetism. However, it is still challenging to directly realize multi&#8208;field&#8208;driven magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic oxides as potential multifunctional electrical devices. Here, novel magneto&#8211;electric&#8211;optical coupling in multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;based thin films at room temperature mediated by deterministic ferroelastic switching using piezoresponse/magnetic force microscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy are shown. Reversible photoinduced ferroelastic switching exhibiting magnetoelectric responses is confirmed in BiFeO3&#8208;based films, which works at flexible strain states. This work directly demonstrates room&#8208;temperature magneto&#8211;electric&#8211;optical coupling in multiferroic films, which provides a framework for designing potential multi&#8208;field&#8208;driven magnetoelectric devices such as energy conservation memories.

         <title>Not All Aggregates Are Made the Same: Distinct Structures of Solution Aggregates Drastically Modulate Assembly Pathways, Morphology, and Electronic Properties of Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solution aggregate structures of an isoindigo&#8211;bithiophene&#8208;based polymer (PII&#8208;2T) are largely tuned by varying the solvent selectivity toward the backbone versus side chains. This results in three distinct assembly pathways and thin&#8208;film morphologies. Surprisingly, amorphous network aggregates outcompete semicrystalline ones to give rise to highly ordered and aligned morphology and enhanced charge&#8208;transport properties.








Abstract
Tuning structures of solution&#8208;state aggregation and aggregation&#8208;mediated assembly pathways of conjugated polymers is crucial for optimizing their solid&#8208;state morphology and charge&#8208;transport property. However, it remains challenging to unravel and control the exact structures of solution aggregates, let alone to modulate assembly pathways in a controlled fashion. Herein, aggregate structures of an isoindigo&#8211;bithiophene&#8208;based polymer (PII&#8208;2T) are modulated by tuning selectivity of the solvent toward the side chain versus the backbone, which leads to three distinct assembly pathways: direct crystallization from side&#8208;chain&#8208;associated amorphous aggregates, chiral liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;mediated assembly from semicrystalline aggregates with side&#8208;chain and backbone stacking, and random agglomeration from backbone&#8208;stacked semicrystalline aggregates. Importantly, it is demonstrated that the amorphous solution aggregates, compared with semicrystalline ones, lead to significantly improved alignment and reduced paracrystalline disorder in the solid state due to direct crystallization during the meniscus&#8208;guided coating process. Alignment quantified by the dichroic ratio is enhanced by up to 14&#8208;fold, and the charge&#8208;carrier mobility increases by a maximum of 20&#8208;fold in films printed from amorphous aggregates compared to those from semicrystalline aggregates. This work shows that by tuning the precise structure of solution aggregates, the assembly pathways and the resulting thin&#8208;film morphology and device properties can be drastically tuned.

         <title>Geometric Phase and Localized Heat Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological thermal metamaterials are presented. An accurate theoretical framework is established to study the geometric phase and dynamics of the thermal lattices. The topological properties of diffusive systems and localized heat diffusion protected by the topological edge states are revealed. The work can be applied to facilitate the heat dissipation of hot spots.








Abstract
Many unusual wave phenomena in artificial structures are governed by their topological properties. However, the topology of diffusion remains almost unexplored. One reason is that diffusion is fundamentally different from wave propagation because of its purely dissipative nature. The other is that the diffusion field is mostly composed of modes that extend over wide ranges, making it difficult to be rendered within the tight&#8208;binding theory as commonly employed in wave physics. Here, the above challenges are overcome and systematic studies are performed on the topology of heat diffusion. Based on a continuum model, the band structure and geometric phase are analytically obtained without using the tight&#8208;binding approximation. A deterministic parameter is found to link the geometric phase with the edge state, thereby proving the bulk&#8208;boundary correspondence for heat diffusion. The topological edge state is experimentally demonstrated as localized heat diffusion and its dependence on the boundary conditions is verified. This approach is general, rigorous, and able to reveal rich knowledge about the system with great accuracy. The findings set up a solid foundation to explore the topology in novel thermal management applications.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Immobilized Ionic Liquid Regulator with Fast Kinetics toward Highly Stable Zinc Anode under &#8722;35 to 60&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is designed to protect the Zn anode from &#8722;35 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The protective layer not only promotes Zn2+ desolvation and transport but also regulates Zn2+ concentration gradient and electric field to guarantee uniform Zn deposition. With this novel semi&#8208;immobilized coating technique, highly stable zinc batteries are fabricated and can be operated over a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) have been extensively investigated as a next&#8208;generation energy storage system due to their high safety and low cost. However, the critical issues of irregular dendrite growth and intricate side reactions severely restrict the further industrialization of ZIBs. Here, a strategy to fabricate a semi&#8208;immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is proposed to protect the Zn anode over a wide temperature range from &#8722;35&#160;to 60&#160;&#176;C. The immobilized SiO2@cation can form high conjugate racks that can regulate the Zn2+ concentration gradient and self&#8208;polarizing electric field to guarantee uniform nucleation and planar deposition; the free anions of the ILs can weaken the hydrogen bonds of the water to promote rapid Zn2+ desolvation and accelerate ion&#8208;transport kinetics simultaneously. Because of these unique advantages, the cycling performance of the symmetric Zn batteries is greatly enhanced, evidenced by a cycling life of 1800&#160;h at 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a cycle lifespan of 2000&#160;h under a wide temperature window from &#8722;35&#160;to 60&#160;&#176;C. The efficiency of this semi&#8208;immobilizing strategy is well demonstrated in various full cells including pouch cells, showing high performance at large current (20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and wide temperatures with extra&#8208;long cycles up to 80&#8201;000&#160;cycles.

         <title>Nonvolatile Control of Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition in VO2 by Ferroelectric Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to control a metal&#8211;insulator transition (MIT) behavior in a vanadium dioxide is demonstrated by employing the heteroepitaxial Mott transistor. Due to the defect&#8208;alleviated interfaces, the enhanced coupling between the correlated electrons and ferroelectricity is successfully proven by showing a nonvolatile MIT behavior through the reversible memory performance.








Abstract
Controlling phase transitions in correlated materials yields emergent functional properties, providing new aspects to future electronics and a fundamental understanding of condensed matter systems. With vanadium dioxide (VO2), a representative correlated material, an approach to control a metal&#8211;insulator transition (MIT) behavior is developed by employing a heteroepitaxial structure with a ferroelectric BiFeO3 (BFO) layer to modulate the interaction of correlated electrons. Owing to the defect&#8208;alleviated interfaces, the enhanced coupling between the correlated electrons and ferroelectric polarization is successfully demonstrated by showing a nonvolatile control of MIT of VO2 at room temperature. The ferroelectrically&#8208;tunable MIT can be realized through the Mott transistor (VO2/BFO/SrRuO3) with a remanent polarization of 80 &#181;C cm&#8722;2, leading to a nonvolatile MIT behavior through the reversible electrical conductance with a large on/off ratio (&#8776;102), long retention time (&#8776;104 s), and high endurance (&#8776;103 cycles). Furthermore, the structural phase transition of VO2 is corroborated by ferroelectric polarization through in situ Raman mapping analysis. This study provides novel design principles for heteroepitaxial correlated materials and innovative insight to modulate multifunctional properties.

Wafer&#8208;scale 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks Cu3(HHTT)2 (HHTT: 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytetraazanaphthotetraphene) thin films with desirable properties for optoelectronics are fabricated by a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth method. Photodetectors based on the thin films exhibit broad detection range from UV to mid&#8208;IR. Successful application of the devices as optical synapses is also presented.

Abstract
Cu3(HHTT)2 (HHTT: 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytetraazanaphthotetraphene) is a novel 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) with efficient in&#8208;plane d&#8211;&#960; conjugations and strong interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions while the growth of Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films has never been reported until now. Here, the successful fabrication of highly oriented wafer&#8208;scale Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films with a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth method on various substrates is presented. Its semiconducting behavior and carrier transport mechanisms are clarified through temperature and frequency&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements. Flexible photodetectors based on Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films exhibit reliable photoresponses at room temperature in a wavelength region from UV to mid&#8208;IR, which is much broader than those of solution&#8208;processed broadband photodetectors reported previously. Moreover, the photodetectors can show a typical synaptic behavior and excellent data recognition accuracy in artificial neural networks. This work opens a window for the exploration of high&#8208;performance and multifunctional optoelectronic devices based on 2D c&#8208;MOFs.

A facile anion&#8208;assisted photochemical deposition&#8208;based gold patterning method, which can&#160;direct print highly conductive gold patterns (1.08 &#215; 107 S m&#8722;1) under ambient conditions without post annealing is presented. The technique combines Digital Light Processing&#8208;based projection lithography with specific ion effects. The high conductivity and excellent conformability of the printed Au is demonstrated, with reliable performance in electrophysiological signal transductions.








Abstract
Metal patterning via additive manufacturing has been phasing&#8208;in to broad applications in many medical, electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries. While previous efforts have produced various promising metal&#8208;patterning strategies, their complexity and high cost have limited their practical application in rapid production and prototyping. Herein, a one&#8208;step gold printing technique based on anion&#8208;assisted photochemical deposition (APD), which can directly print highly conductive gold patterns (1.08 &#215; 107 S m&#8722;1) under ambient conditions without post&#8208;annealing treatment, is introduced. Uniquely, the APD uses specific ion effects with projection lithography to pattern Au nanoparticles and simultaneously sinter them into tunable porous gold structures. The significant influence of kosmotropic or chaotropic anions in the precursor ink on tuning the morphologies and conductivities of the printed patterns by employing a series of different ions, including Cl&#8722; ions, in the printing process is presented. Additionally, the resistance stabilities and the electrochemical properties of the APD&#8208;printed gold patterns are carefully investigated. The high conductivity and excellent conformability of the printed Au electrodes are demonstrated with reliable performance in electrophysiological signal delivery and acquisition for biomedical applications. This work exploits the potential of photochemical&#8208;deposition&#8208;based metal patterning in flexible electronic manufacturing.

         <title>Achieving 19% Power Conversion Efficiency in Planar&#8208;Mixed Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Using a Pseudosymmetric Electron Acceptor</title>

A pseudosymmetric electron acceptor, BS3TSe&#8208;4F, designed from asymmetric selenium substitution strategy promotes free charge generation to enhance exciton dissociation and suppress energy loss in sequentially processed organic solar cells, leading to a record power conversion efficiency of over 19%.








Abstract
A record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19% is realized in planar&#8208;mixed heterojunction (PMHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) by adopting the asymmetric selenium substitution strategy in making a pseudosymmetric electron acceptor, BS3TSe&#8208;4F. The combined molecular asymmetry with more polarizable selenium substitution increases the dielectric constant of the D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F blend, helping lower the exciton binding energy. On the other hand, dimer packing in BS3TSe&#8208;4F is facilitated to enable free charge generation, helping more efficient exciton dissociation and lowering the radiative recombination loss (&#916;E2) of OSCs. As a result, PMHJ OSCs based on D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F achieve a PCE of 18.48%. By incorporating another mid&#8208;bandgap acceptor Y6&#8208;O into D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F to form a ternary PMHJ, a higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) can be achieved to realize an impressive PCE of 19.03%. The findings of using pseudosymmetric electron acceptors in enhancing device efficiency provides an effective way to develop highly efficient acceptor materials for OSCs.

A single&#8208;ion polymer conductor (SIPC) with exceptional selectivity for lithium (Li)&#8208;ion conduction is synthesized. The optimized ion&#8211;dipole interactions between Li&#8208;ions and carbonyl/cyano groups in the SIPC enable a high ionic conductivity, large Li&#8208;ion transference number, and wide electrochemical stability window. Solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries based on the SIPC exhibit superb cycling performance at various current densities and temperatures.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with large ionic conductivity, high ionic transference number, and good interfacial compatibility with electrodes are highly desired for solid&#8208;state batteries. However, unwanted polarizations and side reactions occurring in traditional dual&#8208;ion polymer conductors hinder their practical applications. Here, single&#8208;ion polymer conductors (SIPCs) with exceptional selectivity for Li&#8208;ion conduction (Li&#8208;ion transference number up to 0.93), high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of about 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1, and a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;4.5&#160;V, vs Li/Li+) are prepared by precisely regulating the ion&#8211;dipole interactions between Li+ and carbonyl/cyano groups. The resulting SIPCs show an excellent electrochemical stability with Li metal during long&#8208;term cycling at room temperature and 60&#160;&#176;C. LiFePO4&#8208;based solid&#8208;state cells containing the SIPCs exhibit good rate and cycling performance in a wide temperature range from &#8722;20 to 90&#160;&#176;C. By the same way of ion&#8211;dipole interaction regulation, sodium&#8208; and potassium&#8208;based SIPCs with both high ionic conductivity and high cationic transference numbers are also prepared. The findings in this work provide guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance SIPCs and other metal&#8208;ion systems beyond Li+.

         <title>High&#8208;Stretchability, Ultralow&#8208;Hysteresis ConductingPolymer Hydrogel Strain Sensors for Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conducting&#8208;polymer hydrogel strain sensor is proposed with both high stretchability (300% strain) and ultralow hysteresis (&lt;1.5%). The hydrogel&#8208;based sensor harnesses a unique microphase semiseparated network to achieve enhanced sensing properties. The fabricated sensor can be applied as electronic skins to monitor physiological signals, enable a soft gripper for object recognition and remote control of an industrial robot.








Abstract
Highly stretchable strain sensors based on conducting polymer hydrogel are rapidly emerging as a promising candidate toward diverse wearable skins and sensing devices for soft machines. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of low stretchability and large hysteresis, existing strain sensors cannot fully exploit their potential when used in wearable or robotic systems. Here, a conducting&#160;polymer hydrogel strain sensor exhibiting both ultimate strain (300%) and negligible hysteresis (&lt;1.5%) is presented. This is achieved through a unique microphase semiseparated network design by compositing poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) nanofibers with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and facile fabrication by combining 3D printing and successive freeze&#8208;thawing. The overall superior performances of the strain sensor including stretchability, linearity, cyclic stability, and robustness against mechanical twisting and pressing are systematically characterized. The integration and application of such strain sensor with electronic skins are further demonstrated to measure various physiological signals, identify hand gestures, enable a soft gripper for objection recognition, and remote control of an industrial robot. This work may offer both promising conducting polymer hydrogels with enhanced sensing functionalities and technical platforms toward stretchable electronic skins and intelligent robotic systems.

         <title>Superior Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by the High&#8208;Speed Solid&#8208;State Lithium Transport of an Intermetallic Cu6Sn5 Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;transport matrix throughout the electrode is built up by a LixCu6Sn5 intermetallic network, which largely reduces the polarization effect in the graphite anode and realizes superior fast&#8208;charging graphite/lithium cobalt oxide full cells under strict electrode conditions (areal capacity &gt;3 mAh cm&#8722;2, porosity &lt; 35%).








Abstract
Superior fast charging is a desirable capability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which can make electric vehicles a strong competition to traditional fuel vehicles. However, the slow transport of solvated lithium ions in liquid electrolytes is a limiting factor. Here, a LixCu6Sn5 intermetallic network is reported to address this issue. Based on electrochemical analysis and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy mapping, it is demonstrated that the reported intermetallic network can form a high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium transport matrix throughout the electrode, which largely reduces the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;concentration polarization effect in the graphite anode. Employing this design, superior fast&#8208;charging graphite/lithium cobalt oxide full cells are fabricated and tested under strict electrode conditions. At the charging rate of 6 C, the fabricated full cells show a capacity of 145 mAh g&#8722;1 with an extraordinary capacity retention of 96.6%. In addition, the full cell also exhibits good electrochemical stability at a high charging rate of 2 C over 100 cycles (96.0% of capacity retention) in comparison to traditional graphite&#8208;anode&#8208;based cells (86.1% of capacity retention). This work presents a new strategy for fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries on the basis of high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium transport in intermetallic alloy hosts.

         <title>Development of Pure Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Material by Cyano Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bathochromic shift of a multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA) is achieved by introducing cyano groups. The cyano&#8208;substituted material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;CN&#8208;Me) exhibits pure green emission with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum. The fabricated organic light&#8208;emitting diode device exhibits a high maximum external quantum efficiency (31.9%), which is maintained (28.5%) at 1000 cd m&#8722;2, demonstrating a minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR)&#8208;effect&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have garnered significant attention because they can achieve both high color purity and high external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, the reported green&#8208;emitting MR&#8208;TADF materials exhibit broader emission compared to those of blue&#8208;emitting ones and suffer from severe efficiency roll&#8208;off due to insufficient rate constants of reverse intersystem crossing process (kRISC). Herein, a pure green MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;CN&#8208;Me) with high kRISC of 105 s&#8722;1 is reported. The key to success is introduction of cyano groups into a blue&#8208;emitting MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA), which causes remarkable bathochromic shift without a loss of color purity. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode employing it as an emitter exhibits green emission at 504&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm, corresponding to Commission Internationale d'&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.65). The device achieves a high maximum EQE of 31.9% and successfully suppresses the efficiency roll&#8208;off at a high luminance.

         <title>Light&#8208;Based Printing of Leachable Salt Molds for Facile Shaping of Complex Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissolvable salt&#8208;printed templates allow shaping of hard&#8208;to&#8208;print materials. The control of photoadditive and diluent concentrations in the salt&#8208;based ink is essential to achieve high&#8208;resolution printing of crack&#8208;free objects. Optimal ink formulations enable shaping of materials for various applications from lightweight construction to 3D cell cultures.








Abstract
3D printing is a powerful manufacturing technology for shaping materials into complex structures. While the palette of printable materials continues to expand, the rheological and chemical requisites for printing are not always easy to fulfill. Here, a universal manufacturing platform is reported for shaping materials into intricate geometries without the need for their printability, but instead using light&#8208;based printed salt structures as leachable molds. The salt structures are printed using photocurable resins loaded with NaCl particles. The printing, debinding, and sintering steps involved in the process are systematically investigated to identify ink formulations enabling the preparation of crack&#8208;free salt templates. The experiments reveal that the formation of a load&#8208;bearing network of salt particles is essential to prevent cracking of the mold during the process. By infiltrating the sintered salt molds and leaching the template in water, complex&#8208;shaped architectures are created from diverse compositions such as biomedical silicone, chocolate, light metals, degradable elastomers, and fiber composites, thus demonstrating the universal, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable nature of this new manufacturing platform.

&lt;p&gt;Dissolvable salt-printed templates allow shaping of hard-to-print materials. The control of photoadditive and diluent concentrations in the salt-based ink is essential to achieve high-resolution printing of crack-free objects. Optimal ink formulations enable shaping of materials for various applications from lightweight construction to 3D cell cultures.

         <title>Efficient Photon Extraction in Top&#8208;Emission Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Ampicillin Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The desire to enhance the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) has driven to the investigation of advanced materials with fascinating properties. In ths work, 63.4% external quantum efficiency is achieved with ampicillin (antibiotic)&#8208;based top&#8208;emission OLEDs by introducing ampicillin microstructures (Amp&#8208;MSs) with dual phases (&#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;phase) that induce photoluminescence, electroluminescence, and scattering effect, simultaneously.








Abstract
The desire to enhance the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) has driven to the investigation of advanced materials with fascinating properties. In this work, the efficiency of top&#8208;emission OLEDs (TEOLEDs) is enhanced by introducing ampicillin microstructures (Amp&#8208;MSs) with dual phases (&#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;phase) that induce photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL). Moreover, Amp&#8208;MSs can adjust the charge balance by Fermi level (EF) alignment, thereby decreasing the leakage current. The decrease in the wave&#8208;guided modes can enhance the light outcoupling through optical scattering. The resulting TEOLED demonstrates a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) (maximum: 68.7% and average: 63.4% at spectroradiometer; maximum: 44.8% and average: 42.6% at integrating sphere) with a wider color gamut (118%) owing to the redshift of the spectrum by J&#8208;aggregation. Deconvolution of the EL intensities is performed to clarify the contribution of Amp&#8208;MSs to the device EQE enhancement (optical scattering by Amp&#8208;MSs: 17.0%, PL by radiative energy transfer: 9.1%, and EL by J&#8208;aggregated excitons: 4.6%). The proposed TEOLED outperforms the existing frameworks in terms of device efficiency.

         <title>Concentrated Electrolytes Enabling Stable Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvation structure, electrochemical properties, and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase of a novel concentrated (5.8 m) aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte are unveiled by the combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The unique solvation structure of the concentrated electrolyte and the formed surface layer guarantee the full cell with a capacity retention of &#8776;72% and a coulombic efficiency of 99.2% after 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries are promising devices for large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage applications because of their low&#8208;cost, inherent safety, and environmental friendliness. Among them, aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIB) are currently emerging owing to the fast diffusion kinetics of NH4+. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to obtain stable AAIB with relatively high output potential, considering the instability of many electrode materials in an aqueous environment. Herein, a cell based on a concentrated (5.8 m) aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte, ammonium copper hexacyanoferrate (N&#8208;CuHCF) as the positive electrode (cathode), and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene&#8208;bis(dicarboximide) (PTCDI) as the negative electrode (anode) is reported. The solvation structure, electrochemical properties, as well as the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface and interphase are systematically investigated by the combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The results indicate a remarkable cycling performance of the low&#8208;cost rocking&#8208;chair AAIB, which offers a capacity retention of &#8776;72% after 1000 cycles and an average output potential of &#8776;1.0&#160;V.

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Palladium Nanosheets for Synthetic Catalytic Therapy and Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reconstruction strategy is reported for the fabrication of lattice&#8208;tensile&#8208;strained Pd nanosheets with photodynamic, catalase&#8208;, and peroxidase&#8208;like properties. The in vivo tumor inhibition rate in a 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice model of the strained Pd nanosheets is approximately five times higher than that of the pristine Pd nanosheets.








Abstract
Palladium nanosheets (Pd NSs) are well&#8208;investigated photothermal therapy agents, but their catalytic potential for tumor therapy has been underexplored owing to the inactive dominant (111) facets. Herein, lattice tensile strain is introduced by surface reconstruction to activate the inert surface, endowing the strained Pd NSs (SPd NSs) with photodynamic, catalase&#8208;like, and peroxidase&#8208;like properties. Tensile strain promoting the photodynamic and enzyme&#8208;like activities is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Compared with Pd NSs, SPd NSs exhibit lower photothermal effect, but approximately five times higher tumor inhibition rate. This work calls for further study to activate nanomaterials by strain engineering and surface reconstruction for catalytic therapy of tumors.

         <title>Ultrahigh Carrier Mobilities in Ferroelectric Domain Wall Corbino Cones at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoresistance is measured in conical 180&#176; charged domain walls, in ferroelectric lithium niobate. Extracted carrier mobilities are extremely high, up to &#8776;3700 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This is an unparalleled value for oxide interfaces (and for bulk oxides too) and is most comparable to mobilities in other systems typically seen at cryogenic, rather than at room, temperature.








Abstract
Recently, electrically conducting heterointerfaces between dissimilar band insulators (such as lanthanum aluminate and strontium titanate) have attracted considerable research interest. Charge transport and fundamental aspects of conduction have been thoroughly explored. Perhaps surprisingly, similar studies on conceptually much simpler conducting homointerfaces, such as domain walls, are not nearly so well developed. Addressing this disparity, magnetoresistance is herein reported in approximately conical 180&#176; charged domain walls, in partially switched ferroelectric thin&#8208;film single&#8208;crystal lithium niobate. This system is ideal for such measurements: first, the conductivity difference between domains and domain walls is unusually large (a factor of 1013) and hence currents driven through the thin film, between planar top and bottom electrodes, are overwhelmingly channeled along the walls; second, when electrical contact is made to the top and bottom of the domain walls and a magnetic field is applied along their cone axes, then the test geometry mirrors that of a Corbino disk: a textbook arrangement for geometric magnetoresistance measurement. Data imply carriers with extremely high room&#8208;temperature Hall mobilities of up to &#8776;3700 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This is an unparalleled value for oxide interfaces (and for bulk oxides) comparable to mobilities in other systems seen at cryogenic, rather than at room, temperature.

This system is ideal for such measurements: first, the conductivity difference between domains and domain walls is unusually large (a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;) and hence currents driven through the thin film, between planar top and bottom electrodes, are overwhelmingly channeled along the walls; second, when electrical contact is made to the top and bottom of the domain walls and a magnetic field is applied along their cone axes, then the test geometry mirrors that of a Corbino disk: a textbook arrangement for geometric magnetoresistance measurement. Data imply carriers with extremely high room-temperature Hall mobilities of up to &#8776;3700 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is an unparalleled value for oxide interfaces (and for bulk oxides) comparable to mobilities in other systems seen at cryogenic, rather than at room, temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Functionalized SnO2 Substrate Induced Sequential Deposition of Black&#8208;Phase FAPbI3 with Rearranged PbI2 Residue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterion formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA) is deposited at the tin(IV) oxide (SnO2)/perovskite interface to induce the crystallization of high&#8208;quality black&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), and also help reduce the side effect of the residual lead iodide (PbI2), yielding an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.1% and 1000 h long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
Black&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) with narrow bandgap and high thermal stability has emerged as the most promising candidate for highly efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaics. In order to overcome the intrinsic difficulty of black&#8208;phase crystallization and to eliminate the lead iodide (PbI2) residue, most sequential deposition methods of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite will introduce external ions like methylammonium (MA+), cesium (Cs+), and bromide (Br&#8211;) ions to the perovskite structure. Here a zwitterion&#8208;functionalized tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) is introduced as the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) to induce the crystallization of high&#8208;quality black&#8208;phase FAPbI3. The SnO2 ETL treated with the zwitterion of formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA) can help rearrange the stack direction, orientation, and distribution of residual PbI2 in the perovskite layer, which reduces the side effect of the residual PbI2. Besides, the FSA functionalization also modifies SnO2 ETL to suppress deep&#8208;level defects at the perovskite/SnO2 interface. As a result, the FSA&#8211;FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit an excellent power conversion efficiency of up to 24.1% with 1000 h long&#8208;term operational stability. These findings provide a new interface engineering strategy on the sequential fabrication of black&#8208;phase FAPbI3 PSCs with improved optoelectronic performance.

         <title>Stretchable and Biodegradable Batteries with High Energy and Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kirigami&#8208;patterned biodegradable metal electrodes are introduced to achieve biodegradable stretchable batteries with high power and energy density. The elastic electrodes exhibit excellent electrical performance under deformation. Combining molybdenum trioxide with magnesium yields stretchable cells with energy densities as high as 1.72 mWh cm&#8211;2. The batteries can power a wearable biosensing patch, enabling on&#8208;skin monitoring of physiological signals.








Abstract
Realizing a sustainable, technologically advanced future will necessitate solving the electronic waste problem. Biodegradable forms of electronics offer a viable path through their environmental benignity. With both the sheer number of devices produced every day as well as their areas of application ever increasing, new concepts of degradable batteries able to sustain the high power demands of modern electronics must be developed. Simultaneously, integration of electronics in close interaction with its user or powering soft robotic devices necessitates high degrees of compliance, rendering stretchable batteries indispensable. Here, a concept for merging intrinsically stretchable materials with engineered stretchability by kirigami&#8208;patterning on a component level is shown to yield high&#8208;power biodegradable batteries with reversible elasticity up to 35% when stretched uniaxially and 20% for biaxial extension. Using a combination of molybdenum metal foils, a molybdenum trioxide paste, and magnesium metal foils as electrode materials, a peak power output of 196 &#181;W cm&#8211;2 and an energy density of 1.72 mWh cm&#8211;2 is achieved. The biodegradable batteries are used to power an on&#8208;skin biomedical sensor patch, enabling monitoring of sodium concentration in sweat. This concept provides a versatile route for high&#8208;power biodegradable batteries, enabling untethered soft electronic devices in a sustainable future.

         <title>Using Machine Learning to Predict and Understand Complex Self&#8208;Assembly Behaviors of a Multicomponent Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase behavior of multicomponent nanocomposites is complex and cannot be predicted by theory alone. Machine learning (ML) methods are a compelling alternative to experimental trial and error. In this work, 595 microscopy images of nanocomposites are used to train a series of ML models. The predictions provide insights into the system and suggest ML can significantly streamline the design of nanocomposites.








Abstract
Blends of nanoparticles, polymers, and small molecules can self&#8208;assemble into optical, magnetic, and electronic devices with structure&#8208;dependent properties. However, the relationship between a multicomponent nanocomposite's formulation and its assembled structure is complex and cannot be predicted by theory. The blends can be strongly influenced by processing conditions, which can introduce non&#8208;equilibrium states. Currently, nanocomposite devices are designed through cycles of experimental trial and error. Machine learning (ML) methods are a compelling alternative because they can use existing datasets to map high&#8208;dimensional spaces. These methods do not rely on known relationships between parameters, so they are suited to complex systems without a solid theoretical foundation. Here, a dataset of 595 microscopy images of nanocomposite thin films is used to train a series of ML models. Correlations between the input and output parameters are examined, providing new insights into the system. Finally, the most successful ML model is used to predict the structures of new nanocomposite compositions. The results confirm that ML techniques can be used to improve the efficiency of nanocomposite device design. More broadly, the current study suggests some of the advantages and challenges associated with applying ML to complex systems.

         <title>Conformation Dynamics of Single Polymer Strands in Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene liquid cell transmission electron microscopy visualizes the chain&#8208;resolved conformational dynamics of a single dendronized polymer diffusing in confined organic solvent. Direct observations show the equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium chain&#8208;dynamics of semiflexible polymers. The solvated semiflexible chain fluctuates between coiled and stretched conformations. Non&#8208;equilibrium chain motions including drag and cleavage, due to the interfacial interaction, are also observed.








Abstract
Conformational changes in macromolecules significantly affect their functions and assembly into high&#8208;level structures. Despite advances in theoretical and experimental studies, investigations into the intrinsic conformational variations and dynamic motions of single macromolecules remain challenging. Here, liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy enables the real&#8208;time tracking of single&#8208;chain polymers. Imaging linear polymers, synthetically dendronized with conjugated aromatic groups, in organic solvent confined within graphene liquid cells, directly exhibits chain&#8208;resolved conformational dynamics of individual semiflexible polymers. These experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the dynamic conformational transitions of the single&#8208;chain polymer originate from the degree of intrachain interactions. In situ observations also show that such dynamics of the single&#8208;chain polymer are significantly affected by environmental factors, including surfaces and interfaces.

         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline tempered&#8208;glass&#8208;like perovskite with compressed surface lattice&#8208;structure can be made by a thermal&#8208;shocking fabrication process, which significantly enhances the ionic activation temperature and contributes to hysteresis&#8208;free operation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at high temperature up to 363 K, enabling efficient and stable PSCs fabricated by a high&#8208;speed post&#8208;annealing&#8208;free process in air with the scalable bar&#8208;coating technique.








Abstract
A highly crystalline tempered&#8208;glass&#8208;like perovskite grain structure with compressed surface lattice realized by a thermal&#8208;shocking fabrication is shown. The strained perovskite grain structure is stabilized by Cl&#8722;&#8208;reinforcing surface lattice and shows enhanced bonding energy and ionic activation temperature, which contributes to hysteresis&#8208;free operation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at much higher temperature up to 363 K in thermal&#8208;shocking&#8208;processed MAPbClxI3&#8722;x (T&#8208;MPI). The PSCs can be fabricated by a high&#8208;speed fully air process without post&#8208;annealing based on the scalable bar&#8208;coating technique. Both high efficiency and stability are achieved in T&#8208;MPI PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 22.99% and long&#8208;term operational stability with T80 lifetime exceeding 4000 h.

         <title>Composition Engineering of Amorphous Nickel Boride Nanoarchitectures Enabling Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of amorphous nickel borides electrocatalysts is developed for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), out of which, NiB2 demonstrates remarkable activity, selectivity, and stability. Furthermore, the dependence of 2e&#8722; ORR performance of amorphous nickel borides by tuning the atomic ratio of Ni and B is uncovered from the perspective of free&#8208;adsorption energy and dynamic charge transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Developing advanced electrocatalysts with exceptional two electron (2e&#8722;) selectivity, activity, and stability is crucial for driving the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, a composition engineering strategy is proposed to flexibly regulate the intrinsic activity of amorphous nickel boride nanoarchitectures for efficient 2e&#8722; ORR by oriented reduction of Ni2+ with different amounts of BH4&#8722;. Among borides, the amorphous NiB2 delivers the 2e&#8722; selectivity close to 99% at 0.4&#160;V and over 93% in a wide potential range, together with a negligible activity decay under prolonged time. Notably, an ultrahigh H2O2 production rate of 4.753&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is achieved upon assembling NiB2 in the practical gas diffusion electrode. The combination of X&#8208;ray absorption and in situ Raman spectroscopy, as well as transient photovoltage measurements with density functional theory, unequivocally reveal that the atomic ratio between Ni and B induces the local electronic structure diversity, allowing optimization of the adsorption energy of Ni toward *OOH and reducing of the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics to preserve the O&#63743;O bond.

         <title>Drug in Drug: A Host&#8211;Guest Formulation of Azocalixarene with Hydroxychloroquine for Synergistic Anti&#8208;Inflammation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>

Macrocyclic delivery and therapeutics are two hotspots in supramolecular biomedicine that have only been occasionally merged. In this work, a &#8220;drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug&#8221; strategy is proposed, in which an active drug is encapsulated by a therapeutically active macrocycle, forming a multifunctional supramolecular active ingredient. This drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug formulation achieves the advantages of macrocycles acting as both carriers and therapeutic agents to realize combinational therapy.








Abstract
Macrocyclic delivery and therapeutics are two significant topics in supramolecular biomedicine. The functional integration of these topics would open new avenues for treating diseases synergistically. However, these two individual topics have only been occasionally merged, probably because of the lack of functionalized design of macrocyclic host and the lack of efficient recognition between host and guest drugs. Herein, a &#8220;drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug&#8221; strategy is proposed, in which an active drug is encapsulated by a macrocycle possessing therapeutic activity to form a multifunctional supramolecular active pharmaceutical ingredient. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a complex of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with sulfonated azocalix[4]arene (HCQ@SAC4A) is prepared to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a combined fashion. SAC4A is a therapeutic agent that exhibits scavenging capacity for reactive oxygen species and exerts an anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. It is also a hypoxia&#8208;responsive carrier that can deliver HCQ directly to the inflammatory articular cavity. Consequently, HCQ@SAC4A achieves the synergistic anti&#8208;inflammatory effect on both inflamed RAW 264.7 cells and RA rats. This effect is attributed to the temporal and spatial consistency of the two active ingredients of the complex. As a new paradigm for combinational therapy, the drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug strategy advances in easy preparation, mix&#8208;and&#8208;match combination, and precise ratiometric control.

         <title>A Personalized Electronic Tattoo for Healthcare Realized by On&#8208;the&#8208;Spot Assembly of an Intrinsically Conductive and Durable Liquid&#8208;Metal Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of e&#8208;tattoo that can be directly implemented on the skin by rapid one&#8208;step coating with various designs at a multi&#8208;scale for personalized healthcare is introduced. The e&#8208;tattoo is realized by tuning the electrically conductive and mechanically durable liquid metal composite based suspension to have low repulsion between particles, excellent wettability, and high vapor pressure.








Abstract
Conventional electronic (e&#8208;) skins are a class of thin&#8208;film electronics mainly fabricated in laboratories or factories, which is incapable of rapid and simple customization for personalized healthcare. Here a new class of e&#8208;tattoos is introduced that can be directly implemented on the skin by facile one&#8208;step coating with various designs at multi&#8208;scale depending on the purpose of the user without a substrate. An e&#8208;tattoo is realized by attaching Pt&#8208;decorated carbon nanotubes on gallium&#8208;based liquid&#8208;metal particles (CMP) to impose intrinsic electrical conductivity and mechanical durability. Tuning the CMP suspension to have low&#8208;zeta potential, excellent wettability, and high&#8208;vapor pressure enables conformal and intimate assembly of particles directly on the skin in 10 s. Low&#8208;cost, ease of preparation, on&#8208;skin compatibility, and multifunctionality of CMP make it highly suitable for e&#8208;tattoos. Demonstrations of electrical muscle stimulators, photothermal patches, motion artifact&#8208;free electrophysiological sensors, and electrochemical biosensors validate the simplicity, versatility, and reliability of the e&#8208;tattoo&#8208;based approach in biomedical engineering.

         <title>Ultrahigh Kinetic Inductance Superconducting Materials from Spinodal Decomposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;dissipative circuit element with considerably large inductance is indispensable for the noise&#8208;resilient superconducting qubits. Here, spinodal decomposition is utilized to achieve ultrahigh kinetic inductance in the superconducting materials. Model epitaxial Ti0.48Al0.52N thin films are used and a drastic enhancement in kinetic inductance by 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude while maintaining a low microwave loss is demonstrated.








Abstract
Disordered superconducting nitrides with kinetic inductance have long been considered to be leading material candidates for high&#8208;inductance quantum&#8208;circuit applications.

&lt;p&gt;A non-dissipative circuit element with considerably large inductance is indispensable for the noise-resilient superconducting qubits. Here, spinodal decomposition is utilized to achieve ultrahigh kinetic inductance in the superconducting materials. Model epitaxial Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.48&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.52&lt;/sub&gt;N thin films are used and a drastic enhancement in kinetic inductance by 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude while maintaining a low microwave loss is demonstrated.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Rules for Catalyst Selection and Electrode Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematically theoretical calculations are performed to seek the optimal catalyst from transition metal nitrides for room&#8208;temperature advanced Na&#8211;S batteries. Based on theoretical results, a dual&#8208;functioning host (MoN@CNFs) is designed and synthesized for S and Na electrodes, which exhibits superior electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Seeking an optimal catalyst to accelerate conversion reaction kinetics of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries is crucial for improving their electrochemical performance and promoting the practical applications. Herein, theoretical calculations of interfacial interactions of catalysts and polysulfides in terms of the surface adsorption state, interfacial ions migration, and electronic concentration around the Fermi level are systematically proposed as guiding principles of catalyst selection for RT Na&#8211;S batteries. As a case, MoN catalyst is accurately selected from transition metal nitrides with different d orbital electrons, and for experiment, it is introduced into the carbon nanofibers as a dual&#8208;functioning host (MoN@CNFs). The MoN@CNFs can effectively anchor polysulfides and accelerate their conversion reaction. In addition, for the sodium anode, the MoN@CNFs can also induce uniform deposition of Na and inhibit dendrite growth, which are supported by in situ characterizations and finite element simulation technique. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared RT Na&#8211;S battery displays high reversible capacity of 990 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.2 A g&#8211;1 after 100 cycles and long lifespan over 1500 cycles at 2 A g&#8211;1. Even with high S loading of 5&#160;mg cm&#8211;2, the RT Na&#8211;S battery still exhibits a high areal capacity of 2.5 mAh cm&#8211;2.

         <title>Fluorinated Perylene&#8208;Diimides: Cathode Interlayers Facilitating Carrier Collection for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have experienced rapid progress with the innovation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing small&#8208;molecular acceptors. This work prescribes a facile, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable method for the preparation of high&#8208;performance fluorinated perylene&#8208;diimide as cathode interlayers, making OSCs more promising.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have experienced rapid progress with the innovation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing small&#8208;molecular acceptors (SMAs), while the unique electronic properties of the SMAs raise new challenges in relation to cathode engineering for effective electron collection. To address this issue, two fluorinated perylene&#8208;diimides (PDIs), PDINN&#8208;F and PDINN&#8208;2F, are synthesized by a simple fluorination method, for application as cathode interlayer (CIL) materials. The two bay&#8208;fluorinated PDI&#8208;based CILs possess a lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of &#8776;&#8722;4.0&#160;eV, which improves the energy level alignment at the NIR&#8208;SMAs (such as BTP&#8208;eC9)/CIL for a favorable electron extraction efficiency. The monofluorinated PDINN&#8208;F shows higher electron mobility and better improved interfacial compatibility. The PDINN&#8208;F&#8208;based OSCs with PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 as active layer exhibit an enhanced fill factor and larger short&#8208;circuit current density, leading to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 18%. The devices with PDINN&#8208;F CIL retain more than 80% of their initial PCE after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 750 h. This work prescribes a facile, cost&#8208;effective, and scalable method for the preparation of stable, high&#8208;performance fluorinated CILs, and instilling promise for the NIR&#8208;SMAs&#8208;based OSCs moving forward.

         <title>Gas Separations using Nanoporous Atomically Thin Membranes: Recent Theoretical, Simulation, and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent development of novel atomically thin 2D materials, including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, offers great opportunities for potential breakthroughs in the membrane separation field. Recent research advances, challenges, and potential future directions in the application of nanoporous atomically thin membranes for gas separation are summarized.








Abstract
Porous graphene and other atomically thin 2D materials are regarded as highly promising membrane materials for high&#8208;performance gas separations due to their atomic thickness, large&#8208;scale synthesizability, excellent mechanical strength, and chemical stability. When these atomically thin materials contain a high areal density of gas&#8208;sieving nanoscale pores, they can exhibit both high gas permeances and high selectivities, which is beneficial for reducing the cost of gas&#8208;separation processes. Here, recent modeling and experimental advances in nanoporous atomically thin membranes for gas separations is discussed. The major challenges involved, including controlling pore size distributions, scaling up the membrane area, and matching theory with experimental results, are also highlighted. Finally, important future directions are proposed for real gas&#8208;separation applications of nanoporous atomically thin membranes.

         <title>Quantum Conductance in Memristive Devices: Fundamentals, Developments, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum conductance effects in memristive devices are reviewed, from fundamentals of electrochemical phenomena underlying memristive functionalities to ballistic electronic conduction transport in atomic&#8208;sized conductive filaments. Related challenges in nanoscale metrology for the characterization of memristive phenomena at the nanoscale are analyzed together with opportunities and envisioned applications for memristive devices working in the quantum regime.








Abstract
Quantum effects in novel functional materials and new device concepts represent a potential breakthrough for the development of new information processing technologies based on quantum phenomena. Among the emerging technologies, memristive elements that exhibit resistive switching, which relies on the electrochemical formation/rupture of conductive nanofilaments, exhibit quantum conductance effects at room temperature. Despite the underlying resistive switching mechanism having been exploited for the realization of next&#8208;generation memories and neuromorphic computing architectures, the potentialities of quantum effects in memristive devices are still rather unexplored. Here, a comprehensive review on memristive quantum devices, where quantum conductance effects can be observed by coupling ionics with electronics, is presented. Fundamental electrochemical and physicochemical phenomena underlying device functionalities are introduced, together with fundamentals of electronic ballistic conduction transport in nanofilaments. Quantum conductance effects including quantum mode splitting, stability, and random telegraph noise are analyzed, reporting experimental techniques and challenges of nanoscale metrology for the characterization of memristive phenomena. Finally, potential applications and future perspectives are envisioned, discussing how memristive devices with controllable atomic&#8208;sized conductive filaments can represent not only suitable platforms for the investigation of quantum phenomena but also promising building blocks for the realization of integrated quantum systems working in air at room temperature.

         <title>Delivering Mechanical Stimulation to Cells: State of the Art in Materials and Devices Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 32, August 11, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biophysical signals, especially mechanical cues, are crucial in many (patho)physiological processes. An overview of the current state of the art in the design and development of materials and devices that can deliver mechanical stimulation to cells and tissues, with a focus on their design principles, is provided, and challenges and perspectives for future research directions are highlighted.








Abstract
Biochemical signals, such as growth factors, cytokines, and transcription factors are known to play a crucial role in regulating a variety of cellular activities as well as maintaining the normal function of different tissues and organs. If the biochemical signals are assumed to be one side of the coin, the other side comprises biophysical cues. There is growing evidence showing that biophysical signals, and in particular mechanical cues, also play an important role in different stages of human life ranging from morphogenesis during embryonic development to maturation and maintenance of tissue and organ function throughout life. In order to investigate how mechanical signals influence cell and tissue function, tremendous efforts have been devoted to fabricating various materials and devices for delivering mechanical stimuli to cells and tissues. Here, an overview of the current state of the art in the design and development of such materials and devices is provided, with a focus on their design principles, and challenges and perspectives for future research directions are highlighted.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design strategies for structurally&#160;controlled polymer surfaces via cyclophane&#8208;based chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization with precise control over chemical functionalities, and post&#8208;CVD fabrication via orthogonal surface functionalization that facilitates the formation of designable biointerfaces are summarized. Particular discussion about CVD copolymerization for multifunctional surfaces, and templated&#8208;synthesis of structurally&#160;controlled CVD polymers, ranging from 1D to 3D architecture is provided.








Abstract
Molecular structuring of soft matter with precise arrangements over multiple hierarchical levels, especially on polymer surfaces, and enabling their post&#8208;synthetic modulation has tremendous potential for application in molecular engineering and interfacial science. Here, recent research and developments in design strategies for structurally controlled polymer surfaces via cyclophane&#8208;based chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymerization with precise control over chemical functionalities and post&#8208;CVD fabrication via orthogonal surface functionalization that facilitates the formation of designable biointerfaces are summarized. Particular discussion about innovative approaches for the templated synthesis of shape&#8208;controlled CVD polymers, ranging from 1D to 3D architecture, including inside confined nanochannels, nanofibers/nanowires synthesis into an anisotropic media such as liquid crystals, and CVD polymer nanohelices via hierarchical chirality transfer across multiple length scales is provided. Aiming at multifunctional polymer surfaces via CVD copolymerization of multiple precursors, the structural and functional design of the fundamental [2.2]paracyclophane (PCP) precursor molecules, that is, functional CVD monomer chemistry is also described. Technologically advanced and innovative surface deposition techniques toward topological micro&#8208; and nanostructuring, including microcontact printing, photopatterning, photomask, and lithographic techniques such as dip&#8208;pen nanolithography, showcasing research from the authors&#8217; laboratories as well as other's relevant important findings in this evolving field are highlighted that have introduced new programmable CVD polymerization capabilities. Perspectives, current limitations, and future considerations are provided.

         <title>Massively Parallel Selection of NanoCluster Beacons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) are multicolor silver nanocluster probes whose fluorescence can be activated or tuned by a proximal DNA strand called the activator. While a single&#8208;nucleotide difference in a pair of activators can lead to drastically different activation outcomes, termed the polar opposite twins (POTs), it is difficult to discover new POT&#8208;NCBs using the conventional low&#8208;throughput characterization approaches. Here we report a high&#8208;throughput selection method that takes advantage of repurposed next&#8208;generation&#8208;sequencing (NGS) chips to screen the activation fluorescence of &#8764;40,000 activator sequences. We find the nucleobases at positions 7&#8211;12 of the 18&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;long activator are critical to creating bright NCBs and positions 4&#8211;6 and 2&#8211;4 are hotspots to generate yellow&#8208;orange and red POTs, respectively. Based on these findings, we propose a &#8220;zipper bag model&#8221; that could explain how these hotspots lead to the creation of distinct silver cluster chromophores and alter the chromophore chemical yields. Combining high&#8208;throughput screening with machine learning algorithms, we establish a pipeline to design bright and multicolor NCBs in silico.

         <title>Suppressing Charged Cation Antisites via Se Vapor Annealing Enables p&#8208;Type Dopability in AgBiSe2&#8211;SnSe Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cation disordering is commonly found in multinary cubic compounds, but its effect on electronic properties has been neglected because of difficulties in determining the ordered structure and defect energetics. An absence of rational understanding of the point defects present has led to poor reproducibility and uncontrolled conduction type. AgBiSe2 is a representative compound that suffers from poor reproducibility of thermoelectric properties while the origins of its intrinsic n&#8208;type conductivity remain speculative. Here, we demonstrate that cation disordering is facilitated by BiAg charged antisite defects in cubic AgBiSe2 which also act as a principal donor defect that greatly control the electronic properties. Using density functional theory calculations and in situ Raman spectroscopy, we elucidate how saturation annealing with selenium vapor can stabilize p&#8208;type conductivity in cubic AgBiSe2 alloyed with SnSe at high temperatures. With stable and controlled hole concentration, we can observe a peak in the weighted mobility and the density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass in AgBiSnSe3, implying an increased valley degeneracy in this system. Our findings corroborate the importance of considering the defect energetics for exploring the dopability of ternary thermoelectric chalcogenides and engineering electronic bands by controlling self&#8208;doping.

         <title>Cooperative Coupling of H2O2 Production and Organic Synthesis Over Floatable Polystyrene Sphere&#8208;supported TiO2/Bi2O3 S&#8208;scheme Photocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cooperative coupling of photocatalytic H2O2 production with organic synthesis has an expansive perspective in converting solar energy into storable chemical energy. However, traditional powder photocatalysts suffer from severe agglomeration, limited light absorption, poor gas reactant accessibility and reusable difficulty, which greatly hinders their large&#8208;scale application. Herein, floatable composite photocatalysts are synthesized by immobilizing hydrophobic TiO2 and Bi2O3 on light&#8208;weight polystyrene (PS) spheres via hydrothermal and photodeposition methods. The floatable photocatalysts are not only solar transparent, but also upgrade the contact between reactants and photocatalysts. Thus, the floatable step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) TiO2/Bi2O3 photocatalyst exhibits a drastically enhanced H2O2 yield of 1.15&#160;mM h&#8722;1 and decent furfuryl alcohol conversion to furoic acid synchronously. Furthermore, the S&#8208;scheme mechanism and dynamics are systematically investigated by in&#8208;situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectrum analyses. In&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the mechanism of furoic acid evolution. The ingenious design of floatable photocatalysts not only furnishes insight into maximizing photocatalytic reaction kinetics but also provides a new route for high&#8208;efficient heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>A Reactive Superhydrophobic Platform for Living Photolithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach for single&#8208;step fabrication of superhydrophobic surfaces with chemical reactivity is presented for photolithography in a living manner. The spatial and temporal controllability of the surface configuration under visible light enables the regulation of the location, density, and species of the functional molecules on the reactive surface, and formation of aqueous/oil microdroplets arrays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels, and integrated enzyme biochips.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces with regional functions have widespread applications in biotechnology, diagnostic applications, and micro&#8208;chemical synthesis and analysis. However, owing to their chemical inertness, superhydrophobic surfaces with chemical reactivity are difficult to achieve. Superhydrophobic surfaces that can be further modified with varied densities and expanded species of the functional moieties are not readily available. In this study, a single&#8208;step approach to achieve a reactive superhydrophobic surface is reported, on which chemical grafting of a library of molecules can be carried out through surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical addition or surface&#8208;initiated atom&#8208;transfer radical polymerization. The excellent spatial and temporal controllability of these chemical processes under visible light enables us to take advantage of programmed liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;display (LCD) or Digital Light Processing (DLP) photolithography systems to effortlessly regulate the location, density, and species of the functional molecules on the reactive superhydrophobic surface. The distinctive properties of this surface will provide new insight into intelligent superhydrophobic material development and practical applications, such as aqueous/oil microdroplets array, multi&#8208;anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels and integrated microfluidic reactors with enzymes for chemical logic learning.

         <title>An Initial Covalent Organic Polymer with Closed&#8208;F Edges Directly for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An initial F&#8208;decorated quasi&#8208;phthalocyanine covalent organic polymer is prepared, which delivers exceptional catalytic activity in the acidic oxygen reduction reaction and has capability to be directly applied into proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells devices, which is a stride forward among catalysts based on a pyrolysis&#8208;free conjugated&#8208;polymer network in device manner to date.








Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) are a class of rising electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the atomically metrical control of the organic molecular components along with highly architectural robustness and thermodynamic stability even in acid or alkaline media. However, the direct application of pristine COPs as acidic ORR electrocatalysts, especially in device manner, e.g., in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), remains a big challenge. Currently, the decoration toward electronic structures of active sites is considered a vital pathway to enhancing the acidic ORR activity of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, an initial F&#8208;decorated fully closed &#960;&#8208;conjugated quasi&#8208;phthalocyanine COP (denoted as COPBTC&#8208;F) is reported. The introduction of the closed&#8208;F edges stepwise drags more electrons from FeN4 sites in COPBTC&#8208;F into the catalyst margin, which weakens the occupied numbers of bonding orbitals between COPBTC&#8208;F and OH* intermediates at the rate&#8208;determining step, exhibiting over five times intrinsic performance beyond the counterpart without F functionalities (termed as COPBTC). Significantly, the maximum power density utilizing COPBTC&#8208;F as a cathode catalyst in PEMFCs is remarkably increased by an order of magnitude compared with COPBTC, which is a stride forward among catalysts based on a pyrolysis&#8208;free conjugated&#8208;polymer network in device manner to date.

         <title>Impact of Side Chain Hydrophilicity on Packing, Swelling and Ion Interactions in Oxy&#8208;bithiophene Semiconductors</title>

Abstract
Exchanging hydrophobic alkyl&#8208;based side chains to hydrophilic glycol&#8208;based side chains is a widely adopted method for improving mixed&#8208;transport device performance, despite the impact on solid state packing and polymer&#8208;electrolyte interactions being poorly understood. Presented here is a Molecular Dynamics (MD) force field for modelling alkoxylated and glycolated polythiophenes. The force field is validated against known packing motifs for their monomer crystals. MD simulations, coupled with X&#8208;ray Diffraction (XRD), show that alkoxylated polythiophenes will pack with a &#8216;tilted stack&#8217; and straight interdigitating side chains, whilst their glycolated counterpart will pack with a &#8216;deflected stack&#8217; and an s&#8208;bend side chain configuration. MD simulations reveal water penetration pathways into the alkoxylated and glycolated crystals &#8208; through the &#960;&#8208;stack and through the lamellar stack respectively. Finally, the two distinct ways tri&#8208;ethylene glycol polymers can bind to cations are revealed, showing the formation of a meta&#8208;stable single bound state, or an energetically deep double bound state, both with a strong side chain length dependance. The minimum energy pathways for the formation of the chelates are identified, showing the physical process through which cations can bind to one or two side chains of a glycolated polythiophene, with consequences for ion transport in bithiophene semiconductors.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Molecule Memristor based on an Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Driven Dynamical Structure Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;molecule memristor with long&#8208;lasting retained memory states, high write&#8211;erase endurance, and adjustable on/off ratio is realized by a novel mechanism&#8212;dynamical structure reconfiguration in the Fries rearrangement. Precise manipulation of the potential energy surface of the reaction by external electric fields can retain and switch the corresponding desired species along the reaction coordinate to achieve a memory effect.








Abstract
A robust single&#8208;molecule memristor is prepared by covalently integrating one phenol molecule with multiple binding sites into nanogapped graphene electrodes. Multilevel resistance switching is realized by the electric&#8208;field&#8208;manipulated reconfiguration of the acyl moiety on the phenol center, that is, the Fries rearrangement. In situ measurements of the reaction trajectories with an initial single substrate and an intermediate break through the limitation of macroscopic experiments, therefore unveiling both intramolecular and intermolecular mechanistic pathways (a long&#8208;term controversy) as well as comprehensive dynamic information. Based on this advance, high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule memristors in both the solution and solid states are achieved successively, providing a new understanding of memristive systems and neural network computing.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Reporting Fluorescent Salicylaldehyde&#8211;Chlorambucil Conjugate as a Type&#8208;II ICD Inducer for Cancer Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemotherapeutic type&#8208;II immunogenic cell death inducer. SA&#8208;Cbl. with fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ability is developed by simple conjugation of chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil with salicylaldehyde. The long&#8208;lasting effect of antitumor immunity of SA&#8208;Cbl is proved to be more effective than the non&#8208;endoplasmic reticulum&#8208;targeted drug doxorubicin via an in vivo model.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can activate the anticancer immune response and is highly attractive to improve cancer treatment efficacy. ICD is closely related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and a series of ICD inducers has recently been reported based on ER&#8208;targeted photodynamic/photothermal agents or metal complexes. However, these ER&#8208;targeted ICD inducers suffer from complicated synthesis and heavy&#8208;metal cytotoxicity. Inspired by the promising clinical potential of small organic molecules, herein, an ER&#8208;targeted fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducer, SA&#8208;Cbl, is developed by simple conjugation of the chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil (Cbl) with salicylaldehyde (SA). SA&#8208;Cbl can selectively accumulate in the ER to induce rapid ROS generation and an unfolded protein response process, which leads to a fast release of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and efficient dendritic cells maturation. Meanwhile, the ER&#8208;targeted accumulation and ER&#8208;stress&#8208;inducing process can be in situ monitored based on the turn&#8208;on fluorescence of SA&#8208;Cbl, which is highly pH&#8208; and polarity&#8208;sensitive and can selectively interact with ER proteins. Compared with the traditional chemotherapy drug doxorubicin, the superior anticancer immunity effect of SA&#8208;Cbl is verified via an in vivo tumor model. This study thus provides a new strategy for developing fluorescent self&#8208;reporting ICD inducers by decoration of chemotherapeutic drugs with pH and polarity&#8208;sensitive organic fluorophores.

&lt;p&gt;A chemotherapeutic type-II immunogenic cell death inducer. SA-Cbl. with fluorescent self-reporting ability is developed by simple conjugation of chemotherapeutic drug chlorambucil with salicylaldehyde. The long-lasting effect of antitumor immunity of SA-Cbl is proved to be more effective than the non-endoplasmic reticulum-targeted drug doxorubicin via an in vivo model.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunogenic cell death (ICD) can activate the anticancer immune response and is highly attractive to improve cancer treatment efficacy. ICD is closely related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and a series of ICD inducers has recently been reported based on ER-targeted photodynamic/photothermal agents or metal complexes. However, these ER-targeted ICD inducers suffer from complicated synthesis and heavy-metal cytotoxicity.

Meanwhile, the ER-targeted accumulation and ER-stress-inducing process can be in situ monitored based on the turn-on fluorescence of SA-Cbl, which is highly pH- and polarity-sensitive and can selectively interact with ER proteins.

Abstract
Polyaryletherketone (PAEK) is emerging as an important high&#8208;performance polymer material in additive manufacturing (AM) benefiting from its excellent mechanical properties, good biocompatibility, and high&#8208;temperature stability. The distinct advantages of AM facilitate the rapid development of PAEK products with complex customized structures and functionalities, thereby enhancing their applications in various fields. Herein, the recent advances on AM of high&#8208;performance PAEKs are comprehensively reviewed, concerning the materials properties, AM processes, mechanical properties, and potential applications of additively manufactured PAEKs. To begin, an introduction to fundamentals of AM and PAEKs, as well as the advantages of AM of PAEKs is provided. Discussions are then presented on the material properties, AM processes, processing&#8211;matter coupling mechanism, thermal conductivity, crystallization characteristics, and microstructures of AM&#8208;processed PAEKs. Thereafter, the mechanical properties and anisotropy of additively manufactured PAEKs are discussed in depth. Their representative applications in biomedical, aerospace, electronics, and other fields are systematically presented. Finally, current challenges and possible solutions are discussed for the future development of high&#8208;performance AM polymers.

         <title>Releasable Water Charge&#8208;Trapping and Water&#8208;Resistant Photodetection using 1D Perovskitoid Hydrate Single Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Releasable water charge&#8208;trapping is observed from the transient absorption spectra in a quasi&#8208;1D perovskitoid single&#8208;crystal hydrate, and a dynamic model is proposed to interpret the charge trapping and release processes. Besides, water&#8208;resistant photodetection devices are fabricated based on this single crystal.








Abstract
Hydrates of hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites have been discovered with MAPbI3 and are proved to be unstable in atmosphere. However, the influence of water molecules on the performance of optoelectronic devices is still not fully understood. Here, using a dication, 2&#8208;(dimethylamino) ethylamine (DMEN2+), a stable quasi&#8208;1D&#160;perovskitoid hydrate single crystal is designed and successfully synthesized, which is formulated as DMENPb2I6&#183;H2O. In this design, both corner&#8208;sharing and edge&#8208;sharing connectivity are adopted, and water molecules are connected with the crystal through hydrogen bonding. It is discovered that such water sites distributed along the inorganic chains function both as charge traps and as releasable charge stocks. Optical excitation that overcomes the potential wells formed on these water sites may release these stocked charges and facilitate enhanced transportable charge density. Meanwhile, exciton diffusion and charge transport are strongly confined in the 1D transport channels. Above mechanisms are verified both by the transient absorption spectroscopy and by the photodetection performance. This introduces a new design strategy with a trapping&#8211;stock&#8211;releasing&#8211;transport roadmap for perovskitoid materials. Excellent water resistance endows this material with more advantages in the development of a new generation of optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 25% Realized by Co&#8208;Spacer Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By mixing m&#8208;F&#8208;PEA and NMAI to act as large organic cations in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, the phase distribution control and defect passivation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films are realized. As a result, excellent red light emission is achieved with recorded efficiency as high as 25.8% and the maximum luminance exceeding 1300 cd cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have received great attention in recent years due to their narrow emission bandwidth and tunable emission spectrum. Efficient red emission is one of most important parts for lighting and displays. Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites can deliver high emission efficiency due to the strong carrier confinement, while the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of red quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs are inefficient at present, which is due to the complex distribution of different n&#8208;value phases in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films. In this work, the phase distribution of the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite is finely controlled by mixing two different large organic cations, which effectively reduces the amount of smaller n&#8208;index phases, meanwhile the passivation of lead and halide defects in perovskite films is realized. Accordingly, the PeLEDs show 25.8% EQE and 1300&#160;cd m&#8722;2 maximum brightness at 680&#160;nm, which exhibits the highest performance for red PeLEDs up to now.

         <title>Intelligent Micro&#8208;/Nanorobots for Cancer Theragnostic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview on the recent advances of micro&#8208;/nanorobots&#8208;based cancer theragnostic is presented, ranging from actuation engines, diagnostics, medical imaging, and targeted drug delivery, as well as highlighting the most promising research opportunities for the next decade that can have a profound impact on cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer is one of the most intractable diseases owing to its high mortality rate and lack of effective diagnostic and treatment tools. Advancements in micro&#8208;/nanorobot (MNR)&#8208;assisted sensing, imaging, and therapeutics offer unprecedented opportunities to develop MNR&#8208;based cancer theragnostic platforms. Unlike ordinary nanoparticles, which exhibit Brownian motion in biofluids, MNRs overcome viscous resistance in an ultralow Reynolds number (Re &lt;&lt; 1) environment by effective self&#8208;propulsion. This unique locomotion property has motivated the advanced design and functionalization of MNRs as a basis for next&#8208;generation cancer&#8208;therapy platforms, which offer the potential for precise distribution and improved permeation of therapeutic agents. Enhanced barrier penetration, imaging&#8208;guided operation, and biosensing are additionally studied to enable the promising cancer&#8208;related applications of MNRs. Herein, the recent advances in MNR&#8208;based cancer therapy are comprehensively addresses, including actuation engines, diagnostics, medical imaging, and targeted drug delivery; promising research opportunities that can have a profound impact on cancer therapy over the next decade is highlighted.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;up Interfacial Design of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient and Selective Electrocatalysis of CO2</title>

Abstract
Assembling molecular catalytic centers into crosslinked networks is widely used to fabricate heterogeneous catalysts but they often suffer loss in activity and selectivity accompanied by unclear causes. Here we report a strategy for the construction of heterogeneous catalysts to induce activity and selectivity by bottom&#8208;up introduction of segregated electron conduction and mass transport interfaces into the catalytic materials. The catalytic skeletons are designed to possess different &#960; orderings for electron motion and the open channels are tailored to install finely engineered walls for mass transport, so that origins of activity and selectivity are correlated. The resultant covalent organic framework catalysts with ordered &#960; skeletons and solvophobic pores increased activity by two orders of magnitude, enhanced selectivity and energy efficiency by 70&#8208;fold, and broadened voltage range, to promote CO2 transformation under ambient conditions. Our results open a way to precise interfacial design for actionable heterogeneous catalysts for producing feedstocks from CO2.

         <title>Top&#8208;Layer Engineering Reshapes Charge Transfer at Polar Oxide Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polar discontinuity at the interface between ferromagnetic insulating double&#8208;perovskite La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) and SrTiO3 triggers the formation of Mn3+ at both LNMO interfaces. Such electron doping is detrimental to Ni/Mn ordering and Curie temperature of films thinner than 10 uc. Engineering the charge transfer with a LaNiO3 overlayer results in optimized ferromagnetic properties, only restricted by dimensionality effects.








Abstract
Charge&#8208;transfer phenomena at heterointerfaces are a promising pathway to engineer functionalities absent in bulk materials but can also lead to degraded properties in ultrathin films. Mitigating such undesired effects with an interlayer reshapes the interface architecture, restricting its operability. Therefore, developing less&#8208;invasive methods to control charge transfer will be beneficial. Here, an appropriate top&#8208;interface design allows for remote manipulation of the charge configuration of the buried interface and concurrent restoration of the ferromagnetic trait of the whole film. Double&#8208;perovskite insulating ferromagnetic La2NiMnO6 (LNMO) thin films grown on perovskite oxide substrates are investigated as a model system. An oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;assisted electronic reconstruction takes place initially at the LNMO polar interfaces. As a result, the magnetic properties of 2&#8211;5 unit cell LNMO films are affected beyond dimensionality effects. The introduction of a top electron&#8208;acceptor layer redistributes the electron excess and restores the ferromagnetic properties of the ultrathin LNMO films. Such a strategy can be extended to other interfaces and provides an advanced approach to fine&#8208;tune the electronic features of complex multilayered heterostructures.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Rich MXene&#8208;Immobilized Ni Single Atoms as a High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalyst for the Hydrazine Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts on Ti defect&#8208;rich Ti3C2Tx MXene are fabricated via a combined defect&#8208;trapping and &#8220;self&#8208;reduction&#8221; process. The optimal Ni SACs on Ti3C2Tx MXene at a Ni loading of 2.93 wt% exhibit superior&#160;catalytic performance for the electrochemical hydrazine oxidation reaction, which is attributed to the optimal electronic density of states that enhances the adsorption energy and lowers the reaction energy barrier.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), on account of their outstanding catalytic potential, are currently emerging&#160;as high&#8208;performance materials in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Constructing a strong interaction between the single atom and its supporting matrix plays a pivotal role. Herein, Ti3C2Tx&#8208;MXene&#8208;supported Ni SACs are reported by using a self&#8208;reduction strategy via the assistance of rich Ti vacancies on the Ti3C2Tx MXene surface, which act as the trap and anchor sites for individual Ni atoms. The constructed Ni SACs supported by the Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ni SACs/Ti3C2Tx ) show an ultralow onset potential of &#8722;0.03 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and an exceptional operational stability toward the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Density functional theory calculations suggest a strong coupling of the Ni single atoms and their&#160;surrounding C atoms, which optimizes the electronic density of states, increasing the adsorption energy and decreasing the reaction activation energy, thus boosting the electrochemical activity. The results presented here will encourage a wider pursuit of 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;supported SACs designed by a vacancy&#8208;trapping strategy.

         <title>Efficient Electroreduction of Nitrate into Ammonia at Ultralow Concentrations Via an Enrichment Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu nanoparticles encapsulated with porous carbon framework are developed as an efficient electrocatalyst for nitrate (NO3&#8722;) electroreduction at ultralow concentrations. Benefiting from the enrichment effect of porous carbon framework, the yield rate of NH3 for the electrocatalyst reached 469.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;.








Abstract
The electroreduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) pollutants to ammonia (NH3)&#160;offers an alternative approach for both wastewater treatment and NH3 synthesis. Numerous electrocatalysts have been reported for the electroreduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3, but most of them demonstrate poor performance at ultralow NO3&#8722; concentrations. In this study, a Cu&#8208;based catalyst for electroreduction of NO3&#8722; at ultralow concentrations is developed by encapsulating Cu nanoparticles in a porous carbon framework (Cu@C). At &#8722;0.3&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), Cu@C achieves Faradaic efficiency for NH3 of 72.0% with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;, which is 3.6 times higher than that of Cu nanoparticles. Notably, at &#8722;0.9&#160;V vs RHE, the yield rate of NH3 for Cu@C is 469.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, which is the highest value reported for electrocatalysts with 1&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m NO3&#8722;. An investigation of the mechanism reveals that NO3&#8722; can be concentrated owing to the enrichment effect of the porous carbon framework in Cu@C, thereby facilitating the mass transfer of NO3&#8722; for efficient electroreduction into NH3 at ultralow concentrations.

The catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than 2000 h, while an average ammonia production rate of 27.84 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial level current density of 366 mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved.








Abstract
Nitrate electrocatalytic reduction (NO3RR) for ammonia production is a promising strategy to close the N&#8208;cycle from nitration contamination, as well as an alternative to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process with less energy consumption and carbon dioxide release. However, current long&#8208;term stability of NO3RR catalysts is usually tens of hours, far from the requirements for industrialization. Here, symmetry&#8208;broken Cusingle&#8208;atom catalysts are designed, and the catalytic activity is retained after operation for more than 2000 h, while an average ammonia production rate of 27.84&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at an industrial level current density of 366&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved, obtaining a good balance between catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability. Coordination symmetry breaking is achieved by embedding one Cu atom in graphene nanosheets with two N and two O atoms in the cis&#8208;configuration, effectively lowering the coordination symmetry, rendering the active site more polar, and accumulating more NO3&#8722; near the electrocatalyst surface. Additionally, the cis&#8208;coordination splits the Cu 3d orbitals, which generates an orbital&#8208;symmetry&#8208;matched &#960;&#8208;complex of the key intermediate *ONH and reduces the energy barrier, compared with the &#963;&#8208;complex generated with other catalysts. These results reveal the critical role of coordination symmetry in single&#8208;atom catalysts, prompting the design of more coordination&#8208;symmetry&#8208;broken electrocatalysts toward possible industrialization.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Rechargeable Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity rechargeable K&#8211;Te battery is successfully fabricated. The kinetic barrier in the thick Te cathode is knocked down by the in situ electrochemical self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous Cu1.4Te as a fast ionic pathway, and meanwhile, the K&#8208;metal anode is stabilized by electrolyte regulation. This approach could be extended to other low&#8208;temperature alkali&#8208;metal&#8211;chalcogen battery systems (Li&#8211;S, Li&#8211;Se, Na&#8211;S, Na&#8211;Se, etc.).








Abstract
High mass loading and high areal capacity are key metrics for commercial batteries, which are usually limited by the large charge&#8208;transfer impedance in thick electrodes. This can be kinetically deteriorated under low temperatures, and the realization of high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity batteries in cold climates remains challenging. Herein, a low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity rechargeable potassium&#8211;tellurium (K&#8211;Te) battery is successfully fabricated by knocking down the kinetic barriers in the cathode and pairing it with stable anode. Specifically, the in situ electrochemical self&#8208;reconstruction of amorphous Cu1.4Te in a thick electrode is realized simply by coating micro&#8208;sized Te on the Cu collector, significantly improving its ionic conductivity. Meanwhile, the optimized electrolyte enables fast ion transportation and a stable K&#8208;metal anode at a large current density and areal capacity. Consequently, this K&#8211;Te battery achieves a high areal capacity of 1.25&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, which greatly exceeds those of most reported works. This work highlights the significance of electrode design and electrolyte engineering for high areal capacity at low temperatures, and represents a critical step toward practical applications of low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>A Chiral Dual&#8208;Core Organoboron Structure Realizes Dual&#8208;Channel Enhanced Ultrapure Blue Emission and Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;core strategy, chiral organoboron structures are prepared by direct bonding of two multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) monocores, realizing superior chiroptical property and dual&#8208;channel enhanced ultrapure blue emission. Furthermore, highly efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with maximum external quantum efficiencies of 23.9% and 25.6% are achieved.








Abstract
The realization of luminescent materials with narrowband and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of great significance for the development of future optical and photonic devices. Herein, through a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;core strategy, two pairs of chiral dual&#8208;core multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials (R/S&#8208;DOBN and R/S&#8208;DOBNT) are directly constructed by the bonding of two organoboron MR&#8208;TADF monocores (SOBN and SOBNT) with carbazole/3,6&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole and phenol derivative as donors, realizing obvious CPL and narrowband emissions. Furthermore, the dual&#8208;core effect in the prepared R/S&#8208;DOBN and R/S&#8208;DOBNT increases the transition oscillator strength two times more than that of a monocore structure, while maintaining the ultrapure blue emissions peaking at 453 and 459&#160;nm with a narrower full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 21&#160;nm through reorganization energy reduction. The circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the enantiomers exhibit ultrapure blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.10) and (0.13, 0.12), high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 23.9% and 25.6%, and obvious circularly polarized electroluminescence with dissymmetry factors (|gEL|) &#8776; 10&#8722;3.

         <title>A Van Der Waals Reconfigurable Multi&#8208;Valued Logic Device and Circuit Based on Tunable Negative&#8208;Differential&#8208;Resistance Phenomenon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reconfigurable, multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance device with an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced tunability of multiple threshold voltages is proposed. Following the successful verification of the tunability of multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance phenomenon, the reconfigurability in terms of the function of multi&#8208;valued logic circuits, from ternary inverter to latch circuit, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;valued logic (MVL) technology that utilizes more than two logic states has recently been reconsidered because of the demand for greater power saving in current binary logic systems. Extensive efforts have been invested in developing MVL devices with multiple threshold voltages by adopting negative differential transconductance and resistance. In this study, a reconfigurable, multiple negative&#8208;differential&#8208;resistance (m&#8208;NDR) device with an electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced tunability of multiple threshold voltages is reported, which comprises a BP/ReS2 heterojunction and a ReS2/h&#8208;BN/metal capacitor. Tunability for the m&#8208;NDR phenomenon is achieved via the resistance modulation of the ReS2 layer by electrical pulses applied to the capacitor region. Reconfigurability is verified in terms of the function of an MVL circuit composed of a reconfigurable m&#8208;NDR device and a load transistor, wherein staggered&#8208;type and broken&#8208;type double peak&#8208;NDR device operations are adopted for ternary inverter and latch circuits, respectively.

The urinalysis device achieves the reliable identification of five bladder&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated proteins in urine samples. Integrated with a machine&#8208;learning algorithm, the device realizes a 95.0% bladder cancer diagnosis accuracy and can classify cancer stages with a 90.0% accuracy.








Abstract
Urinalysis is attractive in non&#8208;invasive early diagnosis of bladder cancer compared with clinical gold standard cystoscopy. However, the trace bladder tumor biomarkers in urine and the particularly complex urine environment pose significant challenges for urinalysis. Here, a clinically adoptable urinalysis device that integrates molecular&#8208;specificity indium gallium zinc oxide field&#8208;effect transistor (IGZO FET) biosensor arrays, a device control panel, and an internet terminal for directly analyzing five bladder&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated proteins in clinical urine samples, is reported for bladder cancer diagnosis and classification. The IGZO FET biosensors with engineered sensing interfaces provide high sensitivity and selectivity for identification of trace proteins in the complex urine environment. Integrating with a machine&#8208;learning algorithm, this device can identify bladder cancer with an accuracy of 95.0% in a cohort of 197 patients and 75 non&#8208;bladder&#160;cancer individuals, distinguishing cancer stages with an overall accuracy of 90.0% and assessing bladder cancer recurrence after surgical treatment. The non&#8208;invasive urinalysis device defines a robust technology for remote healthcare and personalized medicine.

         <title>3D Hydrogel Evaporator with Vertical Radiant Vessels Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off between Thermal Localization and Salt Resistance for Solar Desalination of High&#8208;Salinity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

A 3D hydrogel evaporator with vertical radiant vessels (VR&#8208;evaporator) is prepared to surmount the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between thermal localization and salt resistance for solar desalination of high&#8208;salinity, thereby achieving a groundbreaking overall performance.








Abstract
Delivering sufficient water to the evaporation surface/interface is one of the most widely adopted strategies to overcome salt accumulation in solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination. However, water transport and heat conduction loss are positively correlated, resulting in the trade&#8208;off between thermal localization and salt resistance. Herein, a 3D hydrogel evaporator with vertical radiant vessels is prepared to surmount the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off, thereby achieving high&#8208;rate and stable solar desalination of high&#8208;salinity. Experiments and numerical simulations reveal that the unique hierarchical structure, which consists of a large vertical vessel channel, radiant vessels, and porous vessel walls, facilitates strong self&#8208;salt&#8208;discharge and low longitudinal thermal conductivity. With the structure employed, a groundbreaking comprehensive performance, under one sun illumination, of evaporation rate as high as 3.53&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1, salinity of 20&#160;wt%, and a continuous 8&#160;h evaporation is achieved, which thought to be the best reported result from a salt&#8208;free system. This work showcases the preparation method of a novel hierarchical microstructure, and also provides pivotal insights into the design of next&#8208;generation solar evaporators of high&#8208;efficiency and salt tolerance.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrostrictive Relaxors with Dispersive Endotaxial Nanoprecipitations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via the construction of novel local heterostructures of polar nanoregions and endotaxial nanoprecipitations with a nonpolar core in relaxor ferroelectric ceramics, an unprecedentedly large hysteresis&#8208;free strain is achieved under a low stimulated electric field, which is suitable for the application of ultrahigh precision actuator systems. The new strategy can open a new realm for the design of high&#8208;performance ferroelectric relaxors.








Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;precision manufacturing and detection have highlighted the importance of investigating electrostrictive materials with a weak stimulated extrinsic electric field and a simultaneous large hysteresis&#8208;free strain. In this study, a new type of electrostrictive relaxor ferroelectric is designed by constructing a complex inhomogeneous local structure to realize excellent electrostrictive properties. A remarkably large electrostrictive coefficient, M33 (8 &#215; 10&#8722;16 m2 V&#8722;2) is achieved. Through a combined atomic&#8208;scale scanning transmission electron microscopy and advanced in situ high&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis, it is observed that such superior electrostrictive properties can be ascribed to a special domain structure that consists of endotaxial nanoprecipitations embedded in a polar matrix at the phase boundary of the rhombohedral/tetragonal/cubic phases. The matrix contributes to the high strain response under the weak extrinsic electric field because of the highly flexible polarization and randomly dispersed endotaxial nanoprecipitations with a nonpolar central region, which provide a strong restoring force that reduces the strain hysteresis. The approach developed in this study is widely applicable to numerous relaxor ferroelectrics, as well as other dielectrics, for further enhancing their electrical properties, such as electrostriction and energy&#8208;storage capacity.

         <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties of Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Micro&#8211;Nano Fibers via Thermal Drawing and Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micro&#8211;nano Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric fibers with an interfacial engineering effect are fabricated by thermal drawing. The 4 &#181;m&#8208;diameter fibers achieve a figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value (ZT &#8776; 1.4) at 300 K and show a reversible bending radius smaller than 50 &#181;m, approaching the theoretical limit of elastic strain. This fabrication strategy works for large&#8208;scale inorganic thermoelectric materials and benefits the development of fiber&#8208;based thermoelectric devices.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance thermoelectric (TE) materials with great flexibility and stability are urgently needed to efficiently convert heat energy into electrical power. Recently, intrinsically crystalline, mechanically stable, and flexible inorganic TE fibers that show TE properties comparable to their bulk counterparts have been&#160;of interest to researchers. Despite remarkable progress in moving TE fibers toward room&#8208;temperature TE conversion, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value (ZT) and bending stability still need enhancement. Herein, interfacial&#8208;engineering&#8208;enhanced TE properties of micro&#8211;nano polycrystalline TE fibers fabricated by thermally drawing Bi2Te3&#8208;based bulks in a glass&#8208;fiber template are reported. The interfacial engineering effect comes from generating stress&#8208;induced oriented nanocrystals to increase electrical conductivity and producing strain&#8208;distorted interfaces to decrease thermal conductivity. The 4 &#181;m&#8208;diameter fibers achieve a 40% higher ZT (&#8776;1.4 at 300&#160;K) than their bulk counterparts and show a reversible bending radius of 50&#160;&#181;m, approaching the theoretical elastic limit. This fabrication strategy works for a wide range of inorganic TE materials and benefits the development of fiber&#8208;based micro&#8208;TE devices.

         <title>Halide Remixing under Device Operation Imparts Stability on Mixed&#8208;Cation Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskite compositions represent a promising route toward achieving stable and efficient solar cells. Here, the structural evolution of these absorber layers during full device operation is investigated via operando X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. A stabilizing compressive strain effect leading to the remixing of the halide population is unveiled, providing insight into new strategies toward increased device lifetimes and stability.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskites are among the most promising perovskite compositions for application in a variety of optoelectronic devices due to their high performance, low cost, and bandgap&#8208;tuning capabilities. Instability pathways such as those driven by ionic migration, however, continue to hinder their further progress. Here, an operando variable&#8208;pitch synchrotron grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering technique is used to track the surface and bulk structural changes in mixed&#8208;halide mixed&#8208;cation perovskite solar cells under continuous load and illumination. By monitoring the evolution of the material structure, it is demonstrated that halide remixing along the electric field and illumination direction during operation hinders phase segregation and limits device instability. Correlating the evolution with directionality&#8208; and depth&#8208;dependent analyses, it is proposed that this halide remixing is induced by an electrostrictive effect acting along the substrate out&#8208;ofplane direction. However, this stabilizing effect is overwhelmed by competing halide demixing processes in devices exposed to humid air or with poorer starting performance. The findings shed new light on understanding halide de&#8208; and re&#8208;mixing competitions and their impact on device longevity. These operando techniques allow real&#8208;time tracking of the structural evolution in full optoelectronic devices and unveil otherwise inaccessible insights into rapid structural evolution under external stress&#160;conditions.

Correlating the evolution with directionality- and depth-dependent analyses, it is proposed that this halide remixing is induced by an electrostrictive effect acting along the substrate out&lt;span style="text-decoration:underline"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;ofplane direction. However, this stabilizing effect is overwhelmed by competing halide demixing processes in devices exposed to humid air or with poorer starting performance. The findings shed new light on understanding halide de- and re-mixing competitions and their impact on device longevity. These operando techniques allow real-time tracking of the structural evolution in full optoelectronic devices and unveil otherwise inaccessible insights into rapid structural evolution under external stress&#160;conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Surface&#8208;Mimicking Protein Secondary Structure as Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Chimaeras for Self&#8208;Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of photodynamic semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with surface mimicking protein secondary structure (SPSS NPs) is developed to achieve self&#8208;synergistic cancer immunotherapy by combining excellent immunogenic cell death and lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaera&#8208;like multivalent programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1&#160;blockade. SPSS NPs can not only effectively suppress both primary tumor and distant tumor, but also evoke long&#8208;term immunological memory against tumor rechallenge.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has received tremendous attention for tumor treatment, but the efficacy is greatly hindered by insufficient tumor&#8208;infiltration of immune cells and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The strategy that can efficiently activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes and inhibit negative immune regulators will greatly amplify immunotherapy outcome, which is however very rare. Herein, a new kind of semiconducting polymer (SP) nanoparticles is developed, featured with surface&#8208;mimicking protein secondary structure (SPSS NPs) for self&#8208;synergistic cancer immunotherapy by combining immunogenic cell death (ICD) and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The SPs with excellent photodynamic property are synthesized by rational fluorination, which can massively induce ICD. Additionally, the peptide antagonists are introduced and self&#8208;assembled into &#946;&#8208;sheet protein secondary structures on the photodynamic NP surface via preparation process optimization, which function as efficient lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras (LYTACs) to mediate the degradation of programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#160;in lysosome. In vivo experiments demonstrate that SPSS NPs can not only elicit strong antitumor immunity to suppress both primary tumor and distant tumor, but also evoke long&#8208;term immunological memory against tumor rechallenge. This work introduces a new kind of robust immunotherapy agents by combining well&#8208;designed photosensitizer&#8208;based ICD induction and protein secondary structures&#8208;mediated LYTAC&#8208;like multivalence PD&#8208;L1&#160;blockade, rendering great promise for synergistic immunotherapy.

         <title>Nonhalogenated Dual&#8208;Slot&#8208;Die Processing Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective strategy of dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS)&#160;is developed. Highly efficient nonhalogenated organic solar cells are fabricated by slot&#8208;die coating by the DSDS strategy without additives and complex post&#8208;treatments.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies, with their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 19%. However, the typically used spin&#8208;coating method, toxic halogenated processing solvents, and the conventional bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ), which causes excessive charge recombination, hamper the commercialization and further efficiency promotion of OSCs. Here, a simple but effective dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS) strategy is proposed to address the above issues by achieving a continuous solution supply, avoiding the solubility limit of the nonhalogen solvents, and creating a graded&#8208;BHJ morphology. As a result, an excellent PCE of 17.07% is obtained with the device processed with o&#8208;xylene in an open&#8208;air environment with no post&#8208;treatment required, while a PCE of over 14% is preserved in a wide range of active&#8208;layer thickness. The unique film&#8208;formation mechanism is further identified during the DSDS processing, which suggests the formation of the graded&#8208;BHJ morphology by the mutual diffusion between the donor and acceptor and the subsequent progressive aggregation. The graded&#8208;BHJ structure leads to improved charge transport, inhibited charge recombination, and thus an excellent PCE. Therefore, the newly developed DSDS approach can effectively contribute to the realm of high&#8208;efficiency and eco&#8208;friendly OSCs, which can also possibly be generalized to other organic photoelectric devices.

         <title>A Euryhaline&#8208;Fish&#8208;Inspired Salinity Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanofluidic Diode Leads to High&#8208;Performance Blue Energy Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel system is constructed to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes, which lead to a high&#8208;performance salinity&#8208;gradient power generator with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, the pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from a 1D straight nanochannel to 3D network pores, along with three orders of magnitude change for charge density.








Abstract
The adaptability to wide salinities remains a big challenge for artificial nanofluidic systems, which plays a vital role in water&#8211;energy nexus science. Here, inspired by euryhaline fish, sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel systems are constructed to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes, which lead to high&#8208;performance salinity&#8208;gradient power generators with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, the pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from a 1D straight nanochannel&#160;(45 nm) to 3D network pores (1.9 nm pore size and &#8776;1013 pore density), along with three orders of magnitude change for charge density. Thus, the abundant surface charges and narrow pores render the membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generator with power density up to 26.22 Wm&#8722;2. The salinity&#8208;adaptive membrane solves the surface charge&#8208;shielding problem caused by abundant mobile ions in high salinity and increases the overlapping degree of the electric double layer. The dynamic adaption process of the membrane to the hypersaline environment endows it with good salt endurance and stability. New routes for designing nanofluidic devices functionally adaptable to different salinities and building power generators with excellent salt endurance are demonstrated.

         <title>Accessing Excitation&#8208; and Time&#8208;Responsive Afterglows from Aqueous Processable Amorphous Polymer Films through Doping and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart luminescent materials with tunable multicolor afterglows in response to excitation and delay time can be facilely constructed with aqueous processable polymers through physical doping. The afterglow colors can further be finely modulated by the variation of the doping concentration, co&#8208;doping, and the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy&#8208;transfer process.








Abstract
Smart afterglow materials in response to excitation and delay time, including crystals, polymeric films, and carbon dots, have attracted considerable attention on account of their fundamental value in photophysics and promising applications in optoelectronics. However, the fabrication of amorphous and flexible polymer films with fine control remains underexplored. Herein, new doped polymer films based on sodium alginate and aromatic carboxylates are developed, which demonstrate following advantages: (i) easy and fast fabrication through the aqueous solution process, (ii) flexible, transparent, and re&#8208;dissolvable characteristics, (iii) multi&#8208;tunable afterglow colors from blue to red and even white with fine control. Specifically, even better controllability can be achieved through co&#8208;doping and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET). Multimode advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting of these materials is demonstrated using their excitation&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent as well as TS&#8208;FRET&#8208;mediated afterglow colors.

         <title>A Skin&#8208;Inspired Design Integrating Mechano&#8211;Chemical&#8211;Thermal Robustness into Superhydrophobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered coating (STC) concept is proposed. The STC solves the contradiction between the superhydrophobicity and other functionalities (such as abrasion resistance, adhesion, and flame retardancy). Based on a step&#8208;by&#8208;step spraying process and feasible control of the components of each layer, continuous interfaces within layers are achieved, endowing the integration of excellent overall performances into one coating.








Abstract
Designing scalable coatings with a wide spectrum of functions such as liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and antiflaming and a high level of mechano&#8211;chemical&#8211;thermal robustness is crucial in real&#8208;life applications. However, these individual functionalities and robustness are coupled together or even have conflicting requirements on the interfacial or bulky properties of materials, and&#160;thus,&#160;simultaneously integrating all these individual features into one coating has proved challenging. Herein, an integral skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered coating (STC) that resolves conflicting demands imposed by individual features on the structural, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties of materials is proposed. Specifically, the rational design of multiple gradients in roughness, wetting, strength, and flame retardancy and the formation of continuous interfaces along its triple layers endow a sustained liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and flame retardancy even under harsh environments, as well as strong antiabrasion on surfaces and adhesion with the substrate. Such an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design enhances the durability and lifetime of coatings and reduces the maintenance and repair, thereby contributing to cost and energy saving. Together with a facile spraying fabrication process, this STC provides a feasible and sustainable strategy for constructing energy and resource&#8208;saving materials.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Derived Isotropic Nanoscale Polycrystalline Graphite Capable of Considerable Plastic Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanoscale polycrystalline graphite (SINPG) is prepared from colloidal organization of nanocapsules to nanograins by gel&#8208;casting in a non&#8208;pressure environment. SINPG exhibits ultrahigh strength, unprecedent plasticity, and excellent deformation, acting as a metallic material in compression tests. The cleavage associated with typical van der Waals materials is avoided with SINPG.








Abstract
Obtaining large plastic deformation in polycrystalline van der Waals (vdW) materials is challenging. Achieving such deformation is especially difficult in graphite because it is highly anisotropic. The development of sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanostructured polycrystalline graphite (SINPG) is discussed herein. The structure of this material preserves the high in&#8208;plane rigidity and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane flexibility of graphene layers and enables prominent plasticity by activating the rotation of nanoscale (5&#8211;10&#160;nm) grains. Thus, micrometer&#8208;sized SINPG samples demonstrate enhanced compressive strengths of up to 3.0&#160;GPa and plastic strains of 30&#8211;50%. These findings suggest a new pathway for enabling plastic deformation in otherwise brittle vdW materials. This new class of nanostructured carbon materials is suitable for use in a broad range of fields, from semiconductor to aerospace applications.

         <title>Intracellular Crowding by Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Hydrogel Formation Induces Reversible Molecular Stasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular crosslinking in living cells using poly(ethylene glycol) macromers is introduced. Increased macromolecular crowding in the cytosol of the cell causes crosslink&#8208;induced quiescence and results in reduced protein translation, cellular motility, and actin dynamics while cell viability remains high. The effects can be reversed through polymer degradation with UV light.








Abstract
To survive extreme conditions, certain animals enter a reversible protective stasis through vitrification of the cytosol by polymeric molecules such as proteins and polysaccharides. In this work, synthetic gelation of the cytosol in living cells is used to induce reversible molecular stasis. Through the sequential lipofectamine&#8208;mediated transfection of complementary poly(ethylene glycol) macromers into mammalian cells, intracellular crosslinking occurs through bio&#8208;orthogonal strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition click reactions. This achieves efficient polymer uptake with minimal cell death (99% viable). Intracellular crosslinking decreases DNA replication and protein synthesis, and increases the quiescent population by 2.5&#8208;fold. Real&#8208;time tracking of single cells containing intracellular crosslinked polymers identifies increases in intermitotic time (15 h&#160;vs 19 h) and decreases in motility (30 &#181;m h&#8722;1&#160;vs 15&#160;&#181;m h&#8722;1). The cytosol viscosity increases threefold after intracellular crosslinking and results in disordered cytoskeletal structure in addition to the disruption of cellular coordination in a scratch assay. By incorporating photodegradable nitrobenzyl moieties into the polymer backbone, the effects of intracellular crosslinking are reversed upon exposure to light, thereby restoring proliferation (80% phospho&#8208;Rb+ cells), protein translation, and migration. Reversible intracellular crosslinking provides a novel method for dynamic manipulation of intracellular mechanics, altering essential processes that determine cellular function.

         <title>Recording Temperature with Magnetic Supraparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Temperature is one of the most important external influences for materials. In this work, the design, working principle, and tunability of temperature&#8208;indicator supraparticles are presented. These supraparticles can record and memorize thermal influences up to 170&#160;&#176;C with a spectral magnetic readout. The magnetic signals are independent of optical constraints and can thus be utilized to obtain information from within dark, solid objects.








Abstract
Small&#8208;sized temperature indicator additives autonomously record temperature events via a gradual irreversible signal change. This permits, for instance, the indication of possible cold&#8208;chain breaches or failure of electronics but also curing of glues. Thus, information about the materials&#8217; thermal history can be obtained upon signal detection at every point of interest. In this work, maximum&#8208;temperature indicators with magnetic readout based on micrometer&#8208;sized supraparticles (SPs) are introduced. The magnetic signal transduction is, by nature, independent of the materials&#8217; optical properties. This facilitates the determination of valuable temperature information from the inside, that is, the bulk, even of dark and opaque macroscopic objects, which might differ from their surface. Compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art optical temperature indicators, complementary magnetic readout characteristics ultimately expand their applicability. The conceptualized SPs are hierarchically structured assemblies of environmentally friendly, inexpensive iron oxide nanoparticles and thermoplastic polymer. Irreversible structural changes, induced by polymer softening, yield magnetic interaction changes within and between the hierarchic sub&#8208;structures, which are distinguishable and define the temperature indication mechanism. The fundamental understanding of the SPs&#8217; working principle enables customization of the particles&#8217; working range, response time, and sensitivity, using a toolbox&#8208;like manufacturing approach. The magnetic signal change is detected self&#8208;referenced, fast, and contactless.

         <title>Electrochemical Construction of Edge&#8208;Contacted Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Junctions with Low Contact Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach is developed for constructing high&#8208;quality metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions through the edge&#8208;guided electrodeposition. Cross&#8208;sectional imaging and transport measurements confirm the seamless contact of Pd with each layer of MoS2 greatly reduces the contact barrier to &#8776;20 meV and contact resistance to &#8776;290 &#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus significantly increases the performance of FETs with Pd nanowire edge contacts.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, such as MoS2 have emerged as promising ultrathin channel materials for the further scaling of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the contact barrier at the metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions still significantly limits the device's performance. By extending the application of electrochemical deposition in 2D electronics, a distinct approach is developed for constructing metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions in an edge&#8208;contacted configuration through the edge&#8208;guided electrodeposition of varied metals. Both high&#8208;resolution microscopic imaging and electrical transport measurements confirm the successful creation of high&#8208;quality Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions in desired geometry by combining electrodeposition with lithographic patterning. FETs are fabricated on the obtained Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions and it is confirmed that these junctions exhibit a reduced contact barrier of &#8776;20&#160;meV and extremely low contact resistance of 290&#160;&#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus increase the averaged mobility of MoS2 FETs to &#8776;108&#160;cm2 V &#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This approach paves a new way for the construction of metal&#8208;semiconductor junctions and also demonstrates the great potential of the electrochemical deposition technique in 2D electronics.

Cross-sectional imaging and transport measurements confirm the seamless contact of Pd with each layer of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; greatly reduces the contact barrier to &#8776;20 meV and contact resistance to &#8776;290 &#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus significantly increases the performance of FETs with Pd nanowire edge contacts.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D semiconductors, such as MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have emerged as promising ultrathin channel materials for the further scaling of field-effect transistors (FETs). However, the contact barrier at the metal-2D semiconductor junctions still significantly limits the device's performance. By extending the application of electrochemical deposition in 2D electronics, a distinct approach is developed for constructing metal-2D semiconductor junctions in an edge-contacted configuration through the edge-guided electrodeposition of varied metals. Both high-resolution microscopic imaging and electrical transport measurements confirm the successful creation of high-quality Pd-2D MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; junctions in desired geometry by combining electrodeposition with lithographic patterning. FETs are fabricated on the obtained Pd-2D MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; junctions and it is confirmed that these junctions exhibit a reduced contact barrier of &#8776;20&#160;meV and extremely low contact resistance of 290&#160;&#937;&#160;&#181;m and thus increase the averaged mobility of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; FETs to &#8776;108&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V &lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This approach paves a new way for the construction of metal-semiconductor junctions and also demonstrates the great potential of the electrochemical deposition technique in 2D electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Topological Crystalline Insulator Candidate ErAsS with Hourglass Fermion and Magnetic&#8208;Tuned Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered air&#8208;stable topological crystalline insulator (TCI) candidate, ErAsS, is designed and synthesized, which maps the atomic layers in real space to the band topology in momentum space. The distorted As atomic layer and magnetic order of ErAsS induce both the hourglass fermion surface state and the magnetic&#8208;tuned exotic phases including the possible magnetic TCI.








Abstract
Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) with hourglass fermion surface state have attracted a lot of attention and are further enriched by crystalline symmetries and magnetic order. Here, the emergence of hourglass fermion surface state and exotic phases in the newly discovered, air&#8208;stable ErAsS single crystals are shown. In the paramagnetic phase, ErAsS is expected to be a TCI with hourglass fermion surface state protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetry. Dirac&#8208;cone&#8208;like bands and nearly linear dispersions in large energy range are experimentally observed, consistent well with theoretical calculations. Below TN&#160;&#8776; 3.27 K, ErAsS enters a collinear antiferromagnetic state, which is a trivial insulator breaking the time&#8208;reversal symmetry. An intermediate incommensurate magnetic state appears in a narrow temperature range (3.27&#8211;3.65 K), exhibiting an abrupt change in magnetic coupling. The results reveal that ErAsS is an experimentally available TCI candidate and provide a unique platform to understand the formation of hourglass fermion surface state and explore magnetic&#8208;tuned topological phase transitions.

         <title>The Non&#8208;Classical Crystallization Mechanism of a Composite Biogenic Guanine Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By following crystal formation in embryonic spiders, a long&#8208;sought crystallization mechanism for biogenic guanine is revealed. Guanine nucleates from a disordered precursor phase. The crystals grow by the orientated attachment of partially ordered nanogranules into platelets, which coalesce into single crystals, via gradual relaxation of structural defects. The mature guanine is a composite of crystal lamellae intercalated by macromolecular sheets.








Abstract
Spectacular colors and visual phenomena in animals are produced by light interference from highly reflective guanine crystals. Little is known about how organisms regulate crystal morphology to tune the optics of these systems. By following guanine crystal formation in developing spiders, a crystallization mechanism is elucidated. Guanine crystallization is a &#8220;non&#8208;classical,&#8221; multistep process involving a progressive ordering of states. Crystallization begins with nucleation of partially ordered nanogranules from a disordered precursor phase. Growth proceeds by orientated attachment of the nanogranules into platelets which coalesce into single crystals, via progressive relaxation of structural defects. Despite their prismatic morphology, the platelet texture is retained in the final crystals, which are composites of crystal lamellae and interlamellar sheets. Interactions between the macromolecular sheets and the planar face of guanine appear to direct nucleation, favoring platelet formation. These findings provide insights on how organisms control the morphology and optical properties of molecular crystals.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich Molybdenum Sulfide Quantum Dots for Amplified Photoluminescence and Photonics&#8208;Driven Reactive Oxygen Species Generation</title>

Defect&#8208;rich MoS2 QDs are obtained via a mild biomineralization&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up strategy to show enhanced photoluminescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation due to great defect/active sites elevation.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum dots (QDs) with defects have attracted interesting chemistry due to the contribution of vacancies to their unique optical, physical, catalytic, and electrical properties. Engineering defined defects into molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) QDs is challenging. Herein, by applying a mild biomineralization&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up strategy, blue photoluminescent MoS2 QDs (B&#8208;QDs) with a high density of defects are fabricated. The two&#8208;stage synthesis begins with a bottom&#8208;up synthesis of original MoS2 QDs (O&#8208;QDs) through chemical reactions of Mo and sulfide ions, followed by alkaline etching that creates high sulfur&#8208;vacancy defects to eventually form B&#8208;QDs. Alkaline etching significantly increases the photoluminescence (PL) and photo&#8208;oxidation. An increase in defect density is shown to bring about increased active sites and decreased bandgap energy; which is further validated with density functional theory calculations. There is strengthened binding affinity between QDs and O2 due to lower gap energy (&#8710;EST) between S1 and T1, accompanied with improved intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency. Lowered gap energy contributes to assist e&#8722;&#8211;h+ pair formation and the strengthened binding affinity between QDs and 3O2. Defect engineering unravels another dimension of material properties control and can bring fresh new applications to otherwise well characterized TMD nanomaterials.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Mimicking Activity and Radiosensitizing Effect of Bimetallic Clusters to Modulate Tumor Hypoxia for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise alloy clusters Pt2M4 (M = Au, Ag, Cu) are synthesized with bright luminescence and adequate biocompatibility. The experimental results reveal that the Pt2Au4 cluster displays catalase&#8208;like activity and its radiosensitizing effect is the highest. By taking advantage of the sustainable production of O2 via decomposition of endogenous H2O2, the Pt2Au4 cluster modulates tumor hypoxia as well as increases the efficacy of radiotherapy.








Abstract
Alloying is an efficient chemistry to tailor the properties of metal clusters. As a class of promising radiosensitizers, most previously reported metal clusters exhibit unitary function and cannot overcome radioresistance of hypoxic tumors. Here, atomically precise alloy clusters Pt2M4 (M = Au, Ag, Cu) are synthesized with bright luminescence and adequate biocompatibility, and their composition&#8208;dependent enzyme mimicking activity and radiosensitizing effect is explored. Specifically, only the Pt2Au4 cluster displays catalase&#8208;like activity, while the others do not have clusterzyme properties, and its radiosensitizing effect is the highest among all the alloy clusters tested. By taking advantage of the sustainable production of O2 via the decomposition of endogenous H2O2, the Pt2Au4 cluster modulates tumor hypoxia as well as increases the efficacy of radiotherapy. This work thus advances the&#160;cluster alloying strategy to produce multifunctional therapeutic agents for improving hypoxic tumor therapy.

         <title>Perception&#8208;to&#8208;Cognition Tactile Sensing Based on Artificial&#8208;Intelligence&#8208;Motivated Human Full&#8208;Skin Bionic Electronic Skin</title>

An artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin based on vertically integrated triboelectric e&#8208;skin and supercapacitive iontronic e&#8208;skin is proposed through the mimicry of skin structures including human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis. Assisted by the AI&#8208;motivated &#8220;brain,&#8221; the proposed FSB e&#8208;skin can promote the function of tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition.








Abstract
Traditional electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), due to the lack of human&#8208;brain&#8208;like thinking and judging capability, is powerless to accelerate the pace to the intelligent era. Herein, artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis, is proposed. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e&#8208;skin exhibits ultrahigh sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa&#8722;1 (&lt;1&#160;kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa&#8722;1 (1&#8211;34&#160;kPa), and fast response/recovery time of &lt;5.6&#160;ms. In addition, it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a &#8220;brain&#8221;. First, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Second, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis&#8211;dermis&#8211;hypodermis and a five&#8208;layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of the FSB e&#8208;skin with a six&#8208;layer MLP neural network, an advanced intelligent material cognition system is developed for real&#8208;time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.

         <title>Integrating SEI into Layered Conductive Polymer Coatings for Ultrastable Silicon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered conductive polyaniline (LCP) coating is built from a bottom&#8208;up polymer design strategy for Si anodes. The in situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with uniform structure and flexible mechanical property enhances the stability of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Tackling the huge volume expansion of silicon (Si) anode desires a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to prohibit the interfacial side reactions. Here, a layered conductive polyaniline (LCP) coating is built on Si nanoparticles to achieve high areal capacity and long lifespan. The conformal LCP coating stores electrolyte in interlamination spaces and directs an in situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated hybrid SEI skin with uniform distribution of organic and inorganic components, enhancing the flexibility of the SEI to buffer the volume changes and maintaining homogeneous ion transport during cycling. As a result, the Si anode shows a remarkable cycling stability under high areal capacity (&#8776;3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) after 150 cycles and good rate performance of 942&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the great potential of regulating the SEI properties by a layered polymer&#8208;directing SEI formation for the mechanical and electrochemical stabilization of Si anodes.

         <title>Brushed Metals for Rechargeable Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and solvent&#8208;free brushing method is reported to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of metals with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In&#8208;operando study and electrochemical tests demonstrate the improved electrodeposition/dissolution behavior, lower polarization, and higher average coulombic efficiency for P2S5 and MoS2.








Abstract
Battery designs are swiftly changing from metal&#8208;ion to rechargeable metal batteries. Theoretically, metals can deliver maximum anode capacity and enable cells with improved energy density. In practice, these advantages are only possible if the parasitic surface reactions associated with metal anodes are controlled. These undesirable surface reactions are responsible for many troublesome issues, like dendrite formation and accelerated consumption of active materials, which leads to anodes with low cycle life or even battery runaway. Here, a facile and solvent&#8208;free brushing method is reported to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of Li metal with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In&#8208;operando study of P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes in liquid electrolyte cells reveals a smoother electrode contour and more uniform metal electrodeposition and dissolution behavior. The P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes sustain ultralow polarization in symmetric cell for &gt;4000 h, &#8776;8&#215; longer than bare Li anodes. The capacity retention is &#8776;70% higher when P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes are paired with a practical LiFePO4 cathode (&#8776;3.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) after 340 cycles. Brush coating opens a promising avenue to fabricate large&#8208;scale artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase directly on metals without the need for organic solvent.

         <title>A Snakeskin&#8208;Inspired, Soft&#8208;Hinge Kirigami Metamaterial for Self&#8208;Adaptive Conformal Electronic Armor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Survivability in complex environments is in high demand but challenging in flexible electronics or soft robotics. Snakeskin can serve as bioinspiration for employing electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) as a generic strategy to protect itself&#160;and the underlying objects from external damage. Specifically, a new concept of flexible &#8220;E&#8208;armor&#8221; as an upgrade of soft &#8220;E&#8208;skin&#8221; is introduced.








Abstract
A majority of soft&#8208;body creatures evolve armor or shells to protect themselves. Similar protection demand is for flexible electronics working in complex environments. Existing works mainly focus on improving the sensing capabilities such as electronic skin (E&#8208;skin). Inspired by snakeskin, a novel electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) is proposed, which not only possesses mechanical flexibility and electronic functions similar to E&#8208;skin, but is also able to protect itself and the underlying soft body from external physical damage. The geometry of the kirigami mechanical metamaterial (Kiri&#8208;MM) ensures auxetic stretchability and meanwhile large areal coverage for sufficient protection. Moreover, to suppress the inherent but undesired out&#8208;of&#8208;plane buckling of conventional Kiri&#8208;MMs for conformal applications, soft hinges are used to form a distinct soft (hinges)&#8208;rigid (tiles) configuration. Analytical, computational, and experimental studies of the mechanical behaviors of the soft&#8208;hinge Kiri&#8208;MM E&#8208;armor demonstrate the merits of this design, i.e., stretchability, conformability, and protectability, as applied to flexible electronics. Deploying a conductive soft material at the hinges enables facile wiring strategies for large&#8208;scale circuit arrays. Functional E&#8208;armor systems for controllable display and sensing purposes provide simple examples of a wide spectrum of applications of this concept.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Based Intrinsically Stretchable 2D&#8208;Contact Electrodes for Highly Efficient Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol to fabricate highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes that use an intrinsically stretchable 2D&#8208;contact electrode topped with graphene is reported. As a benefit of the fast carrier mobility with complete 2D contact with the organic material and the tunable work function of the 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electro (TCSE), the limited charge injection of the widely used silver&#8208;nanowire&#8208;based stretchable electrode is solved.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) are becoming essential components of wearable electronics. However, the efficiencies of ISOLEDs have been highly inferior compared with their rigid counterparts, which is due to the lack of ideal stretchable electrode materials that can overcome the poor charge injection at 1D metallic nanowire/organic interfaces. Herein, highly efficient ISOLEDs that use graphene&#8208;based 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electrodes (TCSEs) that incorporate a graphene layer on top of embedded metallic nanowires are demonstrated. The graphene layer modifies the work function, promotes charge spreading, and impedes inward diffusion of oxygen and moisture. The work function (WF) of 3.57&#160;eV is achieved by forming a strong interfacial dipole after deposition of a newly designed conjugated polyelectrolyte with crown ether and anionic sulfonate groups on TCSE; this is the lowest value ever reported among ISOLEDs, which overcomes the existing problem of very poor electron injection in ISOLEDs. Subsequent pressure&#8208;controlled lamination yields a highly efficient fluorescent ISOLED with an unprecedently high current efficiency of 20.3&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which even exceeds that of an otherwise&#8208;identical rigid counterpart. Lastly, a 3 inch five&#8208;by&#8208;five passive matrix ISOLED is demonstrated using convex stretching. This work can provide a rational protocol for designing intrinsically stretchable high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices with favorable interfacial electronic structures.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Perfluorinated Greenhouse Gases by Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of porous organic cages with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented and the structure&#8211;property relationships between the nature of the side&#8208;chains and the gas sorption behavior toward highly potent greenhouse gases, namely, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are studied. By this approach, one compound having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions is identified.








Abstract
Anthropogenic greenhouse gases contribute to global warming. Among those gases, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are thousands to tens of thousands of times more harmful to the environment than comparable amounts of carbon dioxide. To date, materials that selectively adsorb perfluorocarbons in favor of other less harmful gases have not been reported. Here, a series of porous organic cage compounds with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented. Their isomorphic crystalline states allow the study of the structure&#8211;property relationship between the degree of fluorination of the alkyl chains and the gas sorption properties for PFCs and their selective uptakes in comparison to other, nonfluorinated gases. By this approach, one compound having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions is identified.

         <title>Designing Rewritable Dual&#8208;Mode Patterns using a Stretchable Photoresponsive Polymer via Orthogonal Photopatterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two patterns are observed in one film! Orthogonal photopatterning is developed to fabricate dual&#8208;mode patterns in stretchable azopolymers that exhibit photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. The dual&#8208;mode pattern contains photonic and chromatic polarization patterns, which do not interfere with each other. The dual&#8208;mode patterns are rewritable and reprocessable. They are promising materials for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, information storage, and encryption applications.








Abstract
The fabrication of dual&#8208;mode patterns in the same region of a material is a promising approach for high&#8208;density information storage, new anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and highly secure encryption. However, dual&#8208;mode patterns are difficult to achieve because the two patterns in one material may interfere with each other during fabrication and usage. The development of noninterfering dual&#8208;mode patterns requires new materials and patterning techniques. Herein, a novel orthogonal photopatterning technique is reported for the fabrication of noninterfering dual&#8208;mode patterns on an azopolymer P1. P1 is a unique material that exhibits both photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions and good stretchability. In the first step of orthogonal photopatterning, patterned photonic structures are fabricated on a P1 film via masked nanoimprinting controlled by photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. In the second step, the P1 film is stretched and irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, which generates a chromatic polarization pattern. In particular, the photonic structures and chromatic polarization in the dual&#8208;mode pattern are noninterfering. Another feature of dual&#8208;mode patterns is that they are rewritable via photo&#8208;, thermal, or solution reprocessing, which are useful for recycling and reprogramming. This study opens an avenue for the development of novel materials and techniques for photopatterning.

         <title>All&#8208;Aqueous Freeform Fabrication of Perfusable Self&#8208;Standing Soft Compartments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method based on the interfacial complexation of oppositely charged natural polyelectrolytes is proposed to directly fabricate fiber&#8208;shaped structures, stable in all&#8208;aqueous physiological&#8208;relevant conditions. Perfusable and size&#8208;controllable materials can be obtained, with adequate permeability and improved biofunctionality, enabling cell adhesion and growth. Outside the separating interface of two&#8208;phase systems, self&#8208;standing entities can be easily handled, broadening the range of applications.








Abstract
Compartmentalized structures obtained in all&#8208;aqueous settings have shown promising properties as cell encapsulation devices, as well as reactors for trans&#8208;membrane chemical reactions. While most approaches focus on the preparation of spherical devices, advances on the production of complex architectures have been enabled by the interfacial stability conferred by emulsion systems, namely mild aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS), or non&#8208;equilibrated analogues. However, the application of non&#8208;spherical structures has mostly been reported while keeping the fabricated materials at a stable interface, limiting the free&#8208;standing character, mobility and transposition of the obtained structures to different setups. Here, the fabrication of self&#8208;standing, malleable and perfusable tubular systems through all&#8208;aqueous interfacial assembly is shown, culminating in the preparation of independent objects with stability and homogeneity after disruption of the polymer&#8208;based aqueous separating system. Those hollow structures can be fabricated with a variety of widths, and rapidly printed as long structures at flow rates of 15&#160;mm s&#8722;1. The materials are used as compartments for cell culture, showcasing high cytocompatibility, and can be tailored to promote cell adhesion. Such structures may find application in fields that benefit from freeform tubular structures, including the biomedical field with, for example, cell encapsulation, and benchtop preparation of microfluidic devices.

         <title>Asymmetrically Enhanced Coplanar&#8208;Electrode Electroluminescence for Information Encryption and Ultrahighly Stretchable&#160;Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the impedance&#8208;voltage division principle and the voltage&#8208;luminance relationship, simply fabricated asymmetrically enhanced alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AECE AC&#8208;EL) devices are designed. The AECE AC&#8208;EL configuration is successfully applied in feasible information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable pattern displays, signifying magnificent application prospects in the elegant wearable electronic systems with intelligent, multifunctional, and full&#8208;color displays.








Abstract
Traditional alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AC&#8208;EL) devices adopting a sandwich structure are commonly used in solid&#8208;state lighting and displays, while the emerging coplanar&#8208;electrode alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting variants manifest excellent application prospects in intelligent, multifunctional, and full&#8208;color displays, and sensing purposes. In this work, an asymmetrically&#160;enhanced coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL device with a universal and straightforward architecture is designed based on the impedance adjustment strategy. This newly devised asymmetric structure extends the functionalities of the coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL devices by overcoming the bottlenecks of complicated patterning procedures and high driving voltages of symmetric configuration.

&lt;p&gt;Based on the impedance-voltage division principle and the voltage-luminance relationship, simply fabricated asymmetrically enhanced alternating-current-driven electroluminescent (AECE AC-EL) devices are designed. The AECE AC-EL configuration is successfully applied in feasible information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable pattern displays, signifying magnificent application prospects in the elegant wearable electronic systems with intelligent, multifunctional, and full-color displays.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional alternating-current-driven electroluminescent (AC-EL) devices adopting a sandwich structure are commonly used in solid-state lighting and displays, while the emerging coplanar-electrode alternating-current-driven light-emitting variants manifest excellent application prospects in intelligent, multifunctional, and full-color displays, and sensing purposes. In this work, an asymmetrically&#160;enhanced coplanar-electrode AC-EL device with a universal and straightforward architecture is designed based on the impedance adjustment strategy. This newly devised asymmetric structure extends the functionalities of the coplanar-electrode AC-EL devices by overcoming the bottlenecks of complicated patterning procedures and high driving voltages of symmetric configuration. The developed device design enables a new type of information encryption and ultrahighly stretchable patterned displays. Notably, the novel encryption appliances demonstrate feasible encryption/decryption features, multiple encryptions, and practical applicability; the biaxially stretchable display devices achieve the highest tensile performance in the field of stretchable electroluminescent pattern displays, and outperform the ultrahighly stretchable sandwich devices in terms of simple patterning process, higher brightness, wider color gamut, and long-term stability. The proposed configuration opens up new avenues for AC-EL devices toward a plethora of smart applications in wearable electronics with intelligent displays, dynamic interaction of human-machine interface, and soft robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhombohedral Pd&#8211;Sb Nanoplates with Pd&#8208;Terminated Surface: An Efficient Bifunctional Fuel&#8208;Cell Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate of ordered rhombohedral Pd8Sb3 phase with a Pd&#8208;terminated surface is successfully prepared and applied as a high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst. The unique surface structure can effectively reduce the energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation in the ethanol oxidation reaction&#160;and suppress the competing two&#8208;electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysis for energy conversion and beyond.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for the commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells, but it is still formidably challenging. In this work, a novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate for boosting both cathodic and anodic fuel cell reactions is prepared. Detailed characterizations reveal that the nanoplates have ordered rhombohedral phase of Pd8Sb3 (denoted as Pd8Sb3 HPs). The Pd8Sb3 HPs exhibit&#160;much enhanced activity toward the oxidation of various alcohols. Particularly, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C displays superior specific and mass activities of 29.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 4.5&#160;A&#160;mgPd&#8722;1 toward the EOR, which are 7.0 and 11.3 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C, and 9.8 and 3.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively, representing one of the best EOR catalysts reported to date. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements reveal that Pd8Sb3 HPs/C can effectively promote the C2 pathway of the EOR. As revealed by density functional theory calculations, the high EOR activity of the Pd8Sb3 HPs can be ascribed to the reduced energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation. Additionally, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C also shows superior performance in the&#160;ORR. This work advances the controllable synthesis of the Pd&#8211;Sb nanostructure, giving huge impetus for the design&#160;of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion and beyond.

         <title>Revealing the Structural Coloration of Self&#8208;Assembled Chitin Nanocrystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chitin nanocrystals can be sustainably extracted from mushrooms and shrimp shells. These elongated nanoparticles spontaneously organize in water to form a chiral nematic mesophase. Upon evaporation, this helicoidal architecture is preserved, resulting in structurally colored films. An alkaline post&#8208;treatment to convert chitin into chitosan is found to significantly enhance the birefringence, resulting in vibrant red, green, and blue coloration.








Abstract
The structural coloration of arthropods often arises from helicoidal structures made primarily of chitin. Although it is possible to achieve analogous helicoidal architectures by exploiting the self&#8208;assembly of chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs), to date no evidence of structural coloration has been reported from such structures. Previous studies are identified to have been constrained by both the experimental inability to access sub&#8208;micrometer helicoidal pitches and the intrinsically low birefringence of crystalline chitin. To expand the range of accessible pitches, here, ChNCs are isolated from two phylogenetically distinct sources of &#945;&#8208;chitin, namely fungi and shrimp, while to increase the birefringence, an in situ alkaline treatment is performed, increasing the intensity of the reflected color by nearly two orders of magnitude. By combining this treatment with precise control over ChNC suspension formulation, structurally colored chitin&#8208;based films are demonstrated with reflection tunable from blue to near infrared.

         <title>3R Electronics: Scalable Fabrication of Resilient, Repairable, and Recyclable Soft&#8208;Matter Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
3R&#8208;electronics are introduced here: the next generation of soft&#8208;matter electronics that are Resilient, Repairable and Recyclable. It is proposed that 3R&#8208;electronics should replace current electronics, as they permit sustainable circular economy. 3R&#8208;electronics are implemented through novel liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based composites, unique high&#8208;resolution digital fabrication techniques, and an unprecedented room&#8208;temperature soldering method that permits for the first time, utilization of heat&#8208;sensitive polymers in microchip&#8208;integrated circuits.








Abstract
E&#8208;waste is rapidly turning into another man&#8208;made disaster. It is proposed that a paradigm shift toward a more sustainable future can be made through soft&#8208;matter electronics that are resilient, repairable if damaged, and recyclable (3R), provided that they achieve the same level of maturity as industrial electronics. This includes high&#8208;resolution patterning, multilayer implementation, microchip integration, and automated fabrication. Herein, a novel architecture of materials and methods for microchip&#8208;integrated condensed soft&#8208;matter 3R electronics is demonstrated. The 3R function is enabled by a biphasic liquid metal&#8208;based composite, a block copolymer with nonpermanent physical crosslinks, and an electrochemical technique for material recycling. In addition, an autonomous laser&#8208;patterning method for scalable circuit patterning with an exceptional resolution of &lt;30&#160;&#181;m in seconds is developed. The phase&#8208;shifting property of the BCPs is utilized for vapor&#8208;assisted &#8220;soldering&#8221; circuit repairing and recycling. The process is performed entirely at room temperature, thereby opening the door for a wide range of heat&#8208;sensitive and biodegradable polymers for the next generation of green electronics. The implementation and recycling of sophisticated skin&#8208;mounted patches with embedded sensors, electrodes, antennas, and microchips that build a digital fingerprint of the human electrophysiological signals is demonstrated by collecting mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal data from the epidermis.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Iron Anchored Tubular g&#8208;C3N4 Catalysts for Ultrafast Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction: Roles of High&#8208;Valency Iron&#8208;Oxo Species and Organic Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersing Fe(III) sites into fine&#8208;tuned nitrogen&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride nanotubes are designed for peracetic acid activation and further for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. This work opens a new avenue to develop heterogenous catalytic systems with higher reactivity and better durability using a double engine mechanism.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as an efficient oxidant activator for eliminating organic pollutants in Fenton&#8208;like systems. However, the complex preparation, single active site, lack of understanding of the fundamental mechanism, and harsh pH conditions currently limit their practical applications. In this work, single&#8208;atom iron anchored nitrogen&#8208;rich g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes (FeCNs) are designed and synthesized by a facile approach, and eco&#8208;friendly peracetic acid (PAA) is selected as the oxidant for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. The constructed heterogenous system achieves an enhanced degradation of various organic contaminants over a wide pH range of 3.0&#8211;9.0, exhibiting an ultrahigh and stable catalytic activity, outperforming equivalent quantities of pristine g&#8208;C3N4 by 75 times. The 18O isotope&#8208;labeling technique, probe method, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the efficient catalytic activity relies on the high&#8208;valency iron&#8208;oxo species coupled with organic radicals generated by PAA. An increase in electron transport from the contaminant to the formed &#8220;metastable PAA/FeCN catalyst surface complex&#8221; is detected. A double driving mechanism for the tubular g&#8208;C3N4 regulated by a single Fe site and PAA activation is proposed. This work opens an avenue for developing novel catalysts with the coexistence of multiple active units and providing opportunities for significantly improving catalytic efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;Atomically dispersing Fe(III) sites into fine-tuned nitrogen-rich graphitic carbon nitride nanotubes are designed for peracetic acid activation and further for Fenton-like reactions. This work opens a new avenue to develop heterogenous catalytic systems with higher reactivity and better durability using a double engine mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom catalysts have emerged as an efficient oxidant activator for eliminating organic pollutants in Fenton-like systems. However, the complex preparation, single active site, lack of understanding of the fundamental mechanism, and harsh pH conditions currently limit their practical applications. In this work, single-atom iron anchored nitrogen-rich g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanotubes (FeCNs) are designed and synthesized by a facile approach, and eco-friendly peracetic acid (PAA) is selected as the oxidant for Fenton-like reactions. The constructed heterogenous system achieves an enhanced degradation of various organic contaminants over a wide pH range of 3.0&#8211;9.0, exhibiting an ultrahigh and stable catalytic activity, outperforming equivalent quantities of pristine g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; by 75 times. The &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O isotope-labeling technique, probe method, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the efficient catalytic activity relies on the high-valency iron-oxo species coupled with organic radicals generated by PAA. An increase in electron transport from the contaminant to the formed &#8220;metastable PAA/FeCN catalyst surface complex&#8221; is detected. A double driving mechanism for the tubular g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; regulated by a single Fe site and PAA activation is proposed. This work opens an avenue for developing novel catalysts with the coexistence of multiple active units and providing opportunities for significantly improving catalytic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Encapsulation&#8208;Based Sodium Storage via Zn&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Implanted Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing a functional encapsulation&#8208;based sodium storage void with abundant pore structure and enriched Zn single atom sites in the inner wall is presented here. Zn single atoms provide abundant selective sodiophilic nucleation sites. Due to the rich pore structure, ZIF&#8208;derived carbon shells can provide geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels to maintain fast electron/ion contact, benefiting for encapsulating large amounts of metallic sodium.








Abstract
The properties of high theoretical capacity, low cost, and large potential of metallic sodium (Na) has strongly promoted the development of rechargeable sodium&#8208;based batteries. However, the issues of infinite volume variation, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and dendritic sodium causes a rapid decline in performance and notorious safety hazards. Herein, a highly reversible encapsulation&#8208;based sodium storage by designing a functional hollow carbon nanotube with Zn single atom sites embedded in the carbon shell (ZnSA&#8208;HCNT) is achieved. The appropriate tube space can encapsulate bulk sodium inside; the inner enriched ZnSA sites provide abundant sodiophilic sites, which can evidently reduce the nucleation barrier of Na deposition. Moreover, the carbon shell derived from ZIF&#8208;8 provides geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels for the rapid transfer of Na+ due to its pore&#8208;rich shell, which can be revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As expected, Na@ZnSA&#8208;HCNT anodes present steady long&#8208;term performance in symmetrical battery (&gt;900 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Moreover, superior electrochemical performance of Na@ZnSA&#8208;HCNT||PB full cells can be delivered. This work develops a new strategy based on carbon nanotube encapsulation of metallic sodium, which improves the safety and cycling performance of sodium metal anode.

         <title>Uneven Stripping Behavior, an Unheeded&#160;Killer of Mg Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An astonishingly uniform electroplating morphology is proven under practical current density and areal capacity in rechargeable Mg batteries, and an asymmetric phenomenon between the plating and stripping processes is discovered. More critically, a nonlinear volcano relation between the non&#8208;uniformity of the stripping morphology and the current density is proposed, which is defined by the distribution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions at the interface.








Abstract
Uniform magnesium (Mg) plating/stripping under high areal capacity utilization is critical for the practical application of Mg&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable Mg batteries. However, the failure of the Mg&#8208;metal anode when cycling under a practical areal capacity (&gt;4&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2), is of rising concern. The mechanism behind these failures remains controversial. In this work, it is illustrated that the initial plating Mg can be undoubtedly uniform in a wide range of current densities (&#8804;5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and under a practical areal capacity (6&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2). However, an unusual self&#8208;accelerating pit growth is observed in the Mg stripping side under moderate current densities (0.1&#8211;1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), which severely deteriorates the anode integrity and subsequent Mg plating uniformity, causing failure of the Mg&#8208;metal anode or short circuit of the battery. The stripping morphology depends on the applied current density, as non&#8208;uniformity versus the current density displays a volcano plot during the stripping process. Through in situ spectroscopy, it is illustrated that this current&#8208;dependent behavior is determined by the evolution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions near the interface. This research reminds that the plating/stripping process of the Mg&#8208;metal anode must be considered comprehensively for practical Mg&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Atomic and Electronic Manipulation of Robust Ferroelectric Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
True 2D ferroelectricity up to T&#160;= 400 K is achieved via atomic and electronic manipulation of polymorphs in Mo1&#8722;xWxTe2, developing an original phase diagram for ferroelectricity in atomically thin materials.








Abstract
Polymorphism allows the symmetry of the lattice and spatial charge distributions of atomically thin materials to be designed. While various polymorphs for superconducting, magnetic, and topological states have been extensively studied, polymorphic control is a challenge for robust ferroelectricity in atomically thin geometries. Here, the atomic and electric manipulation of ferroelectric polymorphs in Mo1&#8722;xWxTe2 is reported. Atomic manipulation for polymorphic control via chemical pressure (substituting tungsten for molybdenum atoms) and charge density modulation can realize tunable polar lattice structures and robust ferroelectricity up to T&#160;= 400 K with a constant coercive field in an atomically thin material. Owing to the effective inversion symmetry breaking, the ferroelectric switching withstands a charge carrier density of up to 1.1 &#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2, developing an original diagram for ferroelectric switching in atomically thin materials.

         <title>Stable and Bright Electroluminescent Devices utilizing Emissive 0D Perovskite Nanocrystals Incorporated in a 3D CsPbBr3 Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals are incorporated into 3D CsPbBr3 films&#160;to form single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells. The 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals improve the maximum luminance to 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2, the power efficiency to 33.0 Lm W&#8722;1, the external quantum efficiency to 8.3%, and the operational stability to 129 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The 0D cesium lead halide perovskite Cs4PbBr6 has drawn remarkable interest due to its highly efficient robust green emission compared to its 3D CsPbBr3 counterpart. However, seizing the advantages of the superior photoluminescence properties for practical light&#8208;emitting devices remains elusive. To date, Cs4PbBr6 has been employed only as a higher&#8208;bandgap nonluminescent matrix to passivate or provide quantum/dielectric confinement to CsPbBr3 in light&#8208;emitting devices and to enhance its photo&#8208;/thermal/environmental stability. To resolve this disparity, a novel solvent engineering method to incorporate highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals (perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs)) into a 3D CsPbBr3 film, forming the active emissive layer in single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (PeLECs) is designed. A dramatic increase of the maximum external quantum efficiency and luminance from 2.7% and 6050&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8208;only PeLEC to 8.3% and 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8211;0D PNC device with only 7% by weight of 0D PNCs is observed. The majority of this increase is driven by the efficient inherent emission of the 0D PNCs, while the concomitant morphology improvement also contributes to reduced leakage current, reduced hysteresis, and enhanced operational lifetime (half&#8208;life of 129 h), making this one of the best&#8208;performing LECs reported to date.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 0D cesium lead halide perovskite Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has drawn remarkable interest due to its highly efficient robust green emission compared to its 3D CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; counterpart. However, seizing the advantages of the superior photoluminescence properties for practical light-emitting devices remains elusive. To date, Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has been employed only as a higher-bandgap nonluminescent matrix to passivate or provide quantum/dielectric confinement to CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in light-emitting devices and to enhance its photo-/thermal/environmental stability. To resolve this disparity, a novel solvent engineering method to incorporate highly luminescent 0D Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals (perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs)) into a 3D CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film, forming the active emissive layer in single-layer perovskite light-emitting electrochemical cells (PeLECs) is designed. A dramatic increase of the maximum external quantum efficiency and luminance from 2.7% and 6050&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for a 3D-only PeLEC to 8.3% and 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for a 3D&#8211;0D PNC device with only 7% by weight of 0D PNCs is observed. The majority of this increase is driven by the efficient inherent emission of the 0D PNCs, while the concomitant morphology improvement also contributes to reduced leakage current, reduced hysteresis, and enhanced operational lifetime (half-life of 129 h), making this one of the best-performing LECs reported to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Observation of Topological Edge States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological phases have been demonstrated in various wave systems, however, they still remain unexplored in a purely diffusive system. This work reveals the topological phase in a&#160;purely diffusive system, that is, a thermal lattice. The experimental results show that the nontrivial topological phase of the thermal lattice can enable thermal edge states that exponentially decay within the gap of bulk decays.








Abstract
Topological band theory predicts that bulk materials with nontrivial topological phases support topological edge states. This phenomenon is universal for various wave systems and is widely observed for electromagnetic and acoustic waves. Here, the notion of band topology is extended from wave to diffusion dynamics. Unlike wave systems that are usually Hermitian, diffusion systems are anti&#8208;Hermitian with purely imaginary eigenvalues corresponding to decay rates. By direct probe of the temperature diffusion, the Hamiltonian of a thermal lattice is experimentally retrieved, and the emergence of topological edge decays is observed within the gap of bulk decays. The results of this work show that such edge states exhibit robust decay rates, which are topologically protected against disorder. This work constitutes a thermal analogue of topological insulators and paves the way to exploring defect&#8208;immune heat dissipation.

         <title>Unraveling Device Physics of Dilute&#8208;Donor Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Organic Solar Cells with Highly Transparent Active Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active layers for (semi&#8208;)transparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) must meet high transparency requirements for integrated energy&#8208;harvesting solutions. A pathway towards high visible transparency is combining a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing acceptor material with small fractions of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing donor component. An in&#8208;depth analysis of three blend systems yields an in&#8208;depth understanding of the device physics upon reduction of the donor.








Abstract
The charge generation&#8211;recombination dynamics in three narrow&#8208;bandgap near&#8208;IR absorbing nonfullerene (NFA) based organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems with varied donor concentrations of 40%, 30%, and 20% are investigated. The dilution of the polymer donor with visible&#8208;range absorption leads to highly transparent active layers with blend average visible transmittance (AVT) values of 64%, 70%, and 77%, respectively. Opaque devices in the optimized highly reproducible device configuration comprising these transparent active layers lead to photoconversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.0%, 6.5%, and 4.1%. The investigation of these structures yields quantitative insights into changes in the charge generation, non&#8208;geminate charge recombination, and extraction dynamics upon dilution of the donor. Lastly, this study gives an outlook for employing the highly transparent active layers in semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs).

Next&#8208;generation photovoltaics will be lightweight, flexible, and (semi)transparent. Highly transparent organic photoactive materials are reported by Thuc&#8208;Quyen Nguyen, Viktor Brus, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2203796.

In article number 2203040, Han&#8208;Young Woo, Tae&#8208;Woo Lee, and co&#8208;workers report the design of highly efficient ISOLEDs that use a graphene&#8208;based 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electrode. As a benefit of a newly designed conjugated polyelectrolyte with efficient electron injection capability, the ISOLED yields an unprecedently high current efficiency of 20.3 cd A&#8722;1.

A comprehensive overview of fully stretchable organic solar cells (f&#8208;SOSCs), including essential studies to make each layer of an f&#8208;SOSC stretchable and efficient is provided. Various strategies to simultaneously enhance the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the active layer, ranging from material design to fabrication control, are emphasized.








Abstract
Recent advances in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) have greatly enhanced their commercial viability. Considering the technical standards (e.g., mechanical robustness) required for wearable electronics, which are promising application platforms for OSCs, the development of fully stretchable OSCs (f&#8208;SOSCs) should be accelerated. Here, a comprehensive overview of f&#8208;SOSCs, which are aimed to reliably operate under various forms of mechanical stress, including bending and multidirectional stretching, is provided. First, the mechanical requirements of f&#8208;SOSCs, in terms of tensile and cohesion/adhesion properties, are summarized along with the experimental methods to evaluate those properties. Second, essential studies to make each layer of f&#8208;SOSCs stretchable and efficient are discussed, emphasizing strategies to simultaneously enhance the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the active layer, ranging from material design to fabrication control. Key improvements to the other components/layers (i.e., substrate, electrodes, and interlayers) are also covered. Lastly, considering that f&#8208;SOSC research is in its infancy, the current challenges and future prospects are explored.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Hollow Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Synthesis Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 31, August 4, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in the synthesis and catalysis&#8208;related applications of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based hollow mesoporous nanoparticles (HMNs) is summarized in detail. This Review will help the readers to understand the challenges and more importantly provide insights into designing novel multifunctional HMN&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
As second&#8208;generation mesoporous materials, mesoporous noble metals (NMs) are of significant interest for their wide applications in catalysis, sensing, bioimaging, and biotherapy owing to their structural and metallic features. The introduction of interior hollow cavity into NM&#8208;based mesoporous nanoparticles (MNs), which subtly integrate hierarchical hollow and mesoporous structure into one nanoparticle, produces a new type of hollow MNs (HMNs). Benefiting from their higher active surface, better electron/mass transfer, optimum electronic structure, and nanoconfinement space, NM&#8208;based HMNs exhibit their high efficiency in enhancing catalytic activity and stability and tuning catalytic selectivity. In this review, recent progress in the design, synthesis, and catalytic applications of NM&#8208;based HMNs is summarized, including the findings of the groups. Five main strategies for synthesizing NM&#8208;based HMNs, namely silica&#8208;assisted surfactant&#8208;templated nucleation, surfactant&#8208;templated sequential nucleation, soft &#8220;dual&#8221;&#8208;template, Kirkendall effect in synergistic template, and galvanic&#8208;replacement&#8208;assisted surfactant template, are described in detail. In addition, the applications in ethanol oxidation electrocatalysis and hydrogenation reactions are discussed to highlight the high activity, enhanced stability, and optimal selectivity of NM&#8208;based HMNs in (electro)catalysis. Finally, the further outlook that may lead the directions of synthesis and applications of NM&#8208;based HMNs is prospected.
