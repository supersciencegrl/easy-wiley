         <title>Coupling Data&#8208;Driven and Reinforcement Learning for Material Development and Device Management in Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a systematic overview of the core theories, characteristics, and application paradigms of both data&#8208;driven approaches and reinforcement learning, highlighting their complementarity. It then elaborates on the coupled paradigm's applications across the full battery life cycle, forming closed loops for material development and device management. Furthermore, it also discusses technical challenges and outlines potential research directions.








ABSTRACT
The growing demand for high&#8208;energy, safe, and durable batteries demands innovative strategies in both material discovery and device management. Conventional approaches, rooted in empirical trial&#8208;and&#8208;error and physics&#8208;based modeling, often struggle to address the complexity and dynamic nature of next&#8208;generation battery systems. Here, we highlight the emerging synergy between data&#8208;driven machine learning and reinforcement learning (RL), establishing a coupled paradigm that unifies predictive modeling with adaptive optimization. Data&#8208;driven methods enable rapid screening of cathodes, anodes, and liquid/solid electrolytes through multi&#8208;source data mining, while RL agents iteratively optimize synthesis conditions, interfacial properties, and charging protocols. Together, these approaches create closed&#8208;loop frameworks for materials development (prediction, exploration, and validation) and device management (data insight and strategy optimization), which accelerate discovery, enhance safety, and improve performance across the battery lifecycle. Finally, we further outline critical opportunities in data processing, feature engineering, and model building that can elevate this coupled paradigm from conceptual promise to industrial deployment. This integration of data&#8208;driven learning with reinforcement intelligence paves a pathway toward autonomous, high&#8208;throughput battery innovation, providing new foundations for next&#8208;generation energy technologies.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hermitian Edge Burst of Sound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study experimentally demonstrates non&#8208;Hermitian edge bursts in 1D acoustic crystals, confirming their universality across quantum and classical systems. Bipolar edge bursts emerge from twisted&#8208;winding topology, while boundary&#8208;selectable bursts are achieved through coupling engineering without changing band topology. The results advance the understanding of edge&#8208;burst dynamics by highlighting the critical interplay between gap&#8208;closing points and non&#8208;Hermitian band topology.








ABSTRACT
Non&#8208;Hermitian band topology can give rise to phenomena with no counterparts in Hermitian systems. A well&#8208;known example is the non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where Bloch eigenstates localize at a boundary, induced by a nontrivial spectrum winding number. In contrast, recent studies on lossy non&#8208;Hermitian lattices have uncovered an unexpected boundary&#8208;localized loss probability&#8212;a phenomenon that requires not only non&#8208;Hermitian band topology but also the closure of the imaginary (dissipative) gap. Here, we demonstrate the non&#8208;Hermitian edge burst in a classical&#8208;wave metamaterial: a lossy nonreciprocal acoustic crystal. We show that, when the imaginary gap remains closed, edge bursts can occur at the right boundary, left boundary, or both boundaries simultaneously, all under the same non&#8208;Hermitian band topology; the latter scenario is known as a bipolar edge burst. The occurrence of each scenario depends on the number and location of the imaginary gap closure points in the eigenenergy spectra. These findings generalize the concept of edge burst from quantum to classical wave systems, establish it as an intrinsic material property, and enrich the physics of the complex interplay between non&#8208;Hermitian band topology and other physical properties in non&#8208;Hermitian systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance, Recyclable Thermosets Enabled by Thiosemicarbazone Dynamic Bonds via Synergistic Dynamic Covalent and Supramolecular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single thiosemicarbazone (TSC) dynamic bond unifies covalent and supramolecular networks, enabling high&#8208;performance thermosets with a Tg of 217&#176;C, strength of 127.1 MPa, toughness of 15.1 MJ m&#8722;3, and Young's modulus of 2.1 GPa. The material enables efficient closed&#8208;loop recycling through in situ depolymerization and reformation over multiple cycles without performance loss. This synergistic effect overcomes performance&#8208;recyclability trade&#8208;offs, advancing sustainable materials with robust properties and streamlined reproduction.








ABSTRACT
Recyclable thermosets have emerged as promising candidates to mitigate plastic pollution, yet reconciling high performance with efficient recyclability remains challenging. Here, we report a high&#8208;performance, readily recyclable thermoset engineered through a synergistic dynamic covalent and supramolecular network. This design employs a single thiosemicarbazone (TSC) dynamic linkage to intrinsically unify dynamic covalent and noncovalent bonds within one chemical moiety, thereby overcoming conventional performance&#8208;recyclability trade&#8208;offs. The dual&#8208;network architecture endows the TSC&#8208;derived polymers (PTSCs) with exceptional thermal stability (glass transition temperature: 217&#176;C), mechanical robustness (tensile strength: 127.1&#160;MPa; elongation at break: 16.6%; Young's modulus: 2.1&#160;GPa; toughness: 15.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), dimensional stability, and chemical resistance. Critically, the inherent reversibility of TSC bonds enables closed&#8208;loop recycling through in situ depolymerization and reconstruction over multiple cycles while retaining performance parity with virgin materials. This efficient recycling route confers genuine circularity, avoiding intermediate purification steps, minimizing solvent consumption, and streamlining the recycling workflow. Furthermore, PTSCs enable selective recovery from complex mixed plastic waste streams and carbon fiber composites without sophisticated separation processes. This work establishes a versatile molecular paradigm for designing readily recyclable thermosets with exceptional performance, advancing sustainable high&#8208;performance materials innovation.

         <title>Breaking the 2&#8208;nm Barrier in Hard Disk Drives Using Monolayer Amorphous Carbon Overcoats</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid growth of AI has increased demand for large&#8208;scale data storage, making HDDs indispensable&#160;in data centers. Increasing&#160;areal storage density is crucial, but limited by the traditional&#160;carbon overcoats (COC). Monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC) offers a superior&#160;alternative. It provides high thermal stability, corrosion resistance, and low friction, enabling HDDs to reach 10 Tb/in2.








ABSTRACT
The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has increased the demand for large&#8208;scale data storage, making hard disk drives (HDDs) indispensable in data centers due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and stability. To support AI&#8208;driven data requirements, increasing the areal storage density is critical. However, this metric is increasingly constrained by the carbon overcoat (COC), the essential protective layer for magnetic media. Traditional diamond&#8208;like carbon (DLC) can no longer fulfill the stringent demands for ultrathin coatings and high thermal stability required by next&#8208;generation technologies like Heat&#8208;Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) and bit&#8208;patterned media. Here, we introduce monolayer amorphous carbon (MAC) as a superior&#160;alternative. MAC is directly grown on the heterogeneous (Fe, Pt, SiO2) HDD surface at low temperatures (&#8764; 300&#176;C), achieving an uniform&#160;0.8 nm thickness across 2.5&#8208;inch disks. Despite its atomic thickness, MAC demonstrates high corrosion resistance and low roughness comparable to commercial 2.5 nm COCs. Its fully amorphous, sp2&#8208;hybridized structure ensures excellent thermal stability under HAMR&#8208;like conditions (&#8764;450&#176;C) and a low friction coefficient, enabling potential lubricant&#8208;free operation. Replacing traditional COCs with MAC facilitates the development of HDD media capable of achieving 10 Tb/in2, addressing the urgent storage demands of the digital era.

The innovative FsLPE fabrication technique enables centimeter&#8208;scale sapphire windows with an average transmittance exceeding 92.0% and minimal degradation (0.3%) even at a 50&#176; incidence angle. Remarkably, these structures withstand 1200&#176;C, suitable for harsh&#8208;condition infrared applications.








ABSTRACT
An ideal anti&#8208;reflection window requires both diffraction&#8208;free transmission and mechanical robustness, which poses significant challenges for hard and brittle materials. Conventional subwavelength structures often achieve diffraction&#8208;free transmission by either reducing the periodicity or increasing aspect ratio yet low processing efficiency hinders scalable fabrication. Herein, we propose a novel cone&#8208;cylinder binary metasurface that overcomes the limitations of traditional subwavelength designs by exploiting multi&#8208;mode resonance and phase compensation. This synergy enables non&#8208;diffractive transmission in a scalable non&#8208;subwavelength sapphire architecture. To realize the metasurface, we developed a femtosecond laser penetrating hybrid etching (FsLPE) technique, which enables the fabrication of centimeter&#8208;scale mid&#8208;infrared broadband windows on sapphire. The resulting device exhibits a peak transmittance of 98.3% at 5&#160;&#181;m, an average transmittance exceeding 92.0%, and minimal degradation (0.3%) even at a 50&#176; incidence angle. Moreover, the window withstands temperatures up to 1200&#176;C, demonstrating great potential for applications in infrared optical systems and optical sensing under extreme environmental conditions.

         <title>STAR Therapy: Spatiotemporal Antitumor Regimen via a Size&#8208;Gated DNA Hydrogel Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spatiotemporal antitumor regimen (STAR) based on size&#8208;gated DSH enables spatiotemporal release: small Los first remodels tumor ECM by reducing density, while larger ICG/PLT is retained and released later. This avoids non&#8208;selective synchronous release of conventional carriers, enhancing tumor accumulation of ICG/PLT, resulting in superior photodynamic efficacy and improved therapy for ECM&#8208;dense solid tumors.








ABSTRACT
Current cancer therapies for solid tumors are significantly hampered by the dense tumor extracellular matrix (ECM), which restricts antitumor drug penetration and accumulation. Hence, there is a critical need for controllable drug delivery systems capable of spatiotemporally controlling the sequential action of ECM&#8208;modulating agents and cytotoxic drugs. However, conventional carriers often suffer from &#8220;non&#8208;selective synchronous release&#8221;, failing to achieve such spatiotemporal control. Herein, we propose a spatiotemporal antitumor regimen (STAR) based on a size&#8208;gated DNA supramolecular hydrogel (DSH) drug delivery system. In this system, a small&#8208;molecule drug Losartan (Los) and a larger indocyanine green&#8208;loaded platelet&#8208;mimetic particle (ICG/PLT) are co&#8208;encapsulated within the DSH. The programmable size&#8208;selectivity of DSH allows for the rapid diffusion of Los to first remodel tumor ECM by reducing matrix density and enhancing tissue perfusion; meanwhile, the larger ICG/PLT particles are retained within the hydrogel structure and released later along with hydrogel degradation. Notably, this size&#8208;gated sequential release strategy significantly enhances the accumulation of ICG/PLT at the tumor site, resulting in superior light&#8208;activated photodynamic therapeutic outcomes against tumors. Taken together, this study establishes a novel STAR paradigm based on size&#8208;gated DSH, holding promise to advance the therapeutic strategy for solid tumors with dense ECM.

         <title>A Tongue&#8208;Computer Tactile Interface Mediated by the Magnetoelectric&#8208;Driven Tribovoltaic Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We have developed a groundbreaking tongue&#8208;machine haptic interface, activated by subtle tongue gestures, for silent communication and human&#8208;computer interaction. The magnetoelectric&#8208;driven tribovoltaic effect between magnetic particle&#8208; filled Gallium&#8211;Indium (EGaIn) liquid metal and conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) significantly enhances sensing sensitivity and precision. This interface demonstrates a wide range of interactive applications, including human&#8208;machine collaboration, intelligent wheelchair control, and gaming interactions.








ABSTRACT
Current human&#8208;computer interaction (HCI) technologies often suffer from wearing discomfort, noise sensitivity, user fatigue, and privacy concerns, particularly for users with physical disabilities or those requiring high&#8208;precision control. In this study, we address the aforementioned challenges by designing an interactive tongue&#8208;computer interface (ITCI) that enables precise, hands&#8208;free interaction through subtle tongue movements. The ITCI utilizes an array of direct current tribovoltaic tactile sensors enhanced by the magnetoelectric effect, achieving a peak current density of 10.72 A m&#8722;2, a charge density of 718 mC m&#8722;2, and a sensitivity of 90 &#181;A N&#8722;1. integration with a bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory (BiLSTM) neural network yields a recognition accuracy of 99.98%, supporting diverse interactive applications, including smart wheelchair control, robotic manipulation, and immersive gaming. This self&#8208;powered, noninvasive interface enhances user autonomy and privacy, offering a robust platform for intelligent, energy&#8208;efficient, and hands&#8208;free human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells With Stabilized Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A symmetric cross&#8208;link molecule agent, 4,4'&#8208;Oxybis(benzenesulfonyl hydrazide), is introduced into wide&#8208;bandgap iodide&#8208;bromide mixed perovskite to stabilize the&#160;vulnerable grain boundaries and suppress halide segregation. This approach enables single&#8208;junction 1.68 eV perovskite solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 23.48%, and perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cells with an efficiency of 32.19%, along with excellent thermal and operational stability.








ABSTRACT
Halide perovskite absorber with a bandgap near 1.68&#160;eV is pivotal for constructing perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, these wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites are susceptible to light&#8208;induced halide segregation and consequential non&#8208;radiative and transport loss, severely compromising device performance and operational stability. Here, we incorporate a symmetric cross&#8208;link agent, 4,4'&#8208;oxydibenzenesulfonyl hydrazide, to stabilize the iodide&#8208;bromide mixed perovskite lattice. The agents are introduced during film growth to regulate the crystallization process and subsequently assemble at grain boundaries, where they firmly anchor to the perovskite grain surface and stabilize the chemically active boundary regions. Through this approach, photostable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites are achieved, exhibiting enhanced crystallinity, reduced band&#8208;tail states, and suppressed halide segregation and lattice decomposition. The resultant 1.68&#160;eV single&#8208;junction devices delivered an independently certified power conversion efficiency of 23.48%. When integrated with silicon heterojunction cells, the resulting two&#8208;terminal monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 32.19%, and retained 90% of their initial efficiency after 1020 h of continuous operation.

         <title>Intrinsically Thermally Robust Nanocrystals for High&#8208;Flux Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sb3+&#8208;induced lattice stiffening and exciton recycling endow 0D Cs3YCl&#8326; nanocrystals with intrinsic resistance to thermal quenching, enabling stable high&#8208;flux photonic operation at elevated temperatures.








ABSTRACT
High&#8208;brightness photonic platforms driven at high currents self&#8208;heat beyond 400 K; under such conditions, colloidal emitters (II&#8211;VI, III&#8211;V, I&#8211;III&#8211;VI2, group&#8208;IV semiconductors, and both leaded and lead&#8208;free halide perovskite nanocrystals) typically lose efficiency and drift in color. Extrinsic passivation offers limited thermal gains with trade&#8208;offs such as organic&#8208;matrix degradation or oxide&#8208;shell phonon bottlenecks. Here we establish a lattice&#8208;encoded chemical strategy that imparts intrinsic thermal resilience to colloidal nanocrystals via defect&#8211;phonon&#8211;exciton coupling in a zero&#8208;dimensional Sb3+&#8208;doped Cs3LnCl6 lattice. A controlled&#8208;ramp synthesis co&#8208;modulates site occupancy and defect chemistry, creating rigid, low&#8208;phonon [BX6]3&#8722; octahedra that localize lattice expansion and suppress multiphonon relaxation. &#197;ngstr&#246;m&#8208;scale engineered deep traps (&#8764;0.6&#8211;1.2 eV) recycle thermally activated carriers, enabling trap&#8208;compensated anti&#8208;thermal quenching and stabilizing emission through Ln3+ 4f cascade coupling. Tunable from deep violet to ultra&#8208;narrow green and yellow, these nanocrystals show enhanced photoluminescence at elevated temperatures (Cs3LnCl6:Sb3+ reaches 160% intensity at &#8764;410 K while retaining &gt;93% photoluminescence quantum yield). High&#8208;power devices retain &gt;90% luminous flux after 50 h at 1.4 A (junction temperature &#8764;410 K) with &lt;1% chromaticity shift. This work turns thermal robustness from extrinsic protection into intrinsic bonding, providing a molecular design framework for high&#8208;flux photonics.

A controlled-ramp synthesis co-modulates site occupancy and defect chemistry, creating rigid, low-phonon [BX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedra that localize lattice expansion and suppress multiphonon relaxation. &#197;ngstr&#246;m-scale engineered deep traps (&#8764;0.6&#8211;1.2 eV) recycle thermally activated carriers, enabling trap-compensated anti-thermal quenching and stabilizing emission through Ln&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; 4f cascade coupling. Tunable from deep violet to ultra-narrow green and yellow, these nanocrystals show enhanced photoluminescence at elevated temperatures (Cs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;LnCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;:Sb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; reaches 160% intensity at &#8764;410 K while retaining &amp;gt;93% photoluminescence quantum yield). High-power devices retain &amp;gt;90% luminous flux after 50 h at 1.4 A (junction temperature &#8764;410 K) with &amp;lt;1% chromaticity shift. This work turns thermal robustness from extrinsic protection into intrinsic bonding, providing a molecular design framework for high-flux photonics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of High&#8208;Efficiency Thin&#8208;Film Perovskite Solar Cells in Air via Polymer&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Microcrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a scalable strategy using PPG&#8208;coated &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 microcrystals that may be processed in air and undergo controlled redissolution to form highly oriented, defect&#8208;suppressed perovskite films. The PSCs derived from these films deliver a PCE of 26.5% and exhibit enhanced stability, demonstrating potential for industrial large&#8208;scale perovskite photovoltaic manufacturing.








ABSTRACT
Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) demonstrate exceptional photovoltaic performance but face critical stability challenges impeding commercialization. Herein, we integrate polypropylene glycol (PPG) into an inverse temperature crystallization process to synthesize highly stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 microcrystals, which retain phase purity for over six months in air. Our approach enables large&#8208;scale production (nearly 50&#160;g) of PPG&#8208;coated &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 (target) microcrystals from low&#8208;cost PbI2, with over 95% yield&#8212;sufficient to manufacture 23 m2 of perovskite solar modules. Redissolving the target &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 microcrystals, followed by spin&#8208;coating and annealing, yields target perovskite films with reduced defect density, minimized residual strain, and enhanced carrier transport. Mechanistic investigations reveal that colloidal species form upon the redissolution of target microcrystals which modulate the film crystallization kinetics, i.e. accelerating (100)&#8208;oriented nucleation and growth. Employing this integrated strategy, a champion PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.50% (certified 26.22%) was obtained at a laboratory scale (0.06 cm2) and 22.66% for a module with an aperture area of 28.99 cm2, together with prolonged operational stability. This work opens new avenues for the industrial&#8208;scale fabrication of efficient and stable large&#8208;area perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>A Recyclable Polythioester With &#945;&#8208;Gem&#8208;Dimethyl Substitution: Instantaneous Crystallization Triggered by Large and Rapid Stretching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PaGMTE, a depolymerizable polythioester (PTE) prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thiolactone, crystallizes extremely slowly in a quiescent melt. However, large and rapid stretching can trigger its instantaneous crystallization, yielding PaGMTE fibers with outstanding mechanical properties and the potential of a waveguide. Furthermore, we unveil PaGMTE's orthorhombic crystal structure featuring antiparallel&#8208;packed homochiral 83 helices&#8212;the first one resolved for any PTE.








ABSTRACT
Designing and fabricating recyclable polymers combining closed&#8208;loop depolymerizability with high mechanical performance remains a major challenge in sustainable materials. To reach both high recyclability without compromising the mechanical properties, precise controlling of the crystallization behaviors emerges as a crucial strategy. Here, we demonstrate unexpected crystallization behavior in a depolymerizable polythioester (PTE), PaGMTE, and report the first crystal structure of this kind. Derived from organocatalytic ring&#8208;opening polymerization of &#945;&#8208;gem&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;thiolactone, PaGMTE exhibits exceptionally slow quiescent crystallization, which stands in sharp contrast to its polyester analog polypivalolactone that crystallizes rapidly. However, large&#8208;amplitude rapid stretching (strain ~600%, strain rate &#8805; 10 s&#8722;1), where the Deborah number based on the Rouse time of entanglement strand exceeds 1, triggers its crystallization, accelerating the crystallization rate by &gt; 200,000 fold and achieving ~40% crystallinity within 1 s. This approach yields highly oriented fibers with outstanding mechanical properties (Young's modulus of 0.80 GPa, tensile strength of 120 MPa, breaking strain of 70%), high transparency, and the potential as a waveguide. We unveil PaGMTE's orthorhombic crystal structure (space group P212121, a = 1.075 nm, b = 0.622 nm, c = 3.618 nm) with antiparallel&#8208;packed homochiral 83 helices. The slow quiescent crystallization shall arise from entropic barriers associated with conformational adjustments toward the helix. Our findings highlight sulfur substitution's profound impact on polymer properties and prove that significantly enhancing the crystallization process holds promise for making PTE a high&#8208;value&#8208;added recyclable material.

         <title>Meissner Effect and Nonreciprocal Charge Transport in Non&#8208;Topological 1T&#8208;CrTe2/FeTe Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates interface&#8208;induced superconductivity (Tc &#8764;12 K) with a robust Meissner effect and pronounced nonreciprocal transport in epitaxial 1T&#8208;CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures, where 1T&#8208;CrTe2 is a 2D ferromagnet, and FeTe is an antiferromagnetic metal. This finding establishes that topological surface states are not required to induce superconductivity in FeTe&#8208;based heterostructures. The 1T&#8208;CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures provide a platform for exploring magnetically controllable superconducting diode effects.








ABSTRACT
Interface&#8208;induced superconductivity has recently been achieved by stacking a magnetic topological insulator layer on an antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. However, the mechanism driving this emergent superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow a 1T&#8208;CrTe2 layer, a 2D ferromagnet with a Curie temperature up to room temperature, on a FeTe layer. These 1T&#8208;CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures show superconductivity with a critical temperature of &#8764;12 K. Through magnetic force microscopy measurements, we observe the Meissner effect on the surface of the 1T&#8208;CrTe2 layer. Our electrical transport measurements reveal that the 1T&#8208;CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures exhibit nonreciprocal charge transport behavior, characterized by a large magneto&#8208;chiral anisotropy coefficient. The enhanced nonreciprocal charge transport in 1T&#8208;CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures provides a promising platform for exploring the magnetically controllable superconducting diode effect.

         <title>Directed Functionalization of Recombinant Spider Silk Nonwoven Membranes with Antibodies Using Non&#8208;Canonical Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recombinant spider silk protein was functionalized by incorporating genetically encoded bio&#8208;orthogonal reactive azido&#8208;groups. The azido&#8208;functionalized proteins were produced in a scalable biotechnological process, and particles, films, as well as nanofibers were established as anchorage for fully functional antibodies via site&#8208;specific bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry. Spider silk nonwoven membranes decorated with antibodies constitute a cutting&#8208;edge tool for bio&#8208;separation processes as well as other applications.








ABSTRACT
Natural spider silk fibers are recognized for their outstanding mechanical properties. The production of underlying recombinant spider silk proteins in scalable quantities unlocks their potential for technical and biomedical applications. The recombinant spider silk technology further enables the introduction of new functions via genetic encoding. In the present study, the non&#8208;canonical amino acid L&#8208;azidohomoalanine is incorporated into the engineered Araneus diadematus fibroin 4, eADF4(C16), at positions explicitly defined by methionine codons in an N&#8208;terminal peptide tag. The azido&#8208;functionalized eADF4(C16) is processed into particles, films, or electrospun into nanofibers. As functional entities, high molecular weight molecules, such as antibodies, are modified with bio&#8208;orthogonal groups suitable for strain&#8208;promoted cycloaddition to the exposed azido&#8208;groups on the spider silk supports. The antibody&#8208;activated spider silk nonwoven meshes exemplarily show their applicability as bio&#8208;capturing membranes.

In the present study, the non-canonical amino acid L-azidohomoalanine is incorporated into the engineered &lt;i&gt;Araneus diadematus&lt;/i&gt; fibroin 4, eADF4(C16), at positions explicitly defined by methionine codons in an N-terminal peptide tag. The azido-functionalized eADF4(C16) is processed into particles, films, or electrospun into nanofibers. As functional entities, high molecular weight molecules, such as antibodies, are modified with bio-orthogonal groups suitable for strain-promoted cycloaddition to the exposed azido-groups on the spider silk supports. The antibody-activated spider silk nonwoven meshes exemplarily show their applicability as bio-capturing membranes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward a Consensus Characterization Protocol for Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We advocate a common consensus on accurate and standardized reporting of performance metrics in the field of organic thermoelectrics. We summarize prevalent issues in the literature and propose a pre&#8208;submission checklist to support the publication of reproducible results.








ABSTRACT
As the field of organic thermoelectrics advances toward maturity, an accurate and standardized reporting of performance metrics becomes essential to drive further progress and assess real&#8208;world viability. The common geometric form factors and material properties (conductivity, anisotropy, stability, etc.) differ from those of conventional bulk inorganic systems, and thus specific recommendations may apply. Herein, we compile prevalent points of concern in the reporting of thermoelectric performance for organic materials and devices. Moreover, we propose a list of critical factors and metrics that should be explicitly documented when reporting the performance of novel organic thermoelectric materials or devices.

         <title>Cold, Rapid, and Scalable Stamping of Aramid&#8208;Networked Viscoelastic h&#8208;BN Doughs for Complex Thermal Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly viscoelastic ceramic doughs composed of h&#8208;BN, Al2O3, and p&#8208;aramid fibers enable a rapid and scalable stamping&#8208;based process for constructing complex 3D thermal structures within 2 s. The resulting fiber&#8208;reinforced architectures exhibit shape integrity, improved thermal conductivity, and mechanical durability under extreme temperatures (&#8722; 50&#176;C to 200&#176;C). This approach offers a low&#8208;energy and efficient route for designing advanced thermal composites.








ABSTRACT
Extensive efforts have been made to fabricate complex 3D thermal management materials from hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) using 3D printing and templating. However, these techniques are often energy&#8208;intensive, time&#8208;consuming, and inherently limited in scalability, owing to prolonged processing times and low throughput. Herein, we report a cold, rapid, and scalable stamping approach for constructing intricate, large&#8208;area h&#8208;BN&#8208;based thermal architectures. This strategy relies on forming highly viscoelastic h&#8208;BN doughs achieved through developing a para&#8208;aramid (p&#8208;aramid) fiber network and densification via a bimodal alumina mixture. The p&#8208;aramid network maximizes viscoelasticity with a minimal binder content (5.1 wt.%), enabling the doughs to exhibit pronounced plasticity during stamping while maintaining solid&#8208;like behavior after relaxation. Consequently, the doughs conform precisely to complex stamp geometries within 2 s under ambient conditions, preserving their high structural integrity. Scalability is demonstrated by stamping various 3D geometries exceeding 10&#160;cm, including cubes, cylinders, annular sectors, and honeycombs. Furthermore, the fiber&#8208;reinforced structures exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity (TC) and fatigue resistance under extreme temperatures (&#8722; 50&#176;C and 200&#176;C). Notably, the resulting architectures substantially improve the TC of the polymer composites when used as internal frameworks. This low&#8208;energy stamping strategy represents a paradigm shift in the processing of advanced thermal materials.

         <title>Charge Carrier and Spin Transport Properties in Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
D&#8211;A copolymers based on DPP building blocks with different alkyl side chains were synthesized, and the charge and spin transport properties were systematically investigated. The PFETs and OSVs based on DPP&#8208;BTCN&#8208;C1 exhibited an electron mobility of 0.36 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, a MR value of 24.6 %, and a spin diffusion length as high as 66.9&#160;nm, respectively.








ABSTRACT
The organic active layer in organic spin&#8208;valves (OSVs) plays a vital role in regulating the device's performance, and the variations in molecular structure can significantly modulate their physicochemical properties. Herein, we synthesized two diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based donor&#8208;acceptor copolymers with distinct alkyl side chains, namely DPP&#8208;BTCN&#8208;C1 (with side&#8208;chain branching points closer to the conjugated skeleton) and DPP&#8208;BTCN&#8208;C3. To evaluate the charge carrier transport properties, a polymer field&#8208;effect transistor and space charge limited current method based on the two molecules were conducted. The experimental results demonstrated that the DPP&#8208;BTCN&#8208;C1 materials had a higher electron transport mobility. Moreover, the spin transport properties were also revealed by fabricating OSVs devices. In the OSVs with a 50&#160;nm interlayer, DPP&#8208;BTCN&#8208;C1 exhibited a higher magnetoresistance (RM) value of up to 24.6 %. By fitting the polymer thickness dependence of the MR value at 10 K, a longer spin diffusion length and higher spin polarization injection efficiency were achieved for the DPP&#8208;BTCN&#8208;C1 structure. We attributed the differences in charge and spin transport performance to the modulation of the film microstructure and energy levels by the alkyl side chains. This work studied the structure&#8208;property relationship of polymer OSVs from the perspective of side&#8208;chain engineering, providing valuable insights for the design of polymers with enhanced spin properties.

         <title>Macroscopic Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Single Crystals With Enhanced Piezoelectricity and Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, we synthesize millimeter&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline Janus TMDC monolayers via an optimized atomic&#8208;layer substitution process. These obtained Janus TMDC exhibit exceptional spatial homogeneity, a record out&#8208;of&#8208;plane piezoelectric response (d33 &#8776; 2.10 pm/V), and high mobility (13 cm2&#183;V&#8722;1&#183;s&#8722;1), enabling their integration into advanced electronic and quantum devices. 








ABSTRACT
Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), featuring intrinsic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane symmetry breaking and permanent electrical dipole moments, open novel avenues for atomic&#8208;scale symmetry control. However, the absence of high&#8208;quality, macroscopic single crystals has hindered the exploration of their predicted intriguing properties and practical applications. Herein, we demonstrate the synthesis of millimeter&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal Janus TMDC monolayers, including MoSSe, WSSe, MoSeS, and WSeS. A combination of spectroscopic, microscopic, and electrical measurements confirms their exceptional crystallinity and spatial homogeneity over large areas. Notably, in contrast to conventional TMDC monolayers, the obtained Janus materials exhibit a strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane piezoelectric response, with record experimental &#119889;33 value of &#8764;2.06 pm/V for WSSe and &#8764;1.56 pm/V for MoSSe, representing an enhancement of over 15 times compared to previously reported experimental results. Moreover, field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) based on Janus MoSSe achieve an exceptional carrier mobility of &#8764;13 cm2&#183;V&#8722;1&#183;s&#8722;1, along with a device yield of 95% across an array of 100 devices. This work provides a feasible pathway for the scalable production of high&#8208;quality, single&#8208;crystal Janus materials and highlights their promise for integration into next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Ultrasound in Women's Health: Mechanisms, Applications, and Emerging Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As healthcare moves toward decentralization, ultrasound technologies are evolving from strictly imaging tools in clinical settings into versatile diagnostic and therapeutic platforms, with growing roles addressing women's health needs. This review highlights how ultrasound's underlying physical mechanisms can be harnessed to reduce disparities in women's health and improve outcomes for conditions historically underserved by conventional treatments.








ABSTRACT
Women's health remains inadequately served due to the historical predominance of males as the biological reference in medical research, leading to persistent sex&#8208;based gaps in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of disease. As healthcare moves toward decentralization, e.g., through the collection of person&#8208;generated health data, point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostics, and wearable devices, there is a critical need for tools tailored to women's unique conditions and presentations. Ultrasound technologies, recognized for their versatility and safety, have evolved from imaging to multifunctional platforms, with growing roles in diagnosis and therapy.

&lt;p&gt;As healthcare moves toward decentralization, ultrasound technologies are evolving from strictly imaging tools in clinical settings into versatile diagnostic and therapeutic platforms, with growing roles addressing women's health needs. This review highlights how ultrasound's underlying physical mechanisms can be harnessed to reduce disparities in women's health and improve outcomes for conditions historically underserved by conventional treatments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women's health remains inadequately served due to the historical predominance of males as the biological reference in medical research, leading to persistent sex-based gaps in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of disease. As healthcare moves toward decentralization, e.g., through the collection of person-generated health data, point-of-care diagnostics, and wearable devices, there is a critical need for tools tailored to women's unique conditions and presentations.

         <title>Evolution of Fe Single Atom in SiOC Ceramic Fibers and Their High&#8208;Temperature and Ultrathin Electromagnetic Wave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diffusion&#8208;dissolution mechanism of metal nanoparticles through an atomic&#8208;level engineering strategy was proposed to effectively control the evolution of Fe nanoparticles into Fe single atoms in SiOC ceramic fibers, and realized high&#8208;temperature and ultrathin electromagnetic wave absorption.








ABSTRACT
Accurately controlling the particle state and clarifying the relationship between particle structure and electromagnetic wave (EMW) are crucial for the development of high&#8208;performance EMW absorbers, which are essential to address the challenges of electromagnetic pollution and stealth technology. However, achieving both high&#8208;temperature resistance and low&#8208;frequency response in ceramic&#8208;based absorbers remains a significant challenge. Herein, we propose a metal nanoparticle diffusion&#8208;dissolution mechanism through an atomic&#8208;level engineering strategy to effectively control the evolution of Fe nanoparticles into Fe single atoms within SiOC ceramic fibers. By precisely optimizing the nitrogen source, the regulatory mechanisms of nitrogen doping on the evolution of iron species and the resulting electromagnetic behavior are systematically investigated. Due to the interaction between Fe single atoms (Fe&#8208;Nx) and adjacent N/C atoms, the local microstructure symmetry of SiOC is disrupted, which improves the polarization behavior of SiOC&#9472;Fe&#9472;CN and enables multiple polarization loss mechanism. Notably, the SiOC&#9472;Fe&#9472;CN&#8208;10 fiber exhibits exceptional absorption capability with a reflection loss (RL) of &#8722;59.33&#160;dB at an ultrathin thickness of 1.60&#160;mm and &#8722;58.0&#160;dB at a low&#8208;frequency of 5.93&#160;GHz. The effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) reaches 5.5&#160;GHz at a thickness of 1.49&#160;mm. It also delivers remarkable high&#8208;temperature (&#8805;500&#176;C) EMW absorption performance, with an RL of &#8722;53.2&#160;dB at a low&#8208;frequency of 4.78&#160;GHz, which is the high performance of SiC&#8208;based high&#8208;temperature absorbers currently available. Moreover, the SiOC&#9472;Fe&#9472;CN&#8208;10 composite demonstrates favorable thermal diffusion properties. This concept of precise control over particle state provides a valuable strategy for the design of high&#8208;performance EMW absorbers and promotes the ongoing advancement of electromagnetic technology.

         <title>Excited State Opto&#8208;Ionic Reservoir Computing in Hybrid Perovskite Electrochemically&#8208;Gated Luminescent Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neuromorphic computing system exploiting opto&#8208;ionic modulation in lead halide perovskite microcrystals demonstrates high&#8208;dimensional reservoir dynamics with diffraction&#8208;limited node resolution. Leveraging ultrafast excited&#8208;state interactions, it achieves efficient computation (800 pJ/node&#8208;operation), robustly distinguishing 4&#8208;bit pulse sequences, paving the way for next&#8208;generation nanoscale, high&#8208;speed neuromorphic platforms based on photophysics.








ABSTRACT
We introduce a neuromorphic reservoir computing concept that leverages the complex interplay between electronic and ionic states in lead halide perovskites to run algorithms by harnessing opto&#8208;ionic modulation of photoexcited state populations. The system leverages the heterogeneous material microstructure and ultrafast spatio&#8208;temporal electronic state dynamics in perovskite microcrystals to generate a high&#8208;dimensional internal state space reservoir within the charge carrier populations. This reservoir exhibits complex, nonlinear, and adaptive behavior. The computation output is read directly from the photogenerated luminescence using diffraction&#8208;limited resolution with 106 nodes per cm2 and energy of 800 pJ per node&#8208;operation. The system performs robustly in distinguishing 4&#8208;bit pulse sequences with a mean accuracy of 87%, showcasing its potential for neuromorphic computing tasks. Our work reveals excited&#8208;state dynamics as a platform for exploring nanoscale computing with photoactive materials, also at high speeds using ultrafast photophysics, with large potential for the development of next&#8208;generation neuromorphic technologies.

         <title>Ultrathin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as an Allosteric Regulator for Albumin&#8208;Responsive Therapy of Diabetic Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based synthetic receptor system is constructed to achieve customized biological functions using dual signaling gates. Ultrathin MOF nanosheets act as synthetic allosteric regulators of glucose oxidase, and serum albumin can activate the enzymatic activity. This MOF&#8211;enzyme system exhibits effective antibacterial activity and accelerated wound healing in a diabetic mouse model.








ABSTRACT
Customizing sense&#8208;and&#8208;respond programs that link natural actuations with user&#8208;defined cues has emerged as a promising strategy for modulating life processes. Herein, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based synthetic receptor system is presented for realizing customized biological functions using write&#8208;in signaling gates. This is achieved by integrating glucose oxidase into a series of engineered Zr&#8208;MOF nanosheets. Notably, ultrathin MOF architectures act as synthetic allosteric regulators by reshaping the interaction network at the enzyme&#8211;dimer interface, thus compromising electron&#8208;transfer efficiency during catalysis. Leveraging this mechanism, activity modulation is achieved by converting an endogenous yet functionally irrelevant protein, serum albumin, into an activating cue for enzymatic catalysis. This MOF&#8211;enzyme system with an albumin/glucose dual&#8208;gated output behavior exhibits effective antibacterial activity through kinetically controlled oxidative stress. The therapeutic efficacy is demonstrated in a diabetic wound&#8208;healing model. These findings establish MOFs as versatile modules for constructing synthetic receptor systems to advance their use in precision biomedicine.

         <title>Bond&#8208;Mode Engineering in Copper(I) Halides: From Excitation&#8208;Dependent Luminescence to High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;Ray Imaging Screens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a bond&#8208;mode control strategy to design two distinct copper halides from one precursor. The ionic compound shows excitation&#8208;dependent dual emission, elucidated by TDDFT calculations. A large&#8208;area flexible film fabricated from this material achieves high&#8208;resolution, afterglow&#8208;free dynamic X&#8208;ray imaging when integrated into a commercial CMOS system, outperforming standard CsI:Tl screens.








ABSTRACT
Copper(I)&#8208;based halides are promising for X&#8208;ray detection due to their excellent scintillation efficiency and solution processability. However, the structure&#8211;property relationship remains elusive, and their practical viability for X&#8208;ray imaging is largely unverified. In this work, we employ a bond&#8209;mode control strategy to synthesize two compounds from the same amine precursor: ionic (4&#8209;ATHP)2CuI3 and coordinative (4&#8209;ATHP)4Cu4I4 (4&#8208;ATHP = 4&#8208;Aminotetrahydropyran), providing a model system to study their photophysics and underlying mechanism. (4&#8209;ATHP)2CuI3 adopts a unique 1D crystal structure with alternating arrangement of Cu2I6 dimers, which shows excitation&#8209;dependent dual emissions. Experimental and calculation results indicate that the dual emissions originate from the Cu2I6 dimer with a different Cu&#9472;Cu bond length. In contrast, the (4&#8209;ATHP)4Cu4I4 shows single emission centered at 635&#160;nm, in which the organic component contributes to the excited state. The ionic (4&#8209;ATHP)2CuI3 achieves a much higher light yield (55&#160;923 photons/MeV) than that of the coordinative counterpart (31&#160;866 photons/MeV). Furthermore, a large&#8209;area flexible film (15 &#215; 20&#160;cm2) based on (4&#8209;ATHP)2CuI3 delivers a spatial resolution of 20&#160;lp/mm. Critically, integrating this film into a CMOS imager demonstrates superior dynamic imaging without afterglow, outperforming the commercialized CsI: Tl screen. This study not only deciphers the bond&#8209;mode&#8209;dependent photophysics but also validates a commercial&#8209;grade scintillator, paving the way for high&#8209;performance X&#8209;ray imaging materials.

The ionic (4&#8209;ATHP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; achieves a much higher light yield (55&#160;923 photons/MeV) than that of the coordinative counterpart (31&#160;866 photons/MeV). Furthermore, a large&#8209;area flexible film (15 &#215; 20&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) based on (4&#8209;ATHP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CuI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; delivers a spatial resolution of 20&#160;lp/mm. Critically, integrating this film into a CMOS imager demonstrates superior dynamic imaging without afterglow, outperforming the commercialized CsI: Tl screen. This study not only deciphers the bond&#8209;mode&#8209;dependent photophysics but also validates a commercial&#8209;grade scintillator, paving the way for high&#8209;performance X&#8209;ray imaging materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Probing Cellular Activity Via Charge&#8208;Sensitive Quantum Nanoprobes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new quantum sensing modality detects shifts in zero&#8208;field splitting caused by charge rearrangement with diamond nanocrystals in response to cellular activity. These electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven effects provide an alternative to temperature&#8208;based interpretations, enabling real&#8208;time, single&#8208;cell readout of inflammation. This approach reframes NV spectroscopy as a tool for monitoring biologically induced electrochemical changes.








ABSTRACT
Nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) based quantum sensors hold great potential for real&#8208;time single&#8208;cell sensing with far&#8208;reaching applications in fundamental biology and medical diagnostics. Although highly sensitive, the mapping of quantum measurements onto cellular physiological states has remained an exceptional&#160;challenge. Here, we introduce a novel quantum sensing modality capable of detecting changes in cellular activity. Our approach is based on the detection of environment&#8208;induced charge depletion within an individual particle that, owing to a previously unaccounted transverse dipole term, induces systematic shifts in the zero&#8208;field splitting (ZFS). Importantly, these charge&#8208;induced shifts serve as a reliable indicator for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;mediated inflammatory response in macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surface modification of our diamond nanoprobes effectively suppresses these environment&#8208;induced ZFS shifts, providing an important tool for differentiating electrostatic shifts caused by the environment from other unrelated effects, such as temperature variations. Notably, this surface modification also leads to significant reductions in particle&#8208;induced toxicity and inflammation. Our findings shed light on systematic drifts and sensitivity limits of NV spectroscopy in a biological environment with ramifications for the critical discussion surrounding single&#8208;cell thermogenesis. Notably, this work establishes the foundation for a novel sensing modality capable of probing complex cellular processes through straightforward physical measurements.

         <title>High Concentration Antibody Formulations Enabled via Thermostable Ionic Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report concentrated (90&#8208;230 mg/mL) antibody solutions for patient&#8208;compliant subcutanoues injection through incorporation of ionic liquids (ILs). Our approach establishes an IL&#8208;dependent effect that reduces protein&#8208;protein interactions, thereby lowering formulation viscosity to levels suitable for injection (&lt;20 cP). The resulting IL&#8208;antibody formulations achieve 4 months of room&#8208;temperature stability and a 5&#8208;fold improvement in serum adsorption compared with saline controls.








ABSTRACT
Concentrated protein formulations have garnered significant attention in both commercial and research domains due to their relevance in patient&#8208;favored, subcutaneous administration. However, these formulations face challenges such as high viscosity and elevated potential for aggregation, primarily driven by intermolecular electrostatic and hydrophobic protein&#8208;protein interactions (PPIs). Achieving an acceptable injectability profile (&lt;20 cP) often necessitates the incorporation of excipients that mitigate PPIs through shielding effects. Current clinical formulations exhibit a narrow colloidal stability window, largely due to molecular changes under physical and thermal stress, whilst also suffering from suboptimal bioavailability (50%&#8211;85%). To address these limitations, we harness the utility of ionic liquids (ILs) that offer tunable charge and amphiphilicity profiles&#160;as a means to simplify and stabilize protein formulations. Herein, we synthesized biocompatible choline and organic acid&#8208;based ILs&#160;and assessed their viscosity profiles with IgG antibody at both high (90 mg/mL) and ultra&#8208;high (230 mg/mL) concentrations. Functional and structural stability assays conducted over 4 months at room temperature identified promising IL candidates for in vivo studies at both IgG concentrations. Through a multi&#8208;tiered screening strategy, we generated thermally stable, ultra&#8208;high concentration antibody solutions that achieved a five fold improvement in serum absorption of polyclonal IgG compared to their saline solutions.

         <title>Stabilizing Iodine Redox Mediator Enables High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an efficient redox mediator, I&#8722; species can catalyze the sluggish sulfur conversion reaction of zinc&#8211;sulfur batteries, while the additional introduction of ammonia&#8208;oxidized lignin convoys iodine&#8208;loss&#8208;free and polyiodide shuttle&#8208;free behavior during cycling process through strong chemisorption capability for polyiodides and remarkable thermodynamic condition for iodine conversion reaction, thus guaranteeing ultra&#8208;stable iodine redox mediator and high&#8208;performance zinc&#8211;sulfur batteries.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous zinc&#8211;sulfur batteries (AZSBs) are regarded as promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and low&#8208;cost energy storage devices. However, sluggish conversion reaction of sulfur&#8208;loading cathode and notorious polyiodide shuttle of iodine redox mediator in aqueous electrolytes severely hinder the development of AZSBs. Herein, ammonia&#8208;oxidized lignin (AOL) is introduced as electrolyte additive to stabilize the redox mediator function of ZnI2, which effectively facilitates the reversible sulfur conversion reaction (S8&#8596;ZnS). As demonstrated, AOL monomer is rich in active hydroxyl/amide moieties, and exhibits strong chemisorption capability for polyiodides as well as remarkable thermodynamic condition for iodine conversion reaction (I3&#8722;&#8596;I&#8722;), which significantly blocks the ZnI2 mediator loss and I3&#8722;/I5&#8722; shuttle behavior during cycling, thereby maximizing the catalytic effect of ZnI2 for S8&#8596;ZnS reaction and high&#8208;performance AZSBs. Consequently, the optimized AZSBs deliver high specific capacity of 1532 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, and high reversible capacity of 326.2 mAh g&#8722;1 after 320 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. Even if assembled into pouch batteries with high sulfur loading of 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, high capacity of 514.5 mAh g&#8722;1 is still maintained after 134 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights to accelerate sulfur conversion reaction kinetics through stabilizing the redox mediators of AZSBs.

         <title>Arch Shaped Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Wave Energy Harvesting and Corrosion Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs an Arch&#8208;TENG for wave energy harvesting, addressing TENG's marine corrosion and low&#8208;frequency inefficiency issues. It outperforms CS&#8208;TENG, shows stable performance, and its array form enables low&#8208;power supply and seawater cathodic protection, expanding marine TENG applications.








ABSTRACT
As a renewable energy source, wave energy exploitation reduces fossil energy pollution and aids carbon neutrality. Traditional electromagnetic generators (EMGs) have low low&#8208;frequency conversion efficiency, limiting large&#8208;scale application. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), invented in 2012, offer a new way for wave energy harvesting with advantages of wide material selection, low&#8208;frequency adaptability, light weight and low cost, but are restricted by marine corrosion and inefficient low&#8208;frequency capture. This work designed an arch&#8208;structured TENG (Arch&#8208;TENG) that captures wave energy via bending. Compared with CS&#8208;TENG, its charge transfer increases by over 450%, with a charge output density of 12.7&#160;nC&#160;cm2 at 0.5&#160;Hz and stable performance after 26&#160;h tests. The array&#8208;integrated device capable of large&#8208;scale wave energy harvesting is designed based on the Arch&#8208;TENG. It was verified that this device can not only stably power low&#8208;power electronic devices but also be used for cathodic protection tests of carbon steel Q235 in seawater, which will provide more practical applications of TENG in marine environments.

         <title>Single&#8208;Fiber Design for Higher Performance Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highlighting the paradigm shift toward single&#8208;fiber artificial muscles, this review elucidates how intrinsic actuation is encoded through precise molecular engineering. We systematically examine state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material systems to reveal key structure&#8208;property relationships. This roadmap offers strategies for achieving high&#8208;performance actuators for next&#8208;generation soft robotics and intelligent wearables.








ABSTRACT
Artificial muscles are essential components in the advancement of next&#8208;generation soft robotics, biomedical devices, and adaptive wearables. While conventional fiber&#8208;based actuators often rely on multi&#8208;material assemblies and complex interfacial engineering, their performance is limited by structural heterogeneity and low&#8208;efficient energy coupling. This review highlights the emerging paradigm of single&#8208;fiber or in&#8208;fiber artificial muscle design, where actuation functionality is intrinsically encoded within the molecular architecture of individual fibers. We comprehensively examine state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material systems such as phase&#8208;transition materials, block copolymer self&#8208;assemblies, mechanically interlocked polymers, covalent supramolecular hybrids, and woven polymer networks. Particular emphasis is placed on the structure&#8211;property&#8211;function relationships that govern the actuation strain, stress output, response speed, and long&#8208;term durability. We also propose a unified framework for evaluating single fiber actuator performance based on key metrics and critically discuss manufacturing challenges, scalability, and integration with smart sensing system. This review provides a roadmap for molecular design of the high&#8208;performance artificial muscle, offering new strategies for intelligent actuation and soft material systems in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Puncture&#8208;Needle&#8208;Integrated Optical Fibers and NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Activated Thermosensitive Hydrogels for Deep&#8208;Seated Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a drug&#8208;device integrated platform combining a stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogel (SW8@Gel) with SPOF, assisted by a puncture needle. Syringe injects SW8@Gel (1.0&#160;mg mL&#8722;1, 25&#160;&#181;L) in situ through a flexible catheter, and SPOF emits 360&#176; divergent near&#8208;infrared II (110&#160;mW, 1064&#160;nm) excitation light. This integration enables deep&#8208;adaptive photothermal ablation while maintaining temperature (44&#176;C) without off&#8208;target damage.








ABSTRACT
Deep&#8208;seated tumors are difficult to treat because of their location, conventional treatment resistance, and limited light penetration during photothermal therapy (PTT). Interstitial PTT with &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; laser irradiation using optical fibers (OFs) offers a promising solution. This study proposes a drug&#8208;device integrated platform assisted by a puncture needle combining stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with a spherical&#8208;tip polymer OF (SPOF) to overcome dual challenges: Inadequate photothermal agent retention and insufficient optical penetration. The injectable thermosensitive hydrogel (SW8@Gel), composed of Pluronic F127 and aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethene&#8208;derived SW8 nanoparticles, rapidly undergoes sol&#8211;gel transition at 38&#176;C, facilitating localized and sustained delivery of the photothermal agent. The flexible low&#8208;bending&#8208;loss SPOF emits 360&#176; divergent near&#8208;infrared II (1064&#160;nm) light from its spherical tip, allowing single&#8208;fiber illumination of deep&#8208;seated tumors (penetration &gt;10&#160;cm) in complex biological environments. Integrating these components enables depth&#8208;adaptive tumor ablation. Compared to other methods, the SPOF/SW8@Gel combination demonstrates the lowest frequency and shortest duration for PTT of deep&#8208;seated tumors and achieves superior efficacy, with a 90% tumor regression rate in mice models and no off&#8208;target damage due to enhanced heating uniformity and reduced systemic toxicity. This platform offers a transformative clinically viable solution for precise ablation of deep malignancies, bridging advanced photonics and targeted oncotherapy.

         <title>Exciton Diffusion&#8208;Suppressed Scintillator for Ultrafast and High&#8208;Resolution Radiography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we demonstrate a general fabrication of large&#8208;area PEA2PbBr4 nanowire scintillation screens. By spatially confining excitons within nanowires, the radioluminescence decay time is drastically shortened to &#964;1/e = 1.87&#160;ns, while the aligned waveguide structure enables high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, opening avenues for ultrafast radiation detection.








ABSTRACT
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillator PEA2PbBr4 has emerged as a promising fast scintillator for applications in ultrafast radiation imaging, transient diagnosis of pulsed radiation fields, and medical radiodiagnosis. However, its performance is limited by notably prolonged decay times under high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray excitation due to inefficient radiative recombination of sparsely distributed bulk excitons. Furthermore, the difficulty in growing and processing high&#8208;quality, large&#8208;area single crystals hinders the development of scalable scintillation screens. Here, we report a general fabrication strategy for large&#8208;area uniform scintillation screens that synergistically enhances the decay time and imaging resolution under X&#8208;ray excitation by suppressing bulk exciton diffusion in PEA2PbBr4. By leveraging the spatial confinement of nano&#8208;porous templates, we reduce the dimensionality of PEA2PbBr4 from bulk single crystals to uniform 1D nanowires, leading to spatial localization of bulk excitons. This localization significantly shortens the radioluminescence decay time from 11.85 to 1.87&#160;ns. Meanwhile, the regularly aligned periodic optical waveguide structure enables directional propagation of scintillation photons along the nanowires, yielding high spatial resolution imaging (57.1 lp/mm at MTF = 0.2). This work provides a viable approach for advancing the application of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid scintillators in ultrafast radiation imaging.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Adaptive Periodontal Ecosystem Engineered With Molybdenum&#8208;Based Nanozyme&#8208;Embedded Composite Hydrogel for Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Precision Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed Ce6@PEG&#8208;MoOx&#8208;loaded hydrogel exhibits self&#8208;adapted responsiveness, target&#8208;specific SOD&#8208; and CAT&#8208;like activities to amplify PDT, while avoiding off&#8208;target harms including chemodynamic or photothermal stimulation. The hydrogel enables noninvasive PAI for periodontitis monitoring, powerfully eliminates biofilms in the anaerobic niches, and activates PI3K/AKT to promote comprehensive tissue restorations. This theranostic closed&#8208;loop ecosystem is a promising smart platform for comprehensive periodontitis treatment.








ABSTRACT
Periodontitis, the sixth most significant global pandemic driven by bacterial biofilms, is characterized by cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and histolytic matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) accumulation, resulting in progressive periodontal destruction. Current therapies are limited by diagnostic inaccuracy, incomplete biofilm elimination, and inadequate tissue regeneration. To address these challenges, an injectable theranostic Ce6@PEG&#8208;MoOx&#8208;loaded hydrogel through facile construction is proposed, encompassing an intelligent closed&#8208;loop for comprehensive periodontitis management. After being injected into periodontal pockets, the hydrogel adheres to tissues and responds to microenvironmental MMPs, realizing on&#8208;demand therapeutic release. By integrating photoacoustic imaging, the hydrogel facilitates noninvasive, precise and reproducible measurement of porcine periodontal pocket depths, enabling periodontitis diagnosis and monitoring. Subsequently, released oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich MoOx nanozyme mitigates cellular oxidative stress, generates O2 to enhance Ce6&#8208;mediated photodynamic eradication of deep&#8208;seated biofilms, and scavenges residual ROS after bactericidal process. Notably, this system avoids off&#8208;target ROS generation and photothermal damage, preserving surrounding tissues including dental pulp, thus exhibiting exceptional light&#8208;controlled ROS&#8208;modulation. Furthermore, released Mo activates the PI3K/AKT pathway to upregulate angiogenic factors, reprograms M2 macrophages polarization, and stimulates osteogenesis of periodontal stem cells. Altogether, this self&#8208;adaptive ecosystem integrates diagnosis, monitoring, biofilm debridement, and tissue regeneration, establishing a closed&#8208;loop precision therapy for periodontitis with significant clinical potential.

         <title>Phase Transition Regulation Mechanisms in P2&#8208;Type Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of elemental doping on phase transition inhibition can be attributed to the enhanced cationic potential within the alkali or transition metal layers, which strengthens interactions between cation and oxygen including O&#8722;AM&#8722;O shielding effect and TM&#8722;O hybridization. Under such conditions, the NaO6 octahedron formation can be suppressed through the strong inhibition on oxygen layer slipping.








ABSTRACT
Layered sodium transition metal oxides (NaxTMO2) are one of the promising cathodes for sodium ion batteries due to the high energy density and advantages of large&#8208;scale manufacturing. Recently, P2&#8208;type oxides cathodes, as an important family of NaxTMO2, has been paid much attention because the oxygen redox chemistry can further boost the energy density of the cathodes through the special configurations of &#8220;Na&#8722;O&#8722;Li&#8221; or &#8220;Na&#8722;O&#8722;Mg&#8221;. However, these materials suffer the phase transition due to highly depleting Na+ in the structure, when the oxygen redox chemistry is triggered. Past of the decade has witnessed the effective strategies to cope with the phase transition issues through elements doping, but the universal rule behind the elements doping strategies is still a mystery, which is essential to provide guidance to design the advanced cathodes. In this perspective, we present a discussion on phase transitions during charge/discharge process in P2&#8208;type oxides, drawing from the research within our group and recent publications. Phase transition process in P2&#8208;type cathodes is analyzed through the lens of structural geometry evolution toward intrinsic physical/chemical properties. Governing principles and regulation mechanisms of phase transition are elucidated as well, which can give contributions to the rational design of high&#8208;performance P2&#8208;type oxide cathodes.

&lt;p&gt;The effect of elemental doping on phase transition inhibition can be attributed to the enhanced cationic potential within the alkali or transition metal layers, which strengthens interactions between cation and oxygen including O&#8722;AM&#8722;O shielding effect and TM&#8722;O hybridization. Under such conditions, the NaO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedron formation can be suppressed through the strong inhibition on oxygen layer slipping.

         <title>Localized Solvent&#8208;Anchored Carboxylate Ester Electrolyte Enables Wide Temperature and Fast Charging Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs a local solvent molecular anchoring strategy based on the dipole&#8208;dipole interaction between methyl propionate (MP) and fluorinated ethylene carbonate (FEC) to anchor free FEC onto MP. This effectively reduces FEC decomposition and HF generation, enabling operation across an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8722;40&#176;C to 70&#176;C and at an ultra&#8208;high rate of 80C under ambient conditions.








ABSTRACT
Sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) have attracted considerable interest due to their abundant raw material supply and high energy density. Nevertheless, realizing fast charging and long&#8208;term cycling stability over a wide temperature range remains a considerable challenge. In this work, we propose a novel strategy that integrates molecular anchoring with weak solvation by modulating the dipole&#8208;dipole interactions between methyl propionate (MP) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). This approach effectively stabilizes the free solvent ratio, suppresses the irregular dendrite formation under low&#8208;temperature and fast&#8208;charging conditions, and minimizes HF generation at elevated temperatures, thereby enhancing electrolyte chemical stability and Na+ desolvation kinetics. These synergistic enhancements enable rapid Na+ transport and facilitate the formation of a robust interface layer across a broad temperature range. Consequently, Na3V2(PO4)3||Na cells demonstrate stable operation from &#8722;40&#176;C to 70&#176;C and sustain over 10&#160;000 cycles at 80&#176;C, outperforming previous reports on wide&#8208;temperature fast&#8208;charging systems. Notably, the cells achieve a capacity retention of 98.58% after 1200 cycles at &#8722;20&#176;C and 85.93% after 1500 cycles at 60&#176;C. Moreover, pouch cells configured with this electrolyte exhibit superior all&#8208;weather adaptability and fast&#8208;charging capability. This work offers valuable insights for developing high&#8208;performance SMBs operable under broad&#8208; temperature conditions.

         <title>Reversible Oxygen Redox in Li&#8208;Rich Mn Based Cathodes Achieved by Regulating the Local Environments of Bulk and Surface Lattice Oxygen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxides deliver high capacities by harnessing both cationic and anionic redox reactions, yet their practical application is severely limited by the instability of lattice oxygen redox (L&#8208;OR). Here, we disentangle the distinct roles of bulk and surface lattice oxygen in L&#8208;OR, demonstrate the feasibility of simultaneously regulating their local environments, and elucidate the critical importance of such regulation in stabilizing L&#8208;OR.








ABSTRACT
Lattice&#8208;oxygen redox (L&#8208;OR) has been widely considered a viable approach to attain high&#8208;capacity cathodes for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, achieving highly reversible L &#8208; OR remains challenging due to the intrinsic chemical instability of lattice oxygen. As such, stabilizing the lattice oxygen becomes necessary for improving the performance of cathode materials with oxygen redox chemistry. In this study, the distinct properties of both bulk and surface lattice oxygen are systematically studied in a model Li&#8208;rich layered oxide material (LRMO, i.e., Li1.2Ni0.2Mn0.6O2) by employing different techniques. We find that, in the bulk, distortions in octahedral coordination geometry are closely correlated with variations in the electronic structure, and the substitution of Li ions with protons in a subsurface layer enhances the stability of surface lattice oxygen by altering its coordination environment. By jointly regulating the local environments of both bulk and surface lattice oxygen, the initial Coulombic efficiency is remarkably improved from 73.88% to 91.72%. Moreover, the modified LRMO demonstrates an impressive cycle stability, which realizes a capacity retention of 95.9% after 500 cycles at 250&#160;mA g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates that&#160;rationally&#8208;designed local environments of lattice oxygen can effectively stabilize the oxygen redox in Li&#8208;rich cathodes.

         <title>Perspective on Aqueous Batteries: Historical Milestones and Modern Revival</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review retraces the development of aqueous batteries from classical Zn&#8208;MnO2 chemistry to modern Zn and Ni systems, correlating voltage, capacity, and electrolyte formulation with practical performance. By mapping historical success and failure onto current and future research directions, it identifies guiding principles that steer the design of safe, low&#8208;cost, and application&#8208;oriented aqueous energy storage.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous batteries have played a pivotal yet fluctuating role in the evolution of electrochemical energy storage. From their foundational success in lead&#8211;acid and nickel&#8208;based chemistries to their eclipse by lithium&#8208;ion batteries, aqueous systems were long regarded as technologically inferior due to limited energy density and poor cycling stability. However, the urgent demand for safe, low&#8208;cost, and sustainable storage has sparked a renaissance, fueled by breakthroughs in electrolyte engineering and advanced electrode materials for both anodes and cathodes. This review revisits the historical trajectory of commercialized aqueous batteries, extracting lessons from past successes and failures while highlighting the technological advances that now enable extended voltage windows, improved cycling stability, and scalable manufacturing. We argue that the future of aqueous batteries lies not in directly competing with lithium&#8208;ion in high&#8208;energy applications, but in complementing them across grid&#8208;scale storage, uninterruptible power supplies, and decentralized energy systems where safety, cost, and recyclability are paramount. By connecting history with current progress, we reflect on how these insights reshape expectations for the next generation of aqueous batteries and their role in a more diversified and sustainable energy storage landscape.

         <title>Residual Strain Evolution in Perovskite Solar Cells throughout Fabrication to Operation: Mechanisms, Characterization, and Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in residual strain engineering for perovskite solar cells, with a focus on the origins of strain during fabrication and operation, characterization methods, and strain regulation strategies. Besides, the impact of residual strain on device stability and efficiency is evaluated. Key factors influencing strain distribution are highlighted, and future directions are proposed for developing high&#8208;performance devices.








ABSTRACT
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 27%, but further improvements of both PCEs and stability are needed for commercialization. One of the key factors hindering their development is the unpredictable residual strain in perovskites. The unstable octahedral structure of the perovskite cage leads to easy changes in bond lengths, bond angles, and crystal structure. It in turn generates, accumulates, and causes the non&#8208;uniform distribution of residual strain, ultimately affecting device performance. Therefore, given the versatility and precise tunability, residual strain engineering provides an effective pathway to optimize the performance of PSCs. This review summarizes the causes of residual strain during device fabrication and operation, qualitative/quantitative/auxiliary characterization methods, and various effective strain regulation methods in the past two years. Finally, unresolved scientific issues and future research directions in strain engineering are discussed. This comprehensive review aims to provide researchers with the latest advances in strain engineering, deepen fundamental understanding of strain effects, and eventually help enhance the performance of PSCs.

         <title>Dynamic Upconversion Manipulation via Cross&#8208;Relaxation Engineering for Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise manipulation of cross&#8208;relaxation between specific energy levels, enabled by a dual&#8208;wavelength cooperative strategy, allows for dynamic control of upconversion luminescence in Er3+&#8208;Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Tm3+, Ho3+, Yb3+) doped NaYS2. Based on switchable luminescent colors and lifetime imaging, programmable logic gate arrays are implemented to construct a dynamic&#8208;random&#8208;visual encryption system for advanced optical information security.








ABSTRACT
Lanthanide ions (Ln3+) doped upconversion originates from their diverse 4f electron transitions. However, the direct manipulation of excited&#8208;state electron populations for dynamic emission modulation remains challenging. In this study, a cross&#8208;relaxation control paradigm, enabled by dual&#8208;wavelength cooperative excitation, is developed for dynamic upconversion engineering. The Er3+&#8208;Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Tm3+, Ho3+, Yb3+) doped NaYS2 platform precisely populates the dual&#8208;target energy levels via cross&#8208;relaxation pathways under cooperative excitation. This approach enables dynamic green&#8208;to&#8208;red luminescence switching while amplifying the red emission (&#8764;20&#8208;fold) by accelerating the cross&#8208;relaxation kinetics; Er3+ acts as the photon harvester, and Ln3+ serves as the cross&#8208;relaxation mediator to redirect population fluxes. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that this phenomenon originates from the unique properties of the low phonon energy, unique layered structure with a large interionic spacing, and high refractive index of the NaYS2 host. Finally, programmable upconversion logic gate arrays are implemented to develop a dynamic&#8208; random&#8208;visual encryption system for optical information security. This study establishes a novel paradigm for upconversion manipulation with unprecedented capabilities for advanced information technologies.

         <title>Flexible Hygroscopic Electronics for Real&#8208;Time Moisture Sorption&#8208;Desorption Monitoring and Smart Humidity Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate a humidity&#8208;regulation flexible hygroscopic electronics with ultra&#8208;sensitive properties using TEMPO&#8208;CNF polymeric gel. This is a new idea of combing the hygroscopic function with the sensory one together for active, real&#8208;time, sensitive detection of moisture sorption&#8208;desorption process and sensory warning, which establishes a new paradigm for smart humidity regulation systems by synergistically integrating moisture capture/release with in situ monitoring capabilities.








ABSTRACT
Humidity regulation plays a critical role in precision electronics, advanced storage, thermal, and energy management applications. While real&#8208;time monitoring of water molecule dynamics during moisture sorption and desorption processes could provide crucial hygroscopic parameters for smart humidity regulation, conventional gravimetric methods suffer from low tracking speed, limited accuracy, and an inability to perform in situ detection. Here, we report a flexible hygroscopic electronics (FHE) capable of simultaneously regulating environmental moisture and dynamically monitoring sorption&#8208;desorption processes through water&#8208;mediated resistive changes in confined space. The targeted electronics exhibit exceptional performance, including a fast hygroscopic response of &#8764;2.1 s at 90% RH, cycling stability, and stable sorption&#8208;desorption properties over more than 50 cycles. By engineering a series of modular array&#8208;based sensors, we achieve adjustable humidity control in enclosed spaces according to application&#8208;specific requirements. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the intelligent electronic array successfully maintains stable humidity conditions even in damaged equipment enclosures (&gt;3.5&#160;h) and provides rapid sensory alerts. This work establishes an intelligent core&#8208;shell FHE system, that absorbs unexpected moisture through a bio&#8208;based hygroscopic core and simultaneously monitors the water sorption/desorption behaviors by a thin conductive shell, which allows remote warning for potential seal risk of equipment in an early stage.

         <title>Self&#8208;Confinement Effect Enabled by Hollow Carbon Nanoreactor for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8211;Cl2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a hollow carbon nanoreactor with a self&#8208;confinement strategy for lithium&#8208;chlorine (Li&#9472;Cl2) batteries. By trapping active Cl2 species within its mesopores using size&#8208;selective micropores, it achieves a record capacity of 8000 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and an ultrahigh current density of 100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Rechargeable Li&#9472;Cl2 batteries represent a promising high&#8208;energy&#8208;density technology. However, the open&#8208;pore structure of conventional cathode materials poses a fundamental challenge by permitting the uncontrolled diffusion of Cl2 into the electrolyte, resulting in severe local concentration dilution that plagues rate capability and specific capacity. Herein, a self&#8208;confinement strategy by hollow carbon nanoreactors (HCNRs) is proposed to regulate the local concentration of active Cl2 species with micropores (&#8776;0.8&#160;nm) on their walls. These micropores act as size&#8208;selective barriers, allowing to block the escape of larger active Cl2 species (kinetic diameter &#8776;0.86&#160;nm), and mesopores (30&#8211;50&#160;nm) function as nanoreactors that concentrate active Cl2 species. This design enables the as&#8208;assembled Li&#9472;Cl2 cell to achieve an ultrahigh current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 during the charge/discharge process and a record&#8208;breaking specific capacity of 8000 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 (9 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2), superior to the reported literature. This hollow nanoreactor design highlights the potential of Li&#9472;Cl2 batteries as high&#8208;power and energy&#8208;dense systems, paving the way for their practical application.

         <title>High Charge Carrier Mobility in Non&#8208;Conjugated 3D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;conjugated 3D COF constructed via boronate ester linkages from tetraphenylene and pyrene&#8208;based monomers is reported, which exhibits a high charge carrier mobility of 14 &#177; 1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








ABSTRACT
&#960;&#8208;Conjugation, &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, and long&#8208;range order play a central role in determining charge transport efficiency in organic materials. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which uniquely integrate these key structural and electronic features, have emerged as a promising platform for the development of novel electrically conductive organic materials. Intraframework &#960;&#8208;conjugation has shown to play a key role in improving charge carrier mobility. Here, we report Joa&#8208;COF&#8208;2, a 3D COF lacking extended intraframework &#960;&#8208;conjugation, yet exhibiting a remarkable charge carrier mobility of 14 &#177; 1&#160; cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. Joa&#8208;COF&#8208;2 adopts an 11&#8208;fold interpenetrated dia topology, featuring a tight interframework &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which enables efficient charge transport in the absence of intraframework &#960;&#8208;conjugation.

         <title>Scalable Growth of Quasi&#8208;1D TiS3 Nanoribbons for High&#8208;Temperature Flexible Strain Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ethanol&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition produces vertically aligned TiS3 nanoribbons (NRs) with controllable aspect ratios, facilitating easy transfer. These TiS3 NRs maintain high conductivity from 80 to 593 K. Flexible strain sensors made from TiS3 NR networks stably detect microstrains as low as 40 at high temperatures of 773 K.








ABSTRACT
Quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;1D) van der Waals MX3 transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs), have emerged as a compelling material platform due to their unique quantum confinement effects and anisotropic properties. Nevertheless, the narrow growth window and extreme sensitivity to growth parameters make it challenging to synthesize TMTCs via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Herein, we demonstrate an ethanol&#8208;assisted CVD method for the scalable growth of TiS3 nanoribbons. This approach utilizes the combination of ethanol with TiCl4 and S powder to form a Ti source precursor, enabling the high yields of TiS3 nanoribbons with a thickness as low as 10 nm and lengths on the micrometer scale (140&#177;30 &#181;m, aspect ratio of approximately 260). Moreover, the nanoribbons exhibit epitaxial vertical alignment on substrates, facilitating the versatile transfer to arbitrary target substrates. The single TiS3 nanoribbon exhibits high conductivity (&#963;293 K = 3.1 &#215; 104 S/m) from 80 to 593 K. Flexible strain sensors based on TiS3 nanoribbon networks demonstrate a high gauge factor of 135.3, a wide strain detection range (40&#8211;7400 &#956;&#949;), and strong tolerance to temperatures up to 773 K. This strategy provides a unique pathway for synthesis of TMTCs, providing essential material support for the development of high&#8208;performance flexible electronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Ethanol-assisted chemical vapor deposition produces vertically aligned TiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoribbons (NRs) with controllable aspect ratios, facilitating easy transfer. These TiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NRs maintain high conductivity from 80 to 593 K. Flexible strain sensors made from TiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; NR networks stably detect microstrains as low as 40 at high temperatures of 773 K.

&lt;p&gt;Quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) van der Waals MX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTCs), have emerged as a compelling material platform due to their unique quantum confinement effects and anisotropic properties.

Herein, we demonstrate an ethanol-assisted CVD method for the scalable growth of TiS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoribbons.

         <title>Alleviating the Misalignment of Fe Single Sites Relative to Triple&#8208;Phase Interfaces to Achieve High Performance Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A relatively hydrophilic sandwiched ionomer/catalyst structure induces the formation of a continuous proton transfer network and the reduction of oxygen transportation. The unique structure results in the 80% increase of site utilization in proton exchange membrane fuel cells, with power density comparable to the currently reported best Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst.








ABSTRACT
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), represented by Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C, are promising alternatives to Pt in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, the molecular&#8208;scale misalignment of the SACs at the triple&#8208;phase interfaces (TPIs) has led to extremely low atomic efficiency, making it difficult to translate the high activity of SACs into the actual cell performance. Therefore, the design of the catalyst layer structure to increase the density of reactant&#8208;accessible single sites is crucial for the application of SACs in PEMFCs. Here, we report tailored catalyst layer structure induced by hierarchical porous Fe&#9472;N&#9472;Cpot catalysts with tuned surface hydrophilicity. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamic (MD) reveals macropores and tuned surface hydrophilicity act as molecular&#8208;level &#8220;on&#8208;switches&#8221; that pull Nafion/water domains deep inside, collapsing the classic transport bottlenecks for both O2 and H3O+. Combinatory spectroscopic evidence confirms the superiority of the structure in forming continuous mass transfer channels, thereby increasing site utilization of Fe by 80%. Exceptional Pmax at 1581&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 is achieved, and capable of sustaining 60k AST with 63% performance retained. This study establishes the first design rule that links pore hierarchy and surface chemistry to TPI activation.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Guided Design of Ru&#8211;NiFe Cathode Catalysts for Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis at Large Electrode Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on theoretical calculations guidance, a large&#8208;scale electrocatalyst with uniform activity was fabricated through an energy&#8208;efficient approach. By tuning properties like hydrogen intermediate adsorption/desorption strength, the catalyst achieves high activity and long&#8208;term stability. These large&#8208;area electrodes, with high activity, long&#8208;term stability, and scalable production, are highly significant for industrial hydrogen production via water electrolysis.








ABSTRACT
A significant gap persists between advanced catalyst synthesis in laboratories and the industrial requirements for water electrolysis. The key challenge lies in simultaneously achieving electrode scalability, high catalytic activity, and long&#8208;term stability. Through theoretical simulation screening, we synthesized a free&#8208;standing cathode catalyst composed of Ru clusters anchored on a NixFeyOOH substrate via Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni/Fe bridges. Advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru&#8211;NiFe catalyst achieves efficient catalytic activity due to Ru&#9472;O&#9472;Ni/Fe bridges, fine&#8208;tuning the electronic structure and enhancing catalytic energetics, while Ru cluster introduction increases the number of active sites and modulates hydrogen intermediate adsorption/desorption strength. The as&#8208;prepared Ru&#8211;NiFe electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction delivers ultralow overpotentials of 5&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and maintains stable operation at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 1000 h. A large&#8208;scale (19&#160;&#215;&#160;19 cm2) anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer (AEM&#8211;WE) based on Ru&#8211;NiFe shows a low cell voltage of 2.98&#160;V at 10 A and stable operation for 2800 h. This study provides valuable insights into designing large&#8208;area electrodes with high activity, long&#8208;term stability, and scalable production for industrial AEM&#8211;WE applications.

         <title>Combinatorial Assembly of Biomimetic Janus Membrane with Multiscale Architectures for Guided Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combinatorial assembly strategy for constructing a continuous Janus membrane with multiscale architectural features inspired by biological materials. The membrane features an asymmetric design, comprising a compact layer with a Bouligand architecture and a porous layer that recapitulates the trabecular structure of cancellous bone, enriched with hydroxyapatite crystals. The combinatorial assembly strategy offers a promising pathway toward multifunctional regenerative materials.








ABSTRACT
Guided bone regeneration (GBR) has gained significant attention in the field of bone tissue engineering. However, designing an effective barrier membrane that simultaneously meets the mechanical and biological requirements at the soft&#8211;hard tissue interface remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we&#160;introduce a combinatorial assembly strategy to construct a continuous Janus membrane with multiscale architectural features inspired by biological materials. Structurally, the membrane features an asymmetric design, comprising a compact layer with a Bouligand architecture that incorporates amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) to enhance mechanical strength and prevent soft tissue infiltration, and a porous layer that recapitulates the trabecular structure of cancellous bone, enriched with hydroxyapatite (HAp) crystals to promote cellular adhesion and osteoinduction. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo results show that the membrane not only exhibits excellent biocompatibility and barrier function but also significantly enhances osteogenic differentiation and bone regeneration in a cranial defect model. This work demonstrates that integrating diverse fabrication techniques enables the creation of functionally efficient GBR membranes with hierarchical structures, offering a promising pathway toward multifunctional regenerative materials.

         <title>Aequorea Victoria&#8208;Inspired Covalent Anchoring Enables Water&#8208;Resistant and Scalable Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence in Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Aequorea victoria, a covalent anchoring strategy using amphiphilic cellulose acetate enables water&#8208;resistant and mechanically adaptable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. The covalently immobilized chromophores exhibit long&#8208;lived afterglow even in water, while the thermoplastic and hydroplastic nature of cellulose allows scalable fabrication of 1D/2D/3D architectures for information encryption and anticounterfeiting applications.








ABSTRACT
Developing organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials stable in aqueous environments remains highly challenging due to the facile quenching of triplet excitons. Inspired by the protective &#946;&#8208;barrel architecture of the green fluorescent protein (Aequorea victoria), the study presented a covalent anchoring strategy based on an amphiphilic cellulose derivative (cellulose acetate) to construct water&#8208;resistant and scalable RTP materials. Covalent immobilization of chromophores within the rigid framework yields dynamic photoactivated afterglow, extending the lifetime from 2.1 to 946.4&#160;ms. The resulting films retain bright RTP even under water while exhibiting water&#8208;mediated tunable mechanical properties. Furthermore, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer with Rhodamine B enables full&#8208;color RTP spanning blue to orange. Benefiting from the inherent thermoplasticity and hydroplasticity of cellulose acetate, the RTP cellulose derivatives are readily processed into diverse 1D/2D/3D architectures and applied in multilevel information encryption. This covalent anchoring strategy offers a sustainable and commercially viable pathway to robust polysaccharide&#8208;based RTP, opening new opportunities for optoelectronics, security, and eco&#8208;friendly photonic technologies.

         <title>Bright 2D Polar Perovskite Scintillator with Ultrafast Decay by Suppressing Free Carrier Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneous polarization in polar RP perovskites suppresses the free&#8208;carrier recombination and promotes exciton formation, leading to the enhancement of exciton population and light yield. Meanwhile, the ultra&#8208;low dielectric constant accounts for the strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling and ultrafast luminescence decay. The synergy effects enable the ultrafast scintillation and high light yield in polar perovskite scintillator.








ABSTRACT
High light yield and ultrafast decay time are highly demanded for scintillators in sensitive, rapid radiation detection and imaging, but both properties can hardly coexist in a scintillator so far. Herein, we report a design principle for spontaneous polarization&#8208;enhanced scintillation in 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites. As anticipated, the (4&#8208;aminomethyl&#8208;1&#8208;cyclohexanecarboxylate)2PbBr4 (APB) perovskite displays high light yield up to 19&#160;660 photons/MeV and a lifetime of 0.90&#160;ns. Combining the experimental and computational results, we demonstrate that enhancement of dielectric screening effect and suppression of free carrier recombination are responsible for the ultrafast decay time and high light yield, respectively. Moreover, the practical applications for fast neutron imaging and flash X&#8208;ray radiography are successfully demonstrated with excellent spatial resolutions of 2.4 and 31 lp/mm, respectively. In addition, the potential for PET technique is verified by shorter CTR values than (LuxY1&#8208;x)2SiO5: Ce (LYSO). This work will open up a new avenue for developing high&#8208;performance ultrafast scintillators for practical applications in biomedical and nuclear detection techniques.

         <title>Universal Fluorine&#8208;Free Proton Exchange Polymers for High&#8208;Performance and Durable Fuel Cells Operable Under Severe Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to excellent physical and chemical stability, the novel designed fluorine&#8208;free polymers with aliphatic&#8208;chain backbones (SP&#8208;PAC12&#8208;QP) are regarded as promising and universal alternatives to perfluorosulfonic acid membranes. Their performances are further improved by physical reinforcement, where the fuel cell performance under high temperature and combined chemical and mechanical durability (109,580 cycles) of the produced SP&#8208;PAC1267&#8208;QP&#8208;4.5&#8208;PE&#8208;7 outperforms commercially stabilized Nafion XL.








ABSTRACT
Fluorine&#8208;free proton exchange membranes (PEMs) could offer a promising alternative to perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) membranes, addressing challenges such as negative environmental impact, high cost, and limited performance under harsh conditions. However, fluorine&#8208;free PEMs inherently suffer from low proton conductivity due to weaker acidity and poorly developed hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase&#8208;separation, along with limited mechanical and chemical stability. Here, we report a novel and universal fluorine&#8208;free PEMs featuring aliphatic chains in the backbone, which for the first time to dissolve all the issues mentioned, such as 2.6 times higher proton conductivity than PFSAs. Further physical reinforcement (SP&#8208;PAC1267&#8208;QP&#8208;4.5&#8208;PE&#8208;7) effectively extended their lifetime to 335.1 times of the original SP&#8208;PAC1267&#8208;QP&#8208;3.5, and exceeded 1.3 times of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fluorinated Nafion XL reinforced membrane, in the severely accelerated durability test. Furthermore, the fluorine&#8208;free PEMs exhibited outstanding performance than Nafion XL, especially at elevated temperatures, proving their practical applicability as a promising alternative to the fluorinated counterparts.

         <title>Rewriting Polymer Fate via Chemomechanical Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a life&#8208;like &#8220;living&#8221; polymer platform that can grow, degrow, and reprogram its properties after fabrication. By integrating mass transport, reversible polymerization, and controlled catalysis, the material achieves on&#8208;demand changes in size, shape, and mechanical properties. Such dynamic behavior has enabled self&#8208;growable electronics, transformable soft robots, and regenerating devices, paving the way for reprogrammable applications.








ABSTRACT
How can synthetic polymers be endowed with the continuous, life&#8208;like ability to grow, degrow, heal, and alter their chemical and physical properties after fabrication? This study addresses this question by coupling theory and experiment to create an open&#8208;system &#8220;living&#8221; polymer platform that integrates mass transport, reversible polymerization, chain exchange, and evolving elasticity into a fully chemomechanically coupled network. Controlled transport, reaction, and stresses enable continuous growth and degrowth with microscale control enabled by light&#8208;activated catalysts. Their chemical composition can be reprogrammed on demand, tuning modulus by up to two orders of magnitude to either stiffen or soften the material. These capabilities enable self&#8208;growable electronics, transformative soft robots, and on&#8208;site damage&#8208;regenerating devices, establishing a foundation for sustainable, endlessly reprogrammable polymers.

         <title>Optimizing f&#8208;d Hybridization Descriptor in Rare&#8208;Earth Oxides for Efficient Sulfur Catalysis in all Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare&#8208;earth oxides enable strong f&#8208;d&#8208;p orbital hybridization at the catalyst&#8208;sulfur interface, which enhances interfacial electronic coupling and Li+ transport in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. This enlarged electron cloud overlap effectively lowers kinetic barriers for sulfur redox. The hybridization strength is quantitatively captured by If&#8208;d, which serves as an effective descriptor for sulfur reaction kinetics and electrochemical performance.








ABSTRACT
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) offer high theoretical energy density and intrinsic safety, yet their development is hindered by sluggish sulfur redox kinetics at the solid&#8211;solid interfaces due to the weak orbital overlap and discontinuous electronic coupling at these regions. Here, we propose rare&#8208;earth oxide catalysts that accelerate the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) in ASSLSBs by strengthening the f&#8208;d&#8208;p hybridization at catalyst&#8208;sulfur&#8208;electrolyte interfaces. We first define a hybridization&#8208;strength factor, If&#8208;d, derived from the electron densities of occupied 4f and unoccupied 5d states, which quantifies interfacial hybridization and directly correlates with the metal&#8208;sulfur coupling strength. Catalysts with higher If&#8208;d exhibit lower activation energy (Ea) and the overpotential (&#951;) during SRR, validating its role as a structure&#8208;activity descriptor for catalyst screening and design. Guided by this descriptor, the screened Lu2O3 catalyst minimizes kinetic barriers (0.088&#160;eV), and thus enabling stable cycling for over 20&#160;000 cycles at 5 C, and an ultra&#8208;high areal capacity of 14.48 mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at room temperature, among the highest performances reported for ASSLSBs. This work fills the mechanistic gap between interfacial orbital interactions and battery performance and paves the way toward catalyst design for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;life ASSLSBs.

         <dc:description>
Ternary all&#8208;component&#8208;active heterostructures featuring electron&#8208;complementation interfaces were synthesized via a versatile overpotential&#8208;driven strategy, enabling high capacity of 492 mAh g&#8722;1 and robust cycling stability up to 9000 cycles, outperforming any individual integrated component. The synthesis strategy has been validated across typical vanadium/bismuth/manganese&#8208;based oxide&#8208;chalcogenide&#8208;metal ternary heterostructures, demonstrating broad universality and impressive performance advances.

Constructing multiphase heterostructures by interweaving characteristically complementary oxides, sulfides, and metals is promising for advancing aqueous battery electrodes, yet versatile synthesis and heterointerface insight pose significant challenges. Traditional methods often suffer from specificity optimization and non&#8208;redox&#8208;active substrate dependency, compromising performance. Herein, we overcome these limitations with a versatile overpotential&#8208;driven synthetic strategy that enables precisely engineering ternary all&#8208;component&#8208;active heterostructures for compromise&#8208;free high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc batteries. Analysis of localized structure and first&#8208;principles calculations in the model integrated V2O5@Cu2S@Cu heterostructure strongly suggest the formation of amorphous/crystalline bridging interfaces with electronic complementarity, which facilitates deep charge transfer and superior kinetics. In situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectra reveal the synergistic multi&#8208;electron redox merging anion coordination, collectively enabling the all&#8208;component redox activity and preferred rate capability. As results, V2O5@Cu2S@Cu delivers a high reversible capacity of 492 mAh g&#8722;1, enabling 9000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1 with 90% capacity retention, greatly surpassing those of any single component. Such synthesis method has been further extended to other accessible vanadium&#8208;based, manganese&#8208;based and bismuth&#8208;based ternary heterostructures, representing an important yet unexplored path to the fabrication of high&#8208;performance aqueous battery cathodes featuring elaborate heterointerface manipulation.

         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic polymers (MOPs) are synthesized by calcinating WCl6 and 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid. The MOPs can catalyze through both photocatalytic and thermal pathways, achieving a high H2O2 production rate of 11.25 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and a high concentration of 1.02 g&#183;L&#8722;1 with 2.74% solar to chemical conversion efficiency.








ABSTRACT
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a critical industrial chemical traditionally produced via the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. Here, we report a low&#8208;cost (&lt;$0.6/g), hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;organic polymer (MIL&#8208;2OH&#8208;W) featuring abundant undercoordinated [WO6]6&#8722; centers for solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production. MIL&#8208;2OH&#8208;W achieves a record production rate of&#160;11.25 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 in the first 10&#160;min and becomes saturated to 3 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 in 1&#160;h, reaching a concentration of&#160;1.02 g&#183;L&#8722;1&#160;(30 mmol&#183;L&#8722;1) with a&#160;2.74% solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical efficiency&#160;under mild conditions (40&#176;C). Mechanistic studies from in&#8208;situ&#160;transient absorption, in&#8208;situ infrared, in&#8208;situ electron paramagnetic resonance and density functional theory reveal a synergistic photothermal pathway, where aromatic hydroxyl linkers mimic anthraquinone&#8208;like redox cycling, stabilize radical intermediates, and accelerate oxygen reduction. The catalyst exhibits exceptional stability (&gt;40 days) and scalability, aligning with the United Nations decarbonization goals. This work provides a blueprint for sustainable H2O2 synthesis by integrating photothermal catalysis with waste&#8208;heat utilization.

         <title>Epigenetic Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanoagonist Overcomes Triple Defenses to Enable Effective Chemo&#8208;Metalloimmunotherapy in Platinum&#8208;Resistant Ovarian Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanoagonist (CMZ&#8208;Pt&#8208;SA@HA) overcomes three defense barriers to enable effective chemo&#8208;metalloimmunotherapy in platinum&#8208;resistant ovarian cancer (PROC). This is achieved through the &#8220;POP&#8221; strategy: (I) Pre&#8208;targeting to enhance DNA&#8208;Cispt adduct formation; (II) On&#8208;targeting to block adduct repair; and (III) Post&#8208;targeting to trigger apoptosis. CMZ&#8208;Pt&#8208;SA@HA not only reverses CisPt resistance and activates STING, but also offers MRI visibility, supporting its potential for clinical use.








ABSTRACT
Platinum&#8208;resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) responds poorly to platinum chemotherapy and evades immune surveillance by suppressing the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, leading to poor outcomes. Herein, we developed an epigenetic metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanoagonist (CMZ&#8208;Pt&#8208;SA@HA) that overcomes cisplatin (CisPt) resistance while restoring immune activation. The platform consists of Mn&#8208;ZIF&#8208;8 encapsulating CaO2 and co&#8208;loaded with CisPt and SAHA (a histone deacetylase inhibitor), then modified with hyaluronic acid to enable tumor targeting and controlled release. CMZ&#8208;Pt&#8208;SA@HA is multifunctional: SAHA downregulates resistance proteins epigenetically, CaO2 triggers calcium overload and oxygen release, and Mn2+/Zn2+ enhances oxidative stress and STING signaling, collectively strengthening chemo&#8208;metalloimmunotherapy. These mechanisms intensify CisPt&#8208;induced DNA damage and stimulate immune activation. CMZ&#8208;Pt&#8208;SA@HA applies a three&#8208;step &#8220;POP&#8221; strategy to overcome PROC's triple defenses: (I) Pre&#8208;targeting to enhance DNA&#8208;CisPt adducts; (II) On&#8208;targeting to block DNA repair; and (III) Post&#8208;targeting to induce apoptosis by relieving hypoxia, arresting the cell cycle, damaging mitochondria, and activating cGAS&#8208;STING. Whether used alone in subcutaneous tumors in preclinical ID8 and patient&#8208;derived xenograft mouse models, or combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy in ascites metastasis models, CMZ&#8208;Pt&#8208;SA@HA consistently showed strong therapeutic efficacy. Its Mn2+&#8208;based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) capability further supports image&#8208;guided therapy and clinical translation.

         <title>Surface Oxophilicity Driven *N Pathway Tuning for Selective Nitrate Electroreduction to Nitrogen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing Sn&#8208;induced surface oxophilicity, Pd metallenes are engineered to precisely regulate nitrogen&#8208;oxygen intermediate adsorption and *N reaction pathways, thereby achieving efficient and intrinsically selective nitrate to N2 conversion. The optimized oxophilicity ensures sufficient *N availability and suppresses undesired *NH hydrogenation, promoting sustainable nitrogen recycling.








ABSTRACT
Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to nitrogen (N2) offers a sustainable pathway to close the nitrogen cycle and mitigate nitrate pollution. However, for Cu, Co, and other transition&#8208;metal catalysts, high N2 selectivity has mainly relied on breakpoint chlorination, which consumes large amounts of chlorine and poses secondary contamination risks. Here, we introduce a surface&#8208;oxophilicity strategy to steer the *N pathway, thereby enhancing both catalytic efficiency and intrinsic nitrogen selectivity. Among oxophilicity&#8208;modified Pd, Sn doping emerged as the optimal configuration. The resulting PdSn metallene aerogels achieve remarkable NO3&#8722;&#8208;N conversion (&#8764;97%) and N2 selectivity (&#8764;99%), together with long&#8208;term stability (&gt;600 h) and broad tolerance to variable nitrate concentrations. In situ characterization and theoretical analyses reveal that Sn&#8208;induced oxophilicity strengthens nitrogen&#8208;oxygen intermediate adsorption, ensuring sufficient *N availability for N&#8208;N coupling while elevating the hydrogenation barrier of *N &#8594; *NH, thus suppressing NH3 formation. Integrated into a Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery and a customized gas&#8208;integrated flow electrolyzer, the catalyst enables efficient nitrate removal and nearly complete N2 selectivity, offering a promising platform for sustainable nitrogen recycling and energy conversion.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;to&#8208;IHP Zn Interphase Engineering With Mannitol Additive Enables (002)&#8208;Textured Zn Plating With Suppressed Hydrogen Evolution Reaction for Ah&#8208;Level Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Pouch Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A sugar alcohol&#8208;based multifunctional additive of mannitol, identified via theoretical screening based on molecular characteristics of electrostatic polarity, H2O binding energy, and LUMO level, is proposed to achieve comprehensive Zn/electrolyte interphase stabilization from the bulk phase to the inner Helmholtz plane. Based on a mannitol&#8208;containing electrolyte, multiple Ah&#8208;level Zn||I2 pouch cells with only 0.02% capacity decay per cycle were successfully fabricated, validating its potential in practical applications.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries are promising contenders for next&#8208;generation grid&#8208;scale energy storage batteries. However, their deployment is hindered by zinc anode degradation at moderate cycling rates (0.5&#8211;2 C), including dendrite growth and parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), stemming from an unstable Zn/electrolyte interphase. Herein, a sugar alcohol&#8208;based multifunctional additive of mannitol (ML), identified via theoretical screening based on molecular characteristics of electrostatic polarity, H2O binding energy, and LUMO level, is proposed to achieve comprehensive Zn/electrolyte interphase stabilization from the bulk phase to the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). Leveraging abundant hydroxyl groups and good Zn2+ affinity, ML disrupts the bulk hydrogen&#8208;bond network and reconstructs Zn2+ solvation structure, simultaneously suppressing proton&#8208;hopping pathways and accelerating Zn2+ desolvation. Moreover, robust chemisorption of ML molecules on both Zn (002) and Zn (101) planes modulates Zn deposition toward the thermodynamically stable (002) texture with enlarged grain size, thereby enabling dendrite&#8208;free plating. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, Zn||I2 full cells achieve an ultrahigh areal capacity of 6.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 over 3000 cycles at a practical rate of 1 C. Multiple Ah&#8208;level Zn||I2 pouch cells are also demonstrated, sustaining 1000 cycles with only 0.02% capacity decay per cycle, underscoring strong prospects for practical large&#8208;scale application.

         <title>Function&#8208;Oriented Modular Molecular Design of a Chitin&#8208;Derived Self&#8208;Healable Binder for Promising Zinc Powder Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modularly engineered chitin&#8208;derived binder is developed via the integration of synergistic functional modules, which empowers zinc micropowder electrodes with robust microstructural integrity, continuous ion/electron transport pathways, and self&#8208;healing ability to maintain high zinc deposition/dissolution reversibility. This work verifies modular molecular design as a potent and pivotal strategy for developing high&#8208;performance binders under harsh electrochemical conditions.








ABSTRACT
Replacing zinc foil with Zn micropowders (ZnMPs) enhances manufacturing compatibility for Zn&#8208;metal batteries but imposes challenges like uncontrolled Zn deposition and accelerated structural degradation, typically resulting in a short cycle life of &lt; 50 cycles. Herein, we synthesize a multifunctional bottle&#8208;brush polycationic binder based on naturally abundant and mechanically robust chitin, which enables exceptional long&#8208;term Zn plating/stripping reversibility, averaging 99.5% Coulombic efficiency over 300 cycles. The design rationales are experimentally validated as follows: diverse functional groups integrated onto the chitin backbone provide multiple supramolecular interactions ensuring ZnMP electrodes&#8217; spatial uniformity and structural robustness; Zn2+&#8208;carboxylate coordination simultaneously enhances the binder's mechanical strength (~1.2 MPa), toughness (~8.6&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) and ionic conductivity (an 87% increase, reaching 1.72 &#215; 10&#8722;5 S cm&#8722;1) upon swelling; while synergistic dynamic electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding permit rapid self&#8208;recovery of the electrodes during cycling. This work underscores the promise of supramolecular engineering for binders targeting aggressive electrode chemistries.

         <title>Directional Catalysis of Sulfur at Highly Ordered Triple&#8208;Phase Interfaces in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomically dispersed cobalt on carbon nanotubes to directionally catalyze sulfur conversion via Co 3d&#8208;S 3p orbital hybridization was designed. The tailored triple&#8208;phase interface enables hierarchical transport networks and suppresses side reactions. Therefore, the resulting cathode exhibits rapid reaction kinetics and achieves a favorable electrochemical performance.








ABSTRACT
Sluggish sulfur reaction kinetics present a critical barrier to the practical application of sulfide&#8208;electrolyte (SE) based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs). Achieving high performance requires both lowering the intrinsic energy barrier for sulfur conversion and engineering efficient transport pathways. Herein, we address these challenges by designing atomically dispersed cobalt sites on carbon nanotubes to directionally catalyze sulfur conversion at the triple phase interface. Strong orbital hybridization between Co 3d and S 3p states strengthens chemical bonding, effectively accelerating both sulfur reduction and lithium sulfide oxidation. The interfaces tailored for directional catalysis maximize highly ordered C/S/SE triple&#8208;phase interfaces and minimize SE/C interfaces, establishing hierarchical ionic/electronic transport networks while mitigating side reactions. Consequently, the engineered cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 1108 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C, retaining 97 % capacity over 500 cycles. The resulting batteries also demonstrate remarkable robustness under demanding conditions. This work offers a powerful catalysis&#8208;driven strategy for high&#8208;performance ASSLSBs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Amplified Nanomedicine Enables Lysosomal Blockade to Potentiate Starvation Therapy of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present a cascade metabolic blockade strategy to overcome adaptive metabolic compensation in starvation therapy for PDAC. A hypoxia&#8208;responsive nanomedicine is engineered for self&#8208;amplified relay delivery of glucose oxidase (GOx) to deplete glucose and chloroquine (CQ) to inhibit lysosome&#8208;mediated metabolic compensation. Combined with a biomimetic tumor&#8208;targeting carrier, this system dismantles metabolic plasticity, amplifies bioenergetic stress, and provides a translatable framework for glycolysis&#8208;addicted malignancies.








ABSTRACT
Starvation therapy targeting the metabolic vulnerability of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) holds great potential; however, analyses of clinical samples and orthotopic models reveal that its efficacy is undermined by lysosome&#8208;mediated metabolic compensation. To disrupt this metabolic adaptability, we herein engineer a homotypic membrane&#8208;camouflaged nanomedicine capable of hypoxia&#8208;responsive cascade drug release and enhanced tumor accumulation. The resulting nanomedicine performs a hypoxia&#8208;induced phase transition that first liberates glucose oxidase to intensify oxygen deprivation and subsequently triggers burst release of chloroquine. Such a design of self&#8208;amplified relay drug release ensures effective starvation induction and precise lysosomal alkalization, thereby shutting down lysosome&#8208;mediated nutrient recycling. In a xenograft orthotopic PDAC model, this nanomedicine achieves 9.75&#8208;fold increase in tumor accumulation, robust tumor inhibition of 92.8%, and an elevated survival rate of 80% with favorable biosafety. Collectively, our findings highlight lysosomal disruption as a therapeutic lever to potentiate starvation therapy and provide a clinically actionable nanoplatform to enhance metabolic interventions for other metabolically vulnerable malignancies.

         <title>Halide Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries: From Fundamental Chemistry to Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically elaborates on the fundamental chemistry, ion transport mechanism, synthesis&#8208;structure&#8208;property relationships, and interface engineering of halide electrolytes for ASSSBs, establishes a sodium&#8208;halide&#8208;specific analytical framework, quantifies humidity stability effects, correlates interfacial phenomena with full&#8208;cell performance, analyzes core challenges, and provides concrete design principles as well as actionable commercialization pathways.








ABSTRACT
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (ASSSBs) stand out as a transformative energy storage technology, combining sodium's natural abundance with enhanced safety and competitive energy density. Solid electrolytes are pivotal to this innovation, with halide electrolytes emerging as prominent candidates due to their unique strengths&#8212;superior deformability for intimate electrode contact, strong cathode compatibility, and promising Na&#8208;ion conductivity. Despite recent progress, significant challenges persist in scalable synthesis, performance optimization, and mechanistic understanding of ion transport and interfacial interactions. This review comprehensively covers sodium&#8208;based halide electrolytes, including their structural chemistry, ion transport, synthesis, modification, electrochemical stability, interfacial behavior, and computational insights. We further integrate a systematic framework to elucidate intricate synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships, enabling a holistic understanding for rational material design. Crucially, this work distinguishes itself by distilling concrete design principles for Na&#8208;halide conductors, providing quantitative insights into humidity stability, and establishing in&#8208;depth correlations between interphases/degradation modes and full&#8208;cell metrics. Moreover, a practical assessment of key performance metrics (energy density, power density, cycle life) and design guidance is presented. Finally, we pinpoint critical barriers (moisture sensitivity, anode incompatibility, and conductivity limitations) and outline a roadmap emphasizing compositional design, interface engineering, manufacturing scalability, machine learning, operando characterization, and standardized metrics to accelerate commercialization.

&lt;p&gt;This review systematically elaborates on the fundamental chemistry, ion transport mechanism, synthesis-structure-property relationships, and interface engineering of halide electrolytes for ASSSBs, establishes a sodium-halide-specific analytical framework, quantifies humidity stability effects, correlates interfacial phenomena with full-cell performance, analyzes core challenges, and provides concrete design principles as well as actionable commercialization pathways.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-solid-state sodium batteries (ASSSBs) stand out as a transformative energy storage technology, combining sodium's natural abundance with enhanced safety and competitive energy density. Solid electrolytes are pivotal to this innovation, with halide electrolytes emerging as prominent candidates due to their unique strengths&#8212;superior deformability for intimate electrode contact, strong cathode compatibility, and promising Na-ion conductivity. Despite recent progress, significant challenges persist in scalable synthesis, performance optimization, and mechanistic understanding of ion transport and interfacial interactions. This review comprehensively covers sodium-based halide electrolytes, including their structural chemistry, ion transport, synthesis, modification, electrochemical stability, interfacial behavior, and computational insights. We further integrate a systematic framework to elucidate intricate synthesis&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships, enabling a holistic understanding for rational material design. Crucially, this work distinguishes itself by distilling concrete design principles for Na-halide conductors, providing quantitative insights into humidity stability, and establishing in-depth correlations between interphases/degradation modes and full-cell metrics. Moreover, a practical assessment of key performance metrics (energy density, power density, cycle life) and design guidance is presented. Finally, we pinpoint critical barriers (moisture sensitivity, anode incompatibility, and conductivity limitations) and outline a roadmap emphasizing compositional design, interface engineering, manufacturing scalability, machine learning, operando characterization, and standardized metrics to accelerate commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emerging Biomaterials Blocking PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 Pathway for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the emerging biomaterial alternatives to monoclonal antibodies for blocking PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway, including peptides, nucleic acids, small molecule inhibitors, and natural compounds. These novel biomaterials could invigorate anticancer immune responses through suppressing PD&#8208;L1 expression, promoting PD&#8208;L1 degradation, or directly inhibiting PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 interactions, which in combination with existing therapeutic modalities would further potentiate the therapeutic efficacy in cancer treatment.








ABSTRACT
Conventional monoclonal antibodies targeting either PD&#8208;1 or PD&#8208;L1, despite the clinical significance as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), exhibit limited effect in the majority of cancer patients. The persistent challenges in ICIs have prompted extensive research into next&#8208;generation biomaterial&#8208;based immunotherapeutic strategies to inhibit PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway. Herein, this review started with the retrospect of recent insights into the dynamic regulation of PD&#8208;L1 expression patterns and its multifaceted functional mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment. Subsequently, the emerging alternatives to PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 inhibitors are summarized by their categories, including peptides, nucleic acids, small molecule inhibitors, and natural compounds, which could function by reducing PD&#8208;L1 expression, degrading PD&#8208;L1, or inhibiting PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 interactions. Furthermore, recent efforts on combination therapy based on these biomaterials are discussed, especially those with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, and sonodynamic therapy. This paradigm shift in PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 immune checkpoint blockade therapy underscores the prospects of emerging biomaterials in orchestrating anticancer immune responses, which would provide insights for developing next&#8208;generation immunotherapeutic strategies for clinical oncology to improve patient outcomes.

         <title>Broadband Circularly Polarized Light Detection via Spin&#8208;Selective Charge Transport in Quantum Dot Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Broadband quantum dot photodiodes enable circularly polarized light detection by exploiting chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity in their electron transport layer. Chiral ligand&#8208;functionalized ZnO electron transport layers selectively transmit spin&#8208;polarized carriers from quantum dots, enabling effective circularly polarized light sensitivity across UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR&#8211;SWIR. This strategy establishes a passive platform for broadband polarization&#8208;resolved optoelectronics.








ABSTRACT
Circularly polarized light (CPL) detection provides polarization&#8208;resolved information, enabling advanced applications in quantum technologies, bioimaging, secure communications, and multi&#8208;level optical data processing. However, conventional CPL photodetectors typically rely on intrinsically chiral absorbers, restricting operation to the UV&#8211;vis range and hindering extension into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR), which are critical for deep tissue imaging and low&#8208;visibility sensing. Here, we demonstrate broadband CPL detection with quantum dot (QD) photodiodes that exploit the chiral&#8208;induced spin selectivity effect in chiral&#8208;ZnO charge transport layers. Chiral ligand&#8208;functionalized ZnO electron transport layers selectively transmit spin&#8208;polarized charge carriers from QDs, enabling CPL&#8208;specific photocurrent generation even in spectral regions without intrinsic chiral absorption. Heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free Cu&#8211;In&#8211;Se QD&#8208;photodiodes exhibit outstanding specific detectivity (D*) of 1.28 &#215; 1012 Jones without external bias and broadband CPL detection (gIph: &#8764;0.17 at 260&#160;nm and &#8764;0.13 at 780&#160;nm), while PbS QD&#8208;devices extend CPL detection across 250&#8211;1700&#160;nm (UV&#8211;Vis&#8211;NIR&#8211;SWIR) with superior performance (D*: 1.45 &#215; 1012 Jones). The chiral&#8208;transport&#8208;driven strategy offers fundamental insights into CPL photodetection and establishes a scalable and optically passive platform for broadband polarization&#8208;resolved optoelectronics.

         <title>Metamaterial Antennas Enhance MRI of the Eye and Occipital Brain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiofrequency antenna platform comprising planar and bend configurations is developed, incorporating structurally integrated epsilon&#8208;negative metamaterial unit cells to enhance MRI. These antennas enable high&#8208;resolution in vivo human&#160;MRI of the eye, orbit, and occipital brain. Comprehensive validation, including simulations, phantom experiments, SAR, MR thermometry, B&#8321;+ mapping, and in vivo MRI in healthy volunteers and one volunteer with retinal pathology, demonstrates clinical feasibility.








ABSTRACT
A metamaterial&#8208;integrated radio frequency antenna (MTMA), implemented in planar and bend configurations, enables high&#8208;resolution MRI of the eye, orbit, and occipital brain at 7.0 T. Its dual&#8208;layer co&#8208;planar architecture integrates a two&#8208;channel transceive loop with a metamaterial layer composed of subwavelength epsilon&#8208;negative unit cells. These unit cells were custom&#8208;designed based on classical split&#8208;ring resonators for operation at 7.0 T. Electromagnetic simulations, including human voxel models, guided the design and characterization of the MTMA's electromagnetic behavior. Both MTMA configurations were benchmarked against conventional loop coil arrays in phantoms and in vivo for experimental validation, demonstrating enhanced transmit (B1+) efficiency and receive sensitivity enabled by the metamaterial layer through resonant near&#8208;field coupling. MRI safety was verified through SAR simulations, bio&#8208;thermal modeling, Magnetic Resonance thermometry, and fiber&#8208;optic sensors, confirming compliance with safety guidelines. The Bend&#8208;MTMA enabled in vivo human MRI of the eye and orbit in healthy volunteers, including B1+ mapping, and provided diagnostic T1&#8208; and T2&#8208;weighted imaging in volunteers with retinal pathology and sinus cysts, demonstrating clinical applicability. The Planar&#8208;MTMA enabled occipital lobe MRI in human volunteers, achieving superior signal coverage and transmit performance. The modular unit cell design enables tuning across MRI magnetic field strengths, establishing a clinically translatable metamaterial&#8208;integrated antenna platform for ocular and neurological imaging.

Super&#8208;Steep Subthreshold Swing
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202510618), Woojin Park, Yonghun Kim, Byungjin Cho, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate super&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS) below 60 mV dec&#8722;1 in graphene/IGZO cold source transistor arrays. Linear density of states with Dirac cone in graphene suppress the Boltzmann thermal tail, while high&#8208;k HfO2 dielectric having small body factor enhanced gating efficiency, hereby further reducing SS. An average SS of &#8776;46.4 mV dec&#8722;1 is achieved in the array, enabling ultralow&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed electronics.

Extremely Backscattering Suppression Structure
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202512727), Benfeng Bai, Xiaopeng Hao, Hong&#8208;Bo Sun, and co&#8208;workers report a hierarchical structure with nanodefects that exhibits extremely backscattering suppression of broadband infrared light. They discovered and utilized an energy negative feedback regulation mechanism in laser&#8208;material interaction to achieve this. This structure can achieve a suppression of over 98%, which can be used for making high&#8208;performance blackbodies, offering a promising route toward precise infrared calibration and detection.

         <title>Polymers for Biomedical Applications: the Quest for Treating Cardiovascular Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modifications of stents can improve their endothelialization, which reduces the risk for thrombosis and restenosis. Biodegradability ensures no foreign body material remains over time, while shape memory expansion reduces damage to the arterial wall. Finally, advanced processing methods enable personalized treatments. The convergence of all these research fields could lead to improved stents for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide. Current treatments using balloon angioplasty, stents, and bypass grafts still suffer from significant risks of restenosis and thrombosis. This review outlines key research areas where polymers are used in treatments for cardiovascular diseases, highlighting developments from the last decade. Designed to serve both experts and non&#8208;experts in the field, it requires little prior knowledge of the subject. A description of the cardiovascular system, cardiovascular diseases, current treatments, and their limitations are first introduced. After providing a detailed overview of the basic and advanced requirements for new treatments, recent advances in key research fields where polymers are applied to achieve these goals are highlighted. While surface modifications aim to improve endothelialization and/or prevent neointimal proliferation, shape memory polymer stents are intended to reduce damage to the arterial wall upon expansion. Research has also focused on developing biodegradable polymer stents to avoid any remaining material in the artery after healing. Finally, various advanced processing methods enable the production of polymeric personalized stents. By addressing various research areas in a single review, the interplay among them is highlighted, demonstrating that their convergence is essential for optimizing treatments and improving human quality of life.

Abstract
Thin&#8208;film batteries (TFBs) are vital for powering miniaturized electronics and Internet of Things(IoT) devices, offering compact size, long cycle life, and high safety. Utilizing solid&#8208;state electrolytes and thin&#8208;film deposition, TFBs integrate seamlessly with microelectronic systems. Advances in fabrication methods such as magnetron sputtering and atomic layer deposition, adapted from semiconductor manufacturing, have enhanced scalability, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical performance. Direct on&#8208;chip integration simplifies design and boosts energy efficiency, making TFBs key for next&#8208;generation electronics. Coupling TFBs with energy&#8208;harvesting technologies like solar cells or thermoelectrics enables self&#8208;sustaining systems. However, challenges remain, including low areal energy density and limits to further miniaturization. Progress in materials science, electrochemistry, and microfabrication is needed to overcome these barriers. This review summarizes recent TFB advances, classifying and analyzing materials, and detailing deposition processes and their refinements. It also addresses issues in processing, packaging, and operation, and describes analytical tools for evaluating structural and chemical stability. Finally, it highlights future application prospects and unresolved questions, providing a blueprint for ongoing research and guiding innovation toward wider adoption of TFB technology.

         <title>Ferroelectrics Hybrids: Harnessing Multifunctionality of 2D Semiconductors in the Post&#8208;Moore Era</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this Review, the state of art of ferroelectric hybrid systems&#8212;combining ferroelectrics, 2D semiconductors, and molecular switches is presented&#8212;as next&#8208;generation platforms for high&#8208;density, multifunctional electronics. By discussing 2D FeFET applications, nanoscale material downscaling, M3D integration, and emerging ferroelectrics, it highlights strategies to overcome scaling bottlenecks and unlock device&#8208;level multifunctionality.








Abstract
The rise of big data in today's computing has highlighted the significant limitations of von Neumann architectures for data storage and processing. Concurrently, the downscaling of silicon&#8208;based transistors while retaining low power efficiency and high system reliability has become increasingly challenging. By adopting a post&#8208;Moore approach, this Review proposes the use of hybrid systems comprising ferroelectric materials, 2D semiconductors, and functional molecular switches to respond to current demands for simultaneous high integration density and multifunctional performance. The representative applications of 2D ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) are reviewed and advances in shrinking ferroelectric domain walls at the (sub)nanometer scale are highlighted. The incorporation of molecular switches to enable multimodal device programmability is explored and the implementation of monolithic 3D (M3D) integration to boost chip&#8208;level density and system functionality is discussed. Finally, a forward&#8208;looking vision is presented for future transistors built upon novel ferroelectric platforms. Taken together, this triple&#8208;hybrid paradigm offers a compelling path to transcend Moore's law, paving the way for next&#8208;generation electronics with unprecedented functions and performance.

Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm for innovation design of polymers is emerging as an exciting frontier. The unique chain structure of polymers makes AI processing complex, bringing numerous challenges, such as small data problems and polymer multiscale descriptors. This review provides a cutting&#8208;edge overview of the current state, challenges, and solutions of AI&#8208;assisted design of advanced polymeric materials.








Abstract
Leveraging the artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm for the innovation of advanced polymeric materials is emerging as an exciting frontier in the cross&#8208;disciplinary material community. The big data analysis and prediction capabilities of AI accelerate the discovery and development of polymers with tailored properties. The concept of AI&#8208;assisted polymer design involves a paradigm shift from traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimentation to a more efficient, data&#8208;driven methodology. To date, various AI algorithms have been developed for the structural design and composition optimization of advanced polymeric materials. It mainly involves three steps, including material information digitization and database construction, establishment of AI prediction models, and AI&#8208;based design and optimization. However, the intrinsic data characteristics and intricate relationships between multiscale structure and polymer property pose tough data and modeling challenges. Advanced approaches are proposed to address these challenges, such as digitalizing polymer multiscale structures, implementing multitask and multimodal learning methods, and inverse design and automatic optimization. This review aims to provide an insightful overview of the current state of AI&#8208;assisted polymer design, highlighting the polymer characteristics and corresponding challenges, achievable strategies, and development direction.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Engineered Rubidium Lead Halide Nanocrystals for Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Broadband Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyro&#8208;Phototronic effect in centrosymmetric 2D RbPb2Cl5 nanocrystals have been observed as a function of halide deficiency. These have lead heptrahedra and prepared following a template approach of cation exchange. Using ligand chemistry, different morphologies of these nanocrystals are synthesized and their pyro&#8208;phototronic response recorded from visible to near IR spectral region.








Abstract
Cesium lead halide has been extensively studied as efficient materials for optoelectronic device applications. Beyond Cs(I), the exploration of other inorganic A&#8208;site monovalent cations remains limited, though Rb(I) stands out as a potential alternative whose role in colloidal nanocrystals is largely unexplored. Here, Rb (I) is employed as an effective A&#8208;site cation in forming monoclinic&#8208;phase RbPb2Cl5, where Pb (II) heptahedrally coordinated. A template&#8208;mediated cation exchange strategy is employed where 0D Rb4CdCl6 used as host nanocrystals. Upon introduction of Pb (II), fast Cd to Pb ion exchange triggers and 2D RbPb2Cl5 in rhombic prism, hexagonal prism or hexagonal platelet&#8208;shaped nanocrystals are formed depending on the reaction conditions. Further to explore the optoelectronic properties, photo response measurements are carried out which exhibit significant pyro&#8208;photocurrent response from these nanocrystals even under ultra&#8208;low&#8208;intensity light illumination (7 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2) across ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral range. Despite its centrosymmetric structure, RbPb2Cl5 generates pyro&#8208;photocurrent due to surface halide deficiencies, supported by DFT which shows surface polarization of |&#120665;P| = 0.173 C&#160;m&#8722;2. These findings highlight the pivotal role of Rb (I) in stabilizing these nanostructures and open a new avenue for their application in advanced optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Promoting Active Hydrogen Supply and Nitrate Adsorption by Disordering Tetrahedral&#8208;Octahedral Structure of CuAl2O4&#8208;&#948; for Efficient Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A disordered tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral structure of CuAl2O4&#8208;&#948; (CAO) by Co doping promotes water dissociation for hydrogen supply and formation of oxygen vacancy for hydrogen storage, enabling high&#8208;efficiency deoxygenation and hydrogeneration of nitrate reduction to ammonia.








Abstract
Modulating the local coordination environment can optimize the electronic structure and reaction pathway of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR), beneficial to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity. Herein, a disordered tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral structure of CuAl2O4&#8208;&#948; (CAO) is proposed by Co doping as an efficient catalyst. Theoretical calculations reveal Co doping induces strong Co&#8208;Al orbital interactions at octahedral sites, which lowers the energy barrier for water dissociation, and meanwhile, Oxygen vacancies (Vos) induced by Co doping not only enhance NO3&#8722; adsorption, but also serve as reservoir sites for transient *H storage, thereby promoting hydrogenation steps. The synergistic Cu&#8208;Vo interaction facilitates the conversion of *NO3&#8211; to *NO2&#8211; and the interfacial electron transfer between Co and Cu suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The substitution of 30% Co in CAO (Co&#8208;3) nanofibers creates the most Vos, resulting in a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.00% and a substantial NH3 yield rate of 27.86 mg h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1cat. in neutral media. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional long&#8208;term electrochemical durability and chemical stability. Thermodynamic analysis unveils the potential&#8208;determining step of *NO2 to *NO for Co&#8208;3 possesses a low free energy of only 0.05 eV, highly superior to 0.29 eV for the pristine CAO.

     alt="Promoting Active Hydrogen Supply and Nitrate Adsorption by Disordering Tetrahedral-Octahedral Structure of CuAl2O4-&#948; for Efficient Nitrate Reduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A disordered tetrahedral-octahedral structure of CuAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4-&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; (CAO) by Co doping promotes water dissociation for hydrogen supply and formation of oxygen vacancy for hydrogen storage, enabling high-efficiency deoxygenation and hydrogeneration of nitrate reduction to ammonia.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modulating the local coordination environment can optimize the electronic structure and reaction pathway of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR), beneficial to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity. Herein, a disordered tetrahedral-octahedral structure of CuAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4-&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; (CAO) is proposed by Co doping as an efficient catalyst. Theoretical calculations reveal Co doping induces strong Co-Al orbital interactions at octahedral sites, which lowers the energy barrier for water dissociation, and meanwhile, Oxygen vacancies (Vos) induced by Co doping not only enhance NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption, but also serve as reservoir sites for transient &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;H storage, thereby promoting hydrogenation steps. The synergistic Cu-Vo interaction facilitates the conversion of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; to &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; and the interfacial electron transfer between Co and Cu suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The substitution of 30% Co in CAO (Co-3) nanofibers creates the most Vos, resulting in a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.00% and a substantial NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 27.86 mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt; in neutral media. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional long-term electrochemical durability and chemical stability. Thermodynamic analysis unveils the potential-determining step of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NO for Co-3 possesses a low free energy of only 0.05 eV, highly superior to 0.29 eV for the pristine CAO.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Actuated Hot&#8208;Carrier/Polarization Triggers Catalysis to Coordinate Staphylococcus aureus Ribosome Stalling and Treat Deep&#8208;Seated Infections</title>

         <dc:description>
Medical microwave actuation of Seebeck&#8208;type and pyroelectric&#8208;type tandem reactors generates hot&#8208;carrier and quick&#8208;change polarization, respectively, by triggering the temperature, while synergizing with microwave&#8208;induced bacterial ribosome stalling to efficiently eliminate deep&#8208;seated bacterial infections.








Abstract
Due to the low energy of microwaves (MW), MW dynamic therapy (MWDT) remains inefficient in treating deep&#8208;seated infections. Here, an MW&#8208;actuated hot&#8208;carrier/polarization&#8208;triggers catalysis strategy is proposed via two types of tandem reactors to amplify the efficacy of MWDT. By combining MW&#8208;thermosensitive carbon nanotube (CNT) with thermal&#8208;electricity conversion materials, the Seebeck&#8208;type and pyroelectric&#8208;type MW&#8208;thermal&#8208;electricity tandem reactors (CNT&#8208;Bi2Te3 and CNT&#8208;ZnO) are prepared. The CNT converts MW into a local heat source and rapidly heats Bi2Te3 or ZnO to activate hot&#8208;carrier or polarization for high&#8208;yield reactive oxygen species production to treat deep&#8208;seated infections. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal MW stalls the ribosomes of Staphylococcus aureus, thereby hindering its proliferation. Therefore, the biocompatible tandem reactor synergizes with bacterial ribosome stalling to demonstrate a targeted bactericidal effect in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, a series of antimicrobial products is developed for precise and efficient antimicrobial therapies.

         <title>LDI, A Lipid Droplet Inhibitor, Disrupts Lipid Accumulation and Modulates Hepatic Lipid Profiles in Fatty Liver</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid droplet inhibitor (LDI), templated with large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica and functionalized with PKC&#945; C1A and lipase, targets lipid degradation in fatty liver. The LDI maintains stable association with lipid droplets, thereby suppressing their formation and expansion. It significantly alleviates liver abnormalities in vivo and effectively regulates hepatic lipid metabolism.









Abstract
Excessive lipid droplet accumulation in hepatocytes drives the progression of metabolic dysfunction&#8208;associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), often leading to inflammation and fibrosis. As obesity and metabolic syndrome rise, MASLD has become a global concern, spurring research into effective treatments. Here, the design of a Lipid droplet inhibitor (LDI) is presented, incorporating porous silica nanostructures along with PKC&#945; C1A and Candida Rugosa lipase, aimed at directly degrading lipid droplets. Through its dual&#8208;functional design, this nanostructure captures diacylglycerol using PKC&#945; C1A while hydrolyzing triacylglycerol into smaller molecular fragments via the lipase. Notably, the amphiphilic biomolecules in LDI facilitate the formation of a Pickering emulsion, ensuring stable localization at the lipid&#8208;water interface for efficient interaction with lipid droplets. LDI reduces lipid droplet formation and triglyceride levels in palmitic acid&#8208;treated HepG2 cells. In a high&#8208;fat diet&#8208;induced MASLD model, it alleviateds liver pathology and, lowered injury scores by up to 84%. Furthermore, lipidomic analysis confirmed that LDI effectively modulated the hepatic lipid profile, suggesting its potential as a nanoplatform for counteracting lipid droplet accumulation.

         <title>Implanting Metal&#8208;Oxo Single Sites on Metal Surface: A Path to Geometric and Electronic Synergy in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedding isolated metal&#8211;oxo sites onto a metallic surface enables synergistic covalent hybridization and geometric regulation, thereby optimizing the adsorption strength of ORR intermediates.








Abstract
Promising and diverse strategies have emerged for creating isolated catalytic active sites, such as single&#8208;atom catalysts and single&#8208;atom alloys, aiming at achieving efficient and selective catalysis. However, the structural tunability of isolated active sites has largely been restricted to their chemical compositions, primarily due to the absence of a higher&#8208;order structure associated with these isolated atoms. To address this, an additional degree of freedom is introduced by incorporating functional groups onto these active sites. Specifically, metal&#8208;oxo single sites are implanted onto metal surfaces to achieve geometric and electronic synergy. As a demonstration of this concept, bismuth single sites are embedded onto a palladium surface, promoting p&#8208;d orbital hybridization and facilitating the formation of terminal Bi&#8208;oxo species. This cooperative interaction optimizes the adsorption strength of intermediates through both covalent electronic hybridization and geometric interactions. The Bi&#8208;oxo&#8208;embedded Pd hybrid nanostructure, created through consecutive etching and displacement deposition, enables the simultaneous optimization of key intermediates for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction. Remarkably, this hybrid nanostructure achieves specific and mass activities 11.03 and 8.45 times greater than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates high stability and achieves a power density of 280 mW cm&#8722;2 in direct methanol fuel cells.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;in&#8208;Liquid Prints: High&#8208;Density Biochemically Encoded Information Preserved in Microdroplet Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel approach for encoding and storing information in the liquid state in microdroplet arrays. These liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid prints are generated by a droplet printing system capable of dynamically setting the composition of each droplet pixel. Information in the form of color images, QR codes, text characters, words and basic programmes are biochemically written into micro&#8208;liquid patterns.








Abstract
Liquids are dense repositories of information, challenged only by how well their compositions are defined, preserved, accessed, or measured. The precise spatial patterning of solutes within a bulk liquid is challenging since diffusion disperses local concentrations and thereby attenuates functionality. Herein, a new concept is introduced for writing and preserving information in the liquid state through liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid microdroplet array printing. This technology produces fine resolution, 2D liquid structures, composite of indexed water&#8208;in&#8208;oil droplet pixels each with a precise composition, a high spatial resolution and a tight inter&#8208;pixel pitch. With extreme control over droplet composition and by applying standard and custom encoding schemes, various forms of information are written biochemically such as images, QR codes, text characters and words. As a composite material, reversible phase transitions between dissolved liquid and crystallized solid states control information encryption and decryption. Compared to current liquid printing and chemical encoding paradigms, ours introduces a fundamentally new precedent for deterministically programming information release, exchange or decay without stimuli or physical processing. Further computational principles such as error correction and information storage are demonstrated. These micro&#8208;liquid patterns are relevant to any application based on precise liquid handling such as information theory, materials design and biological assays.

         <title>Regulating H&#8208;/J&#8208;Aggregation and Suppressing Exciton&#8208;Vibration Coupling of Fused Ring Electron Acceptors Enable 20.51% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>

An analogue of L8&#8208;BO, L8&#8208;OPh, is developed to efficiently regulate molecular H&#8208;/J&#8208;aggregation, suppress exciton&#8208;vibration coupling, and enforce intermolecular interaction, prolonging exciton lifetime and exciton diffusion length of the L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend. Therefore, D18:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieve the remarkable power conversion efficiency of 20.51% (certified as 20.43%), among the highest values for OSCs so far.








Abstract
The limited exciton diffusion length (LD) of organic photovoltaic materials puts organic solar cells (OSCs) into a harsh position to compromise exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport, impeding the further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The exciton behavior of organic semiconductors is strongly related to the molecular alignment. Herein, an analogue of L8&#8208;BO, L8&#8208;OPh with benzyl&#8208;alkyl inner side chains is developed to blend with L8&#8208;BO and successfully regulate its molecular alignment. Incorporating L8&#8208;OPh into L8&#8208;BO enhances the H&#8208;aggregation tendency, weakens exciton&#8208;vibration coupling, and enforces the intermolecular interaction of L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend films. Such endows the L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend film with improved exciton lifetime and larger exciton diffusion coefficient to prolong the LD up to 22.1&#160;nm, compared to L8&#8208;BO (16.5&#160;nm). Besides, L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend films acquire increased crystallinity and better crystal quality to afford lower trap density, prolonged charge carrier lifetime and higher mobilities in D18:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh ternary devices. Therefore, D18:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh ternary OSCs achieve the remarkable PCE of 20.51% (certified as 20.43%), which is among the highest PCEs in OSCs so far. It highlights the importance of finely regulating molecular alignment of organic photovoltaic materials to prolong the LD and boost PCEs of OSCs.

         <title>Trace Chlorine&#8208;Induced Lattice Oxygen Activation for Enhanced High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Electrolysis</title>

Trace Cl&#8722; incorporation into Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6&#8722;&#948; weakens metal&#8211;oxygen covalency to activate lattice oxygen, enhances CO2 adsorption, promotes bulk O2&#8722; transport, and accelerates CO2 reduction kinetics, collectively enabling a current density of 2.02 A cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C and 1.5 V with &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency and outstanding 500 h stability for high&#8208;temperature CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolysis.








Abstract
Tuning lattice oxygen activity in perovskite oxides (ABO3) offers a promising approach to overcome the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and stability in redox reactions. However, precise modulation and mechanistic understanding of lattice oxygen activation remain elusive under high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis conditions. Herein, a novel anion activation strategy is proposed by incorporating trace chloride ions (Cl&#8722;) into the O&#8208;sites of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6&#8722;&#948; perovskite forming an oxychloride cathode. This Cl&#8722; substitution activates lattice oxygen reactivity by weakening Mo&#8722;O/Fe&#8722;O covalency, thereby facilitating the formation and redistribution of oxygen vacancies, accelerating bulk oxygen ion transport, enhancing CO2 adsorption and carbonate intermediate formation, and ultimately promoting CO2 reduction kinetics. As a result, the oxychloride cathode achieves a 60.2&#8211;80.8% enhancement in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolysis, reaching 2.02 A cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C and 1.5&#160;V with &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency, while maintaining exceptional stability of 500 h. This work establishes a new paradigm of O&#8208;site anion engineering to unlock lattice oxygen activity for electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Creep Adhesive Tapes via Trapped&#8208;Entanglement&#8208;Regulated Topological Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under continuous external force, creep deformation occurs on the adhesive joint insidiously, which will gradually result in failure. Authors introduce topological trapped entanglements to build a permanent yet compliant polymer network, effectively improving the long&#8208;term adhesion performance of adhesive tapes under static load condition.








Abstract
Adhesive tapes with high adhesion strength are critical in applications from structural bonding, biomedical devices, to flexible electronics. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by creep&#8212;time&#8208;dependent deformation under sustained stress&#8212;which leads to irreversible failure in long&#8208;term applications. While transient non&#8208;covalent interactions are widely engineered to enhance short&#8208;term energy dissipation, they inherently compromise creep resistance due to their dynamic reversibility. Herein, this persistent challenge is addressed by designing anti&#8208;creep adhesive tapes through precise topological regulation of polymer networks. By systematically comparing linear, covalent&#8208;crosslink, and trapped&#8208;entanglement&#8208;dominated architectures, the entanglement&#8208;stabilized networks are demonstrated to achieve a three&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in creep rate while maintaining strong interfacial adhesion. The unique combination of long&#8208;chain entanglements and spare crosslinks enables efficient elastic energy storage without sacrificing tackiness, resolving the trade&#8208;off between dynamic dissipation and permanent mechanical integrity. This work provides both a mechanistic framework for understanding creep in adhesive materials and a scalable strategy for developing durable, high&#8208;performance polymer adhesives.

         <title>Optically Driven Eutectogel Pyroelectric for Efficient Deformable Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an elastomeric, self&#8208;powered photodetector based on a polyvinyl alcohol pyroelectric eutectogel, which achieves an ultrabroad spectral response, high responsivity and detectivity, as well as a fast response time. Its versatile applicability is demonstrated in encrypted optical communication, conformal image sensing, and diffuse reflection imaging.








Abstract
Ionic gels are emerging stimuli&#8208;response elastomers for biomimetic sensors in diverse fields. Photoresponse ionic gels can detect light as a photoreceptor to emulate biological vision for artificial retina and skin. However, the existing ionic gel&#8208;based photosensors face limited response speeds and detecting sensitivity due to inefficient ion transport. Here, a high&#8208;performance elastomeric photodetector made of polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;based pyroelectric eutectogels, containing polar ions and crystalline domains, is reported, which exhibits a high pyroelectric coefficient and enables efficient optical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion via spontaneous polarization, even under 30% tensile strain. The resulting self&#8208;powered photodetector features a broad spectral response spanning 365&#8211;1300&#160;nm, with photoresponsivity, detectivity, and response time of 42.06&#160;mA W&#8722;1, 7.65 &#215; 1010 Jones and 24/35&#160;ms at 455&#160;nm, respectively. The photodetector array enables light&#8208;encrypted communication and sensitive optical imaging.

         <title>Nanopore&#8208;Based Label&#8208;Free and Single&#8208;Molecule Sequencing toward Precision Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting with an overview of the concepts, classifications, principles, and fabrication methods for nanopores, this review presents a comprehensive picture of the broad application scenarios for nanopore&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule sequencing (SMS), particularly for precision diagnosis. Additionally, it encourages researchers and readers to explore potential directions for enhancing nanopore&#8208;based SMS beyond typical applications by focusing on the intrinsic properties of nanopores.








Abstract
Nanopore&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule sequencing (SMS) is a powerful tool for acquiring detailed heterogeneous information on critical building blocks of life, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and a wide array of biomolecules, at the single&#8208;molecule level. Real&#8208;time current&#8208;intensity fluctuations corresponding to the passage of target molecules through nanopores enable long&#8208;read length, high&#8208;throughput, and high&#8208;accuracy detection, thus meeting the stringent demands of precision diagnosis. Herein, a concise overview of various principles and fabrication methods is provided for nanopores, with particular emphasis on recent advancements in nanopore&#8208;based DNA and protein sequencing, revealing innovative approaches for effectively capturing and translocating target molecules, and rapid and accurate identification. Further typical cases of nanopore&#8208;based SMS applications in precision diagnosis are analyzed, focusing on genetic disorders, infectious diseases, cancers, and abnormal post&#8208;translational modifications to highlight the clinical potential of nanopores. Additionally, the inherent limitations and challenges of nanopores in terms of sensitivity, detection range, and selectivity are discussed and present the latest strategies for enhancing nanopore performance. Finally, perspectives are provided on the future of nanopore&#8208;based SMS, particularly at the intersection of microfluidic devices, surface functionalization, and machine learning, to facilitate more diverse and advanced developments in this field.

         <title>Engineering of Stabilized Ru&#8208;Based Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing the stabilized Ru&#8208;based proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a significant step for the low&#8208;cost production of green hydrogen. The stability degradation mechanism of the whole system, and the mutual effects of core components are systematically sorted out, with an emphasis on synergistic optimization strategies. Aiming to provide a guidance for the design of high&#8208;stable and low&#8208;cost Ru&#8208;based PEMWE system.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a promising blueprint for the industrial production of green hydrogen in the short term, but its large&#8208;scale deployment is extremely constrained by the high cost and low storage of Ir&#8208;dependent anode catalysts. Ru&#8208;based PEMWE, employing Ru&#8208;based composites as anode catalysts, has emerged as a promising alternative to Ir&#8208;dependent PEMWE in recent years, offering lower electrolytic voltages and improved cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the practical application of Ru&#8208;based PEMWE is hindered by stability degradation involving Ru&#8208;based catalyst dissolution, membrane chemical degradation, corrosion of porous transport layer and bipolar plate, and the interactions between them. In this review, the stability degradation mechanisms from Ru&#8208;based catalyst to other core components to the cell system alongside the mutual effects of core components are systematically sorted out. The stability synergistic optimization strategies are subsequently discussed, ranging from individual components to system&#8208;level comprehensive consideration, for the engineering of a stable Ru&#8208;based PEMWE system. Finally, the outlook is provided based on the promising development direction and key scientific challenge for Ru&#8208;based PEMWE system, aiming to provide theoretical guidance and technical reference for the design of highly stable and low&#8208;cost Ru&#8208;based PEMWE system by integrating industry&#8208;aligned standards and emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in system engineering.

         <title>Graphene Liquid Cells for In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy: Unveiling Nanomaterial Growth and Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how graphene liquid cells (GLCs) enable in situ transmission electron microscopy of nanomaterial growth and etching. It presents strategies for preparing suspended graphene, diverse routes for fabricating GLCs, and representative applications in monitoring dynamic nanoscale transformations. The discussion provides insights into opportunities and challenges of advancing GLC&#8208;based liquid&#8208;phase studies.








Abstract
The liquid&#8208;phase growth and etching process of nanomaterials profoundly affects their size, morphology, and composition, thereby determining their properties. Achieving real&#8208;time atomic&#8208;resolution visualization of these processes has driven the development of in situ liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy imaging. Especially, graphene liquid cells (GLCs) have emerged as a powerful platform due to their high resolution, facile fabrication, and compatibility with conventional transmission electron microscopy holders. This review first summarizes the preparation of suspended graphene, the key window material for GLCs, and the fabrication of GLCs with diverse configurations. It then systematically outlines the applications of GLCs in revealing the growth and etching processes of nanomaterials, and finally concludes with perspectives on the opportunities and challenges associated with GLC&#8208;based research. This review aims to provide a panoramic understanding and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>The Space Within: How Architected Voids Promote Tissue Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the role of void spaces in tissue engineering scaffolds and examines four key methods for introducing porosity into hydrogels at different scales. It discusses sacrificial templating, microgels, phase separation, and 3D printing, highlighting principles, advantages, and limitations. It also addresses emerging strategies integrating these techniques to better mimic physiological microenvironments in hierarchical structures and enhance scaffold functionality.








Abstract
Physiological void spaces exist at every scale of the human body, from organs to molecules, facilitating transport, signal propagation, and localized biochemical activity. Constriction of these spaces (e.g., arterial occlusion, fibrosis) highlights their importance, making their mimicry essential in tissue engineering (TE). This review examines four key strategies for introducing porosity into hydrogels across multiple length scales: templating, microgels, phase separation, and 3D printing. The first three methods enable the engineering of physiological environments at the nano&#8208; to micro&#8208;scale, mimicking tissue&#8208; and extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;level spaces. Templating involves embedding and removal of gas, liquid, or solid phases, leaving behind pores. Microgel annealing generates inherent interstitial voids. Liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) creates biphasic networks reminiscent of native ECM. The fourth approach, extrusion&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D printing techniques, enables the fabrication of larger&#8208;scale spaces, such as luminal structures (e.g., vasculature, airways, and ducts). Combining these methods enables the creation of hierarchical architectures from the nano&#8208; to centimeter scale. The review also highlights Filamented Light (FLight) technology, which creates internal microstructural voids relevant to anisotropic tissues. This review offers insights into current methods and their convergence for generating biomimetic void spaces to meet the physiological demands of cells, tissues, and organs.

Polyether solid electrolytes possess strong lithium&#8208;salt solvation ability and flexible interfacial contact, yet suffer from sluggish ion transport and poor interfacial stability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cells. This review integrates multicomponent and structural tuning strategies, illustrates structure&#8211;property insights via multiscale characterizations, benchmarks pouch&#8208;cell performance, and outlines the scalability and consistency challenges facing commercialization.








Abstract
Polyether&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes have shown great potential in lithium batteries due to their excellent interfacial flexibility and high solvation ability for lithium salts. However, the problems of limited ion transport and insufficient interfacial stability have restricted the application of polyether&#8208;based electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#160;batteries. To tackle these problems, researchers have explored a variety of strategies, such as multi&#8208;component compounding and structural regulation, and developed a vast array of solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Therefore, this review first summarizes the key modification strategies and representative examples of electrolytes from a systematic design perspective, aiming at the two aforementioned major issues. Meanwhile, to precisely implement the above strategies and to design more effective modification strategies, latent yet valuable structure&#8211;property relationships should be further uncovered. Thus, multiscale characterizations are rationally integrated through representative case studies. Finally, it summarizes the reported performance of representative polyether&#8208;based solid&#8208;state pouch cells, emphasizes scale&#8208;up and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency, and outlines future research directions for translating these electrolytes into high&#8208;energy, market&#8208;ready batteries.

         <title>Breaking Dilution Limits: Electrocatalytic Ammonia Production from Low&#8208;Concentration Nitrate Streams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the electrocatalytic reduction of low&#8208;concentration nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3). It covers reaction mechanisms, efficiency factors, and key challenges at low&#8208;concentration conditions. Performance improvement strategies are analyzed, alongside feasibility assessment for large&#8208;scale application through application scenarios, techno&#8208;economic, and life&#8208;cycle. Future research directions are outlined to inspire future work.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) in water to high&#8208;value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) using an electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (eNO3&#8722;RR) provides a viable technological pathway to address the imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle. Unfortunately, most of the existing studies have focused on the ideal conditions of high&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722;, but most of the polluted waters around the world are usually at low&#8208;concentration levels. Consequently, researching eNO3&#8722;RR under low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; is more practical. Although the study of low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; has gradually gained attention in recent years, a systematic review of the literature in this area has not yet been reported. To fill this research gap, this paper reviews recent advances in the electrocatalytic reduction of low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; to NH3. Initially, the nature of NO3&#8722; as a reactant, the reaction mechanism of eNO3&#8722;RR, and the factors affecting the efficiency are introduced. Subsequently, the key challenges of electrocatalytic reduction of low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; are analyzed, and various strategies to improve the performance of eNO3&#8722;RR are summarized on this basis. Additionally, the feasibility of large&#8208;scale ammonia recovery using eNO3&#8722;RR under low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; is assessed through application scenario exploration, economic analyses, and life cycle assessment. Ultimately, future research directions are outlined to inspire future work.

         <title>Characterization of Complex Stacking of Semiconductors Through Near Field Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
SNOM imaging and spectroscopy on a mechanically cleaved facet is used to characterize the different layers of complex epitaxial heterostructures composed of a type II superlattice and highly doped semiconductors. Both the geometrical parameters of the stack and the optical properties of the individual layers and of the interfaces are retrieved, as well as the doping level of the heavily doped semiconductors.








Abstract
While high operating temperature infrared photodetection remains a major technological objective, huge improvements have been obtained through the use of increasingly complex semiconductors epitaxies such as quantum cascade structures or III&#8211;V superlattice junction. However, the characterization of these layers is challenging and often requires the use of destructive processes. Here, SNOM imaging and spectroscopy on a mechanically cleaved facet is used to characterize the different layers of a complex epitaxial heterostructure composed of a type II superlattice and highly doped semiconductors. These near&#8208;field experimental data are compared to simulation in order to retrieve both the cut&#8208;off frequency of the superlattice and the doping level of each highly doped semiconductor layers. Additionally, information about interfaces is optically retrieved through hyperspectral characterization of plasmons propagating at these vertical interfaces. In parallel, all the materials and exact stacking of the epitaxy are confirmed through scanning transmission electron&#160;microscopy.

         <title>Giga&#8208;Voxel Multiscale Composite Architecture Mirrored Through a Data&#8208;to&#8208;Model Closed&#8208;Loop Digital Twin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a systematic digital twin workflow tailored for generating high&#8208;fidelity virtual representations of anisotropic composite microstructures and giga&#8208;voxel meso&#8208;structural models is presented, leveraging a harmonious integration of top&#8211;down image&#8208;based modeling and bottom&#8211;up data&#8208;driven voxel generation.








Abstract
Giga&#8208;voxel digital models offer abundant geometric detail; however, no mainstream method currently exists to efficiently distribute individual voxels across massive image volumes, and designing complex anisotropic composite materials remains infeasible due to the absence of promising methods. Herein, we propose a systematic digital twin workflow tailored for generating high&#8208;fidelity virtual representations of anisotropic composite microstructures and giga&#8208;voxel meso&#8208;structural models, leveraging a harmonious integration of top&#8208;down image&#8208;based modeling and bottom&#8208;up data&#8208;driven generation. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of micro&#8208;digital representations as foundational building blocks within a continuum of digital assembly processes tailored for mesostructural models. Utilizing 3D image data, specifically X&#8208;ray tomography, our data&#8208;driven modeling meticulously characterizes the geometric attributes of the experimentally observed objects, thereby facilitating the creation of digital unit twins, each endowed with distinct identities assigned through a random seed generation. The closed&#8208;loop system provides feedback mechanism between data and model to ensure the 3D quality of the generated models. For hierarchical organization at the giga&#8208;voxel level, the digital unit twins are methodically expanded into cohesive 3D architectures based on assembly relationship at length scales of more than four orders of magnitude. Remarkably, this hierarchical model provides intricate insight into micro&#8208;to&#8208;macro geometrics while preserving the intrinsic microstructure.

         <title>Unveiling of Unpaired Surface Spins Regulated Magnetism in 2D &#945;&#8208;Te Nanosheets: an Implication on Magnetoelectric Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;2D tellurium nanosheets unveil a novel form of magnetism regulated by their unpaired surface spins. This emergent property, coupled with ferroelectricity, generates a giant magnetoelectric response. When utilized as a catalyst, this effect significantly accelerates the hydrogen evolution reaction, drastically reducing the required overpotential and demonstrating impressive electrochemical stability for next&#8208;generation energy technologies.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D tellurium (Te) unlocks surface spins (of valence 5p4 electrons) of tunable ferromagnetic order and response to strain&#8208;engineered electronic properties of widespread applications. In spin&#8211;orbit coupling, the inversion symmetry is broken in a 1S0 &#8594; 3S1 spin&#8208;transition of the ground electronic state, a synergetic pathway to charge spin&#8208;order under applied driving forces.

&lt;p&gt;Quasi-2D tellurium nanosheets unveil a novel form of magnetism regulated by their unpaired surface spins. This emergent property, coupled with ferroelectricity, generates a giant magnetoelectric response. When utilized as a catalyst, this effect significantly accelerates the hydrogen evolution reaction, drastically reducing the required overpotential and demonstrating impressive electrochemical stability for next-generation energy technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-2D tellurium (Te) unlocks surface spins (of valence 5p4 electrons) of tunable ferromagnetic order and response to strain-engineered electronic properties of widespread applications. In spin&#8211;orbit coupling, the inversion symmetry is broken in a &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &#8594; &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; spin-transition of the ground electronic state, a synergetic pathway to charge spin-order under applied driving forces. The surface magnetism, combined with the ferroelectricity, gives a giant magnetoelectric response (absent in &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; bulk Te state) that is explored to boost the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution reaction (HER) with 2D &#945;-Te as a synergetic catalyst. High-quality 2D &#945;-Te synthesized as nanosheets is ordered primarily along (001) facets at duly enhanced d&lt;sub&gt;001&lt;/sub&gt; atomic spacing in the 5s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-Te lone pair electrons (diamagnetic) are spaced (Coulomb repulsion) via the 5p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; unpaired spins.

         <title>MXene Membrane as Multifunctional Interface for Vapor Splitting via Photothermal&#8208;Catalytic Membrane Distillation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional MXene&#8208;based membrane integrates photothermal evaporation and photocatalytic vapor splitting in a sweeping&#8208;gas membrane distillation (PTC&#8208;SGMD) platform, simultaneously generating freshwater and hydrogen. The SrTiO3/MX@PVDF interface leverages broad&#8208;spectrum solar absorption, efficient heat/mass transfer, and gas&#8211;solid catalysis to achieve high flux, robust H2 production, and long&#8208;term stability, highlighting a sustainable water&#8211;energy solution.








Abstract
Advancements in solar&#8208;driven processes are fundamentally transforming the production of freshwater and energy into a more sustainable manner. Realizing such potential requires developing highly efficient solar responsive materials and advanced solar systems. Here, an MXene&#8208;based membrane is reported as a multifunctional interface capable of simultaneously producing freshwater and hydrogen through a strategically designed photothermal&#8208;catalytic sweeping gas membrane distillation (PTC&#8208;SGMD) system. By leveraging membrane interface engineering, the innovative design integrates solar evaporation, vapor transportation, and vapor splitting within a single membrane. Unlike conventional liquid&#8211;solid systems, this liquid&#8211;solid&#8211;gas configuration overcomes photocatalyst leaching, interfacial heat loss, and inefficient mass transfer. The multifunctional membrane exhibits enhanced solar absorption and optimal permeability, enabling the MXene&#8208;photocatalyst composite to achieve efficient photocatalytic vapor splitting. Remarkably, the optimized SrTiO3/MX@PVDF membrane achieves a simultaneous water flux of 2.37&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2h&#8722;1 and hydrogen production of 947.8&#160;&#181;mol m&#8722;2h&#8722;1 under 1 sun irradiation. The PTC&#8208;SGMD system demonstrates total solar efficiency of 92.305% with outstanding stability over 72 h of continuous operation. This innovative approach offers a scalable solution to global water scarcity and energy challenges.

         <title>Silver Ions as Ambipolar Dopants in InAs Nanocrystal Solids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8314; ions post&#8208;introduced into InAs nanocrystal films act as ambipolar dopants whose effect depends on host polarity and dopant concentration. In n&#8208;type InAs nanocrystal films, Ag&#8314; occupies interstitial sites to yield n&#8208;type doping effect, whereas in Zn&#8208;doped p&#8208;type InAs nanocrystal films, it first forms p&#8208;type surface doping effect and later induces n&#8208;type doping effect, enabling polarity&#8208;tunable III&#8211;V nanocrystal devices.








Abstract
The precise control of semiconductor polarity in nanocrystals (NCs) is crucial for optimizing device performance in various optoelectronic applications. In this study, it is shown that Ag&#8314;, added post&#8208;synthetically to InAs NCs using an AgNO3 solution, can induce either n&#8208;type or p&#8208;type doping of the solid, depending on the intrinsic polarity of the host and the dopant concentration. In n&#8208;type InAs NCs, Ag&#8314; consistently acts as an interstitial n&#8208;type dopant, shifting the conduction band minimum closer to the Fermi level. Conversely, in p&#8208;type InAs NCs (innately doped with Zn during synthesis), Ag&#8314; initially exhibits a p&#8208;type doping effect at low concentrations by forming surface dipoles but transitions to an n&#8208;type doping effect at higher concentrations through interstitial incorporation. These results offer a unified understanding of the intricate and adjustable doping behavior of Ag&#8314; in colloidal NC systems and present new opportunities for post&#8208;synthetic polarity engineering in III&#8211;V nanomaterials.

         <title>Autonomous Spatiotemporal Regulation of Reversible Hydrogel Actuators by Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators with reversible response to thiols are developed using reversible binding of thiols to Michael acceptors. Autonomous spatiotemporal regulation of reversible movement of these hydrogels is achieved using thiol&#8208;based chemical reaction networks containing both positive and negative feedback.








Abstract
Achieving autonomous spatiotemporal regulation of reversible hydrogel movement remains challenging, as existing approaches typically rely on external regulation or irreversible actuation mechanisms. This work presents the autonomous spatiotemporal regulation of reversible hydrogel actuators using thiol&#8208;based chemical reaction networks (CRNs). The core innovation is a bilayer actuator whose active layer is functionalized with phenylcyanoacrylate Michael acceptors. In their initial state, these groups are hydrophobic, keeping the active layer moderately collapsed. Binding to thiols, such as cysteamine or thiocholine, converts the acceptors into more hydrophilic adducts. This change drives water uptake, causing the active layer to swell and the entire structure to bend. The screening revealed that a methoxy&#8208;substituted acceptor provides the optimal balance of binding strength and reversibility for robust actuation. Autonomous control of reversible actuation is achieved by an autocatalytic, thiol&#8208;producing CRN coupled with negative feedback in the form of slow oxidation of thiols or their irreversible addition to acrylamides. In the hydrogel, this CRN generates a wave of thiols, which causes forward and reverse actuation. This principle is demonstrated with linear, flower&#8208;shaped, and hand&#8208;like actuators. This integrated system, which unites reversible chemistry with spatiotemporal control, takes a significant step toward emulating the autonomy of motion found in living systems.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Fluorinated Gases by Porous Organic Cages &#8211; Effects of Fluorinated Side&#8208;Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study of a series of porous organic cages with perfluorinated alkyl side&#8208;chains of different lengths is presented. The structure&#8208;property relationship of the various cages on gas sorption of highly potent greenhouse gases, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) is investigated. Very high selectivities have been obtained especially for PFC&#8208;218 and PFC&#8208;318.








Abstract
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) as well as related gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) or nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) are examples of F&#8208;gases, a subclass of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). F&#8208;gases are anthropogenic greenhouse gases with the highest global warming potentials known and thus contribute significantly to global warming. To reduce their amount in the atmosphere, selectively adsorbing materials would be beneficial, but such materials are rare. A homologous series of porous organic cages with fluorinated side&#8208;chains is synthesized and depending on the targeted gas as well as operating temperature, different cages have high selectivities for certain F&#8208;gases against N2, CO2, and O2. Within this series, new benchmark selectivities against, e.g., perfluoro propane (PFC&#8208;218) and perfluoro cyclobutane (PFC&#8208;318) have been achieved based on attractive fluorine&#8208;fluorine interactions. Furthermore, these interactions are exploited for the first time in the adsorption of sulfur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride.

     alt="Highly Selective Adsorption of Fluorinated Gases by Porous Organic Cages &#8211; Effects of Fluorinated Side-Chains"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A systematic study of a series of porous organic cages with perfluorinated alkyl side-chains of different lengths is presented. The structure-property relationship of the various cages on gas sorption of highly potent greenhouse gases, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is investigated. Very high selectivities have been obtained especially for PFC-218 and PFC-318.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) as well as related gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) or nitrogen trifluoride (NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are examples of F-gases, a subclass of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). F-gases are anthropogenic greenhouse gases with the highest global warming potentials known and thus contribute significantly to global warming. To reduce their amount in the atmosphere, selectively adsorbing materials would be beneficial, but such materials are rare. A homologous series of porous organic cages with fluorinated side-chains is synthesized and depending on the targeted gas as well as operating temperature, different cages have high selectivities for certain F-gases against N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Within this series, new benchmark selectivities against, e.g., perfluoro propane (PFC-218) and perfluoro cyclobutane (PFC-318) have been achieved based on attractive fluorine-fluorine interactions. Furthermore, these interactions are exploited for the first time in the adsorption of sulfur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Formation of LiF&#8208;Rich SEI in Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes Enables Long&#8208;Life Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QSPE) incorporating PVTC enables in situ formation of a LiF&#8208;rich solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) that stabilizes WO3/NiO electrochromic devices. Using a salt&#8208;pressed configuration, the first direct FIB&#8211;TEM observation of the SEI at the WO3/solid&#8208;electrolyte interface is achieved. This QSPE delivers large optical modulation (&gt;45%), rapid response, and exceptional durability over 40 000 cycles.








Abstract
Electrochromic devices (ECDs) offer significant energy&#8208;saving potential for applications such as smart windows and displays by modulating optical properties in response to electrical stimuli. However, their widespread adoption is limited by challenges associated with electrolyte stability and the formation of a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). In this study, a novel quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QSPE) based on a UV&#8208;curable matrix of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) incorporated with poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE), abbreviated as PVTC] is presented. The high dielectric constant of PVTC facilitates lithium&#8208;ion transport, while electrochemical cycling triggers partial dehydrofluorination, thereby promoting in situ formation of a LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer on WO3 surface. The optimized electrolyte exhibits excellent properties, including high optical transparency (88.7%), ionic conductivity (1.76 mS cm&#8722;1), and mechanical robustness. When applied in ECDs, PVTC enables outstanding performance, achieving 86.29% optical retention from the 5000th to the 40 000th cycle and 98.78% charge retention after 50 000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. Furthermore, prototype demonstrations in smart windows and electrochromic sunglasses validate the scalability and flexibility of the proposed system, highlighting a promising strategy for advancing durable, high&#8208;performance ECDs through innovative electrolyte design.

         <title>Melt Densification Enables Fracture&#8208;Resistant Blend Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melt densification of miscible polymers enables the formation of highly entangled blend hydrogels with exceptional fracture resistance. The resulting networks combine high stiffness and fatigue thresholds with optical transparency, oxygen permeability, and antifouling performance. This generalizable approach provides a straightforward strategy to design robust functional hydrogels for biomedical and electronic applications.








ABSTRACT
Hydrogels and elastomers are integral components in biomedical and electronics devices, but their toughness and crack resistance are often unsatisfactory for load&#8208;bearing applications. Synthetic polymer networks predominantly rely on solution fabrication, which compromises the ultimate mechanical properties. This work presents a universal melt crosslinking strategy, which densifies entanglements well beyond solvated conditions. When deformed, mutually entangled dissimilar chains stiffen the gels, while sparse crosslinks amplify fracture resistance. At water contents up to 83%, the resultant hydrogels demonstrate over 2 orders increase in mechanical properties, including moduli (1.3&#8211;35 MPa), toughness (0.7&#8211;24.5 kJ/m2), and fatigue thresholds (1.2&#8211;3.3 kJ/m2), tunable in a wide range beyond existing hydrogels. Furthermore, the hydrogels show high optical clarity (&gt;96%), oxygen permeability (Dk/t &gt; 40), and anti&#8208;fouling properties (&lt;0.6&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2). This generalizable strategy could guide the design of tough functional soft materials in fields such as healthcare and smart electronics.

         <title>Polymer&#8211;Perovskite Microcrystal Heterojunction for Self&#8208;Powered Optical Sensing and Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable fabrication strategy is demonstrated for self&#8208;powered polymer&#8208;perovskite microcrystal heterojunction (PPMC HJ) photodetectors with clean interfaces and excellent performance: ultralow dark current, high dark&#8208;to&#8208;light ratio, fast response, and long&#8208;term stability. Design optimization boosted yield to 38%. KPFM revealed the Br&#8722; vacancy effects. Integration into an LISF converter validated its potential for next&#8208;gen optoelectronic and optical communication applications.








Abstract
The quasiepitaxial polymer&#8208;perovskite interface is a critical enabler for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, offering opulent features of efficient exciton dissociation and carrier transport. However, interfacial complexities, including energy barriers, poor interface, and defect states, pose significant challenges to scalability and performance. This study maps the nanoscale barrier landscape across the polymer&#8208;perovskite interface, revealing excellent photodetection performance and robust optical communication capacity. A tactical quasiepitaxial growth approach enables the fabrication of a high&#8208;yield inorganic&#8211;organic abrupt hybrid heterojunction (HHJ) photodetector by integrating CsPbBr3 monocrystal with a patterned poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (P3HT) film. This strategy boosts the fabrication yield from 5% to 38% and exhibits significant autonomous light&#8208;sensing performance, including an ultra&#8208;low dark current of below 10 fA at room temperature, a substantial dark&#8208;to&#8208;light conductivity ratio exceeding 106, a linear dynamic range (LDR) of &#8776;132.2&#160;dB, and an open&#8208;circuit photovoltage of &#8776;0.7&#160;V. The critical role of Br&#8722; vacancies in governing the photoelectrical behavior of the polymer&#8208;perovskite microcrystal heterojunction&#160;(PPMC HJ) device is revealed precisely at the nanoscale using various advanced KPFM techniques. Additionally, a light&#8208;to&#8208;frequency converter demonstrates its advanced sensing capabilities. These findings highlight the importance of precision&#8208;engineered polymer&#8208;perovskite microcrystal heterojunctions in overcoming current performance bottlenecks, paving the way for scalable, ultrafast photonic devices with superior performance and reliability.

         <title>Deterministic Switching of Antipolar Variants in Antiferroelectric Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;beam engineering of freestanding PbZrO3 membranes enables selective and reversible switching between in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane antiferroelectric domain variants. By tuning the built&#8208;in electric field through beam focusing, deterministic control of antipolar order is achieved. This programmable, non&#8208;contact approach offers a general strategy for reconfigurable domain engineering in perovskite antiferroelectrics and nanoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric (AFE) materials, characterized by their antiparallel dipole alignments, offer distinct ferroic functionalities desirable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage and next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices. However, the intrinsic degeneracy among antipolar domain variants poses a critical obstacle to their deterministic, nonvolatile control and practical integration into functional architectures. Here, selective and reversible manipulation of AFE domain configurations in freestanding PbZrO3 membranes via electron beam irradiation are demonstrated. By tailoring the electron beam&#8211;induced built&#8208;in electric field, controlled writing and erasure of both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane antipolar domain variants are enabled. Complementary phase&#8208;field simulations uncover the underlying energetic landscape and domain evolution under varying irradiation conditions, offering mechanistic insight into the observed transformations. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy for domain&#8208;level engineering of antiferroelectrics, establishing a generic and programmable approach to deterministically control antipolar ordering in perovskite systems&#8212;suggesting a pathway toward controlled, reversible switching of AFE domains in nanoscale oxide architectures.

By tailoring the electron beam&#8211;induced built-in electric field, controlled writing and erasure of both in-plane and out-of-plane antipolar domain variants are enabled. Complementary phase-field simulations uncover the underlying energetic landscape and domain evolution under varying irradiation conditions, offering mechanistic insight into the observed transformations. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy for domain-level engineering of antiferroelectrics, establishing a generic and programmable approach to deterministically control antipolar ordering in perovskite systems&#8212;suggesting a pathway toward controlled, reversible switching of AFE domains in nanoscale oxide architectures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial Microtubules from Microrobot Swarm Unraveling for Directed Cargo Transport under Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by molecular transport on microtubules, here it is shown that artificial microtubules can spontaneously form when propelling microrobot swarms encounter pointwise or edgewise confinements and work effectively for cargo transport in biological setting such as in blood, making it a particularly exciting delivery platform.








Abstract
Cargo transport on artificial microtubules (AMTs) has been extensively explored in various biomedical applications, including drug delivery and cancer therapy. However, the transport velocity and directional controllability are still poor compared to their natural counterparts, especially under confinement. Here, we show that confinement can induce the spontaneous formation of AMTs from structural transformations of microrobot swarms, and that these AMTs are particularly adept at directionally controlled cargo transport. It is shown that a magnetically driven microrobot cluster, when locally pinned, can be unraveled along the boundary into a strand that can function as a microtubule thanks to collective tangential flows. We demonstrate with both experiments and simulations that the local pinning required for AMT formation can come from a single pinned particle, or from corners and necks ubiquitous in microchannels and cavities. By modulating the driving magnetic field, the microtubule formation process can be precisely manipulated following periodic perturbations and re&#8208;establishments of local order, thereby simultaneously controlling the velocity and direction of cargo transport. The general applicability of this method has also been tested in biological environments including flowing blood, as well as in an in vitro delivery model under confinement.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled MUC1 Ablation via Steric Locking of Turn&#8208;On Reactors Enhances Pyroptosis&#8208;Immunotherapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly engineered theranostic reactor is developed, which could bind to MUC1 on glycoengineered triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells and enter a sterically locked state. It inactivates MUC1 under remotely&#8208;controlled light signals while enabling in&#8208;situ visualization of membrane MUC1, leading to a potent pyroptosis&#8208;associated immunostimulatory effect.








Abstract
Mucin 1 (MUC1) is aberrantly upregulated in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and presents major roles in orchestrating TNBC pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance. Herein, a bioorthogonal MUC1&#8208;binding strategy is reported to install MUC1&#8208;lockable aggregation&#8208;induced emission theranostic reactor (AIETR) onto MUC1 for pyroptosis&#8208;immunotherapy while enabling in situ MUC1 visualization. TNBC&#8208;bearing hosts are first treated with 1,3,4&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;N&#8208;azidoacetylmannosamine&#8208;containing bioresponsive nanoassemblies to generate azido groups on MUC1 via sialic acid metabolism pathway. Dibenzocyclooctyne and MUC1&#8208;binding aptamer arms in AIETR can separately bind with azide moieties and aptamer binding domains in MUC1 of glycoengineered TNBC cells and restrict intramolecular rotation to activate their AIE&#8208;dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and fluorescence imaging capacity. The proximity&#8208;dependent ROS damage abolishes membrane MUC1 to activate pyroptosis cascades. Moreover, treatment&#8208;enabled MUC1 inactivation also ameliorates MUC1&#8208;dependent immunosuppression in TNBC microenvironment to boost anti&#8208;TNBC immunity. This study offers an effective approach for precision TNBC theranostics in the clinic.

         <title>Chimeric Glycoprotein Nanoparticles Elicit Robust Neutralizing Antibodies Against Epstein&#8211;Barr Virus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epstein&#8211;Barr virus (EBV) lacks vaccines/therapeutics despite causing cancers. Chimeric nanoparticles co&#8208;displaying EBV's gB/gHgL fusion apparatus are designed. These induce stronger neutralizing antibodies than cocktails in animals, mimicking whole&#8208;virion antibody patterns. Single&#8208;BCR sequencing reveals a novel gB&#8208;targeting neutralizing antibody (Fab5) to a new site. This strategy offers potent EBV vaccine candidates and insights for multi&#8208;antigen pathogens.








Abstract
Epstein&#8210;Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous gammaherpesvirus linked to a broad spectrum of malignancies and autoimmune diseases with no approved therapeutic drugs or vaccines. EBV infection relies on the viral glycoproteins gB and gHgL, which, together, function as the fusion apparatus, mediating viral recognition and membrane fusion in both epithelial and B cells. Despite discovering potent neutralizing antibodies targeting gB and gHgL, the heterogeneous antigen structures and distribution of multiple glycoproteins in the virion hinder rational vaccine design targeting this apparatus complex. In this study, Chimeric nanoparticles (Chimeric&#8208;NPs) are designed that co&#8208;display EBV fusion apparatus and induce significantly more neutralizing antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates than the cocktail counterparts. It is further demonstrated that the Chimeric&#8208;NPs elicited neutralizing antibodies predominantly targeting gB, closely mimicking the antibody induction pattern by the whole EBV virion. Additionally, single&#8208;BCR sequencing is used to analyze the B cell response to Chimeric&#8208;NP, and a novel gB neutralizing antibody Fab5 targeting a new vulnerable site EBV gB is identified. These findings provide novel candidates and vaccine design strategies for EBV and reveal the underlying mechanisms of antibody induction and immune response regulation by chimera vaccines, with potential implications for all multi&#8208;antigen&#8208;harbored pathogens.

         <title>High Thermal Conductivity Porous Organic Polymers with Low Permittivity via Desolvation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops porous polyacrylonitrile (P&#8208;PAN) films via PEG&#8208;induced desolvation. This strategy creates uniform micropores (reducing permittivity to 1.44, &#8208;73.1%) while simultaneously promoting PAN chain reorganization into aligned crystalline domains. This enhances thermal conductivity tenfold to 1.39 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1, overcoming the typical permittivity&#8208;thermal conductivity trade&#8208;off in organics. As a thermal interface material, P&#8208;PAN reduces chip temperature by 5.7&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Miniaturization of microelectronic devices demand organic dielectric polymers with ultralow permittivity (k &lt; 2.0) and high thermal conductivity (&#955; &gt; 1.0 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1) to mitigate signal delay and thermal accumulation. However, organic polymers inherently face a trade&#8208;off: porosity reduces k but sacrifices &#955; due to disordered pores and interchain hopping barriers. Here, a desolvation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed, fabricating all organic porous polyacrylonitrile (P&#8208;PAN) films. By incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a porogen and plasticizer, followed by water exchange and freeze drying, the P&#8208;PAN film features uniform microscale holes, which reduce dipole density and electronic polarization, resulting in k to 1.44 (73.1% reduction from PAN). Simultaneously, PEG&#8208;induce hydrogen bonds enable PAN chains mobility, promoting the reorganization of amorphous chains into crystalline domains during desolvation. This ordered framework facilitates efficient phonon transport via crystalline domains, elevating &#955; to 1.39&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, nearly tenfold improvement over PAN (0.13&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). Notably, P&#8208;PAN synergizes k &lt; 2.0 and &#955; &gt; 1.0 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1 without fillers, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic polymers. As a proof of concept, P&#8208;PAN as a thermal interface material (TIM) reduces chip temperature by 5.7&#160;&#176;C, decoupling the k&#8208;&#955; trade&#8208;offs in organic polymers and demonstrating its potential for flexible electronics.

As a proof of concept, P-PAN as a thermal interface material (TIM) reduces chip temperature by 5.7&#160;&#176;C, decoupling the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-&#955; trade-offs in organic polymers and demonstrating its potential for flexible electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integrated TRNG and PUF Based on Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Polymer Dielectric Gated Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed that incorporates a photoactivable RTP film as a dielectric layer in phototransistors, giving two distinct outputs, i.e., phosphorescence (Ip) and photocurrent (Id), enabling integrated true random number generator (TRNG) and physical unclonable function (PUF) functionalities.








Abstract
Harnessing the entropy of multiple transitions between different electronic states in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) not only overcomes the drawbacks of authentication via afterglow but also holds significant potential for cryptographic protocols that are immune to attacks from future quantum computers. However, such an objective has yet to be realized. Here, RTP films are incorporated as a dielectric layer in phototransistors, which give two distinct outputs, i.e., phosphorescence (Ip) from the dielectric layer and photocurrent (Id) across the source&#8208;drain electrode. The susceptible thermodynamics of electron transitions and the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer at the dielectric&#8208;semiconductor interface causing Ip to vary with each readout, thereby enabling true random number generator (TRNG) functionality. Whereas Id is mainly governed by film quality and interfacial defects, which vary among different batches due to inherent randomness introduced during fabrication, making it suitable as a physical unclonable function (PUF). Detailed studies reveal that the two outputs demonstrate excellent uniqueness and independence, with a Hamming weight of 0.50, an inter&#8208;Hamming distance of 50.27%, a Pearson correlation coefficient of &#8722;0.0054, and an encoding capacity of 225 within a 5 &#215; 5 transistor array. This work represents a breakthrough of integrated optoelectronic devices for highly secure authentication while also inspiring new applications for RTP materials.

         <title>Isotropic Energy&#8208;Absorbing Metamaterial with Tensegrity&#8208;Inspired Architecture and Auxetic Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of tensile properties enables adjustment of the spring's stiffness coefficient, achieving overall stiffness regulation while offering self&#8208;recovery and anti&#8208;fatigue capabilities. By leveraging negative Poisson's ratio properties, the seven&#8208;cell and tetrahedral metamaterials significantly mitigate impact loads during shock testing. Additionally, the assembly strategy of unit cells is expanded to fabricate multidimensional metamaterials.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials exhibit significant potential for energy absorption applications through rational structural design. Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) metamaterials have drawn particular attention due to their unique auxetic behavior, though their limited functionality restricts energy absorption capacity. This study develops a novel metamaterial combining NPR characteristics with tensegrity structure advantages to address traditional energy&#8208;absorbing materials' limitations in durability, self&#8208;recovery, and dynamic adjustability. By reconfiguring tensegrity modules into programmable units using spring combinations and implementing directional deformation constraints through rigid sliding rod and linear slider systems, the auxetic mechanism of NPR materials is integrated with tensegrity's programmable features. Experimental results demonstrate precise control of global auxetic response and overall stiffness through spring stiffness adjustment, with the elastic element combination providing self&#8208;recovery and fatigue resistance (only 0.40% energy absorption variation after 10000 compression cycles). For structural assembly, seven&#8208;cell and tetrahedral configurations achieve peak force reductions of &#8776;75.68&#160;&#177;&#160;1.22% and 91.18&#160;&#177;&#160;0.40% respectively, under impact, demonstrating assembly strategy scalability. This research breaks through traditional single&#8208;material metamaterial limitations by integrating tensegrity structures with NPR effects, establishing a new paradigm for developing intelligent protective materials with both tunable energy absorption characteristics and enhanced durability.

         <title>Chip&#8208;Scale Graphene/IGZO Cold Source FET Array Enabling Sub&#8208;60 mV dec&#8722;1 Super&#8208;Steep Subthreshold Swing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS) below 60 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 is demonstrated in graphene/IGZO cold source transistor arrays. Linear density of states with Dirac cone in graphene suppressed the Boltzmann thermal tail, while high&#8208;k HfO2 dielectric having small body factor enhanced gating efficiency, hereby further reducing SS. An average SS of &#8776;46.4 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 is achieved in the array, enabling ultralow&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed electronics.








Abstract
In this study, the first sub&#8208;60 mV dec&#8722;1 super&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS) of graphene/InGaZnO (IGZO) cold&#8208;source field&#8208;effect transistor (CSFET) arrays is demonstrated. The linear density of states of the Dirac&#8208;cone&#8208;type graphene suppresses the Boltzmann thermal tail near the graphene/IGZO interface which in turn causes super&#8208;exponentially decaying electron density with increasing energy, leading to an extremely low off current and SS value. In particular, by introducing an HfO2 high&#8208;k dielectric with a low body factor, the surface potential is effectively modulated, further reducing SS by &#8776;46.4 mV dec&#8722;1. Furthermore, highly uniform sub&#8208;60 mV dec&#8722;1 SS with a yield of &#8776;89.1% is achieved in the IGZO CSFET 8 &#215; 8 array devices, with a record SS value of 23.66 mV dec&#8722;1 compared to previously reported oxide&#8208;semiconductor transistors. The proposed IGZO CSFET device is expected to drive significant advancements in high&#8208;speed and ultralow&#8208;power electronic circuits.

         <title>Chiral Nanoagonist Targeting EGFR for Nerve Injury Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral nanoagonist is proposed to effectively activate EGFR for nerve injury repair. D&#8208;Histidine ZnO nanorods promote cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in a chirality&#8208;dependent manner through EGFR signaling networks. Further incorporated into a biodegradable bandage, enhanced nerve regeneration and function recovery are demonstrated in both peripheral and central nervous system injury models.








Abstract
Nerve injury repair is limited by the incapacity to regenerate neurons in the nervous system. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in the development of the nervous system, but its potential in nerve regeneration and repair has remained underappreciated. Herein, a chiral nanoagonist, D&#8208;Histidine ZnO nanorods (NRs), is reported to effectively activate EGFR and initiate multiple downstream cascade signaling pathways, promoting nerve cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in three different types of neural cells. D&#8208;Histidine ZnO NRs not only achieve more than 85% differentiation rate (with neurite length larger than 50 &#181;m), but also induce the transdifferentiating of Schwann cells into a stem&#8208;like phenotype. A biodegradable band&#8208;aid&#8208;like bandage incorporating D&#8208;Histidine ZnO NRs is developed and applied in nerve injury repair in both sciatic nerve and spinal cord injury models. The neurorestoration and functional recovery are significantly improved after 4&#8208;week therapy. This study reveals that chirality&#8208;dependent regulation of nerve cell behavior by chiral nanoagonist targeting EGFR is a pioneering and promising strategy in nerve regeneration therapies.

         <title>Origin of B&#8208;Type Blinking at 2D/3D Heterojunction Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
B&#8209;type photoluminescence blinking is observed in WS2/Si heterojunctions, originating from the competition between two hot&#8209;carrier relaxation pathways either leading to A exciton or localized exciton formation. F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer sustains the blinking by modulating localized exciton density. This finding broadens the understanding of carrier dynamics in 2D/3D systems and help the degsin of stable optoelectronic device. 








Abstract
Photoluminescence blinking is a common phenomenon that occurs across various low&#8208;dimensional materials, like 0D quantum dots or 1D nanowires. Two blinking types in 0D and 1D systems have been observed and extensively studied, revealing the mechanisms of non&#8208;equilibrium photocarrier kinetics, thereby enhancing emission stability and optimizing emitter performance. However, the origin of blinking in 2D materials is still less understood compared to those in quantum dots and single molecules and only the A&#8208;type blinking has been reported. Here, a B&#8208;type photoluminescence blinking is identified at the WS2/Si heterointerface through the statistics of fluorescence lifetime&#8208;intensity distribution. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and transient absorption spectra show that the blinking arises from the dynamic competition between two hot carrier relaxation pathways: one leading to A exciton emission and the other to localized exciton recombination. Moreover, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer modulates the localized exciton density at the heterointerface and sustains the blinking phenomenon, which is distinct from other B&#8208;type blinking. This B&#8208;type blinking broadens the understanding of photocarrier dynamics in 2D/3D systems, which will benefit the development of optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials.

         <title>Michell's&#8208;Instability&#8208;Mediated Fast Reconfiguration of Hydrogel&#8208;Based Ring Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic hydrogel&#8208;based ring actuator exhibits fast reconfiguration from a saddle&#8208;shape to a figure of eight upon heating or light irradiation, resulting in varied stiffnesses of the gel and reduced critical twist of the ring for Michell's instability. Such ring actuators with fast rotational deformation are harnessed for executing specific tasks.








Abstract
Michell's instability, a classic type of mechanical instability, has received tremendous interest from different disciplines. It occurs when the pre&#8208;torsion in an elastic ring surpasses a critical value; the elastic ring spontaneously undergoes a transition from a flat or warped shape to a figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight configuration. However, such instability has rarely been exploited in designing soft actuators. Here, by employing a stimulus&#8208;triggered Michell's instability, hydrogel&#8208;based ring actuators capable of fast shape morphing are developed. Upon heating or light irradiation, the hydrogel ring transforms rapidly from the saddle&#8208;shape into the figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight configuration. Rigorous experiments and simulations reveal the underlying mechanism and attribute it to the stimuli&#8208;induced variations in bending and torsional stiffnesses of the gel string with anisotropic structure and response, which reduces the critical twist for Michell's instability of the ring actuator. Moreover, effects of light intensity, environmental temperature, ring size, and pre&#8208;torsion on reconfiguration are also investigated. The fast action of the ring actuators in aqueous conditions has been demonstrated through various tasks, such as screwing a bottle cap, kicking a ball, and triggering synergetic deformations. The design principle of soft actuators by harnessing Michell's instability should merit the development of other soft machines with fast action and large&#8208;amplitude reconfiguration.

         <title>Field&#8208;Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong field&#8208;free superconducting diode effect (SDE) in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures are demonstrated and achieved by combining engineered geometric asymmetry with stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. The devices reach 54% field&#8208;free diode efficiency&#8212;the highest reported for simple, fully CMOS&#8208;compatible ferromagnet/superconductor multilayers made by standard thin&#8208;film processes.








Abstract
The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which manifests as directional, dissipationless supercurrents, is pivotal for realizing energy&#8208;efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields remains a fundamental challenge. In this study, a strongly enhanced, field&#8208;free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures are proposed, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field&#8208;free values in ferromagnet/superconductor multilayers. Temperature&#8208; and field&#8208;dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity results from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz&#8208;force imbalance. These findings establish a CMOS&#8208;compatible platform for high&#8208;performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.

         <title>Trace&#8208;Level Green Bio&#8208;Derived Amino Acid Molecular Leveling Agent Enables Dendrite&#8208;Free and Long&#8208;Lifespan Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;derived BICINE is introduced as a green and efficient leveling agent to regulate Zn2+ solvation structure and guide uniform Zn nucleation. It also promotes the formation of a stable organic/inorganic hybrid SEI, effectively suppressing dendrites and side reactions, achieving over 5400 h of stable cycling at 5 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The poor reversibility of Zn metal anodes, caused by dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced side reactions, hinders the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). To address these issues, regulating Zn2+ solvation structure, controlling nucleation behavior, and constructing a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are crucial. Herein, a trace&#8208;level (10&#160;mg mL&#8722;1) bio&#8208;derived surface&#8208;leveling agent, N,N&#8208;dihydroxyethyl glycine (BICINE), is introduced to tailor the interfacial environment. With multiple coordinating groups, BICINE adsorbs onto the Zn surface, homogenizes nucleation, reconstructs solvation sheath, and induces a hybrid SEI. Meanwhile, it promotes the formation of a uniform cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), stabilizing cathode morphology and preventing irreversible degradation. These synergistic effects suppress dendrite growth and parasitic reactions, enabling highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Consequently, symmetric Zn||Zn cells demonstrate remarkable stability, with the capability to operate for over 5,300&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 and maintain stable performance at a high depth of discharge (88.2%). Asymmetric Cu||Zn cells exhibit exceptional Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% over 1,650 cycles. Even with a low N/P ratio of 3, Zn||NH4V4O10 full cells retain 89.7% of their capacity after 250 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. The low&#8208;cost BICINE strategy holds great promise for advancing the commercialization of AZIBs.

A chemical reaction that is typically symmetry&#8208;forbidden (norbornadiene (NBD) to quadricyclane (QC)) is catalyzed in a single&#8208;molecule junction using a combination of nanoconfinement and electrical catalysis. It occurs when the molecular junction is sterically driven into a configuration that is far from the ground state prior to applying the activating voltage as revealed by simultaneous single&#8208;molecule break&#8208;junction and Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Molecular orbital symmetry plays a pivotal role in determining chemical reaction mechanisms. The process of changing chemical reactants into products must transition along a pathway that conserves molecular orbital symmetry to ensure continuity. This principle is so fundamental that reactions that do not conserve symmetry are typically considered &#8220;forbidden&#8221; due to the high resultant energy barriers. Here, it is demonstrated that it is possible to electrically catalyze these forbidden transitions when a single molecule is bound between two electrodes in a nanoscale junction. A cycloaddition reaction is induced in a norbornadiene (NBD) derivative, converting it to quadricyclane (QC) by utilizing nanoconfinement to place the molecule into a configuration that is far from equilibrium and applying a small voltage to the molecular junction. Traditionally, this reaction can only be induced photochemically due to orbital symmetry selection rules. By directly tracking the reaction dynamics in situ using single&#8208;molecule Raman spectroscopy, it is shown that for this reaction to be electrically catalyzed the molecule must be sterically maneuvered into a configuration near the transition state at the peak of the energy barrier prior to applying the voltage needed to successfully induce the forbidden transition is applied.

         <title>Sieving Hydrogen Isotopes via Machine Learning Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) of High&#8208;Quality Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h&#8208;BN) on Iron Foils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;atomic scale separation of hydrogen isotopes (H+/D+) require near pristine h&#8208;BN membranes, and scalable synthesis of such high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN comparable to mechanically exfoliated crystals remains a significant challenge. This study reports a scalable Fe&#8208;catalyzed Machine&#8208;Learning Enabled Chemical vapor deposition process for bottom&#8208;up large&#8208;area, high&#8208;quality monolayer h&#8208;BN film synthesis and demonstrate H+/D+ separation with selectivity approaching mechanically exfoliated h&#8208;BN.








Abstract
Atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ceramics, such as monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), present potential for disruptive advances in separations. However, sub&#8208;atomic scale separation of hydrogen isotopes (H+/D+) require near pristine 2D material membranes, and scalable synthesis of such high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN comparable to mechanically exfoliated crystals remains a significant challenge. Here, we&#160;report a scalable Fe&#8208;catalyzed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for bottom&#8208;up synthesis of large&#8208;area, high&#8208;quality monolayer h&#8208;BN films, overcoming key limitations of conventional ammonia&#8208;based routes. By leveraging mechanistic insights and higher CVD temperatures, we&#160;suppress multilayer formation and achieve uniform monolayer h&#8208;BN coverage on commercially available Fe foils. Machine learning enables systematic exploration of the complex, multi&#8208;dimensional CVD parameter space (growth time, temperature, precursor temperature, multilayer faction, coverage), providing data&#8208;driven approaches to visualize and identify process regimes facilitating predominantly monolayer h&#8208;BN growth with minimal secondary nuclei/ad&#8208;layers. The optimized Fe&#8208;catalyzed CVD h&#8208;BN membranes show high&#8208;quality as observed by proton/deuteron (H+/D+) selectivity &#8776;8.45, approaching the highest quality benchmark of mechanically exfoliated h&#8208;BN (H+/D+ selectivity &#8776;10) as well as significantly outperforming Cu&#8208;catalyzed CVD h&#8208;BN membranes (H+/D+ selectivity &#8776;3.62, control selectivity &#8776;1.7). Our work provides a scalable cost&#8208;effective route for high&#8208;quality monolayer h&#8208;BN synthesis for sub&#8208;atomic scale separations (H+/D+) and demonstrates the broader potential of machine learning&#8208;guided optimization of CVD for advancing synthesis of 2D materials.

         <title>A Sono&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform Integrating STING Activation and CXCR4 Blockade for Synergistic Immunotherapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;function therapeutic platform that integrates ultrasound&#8208;triggered sonodynamic therapy, STING pathway activation, and CXCR4 inhibition for synergistic immunotherapy of glioblastoma is presented. This approach not only facilitates robust innate and adaptive immune activation but also significantly inhibits tumor growth and recurrence in glioblastoma&#8208;bearing mice, offering a promising strategy to overcome the immunosuppressive barriers.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor with a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment, remains a therapeutic challenge due to its resistance to conventional treatments. In this study, a novel multi&#8208;function therapeutic platform that integrates ultrasound&#8208;triggered sonodynamic therapy (SDT), STING pathway activation, and CXCR4 inhibition for synergistic immunotherapy of GBM is presented. Through systematic comparison of a series of organic molecules with subtle substituted atom alterations, a new selenium&#8208;containing compound is identified with outstanding sonodynamic properties. The high&#8208;performance sonosensitizer is co&#8208;assembled with a STING agonist prodrug, which is further cloaked with glioma cell membrane and CXCR4&#8208;targeting peptides for dual homing and immune modulation. Under ultrasound irradiation, the nanoplatform triggers robust reactive oxygen species production, in combination with the self&#8208;accelerating STING agonist release, significantly stimulating both innate and adaptive immune responses while disrupting the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis to suppress immunosuppressive cell infiltration. This tripartite strategy, which integrates SDT&#8208;mediated tumor ablation, STING&#8208;induced systemic immunity, and CXCR4 blockade, synergistically suppresses primary tumor growth, prevents postoperative recurrence, and extends survival in GBM&#8208;bearing mice. This approach presents a promising sono&#8208;triggered multimodal paradigm for overcoming GBM's immunosuppressive barriers and enhancing therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Infrared and Thermo Co&#8208;Driven Catalysis for CO2 Conversion to Valuable Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome thermal bottlenecks in direct dimethyl carbonate synthesis, infrared photon energy is coupled with gentle heating on vacancy&#8208;rich CeO2. Vacancy states absorb IR and generate holes with moderate potentials, guiding selective CO2&#8211;methanol conversion, and heat expedites carrier relaxation, resulting in the DMC production rate of &#8764;30 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity, demonstrating an IR&#8211;thermo synergy for CO2 utilisation.








Abstract
Conversion of CO2 into high value chemicals presents a promising pathway for CO2 mitigation and utilisation. The direct synthesis of dimethyl carbonate from CO2 and methanol is one of such carbon&#8208;neutral pathways. However, thermal catalytic processes for direct dimethyl carbonate synthesis have reached a performance bottleneck at elevated temperatures. This work explores the synergy of photon and thermal energy to enhance the dimethyl carbonate production rate to 30&#160;mmol/g/h, together with 100% selectivity, thanks to a defect&#8208;modified and noble&#8208;metal free cerium oxide catalyst. Fundamentally, it is found that the defects in cerium oxide can provide energy levels that enable IR light absorption and generate holes with a moderate oxidation potential, so avoiding the unfavorable overoxidation pathway and enhancing the production rate of dimethyl carbonate. The thermal energy has been proved to remarkably facilitate the relaxation of IR&#8208;induced charge carriers and to enhance the dimethyl carbonate formation process. This work introduces a strategy of IR photons and thermo co&#8208;driven catalysis and achieves a breakthrough in dimethyl carbonate formation.

         <title>Terahertz Multi&#8208;State Reconfigurable Holographic Metasurface Based on Full&#8208;Stokes Magnetic Eigen&#8208;Modulation of Photonic Weyl Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eigen propagation states in the photonic Weyl semimetal cover the normalized full&#8208;Stokes parameter, which can be modulated by the magnetic vector at the magnetized plasma frequency, following a projection relationship. Coupled with the vectorial holography, a multi&#8208;state reconfigurable holographic metasurface is achieved, providing a new paradigm to increase the number of functional states, theoretically to infinity.








Abstract
The metasurface is limited by the fixed microstructure to integrate more reconfigurable functional states, making it indispensable to introduce active materials. Nowadays, attributing to the nontrivial topological properties, the photonic Weyl semimetal shows its potential in active polarization modulation. Here, it is demonstrated that the photonic Weyl semimetal can filter the light with arbitrary required normalized Stokes parameters selected by the magnetic field, namely full&#8208;Stokes magnetic eigen&#8208;modulation scheme, and an analytical relationship between the magnetized direction and eigen polarization state is further derived to guide the modulation scheme. The fractional bandwidth of the modulation scheme is up to 52%.

     alt="Terahertz Multi-State Reconfigurable Holographic Metasurface Based on Full-Stokes Magnetic Eigen-Modulation of Photonic Weyl Semimetal"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eigen propagation states in the photonic Weyl semimetal cover the normalized full-Stokes parameter, which can be modulated by the magnetic vector at the magnetized plasma frequency, following a projection relationship. Coupled with the vectorial holography, a multi-state reconfigurable holographic metasurface is achieved, providing a new paradigm to increase the number of functional states, theoretically to infinity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metasurface is limited by the fixed microstructure to integrate more reconfigurable functional states, making it indispensable to introduce active materials. Nowadays, attributing to the nontrivial topological properties, the photonic Weyl semimetal shows its potential in active polarization modulation. Here, it is demonstrated that the photonic Weyl semimetal can filter the light with arbitrary required normalized Stokes parameters selected by the magnetic field, namely full-Stokes magnetic eigen-modulation scheme, and an analytical relationship between the magnetized direction and eigen polarization state is further derived to guide the modulation scheme. The fractional bandwidth of the modulation scheme is up to 52%. Combined with vectorial holography, an 8-state reconfigurable metasurface is designed, whose imaging states can be modulated by magnetized direction and experimentally demonstrated in the frequency range from 0.6 to 0.71THz. Furthermore, a single metasurface can function as four switches of the four pairs of orthogonal polarization channels, and the largest contrast ratios of each state are over 18&#160;dB. This multi-state metasurface scheme provides a novel paradigm to increase the number of functional states, theoretically to infinity, showing promising potential in 6G THz communication and quantum technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Engineering for Synergistic Nucleation and Interfacial Regulation Enabling Durable Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a highly sodiophilic and robust Na metal host achieved by spatially confined atomically dispersed Bi sites featuring a unique N3&#8208;Bi&#8208;S1 moiety in interconnected carbon tubes (Bi&#8208;N3S1@CT) has been developed, demonstrating exceptional average Coulombic efficiency, large capacity, and long&#8208;term durability. The mechanisms behind performance enhancement are explicitly revealed by substantial experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are highly promising candidates for low&#8208;cost, sustainable, and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems. However, their practical deployment is challenged by uncontrolled dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. To address these issues, a highly reversible and robust Na metal host enabled by atomic Bi sites is devised, coordinated in a unique N3&#8208;Bi&#8208;S1 moiety anchored on interconnected carbon tubes (Bi&#8208;N3S1@CT). Crucially, this designed remarkably sodiophilic Bi single&#8208;atom promotes uniform Na nucleation with minimal Na+ consumption, enabling durable and highly reversible Na plating/stripping, while effectively suppressing electrolyte over&#8208;decomposition and fostering the formation of robust inorganic&#8208;rich SEI films, as supported by comprehensive theoretical calculations and experimental analyses. Consequently, Bi&#8208;N3S1@CT achieves an extraordinary average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6% over 900 cycles at 12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 6 mAh cm&#8722;2, along with long&#8208;term durability of 1000&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells. Notably, an anode&#8208;free pouch cell paired with a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibits decent cyclability over 240 cycles at 1C while maintaining good rate capability. This work demonstrates a promising strategy to simultaneously enhance energy density and stability in AFSMBs via atomic&#8208;level sodiophilicity regulation and SEI engineering.

         <title>Highly Robust and Intrinsic Flame&#8208;Retardant Polyphenylene Benzodiazole/Liquid Crystal Polyarylate Composites for Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators in Harsh Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through interface molecular engineering design, intrinsically flame&#8208;retardant and high&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on polyphenylene benzodiazole fabric reinforced liquid crystal polyarylate (PBO/LCP) composites is achieved. The TENG is expected to provide a sustainable pathway for reliable energy sources and sensing for robots in extreme environments.








Abstract
Achieving a power supply for robots operating at high temperatures or in combustion environments is crucial for human life. As an emerging energy collection technique, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) possess great sustainability, however, their electrical output performances rapidly deteriorate due to the failure of polymer based triboelectric layers in harsh environments. Herein, an outstanding high&#8208;temperature resistant and electrically stable TENG is fabricated using composites of polyphenylene benzodiazole (PBO) fiber enhanced liquid crystal polyarylate (LCP). The intrinsic inert PBO fibers are modified by aminated naphthalimide sizing to effectively improve the interfacial interactions of PBO/LCP composites in terms of high tensile strength (409.3 MPa) and storage modulus at 250 &#176;C (0.18 GPa). More importantly, besides good flexibility, high heat resistance index of 303.9&#176;C, and impressive limiting oxygen index of 36.4%, the resultant TENGs showed enhanced electrical output performance at elevated temperature. The output voltage reached 42 V at 200&#176;C, which could drive a louder buzzer compared to the reduced voltages (by 26.5%) at room temperature. Even after burning on the flame for 10 s, the output voltage is almost 100% retained. The findings demonstrate the great potential of interface molecular engineering and structure&#8208;function integrated composites for the wearable electronics of robots in extreme environments.

         <title>Adaptive Co&#8208;Crystals with Switchable Host&#8208;Guest Stoichiometry for Dynamic Regulation of Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycle&#8208;based adaptive co&#8208;crystals with switchable host&#8208;guest stoichiometry is proposed, enabling vapor&#8208;induced phase transitions, precise D/A ratio modulation, and dynamic TSCT/photoluminescence regulation. Unlike traditional systems, they access intermediate states for fine&#8208;tuned chromic behaviors in the solid state, advancing supramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor materials.








Abstract
The development of photoluminescence materials with tunable properties through structural and functional modifications remains a fascinating yet challenging task. In this work, the concept of adaptive co&#8208;crystals featuring switchable host&#8208;guest stoichiometry within the realm of pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular chemistry is proposed. This strategy allows for the rational design of a diverse range of through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer co&#8208;crystals, enabling dynamic modulation of photoluminescence in the solid state. Experimental and theoretical findings unveil two distinct phases within each set of co&#8208;crystal architectures, characterized by different donor/acceptor stoichiometric ratios as well as molecular packing modes. Notably, these co&#8208;crystalline phases undergo vapor&#8208;induced stoichiometry switching and structural interconversion, resulting in unique charge&#8208;transfer transition states and enabling reversible control over photoluminescent behavior. Particularly, this dynamic modulation of the cavity apertures, driven by stoichiometric variation, facilitates highly selective capture and release of 1&#8208;bromoalkane under mild conditions. The present study highlights the potential application of vapor&#8208;mediated co&#8208;crystals with switchable stoichiometry as a supramolecular strategy for modulating the intrinsic characteristics of intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor materials.

         <title>Disorder Scattering Induced Large Room Temperature Nonlinear Anomalous Hall Effect in a Semiconductor CdGeAs2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk CdGeAs2, a well&#8208;known nonlinear optical semiconductor, exhibits an exceptionally large room&#8208;temperature nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), achieving a record&#8208;high nonlinear Hall responsivity of 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 m/V. This pronounced NLHE enables broadband frequency mixing up to the megahertz regime, establishing CdGeAs2 as a promising platform for next&#8208;generation nonlinear electronic and optoelectronic technologies.








Abstract
The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) with time&#8208;reversal symmetry has emerged as a transformative phenomenon within the Hall effect family, attracting significant interest due to its profound implications for both fundamental physics and technological applications. While prior studies have predominantly focused on NLHE in 2D materials, advancements in practical applications have been constrained by low operating temperatures and limited responsivity, typically below 10&#8722;4 m/V. Achieving significant responsivity at room temperature (RT) in 3D systems has proven challenging, particularly for scattering&#8208;induced NLHE. Here, the discovery of disorder scattering&#8208;induced NLHE in chalcopyrite&#8208;type CdGeAs2 bulk single crystals is reported, demonstrating a remarkable responsivity of up to 10&#8722;3 m/V at RT. The studies reveal that NLHE not only facilitates ac&#8208;driven second harmonic and rectification Hall responses but also induces an exceptionally large anomalous Hall angle. Through band structure measurements by ARPES, DFT calculations, as well as symmetry and nonlinear Hall conductivity scaling analyses, disorder scattering is identified as the dominant mechanism for the NLHE in CdGeAs2. Leveraging the observed strong responsivity of NLHE at RT, its broadband electronic frequency mixing capability in the MHz range is further demonstrated. This work sets the foundation for integrating scattering&#8208;induced NLHE in 3D materials into very high&#8208;frequency mixing technologies.

&lt;p&gt;Bulk CdGeAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a well-known nonlinear optical semiconductor, exhibits an exceptionally large room-temperature nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), achieving a record-high nonlinear Hall responsivity of 2.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; m/V. This pronounced NLHE enables broadband frequency mixing up to the megahertz regime, establishing CdGeAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a promising platform for next-generation nonlinear electronic and optoelectronic technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) with time-reversal symmetry has emerged as a transformative phenomenon within the Hall effect family, attracting significant interest due to its profound implications for both fundamental physics and technological applications. While prior studies have predominantly focused on NLHE in 2D materials, advancements in practical applications have been constrained by low operating temperatures and limited responsivity, typically below 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; m/V. Achieving significant responsivity at room temperature (RT) in 3D systems has proven challenging, particularly for scattering-induced NLHE. Here, the discovery of disorder scattering-induced NLHE in chalcopyrite-type CdGeAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bulk single crystals is reported, demonstrating a remarkable responsivity of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; m/V at RT. The studies reveal that NLHE not only facilitates ac-driven second harmonic and rectification Hall responses but also induces an exceptionally large anomalous Hall angle. Through band structure measurements by ARPES, DFT calculations, as well as symmetry and nonlinear Hall conductivity scaling analyses, disorder scattering is identified as the dominant mechanism for the NLHE in CdGeAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Leveraging the observed strong responsivity of NLHE at RT, its broadband electronic frequency mixing capability in the MHz range is further demonstrated. This work sets the foundation for integrating scattering-induced NLHE in 3D materials into very high-frequency mixing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Control of Covalent Bond Enables Efficient Magnetic Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant and reversible magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is achieved by tuning covalency through sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell chemical engineering, establishing a novel design principle for effective hysteresis control in magnetocaloric materials.








Abstract
Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to a magnetic field, presents an energy&#8208;efficient and climate&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional vapor&#8208;compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric materials are minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal lattice constants at the unit&#8208;cell level, mitigating hysteresis often compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge by forming Sn(Ge)3&#8722;Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound. This approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be extended over a wide temperature range of 40&#8211;160 K. This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction applications in the longstanding pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

         <title>Light&#8208;Up Nanostructures with Allosterically Controlled Fluorogenic DNA Aptamers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By customizing allosteric regulation into fluorescent DNA aptamers, switchable fluorescent nanodevices become achievable. Such a sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;dependent engineering leads to the realization of clear&#8208;cut fluorescent ON&#8211;OFF switches alongside more advanced operations like Boolean gates and combinatorial circuits. The incorporation of allosteric aptamers with tunable fluorescent properties in DNA nanostructures points a versatile platform of DNA data storage and computing.








Abstract
In this study, a systematic approach is presented for the rational design of synthetic allosteric DNA aptamers. This methodology enables precise control over the allosteric ON&#8211;OFF transition in fluorescent DNA aptamers, allowing for the engineering of aptamers with highly tunable fluorescent properties. When combined with toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, a series of allosteric aptamers is developed in which the target sequence functions as a specific allosteric modulator. Furthermore, these aptamers are applied in synthetic DNA computing and in the construction of responsive nanostructures that light up upon activation.

         <dc:description>
This study develops a microcapsule rupture&#8208;triggered in&#8208;situ polymerization strategy for mechano&#8208;responsive ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with full&#8208;color tunable emissions. This approach paves the way for the development of self&#8208;healing smart coatings capable of high&#8208;contrast damage visualization, as well as advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems featuring mechanically activated dynamic RTP responses.








Abstract
Polymer materials with mechano&#8208;responsive ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly desired but challenging to achieve. Herein, a microcapsule (MC) rupture&#8208;triggered in&#8208;situ polymerization strategy is proposed to achieve such RTP with full&#8208;color tunable emissions. It involves co&#8208;encapsulating organic phosphors and moisture&#8208;reactive hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) in MCs, which are dispersed into a polymer matrix. Mechanical damage ruptures MCs, releasing HDI that undergoes moisture&#8208;initiated polymerization to form a rigid cross&#8208;linked network at the damaged site. This network effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative decay pathways of triplet excitons, thereby activating &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; ultralong RTP signals specifically and exclusively at the damaged sites. The system achieves&#160;ultralong RTP lifetimes exceeding 1.5&#160;s and a phosphorescence quantum yield of 11.2%. Notably, these RTP systems demonstrate&#160;exceptional stability under harsh conditions, including immersing in neutral, acidic, alkaline aqueous environments and various organic solvents, as well as exposure to high temperatures. Full&#8208;color tunable afterglow emissions, ranging from blue to red, are readily achieved by employing different organic phosphors. This approach facilitates the development of self&#8208;repairing smart coatings with high&#8208;contrast damage visualization and advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems featuring mechanically activated dynamic RTP responses.&#160;Furthermore, the compatibility of MCs with diverse polymer matrices expands the practical applicability of such stimuli&#8208;responsive ultralong RTP materials.

         <title>Electrostatically Enhanced Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Anchoring for Scalable and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel electrostatically enhanced anchoring strategy (EEAS). This work employs sulfonamide&#8208;based post&#8208;treatments to modulate the protonation state of phosphonic acid groups in SAMs, resulting in stronger electrostatic interactions with TCO substrates and simultaneously effectively passivating buried interfacial defects, ultimately improving device performance. This scalable and generalizable strategy for advancing PSCs toward industrial standards.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have substantially advanced the efficiency of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), yet weak interfacial adhesion to transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates and perovskite compromises both scalability and thermal stability. Here, an electrostatically enhanced anchoring strategy (EEAS) is presented using sulfadiazine (SDZ) molecules to deprotonate phosphonic acid groups in SAMs, generating phosphate anions that strengthen electrostatic interactions with the positively charged TCO substrates. The protonated SDZ species concurrently establish strong coordination interactions with the buried perovskite interface. This approach enables the formation of uniform and robust buried interfaces while improving perovskite crystallinity and facilitating charge extraction. The resulting PSCs achieve a certified efficiency of 26.23% (steady&#8208;state 25.42%) over 1 cm2 areas. This EEAS is scalable, enabling 20.7&#8208;cm2 modules with a PCE of 24.72%. The devices demonstrate exceptional operational stability, retaining over 94% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous illumination at 65 &#176;C (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).

         <title>Grain Welding Strategy Suppressing Chemomechanical Failure in Polycrystalline Cathode for High&#8208;Voltage Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grain welding strategy is presented to achieve densification of particle in polycrystalline O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode material via introducing Li2CO3 and Na2CO3 eutectics to form liquid phase sintering. The modified cathode suppresses the generation of microcracks and high&#8208;voltage phase transition, impeding chemomechanical failure and achieving high&#8208;voltage fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Chemomechanical failure is critical bottleneck for Na&#8208;based layered oxides (especially polycrystalline material) to achieve the stable operating at high&#8208;voltage with fast&#8208;charging ability. Although attempts like coating and doping are presented to alleviate this issue, the inherent intergranular crevices are inevitable during the synthetic process, which facilitates the chain reaction of chemomechanical failure. Herein, a concept of grain welding strategy is presented to achieve densification of powder particle by introducing liquid phase sintering process, strengthening intergranular adhesion force. The designed polycrystalline NaLi0.05[Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3]0.95O2 shows dense structure attributed to the formation of eutectics which lowers the melting point with fast mass transfer. The Li doping also well manipulates the interlayer properties in unit cell, suppressing the high&#8208;voltage phase transition. Multiple characterizations like cross&#8208;sectional images and synchrotron&#8208;based full&#8208;field transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy confirm that the modified material suppresses the generation of microcracks during electrochemical cycles, impeding the chemomechanical breakdown. Consequently, it shows advanced capacity of 152.8 mAh g&#8722;1, excellent fast charging capability (121.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;C, 12&#160;min), as well as long&#8208;life of 1000 cycles.

         <title>Frontal Polymerization&#8208;Enabled 3D Printing of Recyclable High&#8208;Performance Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a closed &#8208; loop manufacturing process integrating 3D printing and frontal polymerization to produce high &#8208; performance, fully recyclable carbon fiber composites. The method enables in &#8208; situ curing within seconds, drastically reducing energy consumption. These acid &#8208; degradable resins offer tensile strengths exceeding 800 MPa, while recovered fibers retain 95% of their properties, paving the way for sustainable thermoset composites.








Abstract
Thermoset composites often face a challenging trade&#8208;off between recyclability and high performance. In this study, an innovative closed&#8208;loop manufacturing approach that integrates frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) with 3D printing to produce fully recyclable carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced polymers (c&#8208;CFRPs) is presented. A self&#8208;propagating FROMP&#8208;enabled direct ink writing (DIW) printing technology is developed, enabling in situ curing within seconds. This breakthrough eliminates the need for post&#8208;processing and reduces energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional autoclave methods. By copolymerizing dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) with a commercial spiroacetal monomer&#160;(&#8804;3&#160;wt.%), acid&#8208;degradable resins that retain the tensile strength of conventional thermosets are introduced&#160;while allowing for matrix depolymerization under mild conditions. The DCPD&#8208;based c&#8208;CFRPs demonstrate remarkable tensile strengths of up to 817&#160;MPa and glass transition temperatures exceeding 160&#160;&#176;C. In a significant advancement, the recovered carbon fibers retain their pristine morphology and over 95% of their original mechanical properties, enabling repeated recycling without performance loss. Additionally, recovered oligomers can be repolymerized into new resins, further enhancing sustainability. This work presents a groundbreaking solution for high&#8208;performance composite manufacturing, addressing critical energy and waste challenges in the thermoset industry.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Design and Discovery of High&#8208;Performance Cyanine&#8208;Based Photosensitizers for Integrated Theranostic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted framework integrating quantum&#8208;chemical and RDKit descriptors enables accurate prediction and two&#8208;stage screening of cyanine&#8208;based photosensitizers. This strategy bridges computation and experiment, efficiently identifying and synthesizing high&#8208;performance theranostic agents with superior singlet oxygen generation and fluorescence properties, providing a rational and generalizable path toward next&#8208;generation PDT photosensitizer design.








Abstract
Cyanine&#8208;based photosensitizers are attractive for photodynamic therapy (PDT) owing to their excellent near&#8208;infrared absorption and fluorescence. However, the low singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;) and structural optimization challenges hinder their further development. In this study, a machine learning (ML)&#8208;assisted molecular design framework based on the currently available dataset of cyanine molecules is provided. By integrating RDKit structural descriptors with quantum chemical descriptors, hybrid feature&#8208;based predictive models that accurately predict the &#934;&#916; and fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F) of cyanine derivatives (R2 &gt;0.9) have been constructed for the first time. Based on this, a two&#8208;stage virtual screening strategy is developed to efficiently identify promising cyanine derivatives from a library of 2835 candidate structures. Three representative molecules are synthesized as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept validation, confirming the predictive reliability and practical utility of the ML&#8208;guided workflow. The lead compound 1775 exhibits the highest performance (&#934;&#916; = 0.62) and performs well in cellular assays, supporting the robustness and applicability of the ML&#8208;assisted screening strategy in guiding experimental validation. This work establishes a data&#8208;driven paradigm bridging molecular modeling and experimental verification, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for the rational design and rapid evaluation of high&#8208;performance cyanine&#8208;based theranostic agents.

         <title>Akkermansia Muciniphila&#8208;Inspired Oral siRNA Delivery by Active Matrix&#8208;Penetration and Intracellular Endoplasmic Reticulum Accumulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural oral nucleic acid delivery system inspired by Akkermansia muciniphila is developed, which efficiently penetrates the intestinal mucus by degrading mucins and targets the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via Golgi apparatus&#8211;ER transport. This enables effective PD&#8208;L1 silencing and immune checkpoint blockade therapy for colorectal cancer.









Abstract
Oral delivery of small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)&#160;is highly challenging due to the multiple barriers present in the gastrointestinal tract and within cells. Herein, inspired by intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila, the use of Akkermansia muciniphila membrane vesicles (AMVs) is introduced as an effective tool for oral delivery of siRNA. It is revealed that, distinct from common passive mucus&#8208;penetrating nanoparticles, AMVs enable active mucus penetration by degrading intestinal mucins, thereby enhancing their ability to traverse the intestinal barrier by approximately 4.6 times. Additionally, AMVs can markedly heighten siRNA penetration into tumor tissues. Once inside tumor cells, AMVs bypass the traditional endosomal&#8208;lysosomal degradation pathway typical of lipid&#8208;based delivery systems. Instead, they utilize a rapid transport expressway from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), facilitating the accumulation of siRNA within the ER and thereby markedly enhancing gene silencing efficiency. In a mouse model of colorectal cancer, this formulation effectively inhibits tumor growth by 91.6%, and it exhibits a favorable biosafety profile. Overall, this research unveils a unique and promising bioinspired platform for oral siRNA delivery, advancing the development of safe and efficient oral nucleic acid therapeutics.

         <title>Bioinspired Janus Spider&#8208;Web Nanofibrous Membranes Integrating Triboelectric Energy Harvesting, Adaptive Thermo&#8208;Moisture Regulation, and Bactericidal Activity for Multifunctional Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;web&#8208;inspired Janus ferroelectric nanofibrous membrane integrates asymmetric wettability, high porosity, and robust flexibility. The membrane achieves self&#8208;powered thermo&#8208;moisture regulation, enhanced water transport, and antibacterial protection, demonstrating stable triboelectric output and multifunctional adaptability for wearable electronics, healthcare monitoring, and smart protective textiles.








Abstract
The development of multifunctional membranes integrating asymmetric wettability, breathable waterproofing, antibacterial activity, and energy&#8208;harvesting capabilities is critical for smart textiles and medical protective equipment, yet balancing robustness, environmental adaptability, and energy conversion efficiency remains challenging. Here, we engineer a bioinspired Janus nanofibrous membrane with a spider&#8208;web&#8208;like hierarchical architecture via synchronous electrospinning&#8208;electrospraying of poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and polyamide 6 (PA6). This design achieves dual&#8208;scale wettability (hydrophobic/hydrophilic asymmetry), 83.6% porosity, and mechanical durability (99% structural integrity after 2000 bends). It enables intelligent environmental regulation (7.4 &#8451; thermal gradient under 1 kW/m&#178; solar irradiation), while the electric&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced design accelerates water transport by 20% vs. passive diffusion. Its triboelectric performance surpasses existing breathable membranes (177.5 V open&#8208;circuit voltage, 0.63 W/m2 power density, stable output over 10,000 cycles), enabling encrypted Morse&#8208;code communication for programmable human&#8208;machine interaction. The hierarchical structure exhibits exceptional antibacterial efficacy: 99.92% against Escherichia coli (E. coli), 100% against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and 95% against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Via a scalable, low&#8208;cost process compatible with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing, this approach holds promise for industrial integration in next&#8208;generation wearable healthcare and protection systems.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Rivalling Large&#8208;Area Flexible Broadband Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive large&#8208;area flexible organic photodetector, based on a cyano&#8208;substituted electron acceptor, has been obtained. It is fully comparable to the commercially available silicon photodiodes in multiple aspects, including detection range, responsivity, and detectivity. The demonstration of various applications in different scenarios and the development of large&#8208;area flexible devices highlight the unique advantages and commercialization prospects of the organic photodetectors. 








Abstract
Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have demonstrated significant advantages as a promising next&#8208;generation photodetection technology, especially for application in flexible and curved image sensing. However, there is still a big gap in device performance between OPDs and commercial silicon photodiodes, which hinders their practical application. Herein, using a novel near&#8208;infrared electron acceptor featuring acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor molecular skeleton and electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;substituted terminal groups, the study reports an OPD that can fully compete with the commercial silicon photodiodes. Benefiting from the strong electron push&#8208;pull effect and large molecular dipole moment, the OPD exhibits a broad detection range from 300 to 1100&#160;nm and a peak external quantum efficiency of 70% at 940&#160;nm. Moreover, owing to the reduced energetic disorder and trap density, the OPD exhibits a picoampere&#8208;level dark current density (1.30 &#215; 10&#8722;10 A cm&#8722;2) at &#8211;0.1&#160;V bias. Such high responsivity and low dark current density endow the OPD with a detectivity surpassing 1013 Jones across the whole spectral range. More importantly, this superior photodetection performance can be maintained in large&#8208;area flexible device (80 mm2). These results demonstrate the huge potential of OPDs in addressing the limitations of silicon photodiodes for application in flexible and wearable electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Concentration Antibody Formulation via Solvent&#8208;Based Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous solid antibodies are encapsulated into hydrogel microparticles through a solvent&#8208;based dehydration process. The solvent extracts water from antibody solution droplets, causing the antibody to concentrate, and precipitation of the antibody into amorphous solid is induced. The particles are resuspended into aqueous solution in which they are injectable for subcutaneous delivery at high concentrations.








Abstract
Although subcutaneous (SC) delivery is the preferred administration route for immunotherapies and other biologics for improved patient compliance and lower healthcare costs, it necessitates high&#8208;concentration antibody formulations. However, high&#8208;concentration antibody solutions face significant instabilities and prohibitively high viscosities. Other approaches for high&#8208;concentration formulations have been developed, including non&#8208;aqueous solutions, which can be irritating or painful, and antibody&#8208;laden hydrogel microparticles, which require centrifugation and are limited to concentrations &lt;300 mg&#160;mL&#8722;1. This work presents a new formulation process wherein the antibody is concentrated and encapsulated into hydrogel microparticles via solvent&#8208;based dehydration. The final dosage form is an aqueous particle suspension with a formulation concentration of 360 mg&#160;mL&#8722;1. In this process, microparticles are synthesized continuously, and antibody precipitation is realized simultaneously to dehydration, which allows for higher antibody concentrations. Antibody phase behavior and precipitation&#8211;dehydration kinetics are analyzed. The antibody is structurally and functionally stable in the microparticle post&#8208;processing and after 4 months. Injectability of the suspension meets clinical standards with glide force &lt;20 N. For the first time, an aqueous antibody formulation at high concentrations comparable to non&#8208;aqueous formulations is presented, ideal for subcutaneous administration. The process is envisioned to be generalizable as a platform for SC delivery in multiple clinical&#160;applications.

         <title>Ambient&#8208;Stable NIR Nanolasing: Monolithic Integration of PbS CQDs on a Silicon Photonic Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared nanolaser is experimentally demonstrated using a high&#8208;Q cavity and Zn&#8208;doped PbS cQDs. The cavity design, cQD performance, and device behavior under fs/ps pumping are systematically studied, achieving the lowest threshold and narrowest linewidth for NIR nanolasers under fs excitation. CW pumping reveals cavity&#8208;enhanced emission across E, S, C, and L telecommunication bands, exhibiting excellent thermal and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Nanolasers based on colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), while transformative in the visible spectrum, face critical roadblocks in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regime due to material instability under ambient conditions and ultrafast Auger recombination in large NIR CQDs. Here, these limitations are addressed through zinc&#8208;doped PbS CQDs that suppress nonradiative decay, integrated with compact high&#8208;Q silicon nanobeam cavities to leverage the Purcell effect for efficiently guiding spontaneous emission into laser modes, thereby significantly reducing the threshold power. This work demonstrates a monolithic CQD&#8208;integrated silicon photonic platform that achieves NIR lasing under pulsed optical pumping, featuring a record narrow linewidth of 0.29 nm (0.15 meV) at 1579.20 nm and an ultralow threshold of 127 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. Notably, under continuous&#8208;wave (CW) pumping, the device exhibits cavity&#8208;filtered spontaneous emission with a sub&#8208;nanometer linewidth across the 1350&#8211;1600 nm spectrum. This emission showcases &lt;6% peak power decay over 15 h at 300 K, robust performance up to 360 K, and negligible degradation after 250 days of ambient storage. By monolithically integrating solution&#8208;processed CQDs with CMOS&#8208;compatible silicon photonics, this platform establishes a reliable, scalable, and low&#8208;cost route toward multiwavelength on&#8208;chip nanolaser arrays in the NIR regime, unlocking transformative potential for compact photonic technologies in imaging, sensing, and communications.

         <title>Thermodynamically Self&#8208;Limiting Presodiation Inducing Homogeneous Inorganic&#8211;Organic Polymer&#8208;Skeleton Interphases for Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>

A thermodynamically self&#8208;limiting chemical presodiation is proposed by synergistically integrating sodium diphenyl ketone (Na&#8208;DK) with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), which is applicable to diverse cathodes, offering a practical route to advance sodium&#8208;ion battery technologies.








Abstract
Cathode&#8208;side chemical presodiation is a promising route to compensate for initial sodium loss in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, conventional presodiated cathodes are prone to oversodiation, structural degradation, and consequent cycling instability under excessive thermodynamic impetus, necessitating stringent control over presodiation duration and thereby limiting their universality and practicality. Here, a universal and thermodynamically self&#8208;limiting chemical presodiation is proposed by synergistically integrating sodium diphenyl ketone (Na&#8208;DK) with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Specifically, Na&#8208;DK enables controllable and self&#8208;limiting sodium insertion beyond the stability potential threshold of presodiated cathodes due to diminishing thermodynamic driving force, effectively preventing oversodiation while eliminating the requirement for strict presodiation time control. Simultaneously, Na&#8208;DK initiates a radical&#8208;mediated decomposition of FEC to form homogeneous inorganic&#8211;organic polymer&#8208;skeleton cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphases (CEIs) with enhanced mechanical robustness, surpassing conventional PVDF&#8208;derived heterogeneous inorganic&#8208;rich CEIs. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments confirm that when applied to the widely used Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, this strategy delivers exceptional cycling stability, retaining 93.5% capacity after 2000 cycles (4000 h) at 1 C and 92.3% after 5000 cycles at 10 C, among the best performances. Full cells exhibit over twofold capacity enhancement and markedly extended cycle life compared to commercial counterparts. More importantly, this strategy is successfully extended to other cathode chemistries (e.g., Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7), demonstrating its broad applicability.

         <title>Selective Growth of Ferroelectric Ultrathin Nonlayered &#947;&#8208;In2Se3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precursor&#8208;guided CVD method is developed to selectively grow ultrathin &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 crystals with a nonlayered, vacancy&#8208;ordered screw form structure. &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;phase In2Se3 are synthesized using different precursors. Ex situ STEM reveals a &#947;&#8208;In2Se3&#8208;to&#8208;InSe phase transition at 600&#160;&#176;C, highlighting the potential of &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 for next&#8208;generation polytypes&#8208;dependent nanoelectromechanical and memory devices.








Abstract
Indium selenide (In2Se3) has received increasing interest due to its diverse polytypes and associated polytype&#8208;dependent ferroelectric properties, making it one of the promising platforms guiding the development of ultrathin ferroelectric nanodevices. To date, &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#946;'&#8208;phase In2Se3 have been well studied, but nonlayered &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 remains underexplored because of sophisticated formation paths and minor energy differences with other phases. Therefore, understanding the growth mechanisms and electronic structures of &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 is crucial to present the full roadmap of the InxSey family. Herein, a precursor&#8208;guided chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is proposed to selectively grow ultrathin &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 crystals with a nonlayered, vacancy&#8208;ordered screw form (VOSF) structure. The sublimation temperature of precursors plays a critical role in selectively synthesizing &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;phase In2Se3 using different precursors (In2Se3, In2O3, InCl3). Ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveals a &#947;&#8208;In2Se3&#8208;to&#8208;InSe phase transition at 600&#160;&#176;C, consecutively triggered by interlayer bonds broken, vacancy reorganization and removal of Se atoms. Away from existing literature, only out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity in &#947;&#8208;In2Se3, driven by vertical off&#8208;center displacements of Se atoms, is detected. Therefore, a full spectrum of In2Se3&#8217;s polytypes, particularly nonlayered ferroelectric &#947;&#8208;In2Se3, is selectively obtained, presenting great potential for next&#8208;generation In2Se3&#8208;based polytypes&#8208;dependent nanoelectromechanical and memory devices.

         <title>Flow&#8208;Regime&#8208;Controlled Fabrication of CNT&#8208;Bridged Vertically Aligned rGO/MXene Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Fiber Supercapacitors</title>

         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;bridged vertically aligned reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/MXene fibers (CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMFs) are fabricated by flow&#8208;driven wet spinning strategy with precisely regulated flow regimes. The vertical aligned 2D nanosheets are interconnected by CNT, forming continuous conductive networks for fluent ion accumulation and fast electron transfer, thereby significantly enhancing the energy storage performance.








Abstract
The directional construction of electrode frameworks aligned with the transport pathways of ions/electron is critical for electrochemical processes. However, conventional fabrication strategies suffer from bottlenecks such as complex processes, and difficulty in scaling up production. In this work, a flow&#8208;driven wet&#8208;spinning strategy is developed to fabricate carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;bridged vertically aligned reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/MXene fibers (CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMFs). Enabled by precisely regulating of flow regimes, the vertical aligned rGO/MXene nanosheets and CNT&#8208;bridged structure collaboratively establish open porous channels for rapid ion transport, continuous conductive networks for efficient electron transfer, and abundant accessible active sites for enhanced charge storage. Consequently, the CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMF electrode exhibits improved ion transport, exceptional specific capacitance (740 F g&#8722;1), and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability (98% retention after 30&#160;000 cycles) in H2SO4 electrolyte. The assembled flexible asymmetric supercapacitor achieves a remarkable energy density of 224&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (at 1200&#160;W kg&#8722;1) while maintaining robust mechanical flexibility.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Targeting Co&#8208;Delivery of T&#8208;Cell Antigen and Camptothecin Guided by Cascade&#8208;Responsive Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly to Reshape Tumor Antigenicity for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade&#8208;responsive peptide self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed for co&#8208;delivering camptothecin and T&#8208;cell antigen to tumors. The approach successfully reshapes tumor antigenicity by efficiently endowing tumor cells with exogenous peptide antigens through the intracellular class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC&#8208;I)&#8208;associated antigen presentation pathway. When combined with the adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells and immune checkpoint blockade, our strategy effectively inhibits tumor growth.








Abstract
Antigen presentation deficiency restricted by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC&#8208;I) causes low antigenicity and antigen escape in tumors, thereby limiting T&#8208;cell immunotherapy outcomes. Here, a combined tumor immunotherapy is developed, in which tumors can present exogenous non&#8208;tumor antigens, and adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells specific for these antigens are re&#8208;targeted to attack tumors. The approach leverages a cascade&#8208;responsive peptide self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;deliver suitable antigens and the chemotherapeutic drug camptothecin (CPT) to tumors. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, to re&#8208;target ovalbumin (OVA)&#8208;specific OT&#8208;I CD8+ T cells against tumors, PSA (Nap&#8208;GFFpYE&#8208;ss&#8208;Ag) and CPSA (CPT&#8208;GFFpYE&#8208;ss&#8208;Ag) are constructed, containing an OVA&#8208;derived epitope OVA257&#8208;264 and/or CPT. The design enables the release of a unique N&#8208;terminal extended OVA257&#8208;264 and CPT into the cytosol. As a result, the extended antigen is efficiently presented on the tumor surface by MHC&#8208;I, and CPT further enhances this presentation. When combined with adoptively transferred OT&#8208;I CD8+ T cells, the approach effectively facilitates CD8+ T cell infiltration and tumor inhibition. Additionally, CPSA treatment sensitizes immune responses to programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) blockade, allowing the approach to synergize with an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody for improved tumor eradication.

As a proof-of-concept, to re-target ovalbumin (OVA)-specific OT-I CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells against tumors, PSA (Nap-GFFpYE-ss-Ag) and CPSA (CPT-GFFpYE-ss-Ag) are constructed, containing an OVA-derived epitope OVA&lt;sub&gt;257-264&lt;/sub&gt; and/or CPT. The design enables the release of a unique N-terminal extended OVA&lt;sub&gt;257-264&lt;/sub&gt; and CPT into the cytosol. As a result, the extended antigen is efficiently presented on the tumor surface by MHC-I, and CPT further enhances this presentation. When combined with adoptively transferred OT-I CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, the approach effectively facilitates CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell infiltration and tumor inhibition. Additionally, CPSA treatment sensitizes immune responses to programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade, allowing the approach to synergize with an anti-PD-L1 antibody for improved tumor eradication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three&#8208;Phase Interfacial Force Regulated Solid&#8208;Like Liquid&#8208;Slider for Highly Efficient and Robust Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;like liquid&#8208;slider triboelectric nanogenerator is proposed, which enables stable operation of patterned liquid as the tilt angle varies from horizontal to vertical by regulating three&#8208;phase interfacial forces, demonstrating remarkable long&#8208;term durability and a record&#8208;high energy conversion efficiency of 63.47%.








Abstract
Conventional sliding mode triboelectric nanogenerators convert low&#8208;frequency mechanical energy into electricity through relative motion between solid&#8208;solid tribo&#8208;layers. However, the inherent trade&#8208;off between maintaining close contact and mitigating interfacial friction hinders the device's energy conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Here, a solid&#8208;like liquid&#8208;slider triboelectric nanogenerator (LS&#8208;TENG) is proposed, where milliliter&#8208;scale liquid motion is precisely governed by a liquid&#8208;driver consisting of a hydrophilic interface enclosed by a hydrophobic boundary. By theoretical analysis and experimental regulation of solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas three&#8208;phase interfacial forces, stable operation of the liquid&#8208;slider with a designed pattern is realized as the tilt angle varies from horizontal to vertical. Benefiting from the shape&#8208;adaptivity and ultra&#8208;smooth properties of the liquid, a palm&#8208;sized LS&#8208;TENG outputs 2856 &#181;J of energy per cycle with an average torque of just 0.73 mN&#183;m at 30&#160;rpm, achieving a record&#8208;high energy conversion efficiency of 63.47%. The optimized friction during solid&#8208;liquid dynamic interactions ensures the excellent stability of LS&#8208;TENG over six months of continuous operation. Moreover, the encapsulated LS&#8208;TENG autonomously initiates under a 1.3 m&#160;s&#8722;1 breeze, powering 960 series&#8208;connected green LEDs and enabling wireless wind speed monitoring. The regulation of three&#8208;phase interfacial forces in solid&#8208;liquid TENG provides a feasible path for efficient and reliable mechanical energy harvesting.

         <title>Multiply Nano&#8208;Twinned Copper as a &#8220;Dual&#8208;Site Cooperative&#8221; Catalyst for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study prepares Multiply Nano&#8208;Twinned Copper (MNTs&#8208;Cu) via a &#8220;dual nonequilibrium&#8221; strategy. As a &#8220;dual&#8208;site cooperative&#8221; catalyst, it enhances NIRR performance, achieving a high NH3 yield of 112.03&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.7&#160;V vs RHE, and notably, it can continuously maintain a high FENH3 of &gt;99% within the high potential range, offering insights for H*&#8208;involved reactions.








Abstract
To advance the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NIRR) to ammonia, it is essential to rationally regulate the kinetics of active hydrogen (H*). Nevertheless, an in&#8208;depth understanding of H* generation, transfer, and utilization remains elusive, which impedes exploring strategies for optimizing H* dynamics. In this study, a copper nanocrystalline is developed with a multiply nano&#8208;twinned structure (MNTs&#8208;Cu) using a &#8220;dual nonequilibrium&#8221; strategy to optimize H* dynamics and enhance NIRR performance. Experimental and theoretical studies show that MNTs&#8208;Cu functions as a &#8220;dual&#8208;site cooperative&#8221; catalyst, addressing the H* supply&#8208;consumption balance to boost ammonia electrosynthesis. Specifically, the Cu sites are responsible for the activation of nitrate, while the nano&#8208;twinned structure serves as an &#8220;active hydrogen hub&#8221; to facilitate the generation, transfer, and utilization of H*. The MNTs&#8208;Cu catalyst achieves a high NH3 yield of 112.03&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.7&#160;V vs RHE, and notably, it can continuously maintain a high FENH3 of &gt;99% within the high potential range from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;0.9&#160;V vs RHE. This work provides a novel pathway for optimizing H* behavior through structural engineering, offering insights for advancing NIRR and other hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Programmable Photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Triggered by a Temperature&#8208;Adaptation Spin Polarization Electron Pump</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a temperature&#8208;adaptation spin polarization electron pump that enables directional electron transfer and suppresses charge recombination. The injected spin polarization electrons stabilize CO* intermediates and promote their hydrogenation toward CH4, achieving reversible product selectivity and enhanced CO2 photoreduction efficiency.








Abstract
Selective control of CO2 photoreduction toward CO or CH4 is essential for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion. Reversible switching between these two products remains challenging because conventional photocatalysts cannot adjust charge behavior with temperature, and polar intermediates are insufficiently stabilized. A temperature&#8208;adaptation photocatalytic platform that acts as a spin polarization electron pump, delivering programmable interfacial electron injection and dynamically steering CO2 reduction pathways in real time is reported. At low temperature, adaptive modulation increases interfacial electron accumulation at the reaction interface, extending the lifetime and reactivity of deep&#8208;pathway intermediates without altering catalyst composition. Consequently, product selectivity reversibly shifts from CO at high temperature to CH4 at low temperature, enabling controlled access to either shallow or deep reduction products under reliably well&#8208;defined thermal conditions. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance demonstrate enhanced spin polarization and reduced charge recombination upon cooling, consistent with stronger interfacial electron retention. In situ infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics reveal that spin polarization&#8208;selective transfer bends CO2 and induces C&#9472;O bond asymmetry, which facilitates CHO* formation and lowers the barrier for CO* hydrogenation to CH4. Collectively, these findings establish a generalizable strategy that integrates spin polarization with temperature responsiveness to realize dynamically programmable product selectivity in solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion.

         <title>Mass Diffusion&#8208;Dominated Phase Separation Enabling On&#8208;Demand and Repeatable Lifetime Programming of Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Polymer Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) polymer hydrogels with programmable lifetimes are designed via mass diffusion&#8208;dominated phase separation. Their lifetimes are tunable from 9.1 to 130.8 ms by varying heating time (0&#8211;60 min), and repeatable RTP is achieved under heating/cooling cycles. These hydrogels serve as rewritable spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting platforms for time&#8208;dependent information display.








Abstract
Current luminescent polymer hydrogels rely primarily on tunable emission intensities/colors. Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) hydrogels with on&#8208;demand programmable lifetimes, albeit long envisaged, have never been achieved, but such RTP hydrogels will provide another lifetime dimension to enrich the family of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials for broadening their emerging applications. Herein, the mass diffusion&#8208;dominated phase separation strategy is proposed to develop the first RTP polymer hydrogels, whose lifetime can be continuously programmed from 9.1 to 130.8&#160;ms. Upon heating at 90 &#176;C, cooperative coordination and hydrophobic interactions in hydrogels induce a dense/sparse polymer phase separation, leading to controllable rubbery&#8208;to&#8208;glassy transition with 154&#8208;fold enhancement in Young's modulus, thereby efficiently restricting molecular vibrations and stabilizing triplet excitons. Note that the hydrogels&#8217; RTP performance is essentially not controlled by heat transport but is dominated by phase&#8208;separation kinetics, therefore their lifetimes can be widely programmed by merely manipulating the heating duration. Further natural cooling at 25&#160;&#176;C makes polymer phase re&#8208;fusion to recover the rubbery state, enabling the repeatable RTP lifetime programming. Based on these findings, rewritable spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved information decryption platform with time&#8208;dependent security is demonstrated. This study opens new avenues of RTP hydrogels by demonstrating the unprecedented lifetime&#8208;programming capacity and enriches the intelligence of luminescent materials.

Their lifetimes are tunable from 9.1 to 130.8 ms by varying heating time (0&#8211;60 min), and repeatable RTP is achieved under heating/cooling cycles. These hydrogels serve as rewritable spatiotemporal-resolved anti-counterfeiting platforms for time-dependent information display.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current luminescent polymer hydrogels rely primarily on tunable emission intensities/colors. Room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) hydrogels with on-demand programmable lifetimes, albeit long envisaged, have never been achieved, but such RTP hydrogels will provide another lifetime dimension to enrich the family of stimuli-responsive materials for broadening their emerging applications. Herein, the mass diffusion-dominated phase separation strategy is proposed to develop the first RTP polymer hydrogels, whose lifetime can be continuously programmed from 9.1 to 130.8&#160;ms. Upon heating at 90 &#176;C, cooperative coordination and hydrophobic interactions in hydrogels induce a dense/sparse polymer phase separation, leading to controllable rubbery-to-glassy transition with 154-fold enhancement in Young's modulus, thereby efficiently restricting molecular vibrations and stabilizing triplet excitons. Note that the hydrogels&#8217; RTP performance is essentially not controlled by heat transport but is dominated by phase-separation kinetics, therefore their lifetimes can be widely programmed by merely manipulating the heating duration. Further natural cooling at 25&#160;&#176;C makes polymer phase re-fusion to recover the rubbery state, enabling the repeatable RTP lifetime programming. Based on these findings, rewritable spatiotemporal-resolved information decryption platform with time-dependent security is demonstrated. This study opens new avenues of RTP hydrogels by demonstrating the unprecedented lifetime-programming capacity and enriches the intelligence of luminescent materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unique Dual&#8208;Affinity Strategy for Specific Lipopolysaccharide Clearance in Sepsis Therapy: Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Molecularly Imprinted Polymers via Emulsion Interfacial Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of achieving specific LPS clearance in sepsis, a dual&#8208;affinity adsorbent (PS@PA&#8208;PHK+) is developed that converges the high binding affinity of peptides with the shape&#8208;selective recognition capability of molecularly imprinted polymers. PS@PA&#8208;PHK+ demonstrates high specificity, broad&#8208;spectrum selectivity toward diverse LPS types, and strong adsorption capacity, representing the key features of a new generation of hemoperfusion materials.








Abstract
Sepsis is an infection&#8208;induced organ dysfunction with high global morbidity and mortality. Specific clearance of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), key pathological drivers in sepsis, from the bloodstream is critical for effective therapy. However, selective capture of LPS is challenging due to their structural heterogeneity, extremely low concentrations (ng&#183;mL&#8722;1), and complexity of blood components. Here, a novel dual&#8208;affinity strategy is presented for designing high&#8208;specificity LPS adsorbents. Leveraging phage display, a high&#8208;affinity peptide ligand (P&#8208;HK) targeting the LPS family is identified by screening against their conserved Kdo2&#8208;Lipid A structure. Concurrently, delicate molecularly imprinted polymers (PS@PA+) with geometrically matched cavities are synthesized via emulsion interfacial polymerization, exploiting the oriented assembly of amphiphilic LPS templates at oil&#8208;water interfaces. Conjugation of the imprinted polymers with the peptide ligand produced PS@PA&#8208;PHK+, which exhibits highly specific LPS binding and demonstrates exceptional performance, including remarkable E. coli LPS clearance efficiency (99.2% in buffer; 95.4% in blood), high adsorption capacity (543 EU&#183;mg&#8722;1), broad&#8208;spectrum clearance of diverse bacterial LPSs, robust anti&#8208;fouling properties, and satisfactory biocompatibility. Furthermore, PS@PA&#8208;PHK+&#8208;based hemoperfusion in a septic rabbit model confirmed significant therapeutic efficacy, remarkably reducing circulating LPS levels and mitigating organ damage. This material design overcomes the challenge of specific LPS clearance, offering substantial promise for transformative sepsis therapy.

         <title>Integrated Hollow Microfibers of Covalent Organic Framework on Cu Foil as a Gradient Zn Metal Anode Host for Bottom&#8208;Up Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated hollow microfibers of covalent organic framework on Cu foil (HMCOF&#8208;Cu) is designed as a gradient host for Zn metal anode. Owing to the carbonyl groups in the surface HMCOF layer and hierarchical pores, the HMCOF&#8208;Cu host presents rapid desolvation of hydrated Zn2+, fast Zn2+ ions diffusion and reduced volume change for bottom&#8208;up Zn deposition without dendrite.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn metal batteries are promising choices for future grid&#8208;scale energy storage because of cost&#8208;effectiveness, high&#8208;rate performance and safety. Nonetheless, the sluggish desolvation of hydrated Zn2+ ions usually leads to uncontrolled Zn dendrite growth and detrimental side reactions on Zn metal anodes (ZMAs). Herein, we report the formation of integrated hollow microfibers of covalent organic frameworks on Cu foil (denoted as HMCOF&#8208;Cu) as a ZMA host with gradient design. Of note, interactions between carbonyl groups of HMCOF and H2O in [Zn(H2O)6]2+ promote rapid desolvation of hydrated Zn2+. Besides, 3D&#160;HMCOF network can accelerate Zn2+ diffusion and accommodate the volumetric deformation during the deposition/stripping cycles. Moreover, the gradient design can induce bottom&#8208;up deposition for dendrite&#8208;free ZMA. As a result, the HMCOF&#8208;Cu host enables stable Zn plating/stripping processes over 2500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full cell based on HMCOF&#8208;Cu@Zn anode presents a long&#8208;term stability over 7000 cycles at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Dual&#8208;B&#8208;Site Strategy Underpins Stable Unimodal Deep&#8208;Blue Emitting Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;B&#8208;Site strategy is innovatively proposed to underpin stable unimodal deep&#8208;blue perovskite emission. The new approach suppresses phase segregation and eliminates green emission in blue perovskite emitters by controlling energy transfer dynamics. This study provides the first mechanistic explanation of this process and offers a universal design rule to prevent spectral instability in single&#8208;halide blue perovskite emitters.








Abstract
The operational stability of mixed&#8208;halide blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is fundamentally constrained by intrinsic halide ion migration. Employing single&#8208;halide perovskite systems represents a viable route to circumvent this issue, yet solution&#8208;processed pure&#8208;bromide perovskites typically exhibit undesirable green emission, impeding attainment of high&#8208;color&#8208;purity blue electroluminescence. Herein, this challenge is addressed through the strategic incorporation of Mg2+ into the B&#8208;site of the pure bromine&#8208;based perovskite lattice. This substitution induces a substantial spectral blueshift and promotes phase homogenization by facilitating efficient energy transfer from small&#8208;n to large&#8208;n phases. Notably, the first systematic investigation and mechanistic elucidation of the origin of bimodal emission in blue PeLEDs is presented. Consequently, the champion PeLED delivers stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 464&#160;nm with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 4.76%. This study presents a definitive paradigm for achieving spectrally stable and efficient deep&#8208;blue emission from single&#8208;halide perovskites. The elucidated mechanism underlying emission bimodality provides critical guidance for future development of blue PeLEDs.

         <title>Dual Vacancy&#8208;Driven &#8220;Lattice Softening&#8221; NiFeAlx LDHs for High&#8208;Rate and Durable Chloride Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a mild room&#8208;temperature etching strategy, rational construction of dual&#8208;vacancy domains and multidimensional ion pathways is realized in NiFeAlx layered double hydroxide cathodes. The vacancy&#8208;rich, lattice&#8208;softened framework enables elastic strain accommodation and rapid Cl&#8722; diffusion, delivering unprecedented cycling stability and high&#8208;rate performance beyond previously reported chloride&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Defect engineering becomes an essential strategy for enhancing electrochemical performance, yet its application in anion&#8208;based systems such as chloride&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) remains largely unexplored. Herein, a rational defect&#8208;engineering strategy is developed to overcome these bottlenecks by constructing dual&#8208;vacancy NiFeAlx layered double hydroxides (LDHs) featuring coexisting cationic and oxygen vacancies, achieved via a room&#8208;temperature alkaline etching process that selectively leaches Al3+ while retaining layered integrity. The optimized NiFeAl0.04&#8208;24h&#8208;Cl LDH exhibits unprecedented &#8220;lattice softening&#8221; behavior, enabling elastic deformation and dynamic structural reconstruction to accommodate volumetric fluctuations during Cl&#8208;intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. Benefiting from this defect&#8208;induced structural flexibility, the electrode delivers a high reversible capacity of 101.4 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, along with the Coulombic efficiency of 99.91%. Multiscale mechanistic analyses demonstrate that the coupled vacancies regulate local electronic distribution and coordination environments while simultaneously imparting pronounced lattice softening and structural elasticity to the NiFeAl0.04&#8208;24h&#8208;Cl LDH, thereby facilitating enhanced Cl&#8722; ion accommodation. Furthermore, the vacancies construct interconnected 3D ion highways, which dramatically accelerate Cl&#8722; diffusion, enhance interfacial adsorption kinetics, and minimize charge&#8208;transfer resistance. Such lattice&#8208;adaptive regulation resolves the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between anion&#8208;storage capacity and structural stability in LDH&#8208;based systems, offering a promising strategy for designing efficient anion&#8208;hosting electrodes for advanced CIB systems.

&lt;p&gt;Through a mild room-temperature etching strategy, rational construction of dual-vacancy domains and multidimensional ion pathways is realized in NiFeAl&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; layered double hydroxide cathodes. The vacancy-rich, lattice-softened framework enables elastic strain accommodation and rapid Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion, delivering unprecedented cycling stability and high-rate performance beyond previously reported chloride-ion batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defect engineering becomes an essential strategy for enhancing electrochemical performance, yet its application in anion-based systems such as chloride-ion batteries (CIBs) remains largely unexplored. Herein, a rational defect-engineering strategy is developed to overcome these bottlenecks by constructing dual-vacancy NiFeAl&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; layered double hydroxides (LDHs) featuring coexisting cationic and oxygen vacancies, achieved via a room-temperature alkaline etching process that selectively leaches Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; while retaining layered integrity. The optimized NiFeAl&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;-24h-Cl LDH exhibits unprecedented &#8220;lattice softening&#8221; behavior, enabling elastic deformation and dynamic structural reconstruction to accommodate volumetric fluctuations during Cl-intercalation/de-intercalation. Benefiting from this defect-induced structural flexibility, the electrode delivers a high reversible capacity of 101.4 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 1000 cycles at 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, along with the Coulombic efficiency of 99.91%. Multiscale mechanistic analyses demonstrate that the coupled vacancies regulate local electronic distribution and coordination environments while simultaneously imparting pronounced lattice softening and structural elasticity to the NiFeAl&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;-24h-Cl LDH, thereby facilitating enhanced Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion accommodation. Furthermore, the vacancies construct interconnected 3D ion highways, which dramatically accelerate Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion, enhance interfacial adsorption kinetics, and minimize charge-transfer resistance. Such lattice-adaptive regulation resolves the long-standing trade-off between anion-storage capacity and structural stability in LDH-based systems, offering a promising strategy for designing efficient anion-hosting electrodes for advanced CIB systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling In&#8208;Plane Crystallographic Anisotropy&#8208;Dependent Memory Performance In Van Der Waals &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 Ferroelectric Semiconductor Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

This study demonstrates that the in&#8208;plane crystallographic anisotropy of the two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals ferroelectric semiconductor &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 is a critical determinant of ferroelectric switching dynamics and memory performance. Our results reveal orientation&#8208;dependent transport pathways, Schottky barrier modulation, and electrostatic potential energy that dictate polarization reversal and synaptic functionality.








Abstract
The ferroelectric semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (FeS&#8208;FETs) based on &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 emerge as promising non&#8208;volatile memory devices. However, the intrinsic in&#8208;plane (IP) crystallographic anisotropy of &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 introduces orientation dependence, leading to pronounced variations in memory performance depending on the IP alignment of the source/drain (S/D) contacts. This study presents the first demonstration of IP anisotropy&#8208;dependent ferroelectricity in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 FeS&#8208;FETs with S/D contacts aligned along the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) directions. The AC&#8208;aligned S/D configuration achieves a ferroelectric resistance switching (FRS) ratio of 6.42, an on/off current ratio of 4.53 &#215; 104, and a normalized memory window (MW) of 59 %, whereas the ZZ&#8208;aligned counterpart exhibits an FRS ratio of 1.05, an on/off ratio of 5.25, and negligible MW. The electron transports proceed through twisted pathways along the AC direction, but proceed along a straight trajectory in the ZZ direction to avoid high&#8208;energy barrier regions due to the threefold rotational symmetric lattice. Thus, the excessive electron transmission and a reduced Schottky barrier height effectively screen the influence of ferroelectric bound charges in the ZZ&#8208;aligned S/D contacts. These findings establish clear correlations between IP anisotropy and the ferroelectric functionality of &#945;&#8208;In2Se3, offering critical guidelines for the design of FeS&#8208;FETs.

         <title>Chain&#8208;Length&#8208;Selective Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Regulation via Competitive and Cooperative Pathways in Solid&#8208;State Macrocyclic Host&#8211;Guest Systems</title>

A dual&#8208;mode macrocyclic host&#8211;guest approach enables chain&#8208;length&#8208;selective modulation of solid&#8208;state charge&#8208;transfer interactions via competitive and cooperative pathways, achieving aldehyde&#8208;vapor&#8208;triggered structural reorganization, switchable vapochromic sensing, and dynamically tunable photothermal conversion efficiency in responsive organic cocrystals.








Abstract
Dynamic regulation of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions in the solid state remains a key challenge in developing responsive functional materials. Herein, a dual&#8208;mode supramolecular strategy&#8212;is reported based on competitive and cooperative host&#8211;guest interactions&#8212;for constructing dynamic macrocycle&#8208;based CT complexes with tunable optical and photothermal properties in response to aliphatic aldehyde vapors. Two pillararene&#8208;derived macrocyclic hosts, EtLP6 and EtFLP6, form disordered CT assemblies with F4TCNQ via solvent&#8208;free grinding. These CT complexes exhibit chain&#8208;length&#8208;dependent vapochromic behavior governed by distinct mechanisms: guest&#8208;triggered disassembly or reassembly of D&#8211;A structures in EtLP6&#8208;F4TCNQ&#945; (competitive regulation), and aldehyde&#8208;assisted ternary CT assembly in EtFLP6&#8208;F4TCNQ&#945; (cooperative regulation). Single&#8208;crystal structures incorporating X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and spectral analyses reveal vapor&#8208;induced structural transformations that correlate directly with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption changes. Notably, such CT&#8208;state modulation enables the first vapor&#8208;regulated organic photothermal cocrystal system, with conversion efficiency tunable from non&#8208;detectable levels to over 11% under 808&#160;nm irradiation. This work establishes a versatile framework for designing solid&#8208;state supramolecular materials with multi&#8208;responsive optical and thermal functions via macrocyclic host&#8211;guest chemistry.

         <title>Topological Structure&#8208;Induced Piezoelectricity from the &#945;&#8208;Phase Poly(Vinylidene Fluoride)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The findings reveal a meron&#8208;like topological polar structure in the ring&#8208;banded spherulites of &#945;&#8208;phase poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The symmetry breaking induced by strain&#8208;gradient twisted lamellae generates a net polarization, which accounts for the observed unprecedented piezoelectricity. The topology&#8208;induced polarization mechanism uncovered in this work offers a generalizable strategy for engineering diverse polar polymers with unprecedented polarization&#8208;dependent functionalities.








Abstract
Topologically polar structures offer a rich landscape for uncovering emergent phenomena inaccessible in traditional ferroelectric materials. In contrast to the numerous examples found in ferroelectric oxides, topological structures identified in ferroelectric polymers are extremely rare. Here, the creation of a meron&#8208;like topological polar structure is demonstrated in the non&#8208;polar &#945;&#8208;phase poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The formation of the twisted lamellae within ring&#8208;banded polymer spherulites and the resulting topological structure are revealed using combined experimental and computational methods. Non&#8208;zero polarization is demonstrated using Kelvin probe force microscopy, second harmonic generation measurement, and dielectric spectroscopy, and verify the facilitation of polarization orientation by strain in the topological &#945;&#8208;phase PVDF. Accordingly, piezoelectricity in the topological &#945;&#8208;phase PVDF is demonstrated through both direct and converse measurements and reveals a strong correlation between polarization, the piezoelectric coefficient, and the topological structure. This result offers a new perspective on creating polar topological structures and inducing formerly symmetry&#8208;forbidden properties like piezoelectricity in the non&#8208;polar phase of ferroelectric polymers.

         <title>Stopping Phase Separation Enables Durable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locking polyquaternium network strategy is proposed to suppress local electric fields that drive light&#8208;induced phase segregation. This approach enables wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite photovoltaics to achieve high efficiencies under both indoor and outdoor illumination, accompanied by extended operational stability. The findings establish a general design principle for durable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites and open new opportunities for indoor energy harvesting and integration with the Internet of Things.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced halide segregation presents a fundamental barrier to the longevity of wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, a multifunctional ionic polymer, polyquaternium&#8208;37, is reported as an effective grain boundary passivator to inhibit the degradation pathway. This dual&#8208;interaction mechanism concertedly arrests halide migration at grain boundaries, thereby suppressing local electric&#8208;field and ultimately curbing light&#8208;induced phase separation. Consequently, the modified WBG perovskites demonstrate robust photostability under light stress. The champion inverted perovskite photovoltaic device delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.86% under AM 1.5G illumination and an outstanding indoor PCE of 43.19% under 1000 lux. Remarkably, the modified device exhibits a projected T90 lifetime exceeding 10 000 h under continuous indoor light cycling.

     alt="Stopping Phase Separation Enables Durable Wide-Bandgap Photovoltaic Perovskites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dual-locking polyquaternium network strategy is proposed to suppress local electric fields that drive light-induced phase segregation. This approach enables wide-bandgap perovskite photovoltaics to achieve high efficiencies under both indoor and outdoor illumination, accompanied by extended operational stability. The findings establish a general design principle for durable wide-bandgap perovskites and open new opportunities for indoor energy harvesting and integration with the Internet of Things.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light-induced halide segregation presents a fundamental barrier to the longevity of wide-bandgap (WBG) mixed-halide perovskites. Herein, a multifunctional ionic polymer, polyquaternium-37, is reported as an effective grain boundary passivator to inhibit the degradation pathway. This dual-interaction mechanism concertedly arrests halide migration at grain boundaries, thereby suppressing local electric-field and ultimately curbing light-induced phase separation. Consequently, the modified WBG perovskites demonstrate robust photostability under light stress. The champion inverted perovskite photovoltaic device delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.86% under AM 1.5G illumination and an outstanding indoor PCE of 43.19% under 1000 lux. Remarkably, the modified device exhibits a projected &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;90&lt;/sub&gt; lifetime exceeding 10 000 h under continuous indoor light cycling. This work pioneers a facile solution to halide segregation via grain boundary engineering, paving the way for operationally stable WBG perovskite photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Close&#8208;Loop Cathode Chemistry Enables Self&#8208;Rejuvenating Aqueous Zn&#8211;Te Batteries Compromised by Non&#8208;Equilibrium Redox Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>

Triethylsulfonium iodide (TESI) inhibits Te shuttling in aqueous Zn&#8208;Te batteries through three synergistic functions. TES+ forms a protective interphase on Zn, blocking shuttling and enabling uniform plating. I&#8722; catalyzes Te redox with reduced hysteresis, while generated I3&#8722; establishes closed&#8208;loop I3&#8722;/&#8722; redox to regenerate the cathode. This enables 94.3% capacity retention after 1500 cycles with a 12&#8208;hour rest.








Abstract
Tellurium (Te) emerges as an alluring cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, boasting an unrivaled six&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer capacity (1260 mAh g&#8722;1 and 7829 mAh cm&#8722;3). However, the battery performance and cycling stability are severely degraded by inherent TeOx&#183;H2O(aq) shuttle arising from proton&#8208;tunneling&#8208;induced non&#8208;equilibrium electrochemical hydrolysis, where proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dominates. In this work, a rejuvenation of dead Zn&#8211;Te batteries is demonstrated based on a close&#8208;loop chemistry via employing organic triethylsulfonium iodide (C6H15SI, TESI). The triiodide anions (I3&#8722;) are found to reduce dissolved TeOx&#183;H2O(aq.) with thermodynamic favorability to revitalize Te cathode, meanwhile, generated I2 is recycled back into the electrolyte by reacting with iodide anions. Simply left resting for 12&#160;h, a completely degraded Zn&#8211;Te cell (1500 cycles) recovered 94.3% of its initial capacity (465 mAh g&#8722;1). Furthermore, TES+ is found to promote an anode solid electrolyte interphase via detaching ethyl. The functional layer efficaciously prevented anode passivation caused by tellurium&#8208;shuttling and facilitated efficient zinc&#8208;ion transfer to achieve dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. This loop chemistry not only extends the lifespan of batteries but also enables the reuse of materials, potentially reducing the overall cost of battery production and resource consumption.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Observation of Atom Motion and Manipulation of Structural Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controling focused electron beam irradiation on KTaO3 single crystal, not only atomic scale phase transformation from KTaO3 to K6Ta10.8O30 can be triggered along a specific crystalline direction, but also Ta atom migration process is directly observed. Moreover, the tetragonal tungsten bronze K6Ta10.8O30 formed here remains stable at ambient condition.








Abstract
Precisely controlling structural transformations is essential for realizing novel functionalities in crystal materials, as these transformations often result in significant changes in physical and chemical properties. However, such structural control at the atomic scale remains a formidable challenge. Here the direct observation and realization of atomic scale structural transformation is demonstrated from KTaO3 to K6Ta10.8O30 via high&#8208;energy electron beam manufacturing in scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), which can finally manipulate the Ta atom movements. The K and O vacancies in KTaO3 can be introduced via the knock&#8208;on energy transferred from the controled high&#8208;dose electron beams. These vacancies can further accommodate Ta atom emerging at the interstitial sites of the TaO2 plane in KTaO3. Thus, all atom species in KTaO3 can be stimulated via electron beam and the cooperative movements of them trigger the final formation of the new K6Ta10.8O30 phase. The detailed mechanisms are revealed by low&#8208;dose, in situ, atomic scale imaging under STEM. The controllability of this electron beam manufacture process and the stability of the new K6Ta10.8O30 phase is further validated. DFT calculations rationalize the triggering steps of the manufacture process and show the transformation is energetically beneficial at the condition of K and O vacancies introduced by knock&#8208;on effect. This work not only investigates the microscopic mechanism of electron beam&#8208;induced structural transformation, but also establishes a versatile pathway for synthesizing new functional materials with tailored properties.

A nanostructural refinement strategy is reported for KPHI photocatalysts using NH4Cl in a molten salt environment to induce coherent domain fragmentation and controlled cyano defect formation. This dual modification promotes n&#8594;&#960;* transitions, enhances charge separation, and accelerates ORR kinetics, yielding exceptional AQY values of 49% (410 nm) and 5% (525 nm) without cocatalysts.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven oxygen reduction on ionic carbon nitride frameworks presents a compelling strategy for sustainable hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Herein, a nanostructural engineering strategy is presented to tailor the morphology and defect chemistry of potassium poly(heptazine imide) (KPHI), enabling extended solar coverage and enhance photocatalytic performance. By incorporating NH4Cl into a molten KCl/LiCl eutectic medium, simultaneous nanoscale fragmentation of KPHI crystals and controlled introduction of cyano (&#8211;C&#8801;N) defects are achieved. These molecular modifications induce n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transitions, facilitate efficient charge separation, and accelerate oxygen reduction reaction kinetics. The optimal catalyst reaches an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 49% at 410&#160;nm and 5% at 525&#160;nm without the need for cocatalysts, among the highest values reported for metal&#8208;free photocatalyst systems. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms preferential photoexcited electron localization at &#8211;C&#8801;N sites, highlighting their key role in enhancing the charge carrier dynamics. Crucially, autogenous NH3 pressure is harnessed from NH4Cl decomposition to unlock a low&#8208;temperature (500 &#176;C) KPHI variant that delivers analogous performance to its counterpart produced at 600&#160;&#176;C, offering a more sustainable synthetic route. This study elucidates the structure&#8208;activity relationship in ionic carbon nitrides and provides a generalizable approach for controlling their morphology and defect characteristics.

         <title>Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Plasmonic WO3&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Simultaneous N2 Fixation and H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalyst is designed by combining multiple doping strategies together in WO3 nanoplates. The optimized photocatalyst exbibits enhanced light absorption, hot charge carrier generation, and N2 activation. It can produce NH3 and H2O2 simultaneously. A type of floating biphasic plasmonic photocatalytic film is further fabricated to improve the efficiency and scalability of the photocatalytic process.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis has recently received much attention in generating high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalysts are frontier materials that can effectively employ localized surface plasmon resonance to generate and utilize hot charge carriers. Herein, the development of a new type of Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic WO3&#8208;based photocatalyst through hydrogen doping, oxygen vacancy (OV) introduction, and metal doping is reported. Hydrogen doping and OV introduction broaden the light absorption range of the WO3&#8208;based photocatalyst, thereby enabling the generation of more hot charge carriers. Metal doping provides more catalytically active sites. More interestingly, both hot electrons and holes can be used to generate high&#8208;value&#8208;added products, i.e., ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. The optimal Mo&#8208;H0.23WO3&#8722;x photocatalyst exhibits excellent ammonia and hydrogen peroxide production rates of 187.53 and 196.25 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively. Furthermore, a biphasic photocatalytic system is designed to suppress light absorption by water and maximize sunlight utilization. This work expands the scope of plasmonic photocatalysts towards degenerately doped plasmonic metal oxide semiconductors and provides a new paradigm for the solar&#8208;driven generation of high&#8208;value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Afterglow from Luminescent Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active glow luminescent system for encoding, signaling, and tracking in dark environments has been developed by integrating inorganic ultralong afterglow phosphors with adaptive liquid crystal elastomer actuators. 








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent polymeric materials which combine afterglow emission with mechanical flexibility and adaptability to external stimuli are well&#8208;suited for dynamic optical devices, encoding, anticounterfeiting, and soft robotics. However, current systems rely on static matrices and organic phosphors, which limit their afterglow duration, flexibility, processability, and responsiveness to various stimuli. Here, an active glow luminescent system for encoding, signaling, and tracking in dark environments by integrating inorganic ultralong afterglow phosphors with adaptive liquid crystal elastomer actuators is demonstrated. The resulting material exhibits ultralong emission (up to 1200 s) in the dark, enabling reprogrammable information encryption and reversible scattering&#8208;to&#8208;transparent transition upon mechanical, thermal, or light stimuli, allowing for multimodal decoding. A bicolor, spatially encoded phosphorescent soft actuator is fabricated that appears plain and unmarked under daylight, but reveals structured emission in the dark while simultaneously exhibiting shape change under heat or light. Incorporation of an additional fluorescent dye further endows the system with light&#8208;environment sensitivity, enabling luminescent rolling wheels and fiber actuators capable of self&#8208;signaling and recovery tracking. This work not only demonstrates constructing active luminescent materials but also provides valuable insights toward adaptive and interactive glowing optical devices.

         <title>Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with Phonon&#8208;Enhanced Sum&#8208;Frequency Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonlinear optical microscopy technique is introduced that enables rapid imaging of hexagonal boron nitride monolayers, which are usually optically invisible. The nonlinear mixing of mid&#8208;infrared and visible laser pulses enables full crystallographic imaging through phase&#8208;resolved sum&#8208;frequency generation microscopy, where the resonant excitation of a phonon provides 800&#8208;fold enhancement.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals heterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The optical characterization of mono&#8208; and few&#8208;layer samples of hBN however, remains a challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here, phase&#8208;resolved sum&#8208;frequency microscopy is introduced as a technique for imaging monolayers of hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualizing their crystal orientation. Femtosecond mid&#8208;infrared (IR) and visible laser pulses are used for sum&#8208;frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a wide&#8208;field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN that leads to an &#8776;800&#8208;fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible to image large 100&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;&#181;m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Heterodyne detection combined with azimuthal sample rotation further provides full crystallographic information. Combined knowledge of topography and crystal orientation reveals that triangular domains of CVD&#8208;grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen&#8208;terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG microscopy is an ultra&#8208;sensitive tool with the potential to image crystal structure, strain, stacking sequences, and twist angles in a wide range of van der Waals structures, where locating and identifying monolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount importance.

         <title>Creating Favorable Pt/Co Interfaces via a Two&#8208;Step Approach for Constructing Highly Durable PtCo Intermetallic Fuel Cell Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino acid&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step approach is developed to prepare L12&#8208;Pt3Co intermetallic catalyst with an increased ordering degree for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The optimal amino acids (L&#8208;Cystine) can establish a favorable Co&#8208;rich environment around fine Pt nanoparticles during thermal conversion, facilitating Co diffusion into the Pt nanoparticles. The L12&#8208;Pt3Co demonstrates compelling performance and long&#8208;term durability in MEA under heavy&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, attributed to the high degree of ordering in the Pt3Co catalyst.








Abstract
Structurally ordered PtCo intermetallics are one of the most promising oxygen&#8208;reduction catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) due to their intrinsically improved catalytic activity and stability relative to PtCo solid&#8208;solution alloys. However, increasing the heating temperature to achieve a desirable high degree of ordering results in severe particle agglomeration and low mass activity and stability. Herein, a two&#8208;step synthesis approach is developed to create an L12&#8208;Pt3Co intermetallic structure with an increased ordering degree and well&#8208;dispersed ultrafine particles. The first step of the synthesis yields ultrafine Pt nanoparticles that are well&#8208;dispersed on the ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon support. The second adsorption step enables us to fine&#8208;tune the Pt and Co interfaces, assisted by optimal amino acids, to establish a favorable Co&#8208;rich environment around fine Pt nanoparticles, facilitating Co diffusion into the Pt crystalline under mild thermal conditions (&lt;800 &#176;C). This two&#8208;step ordered L12&#8208;Pt3Co catalyst is systematically evaluated using membrane electrode assemblies under heavy&#8208;duty vehicle (HDV) conditions and demonstrated exceptional performance and durability, retaining 1.35 A cm&#8208;2 only a 7% loss in current density at 0.7&#160;V after an extensive accelerated stress test of 150,000 voltage cycles.

         <dc:description>
Cyclically regenerated Co atom clusters (Coac) from the heterostructured CoSe&#8208;ZnSe bimetallic selenide anode are novel, high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state bulk electrocatalysts. They significantly accelerate ZnSe anode conversion reactions for fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries, overcoming solid&#8208;state bulk catalyst design bottlenecks with high catalytic efficiency, electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;passivation in long&#8208;cycle tests, endowing the battery with excellent cycle stability and ultra&#8208;high rate performance.









Abstract
Catalysts are pivotal in enhancing reaction kinetics across various domains, including energy conversion and storage. However, their application in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) has been largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by solid&#8208;solid conversion reactions in bulk electrode materials, and electrochemical instability and passivation of electrocatalysts during cycling. Herein, this study presents that Co atom clusters (Coac) cyclically regenerate from a designed heterostructure of bimetallic selenides anode (CoSe&#8211;ZnSe) during electrochemical lithiation process as a novel and effective solid&#8208;state bulk&#8208;phase electrocatalyst can significantly accelerate conversion reactions of ZnSe anode for fast&#8208;charging LIBs. The propose strategy overcomes the bottlenecks in solid&#8208;state bulk&#8208;phase catalyst design, imparting Coac catalyst with high catalytic efficiency, full&#8208;voltage&#8208;range electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;passivation during long&#8208;cycling test. With catalytic effect of Coac, the batteries demonstrate fast&#8208;charging performance such as unprecedented rate capability up to 50 A g&#8722;1, as well as high&#8208;rate long cyclability (3000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1).

They significantly accelerate ZnSe anode conversion reactions for fast-charging Li-ion batteries, overcoming solid-state bulk catalyst design bottlenecks with high catalytic efficiency, electrochemical stability and anti-passivation in long-cycle tests, endowing the battery with excellent cycle stability and ultra-high rate performance.

         <title>Ultrahigh Cell Density 3D Bioprinting by Acoustic Fluids&#8208;mediated Stereolithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustic fluids&#8208;mediated stereolithography (ASL) enables ultrahigh cell density 3D bioprinting by using surface acoustic waves to assemble cells for biomimetic constructs with hierarchical architectures. Integrated with acoustic&#8208;assisted medium exchange, ASL rapidly fabricates functional liver models, advancing disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and artificial organ engineering.








Abstract
Dense cell populations and their complex structures are the essentials of physiologically functional solid organs, but their biomimetic construction is challenging. Here, an ultrahigh cell density (UHCD) bioprinting system is presented for fabricating organ&#8208;analogous intricate architectures based on an acoustic fluids&#8208;mediated stereolithography (ASL) technique. The ASL can achieve cell aggregation on a prepolymerized solid&#8211;liquid interface with densities comparable to native tissues through focused surface acoustic waves&#8208;induced vortices. Meanwhile, the ASL&#8208;based UHCD bioprinting shows reduced light scattering in each ultrathin layer printing process, reaching cell densities of 1 billion cells&#160;mL&#8722;1. Additionally, by incorporating an acoustic&#8208;assisted medium exchange system, the ASL facilitates the bioprinting of multicellular components in arbitrary architectures. Based on these features, ASL's capability in fabricating structure&#8208;mimetic liver tissue models with regenerative functionalities is demonstrated. It is believed that the ASL technique achieves breakthroughs in UHCD bioprinting, opening new avenues in the development of artificial tissue and organ engineering.

         <title>Thermoplastic Molding of Chitosan to Form Living Plastic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces a thermomechanical compression technique to densify chitosan into stable, custom&#8208;shaped plastics with multifunctionality. The relatively mild processing conditions of the method allow the integration of biomolecules without the need for covalent cross&#8208;linkers to prepare bioactive materials along with the successful incorporation of pollutant&#8208;degrading microbes, resulting in &#8220;living plastics&#8221; capable of bioremediation.








Abstract
Numerous approaches for the solution&#8208;based fabrication of chitosan&#8208;based materials are reported, but most often result in materials with limitations in terms of stability in aqueous systems and mechanics unless chemical cross&#8208;linking is utilized. In the present study, a thermomechanical compression method is presented for solid&#8208;state processing of chitosan powders into dense bulk plastic&#8208;like materials where the mechanical and physical properties can be tailored. To achieve this outcome, chitosan&#8208;citrate complexes, formed through ionic cross&#8208;linking and amidation, undergo thermal fusion at high temperature and pressure to generate robust materials with retention of the inherent properties of chitosan, including biodegradability and cytocompatibility. The chitosan&#8208;based plastics can be doped with enzymes and antibiotics with retention of bioactivity and are also explored as living materials when microbial cells (e.g., Pseudomonas putida) are included in the process and subsequently shown to maintain metabolic functions to degrade organic pollutants. This thermoplastic approach for solid&#8208;state processing of chitosan enables the development of a variety of new materials and composites with embedded biomolecules for enhanced functions. This solid&#8208;state fabrication of chitosan bulk materials approach eliminates the need for conventional solution&#8208;based processing, enabling rapid material production via compression molding while reducing costs, minimizing waste, and improving overall manufacturing efficiency.

         <title>Achieving Ultrahigh n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Power Factor in an Intrinsically Large Transport&#8208;Fermi Energy Gap Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectric polymer, P(TDPP&#8208;BT&#8208;LEG) is reported, with a record&#8208;high power factor of 397 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2. This exceptional performance is attributed to its intrinsically large transport&#8208;Fermi energy gap, enhanced doping facilitated by side chain&#8208;ionized dopant interactions, and efficient interchain coupling via BT units, offering valuable insights for the design of advanced organic thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
The conductivity of organic thermoelectric materials has seen significant improvements in the past few years, but often at the expense of the Seebeck coefficient. Consequently, the thermoelectric performance, especially for n&#8208;type materials, remains considerably lower than that of their inorganic counterparts. Herein, a high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectric polymer, P(TDPP&#8208;BT&#8208;LEG) is reported, with an unexpectedly high Seebeck coefficient and ultrahigh power factor, driven by its intrinsically large energy gap between the Fermi and transport energy levels and high charge carrier mobility. Notably, it is shown that strong electrostatic interactions induced by the ethylene glycol side chains facilitate charge transfer between the dopants and the polymer. This enables effective doping of polymers with high LUMO levels. Furthermore, efficient charge transport, arising from favorable molecular packing, allows the polymer to maintain high electrical conductivity even at low charge carrier concentrations. Ultimately, this polymer achieves a record&#8208;high n&#8208;type power factor of 397 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, with a high Seebeck coefficient of &#8722;420 &#181;V&#160;K&#8210;1. This study highlights the potential of enhancing the Seebeck coefficient through precise energy level tuning and molecular design, fundamentally advancing the rational design of high&#8208;performance organic thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Broadband Plane Blackbody by Ultrafast Laser Induced Surface Hierarchical Structuring and Nanodefect Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid micro&#8208;nano periodic structure, realized via a one&#8208;step process utilizing the mechanism of ultrafast laser multiple interaction with a silicon surface, is reported. This structure simultaneously achieves suppression of optical backscattering and energy band engineering. The fabricated surface exhibits exceptional uniformity and stability as a blackbody, thereby addressing the stability and uniformity challenges of plan blackbodies under protracted deployment.








Abstract
Blackbodies, ideal light&#8208;absorbing objects per Planck's law, do not occur in nature on Earth. Nevertheless, they are of utmost significance in applications across astronomy, optoelectronics, and thermal radiation engineering. While artificial counterparts such as cavity blackbodies and plane blackbodies can approximate ideal blackbodies to some extent, they are beset with problems, including large volume, low emissivity, narrow bandwidth, poor uniformity, and feeble adhesion. Here, a method relying on ultrafast laser direct irradiation is reported, which enables fast writing of uniform plane blackbodies with high&#8208;emissivity over 0.98 in an ultra&#8208;broadband spectrum of 3&#8211;14 &#181;m on a doped silicon surface. A phenomenon of energy negative feedback regulation in laser&#8208;material is discovered, which allows for the simultaneous implementation of hierarchical surface structuring and nanodefect&#8208;induced energy&#8208;level engineering. The resulting micro&#8208;nano hierarchical cone&#8208;array structure effectively curbs light back&#8208;scattering and intensifies nanodefect&#8208;induced absorption. Since the laser&#8208;treated surface does not entail material adhesion or injection, it exhibits superior stability in contrast to traditional black coatings. This is corroborated by high&#8208;temperature tests exceeding 900&#160;&#176;C and repeated mechanical exfoliation tests, underscoring its resilience in harsh environmental conditions.

Here, a method relying on ultrafast laser direct irradiation is reported, which enables fast writing of uniform plane blackbodies with high-emissivity over 0.98 in an ultra-broadband spectrum of 3&#8211;14 &#181;m on a doped silicon surface. A phenomenon of energy negative feedback regulation in laser-material is discovered, which allows for the simultaneous implementation of hierarchical surface structuring and nanodefect-induced energy-level engineering. The resulting micro-nano hierarchical cone-array structure effectively curbs light back-scattering and intensifies nanodefect-induced absorption. Since the laser-treated surface does not entail material adhesion or injection, it exhibits superior stability in contrast to traditional black coatings. This is corroborated by high-temperature tests exceeding 900&#160;&#176;C and repeated mechanical exfoliation tests, underscoring its resilience in harsh environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Nanorelay Enhances Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer in Lanthanide Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks during Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion</title>

Electron&#8208;rich closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; is first incorporated into a lanthanide metal&#8208;organic framework (Ln&#8208;MOF), forming B12H12@Tb&#8208;based Ln&#8208;MOF, where closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; acts as an electron nanorelay to enhance ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer during photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Single&#8208;crystal, in situ, and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques reveal the complete mechanistic pathway, providing guidance for the rational design of highly efficient catalysts for artificialphotosynthesis.








Abstract
Lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) exhibit potential yet limitations for photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Their &#8220;potential&#8221; stems from their CO2 adsorption capability, attributed to the ligand&#8208;field effects and specialized pore microenvironments; the &#8220;limitation&#8221; is due to the inertness of ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) originating from the 4f electron shielding effect, high ionization energies, and low electron affinities. Introducing electron&#8208;rich active components, acting as nanorelays, into Ln&#8208;MOF pores offers a viable strategy to overcome these drawbacks, though the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Herein, the mechanistic pathway underlying efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the B12H12@Tb&#8208;based MOF composite is elucidated, wherein the electron&#8208;rich closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; serves as the counteranion and functions within the pores as an electron nanorelay. The crystalline structure of this composite is revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. In situ and transient techniques, together with theoretical calculation, uncovered the serial mechanism, including how closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; nanorelay facilitates a radical&#8208;assisted electron transfer and subsequently improves LMCT within Ln&#8208;MOF, as well as how Tb3+ serves as the catalytic active center for the intermediate process pathways of CO2 molecules. These mechanistic studies not only unveil the &#8220;black box&#8221; of MOF&#8208;based composite photocatalyst, but also provide solutions for the development of efficient artificial photosynthesis catalysts.

         <title>Circumventing Self&#8208;Diffusion Enables High&#8208;Rate Hard Carbon Anodes</title>

         <dc:description>
This study reveals that slow sodium self&#8208;diffusion within metallic clusters in low&#8208;potential regions (&lt;0.1&#160;V) as the primary factor hindering the rate capability of hard carbon. By rationally designing a heterostructure where long&#8208;ranged anisotropic graphitic nanobelts are in situ embedded into isotropic amorphous carbon matrix, Na+ diffusion kinetics is redirected from the slow metallic&#8208;cluster self&#8208;diffusion to the rapid interlaminar pathways through the extended graphitic stacks, thereby significantly circumventing the sodium diffusion barrier in the low potential.








Abstract
Hard carbons (HCs) are promising anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), yet their application faces a critical challenge that sluggish kinetics in low&#8208;potential regions (&lt;0.1&#160;V) severely limit fast&#8208;charging capability, and the origin of this limitation remains unclear. Here, this study reveals slow sodium self&#8208;diffusion within metallic clusters as the fundamental barrier of hard carbons, by combining first&#8208;principles calculations and in/ex situ characterizations. By rationally designing a heterostructure where long&#8208;ranged anisotropic graphitic nanobelts are in situ embedded into isotropic amorphous carbon matrix, Na+ diffusion kinetics is redirected from the slow metallic&#8208;cluster self&#8208;diffusion to the rapid interlaminar pathways through the extended graphitic stacks, thereby significantly circumventing the sodium diffusion barrier at the low potential. The optimized HCs achieve a high reversible capacity (386 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1), exceptional rate capability (312 mAh g&#8722;1 at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1), and robust long&#8208;term cyclic stability (98% after 1000 cycles) in a conventional ester electrolyte, with energy density and power density surpassing those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art graphite in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These findings provide fundamental insights into high&#8208;rate hard carbons for advanced SIBs.

         <title>Facile Bottom&#8208;Up Assembly of Photonic Micropatterns via Surface&#8208;Guided Colloidal Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution photonic micropatterns with vivid structural colors are fabricated through bottom&#8208;up assembly, guided by surface&#8208;dependent regioselective heterogeneous nucleation and crystal growth of colloidal particles. Full&#8208;spectrum color tunability is achieved by controlling particle size and interparticle attraction, while in situ color mixing is enabled by exclusive crystallization of bidisperse particles, expanding the accessible color palette.








Abstract
Photonic micropatterns derived from colloidal self&#8208;assembly are highly sought after for next&#8208;generation optical and functional devices. However, achieving high optical quality, spatial precision, and stopband tunability with a simple fabrication process remains challenging due to the limitations of conventional top&#8208;down techniques. Here, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is reported for fabricating high&#8208;resolution photonic micropatterns via regioselective heterogeneous nucleation and crystallization of polystyrene particles, directed by surface&#8208;dependent nucleation behavior. On strongly charged glass, nucleation is suppressed, while on weakly charged photoresist surfaces, it is promoted via depletion&#8208;mediated attraction. Photoresist micropatterns prepared by standard photolithography enable single&#8208;step, spatially localized crystal growth without physical confinement. The resulting crystalline grains exhibit uniform orientation and minimal intergrain gaps, displaying intense structural colors. By systematically tuning depletant and salt concentrations, an optimal pair potential well depth is identified that yields superior&#8208;quality photonic micropatterns. Full&#8208;spectrum color tunability is achieved by varying particle size while maintaining this optimal interaction range. Moreover, bidisperse systems show exclusive crystallization of distinct grain types within a single pattern, enabling in situ color mixing and extended color palettes. Beyond photolithography, that accessible charge&#8208;guided patterning is demonstrated using vapor&#8208;phase masking, oil stamping, and even fingerprints, highlighting the versatility and scalability of this bottom&#8208;up approach.

         <title>Trace Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of High&#8208;Quality Graphene with Improved Electrical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the critical role of trace oxygen in graphene synthesis. Superclean graphene films are synthesized via trace oxygen&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition. Experimental and computational analyses elucidate the dual role of oxygen in etching amorphous carbon and assisting defect repair during graphene growth. This strategy substantially enhances graphene's crystallinity while simultaneously improving its electronic performance.








Abstract
Point defects and amorphous carbon contamination, which are almost inevitable during the high&#8208;temperature chemical vapor deposition growth process, are demonstrated to severely degrade the intrinsic properties of graphene films, particularly their electronic performance. This study puts forward a trace oxygen&#8208;assisted strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;quality graphene by effectively eradicating amorphous carbon contamination and then promoting the repair of underlying lattice defects. Both experimental results and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that lattice healing is inhibited when the lattice is covered by amorphous carbon but facilitated with the aid of oxygen. The high crystallinity of the synthesized graphene is evidenced by its strong resistance to electron&#8208;beam radiation and mechanical property (2D Young's modulus &#8776;355 N&#160;m&#8722;1 and fracture strength &#8776;1778 nN) comparable to that of exfoliated graphene. Furthermore, the as&#8208;obtained graphene film exhibits enhanced electronic performance, including a low sheet resistance of 174.4 &#177; 31.9 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and a high carrier mobility exceeding 15&#160;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature. This work not only elucidates the novel functions of oxygen in the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene but also offers new prospects for further enhancing the performance of graphene.

&lt;p&gt;This study reveals the critical role of trace oxygen in graphene synthesis. Superclean graphene films are synthesized via trace oxygen-assisted chemical vapor deposition. Experimental and computational analyses elucidate the dual role of oxygen in etching amorphous carbon and assisting defect repair during graphene growth. This strategy substantially enhances graphene's crystallinity while simultaneously improving its electronic performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point defects and amorphous carbon contamination, which are almost inevitable during the high-temperature chemical vapor deposition growth process, are demonstrated to severely degrade the intrinsic properties of graphene films, particularly their electronic performance. This study puts forward a trace oxygen-assisted strategy for synthesizing high-quality graphene by effectively eradicating amorphous carbon contamination and then promoting the repair of underlying lattice defects. Both experimental results and first-principles calculations reveal that lattice healing is inhibited when the lattice is covered by amorphous carbon but facilitated with the aid of oxygen. The high crystallinity of the synthesized graphene is evidenced by its strong resistance to electron-beam radiation and mechanical property (2D Young's modulus &#8776;355 N&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and fracture strength &#8776;1778 nN) comparable to that of exfoliated graphene. Furthermore, the as-obtained graphene film exhibits enhanced electronic performance, including a low sheet resistance of 174.4 &#177; 31.9 &#937; sq&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high carrier mobility exceeding 15&#160;000 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature. This work not only elucidates the novel functions of oxygen in the synthesis of high-quality graphene but also offers new prospects for further enhancing the performance of graphene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Intelligence Programmable Intrathecal Injection System Based on Tween 80&#8208;Confined Halide Perovskite Optoelectronic Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative Tween 80 confinement strategy modulates Cs2AgBiBr6 crystallization by suppressing bromine vacancy (Brvac) formation, enabling the optoelectronic memristor to exhibit electronic synaptic functionality and transient photoresponse (TPR). By leveraging the multi&#8208;wavelength modulation capability of TPR, an all&#8208;optically controlled drug delivery system is demonstrated. This work expands the frontiers of optoelectronic devices applications in the biomedical field.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free inorganic perovskites have emerged as promising candidates to replace the lead&#8208;based perovskites and expedite the commercialization of optoelectronic devices, owing to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, tunable bandgap, and long carrier diffusion lengths. However, uncontrollable nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites pose a major challenge to device performance. Herein, a Tween 80&#8208;confined Cs2AgBiBr6&#8208;based optoelectronic memristor is presented that exhibits both electronic synaptic functionality (ESF) and transient photoresponse (TPR). The Tween 80 confinement strategy effectively suppresses bromine vacancy (Brvac) and promotes the formation of a high&#8208;quality, pinhole&#8208;free perovskite film, which endows the device with outstanding optoelectronic performance. Leveraging the ESF under electrical stimulation, the as&#8208;fabricated device achieves highly efficient pattern recognition. Under optical stimulation, it demonstrates a TPR with 20&#160;ms response time, an extended durability of 931.7&#160;s, and excellent repeatability over 1000 cycles at 5&#160;Hz. Furthermore, the device achieves all&#8208;optical writing and erasing through combined optical stimuli, enabling complex image encryption/writing tasks. Finally, an all&#8208;optically controlled intrathecal injection system is designed based on the device, incorporating six specific drug release strategies. Therefore, this work provides innovative insights into the application of optoelectronic memristors in biomedical and life sciences, paving the way for the development of smart medicine.

         <title>Ambient&#8208;Compatible Solvent Bath Thermal Annealing for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells and Large&#8208;Area Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent bath thermal annealing (STA) approach is developed for efficient ambient processing of organic solar cells and modules. STA immerses the active layer in perfluorodecalin to ensure uniform heating and protection from oxygen and moisture, optimizing film crystallinity and molecular packing. The strategy yields exceptional device efficiency, stability, and scalability, significantly enhancing the prospects for large&#8208;area manufacturing.








Abstract
Thermal annealing is essential for optimizing the bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) morphology of organic solar cells (OSCs), yet traditional thermal annealing (TA) under ambient air suffers from film degradation and nonuniform heating. Here, a novel post&#8208;treatment, solvent bath thermal annealing (STA), enabling effective TA of large&#8208;area OSC active layers under ambient conditions, is introduced. In STA, the BHJ film is immersed in a perfluorodecalin (PFD) bath during heating, ensuring uniform thermal distribution and protection against oxygen and moisture. STA&#8208;treated films thus exhibit optimized vertical component distribution, enhanced crystallinity, and improved molecular packing with higher structural order, leading to efficient charge transport and suppressed nonradiative recombination regardless of the annealing atmosphere. As a result, STA&#8208;treated OSCs based on PM6/L8&#8208;BO blend deliver outstanding performance: small&#8208;area cells achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05%, while large&#8208;area (20.25&#160;cm2) modules attain a PCE of 17.37% (certified 16.75%), among the highest PCEs for large&#8208;area organic solar modules. It also successfully bridges the performance gap between inert and ambient processing conditions. Moreover, STA&#8208;treated devices show excellent operational stability under continuous illumination and thermal stress. This ambient&#8208;compatible annealing strategy thus provides a scalable route toward high&#8208;efficiency and stable organic solar modules for practical large&#8208;area manufacturing.

         <title>Interfacial Charge Flow Modulation of CaF2/CaAl12O19:Dy Heterojunctions for Enhanced Mechanoluminescence in Flexible Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterojunctions are constructed by in situ growing CaF2:Dy on the CaAl12O19:Dy particles. Compared with the single&#8208;phase materials, the constructed CaF2/ CaAl12O19:Dy heterojunction interfaces via F&#9472;Al&#9472;O and F&#9472;Ca&#9472;O bonds boost the charge flow from CA6 to CaF2, enhancing the interfacial triboelectricity and thus yielding improved mechanoluminescent performance in terms of intensity, repeatbility, and self&#8208;recoverability in flexible composites.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) flexible composites show broad application prospects in stretchable optoelectronics and wearable devices. However, challenges such as low brightness, inadequate repeatability, and restricted self&#8208;recoverability hinder their practical use. Aiming to these issues, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of the heterojunction strategy on the interfacial triboelectricity&#8208;induced ML in flexible composites. Herein, the typical interfacial triboelectricity&#8208;dependent ML material of CaF2:Dy is in situ grown on the trap&#8208;controlled ML material of CaAl12O19:Dy (CA6:Dy) because of their high crystal lattice matching ability. Compared with the single&#8208;phase materials, the CaF2/CA6:0.06Dy heterojunctions exhibit outstanding ML performance in the flexible polydimethylsiloxane matrix, which can achieve repeatable ML for over 10&#160;000 times with a self&#8208;recovery degree of ca. 91.60%. The trap&#8208;controlled mechanism and interfacial triboelectrification&#8208;induced electron bombardment model are both responsible for the ML of CaF2/CA6:0.06Dy heterojunctions. Theoretical calculation results suggest that the construction of heterojunction interfaces via F&#9472;Al&#9472;O and F&#9472;Ca&#9472;O bonds can effectively prompt the charge flow from CA6 to CaF2. This endows CaF2/CA6:0.06Dy with enhanced interfacial triboelectricity and enriched trap structure, leading to improved ML properties. This work confirms that rational heterojunction design can overcome the limitations of single&#8208;phase materials in flexible matrices, offering a robust platform for the development of high&#8208;performance and flexible ML materials.

A hybrid&#8208;sulfonamide electrolyte (HSE) stabilizes 4.5 V&#8208;class Li&#8208;ion batteries with high&#8208;nickel cathodes and Si&#8208;majority graphite anodes by forming a self&#8208;limiting inorganic interphase at the Si||electrolyte junction. The HSE enables a broad operating temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C and excellent cycling performance of 1.4 Ah pouch cells with 80% capacity retention after 1150 cycles.








Abstract
4.5&#160;V&#8208;class lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) pairing LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathodes with silicon&#8208;majority graphite (SmG, &gt;1500 mAh g&#8722;1) anodes can surpass 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, but their cycling stability, safety, and low&#8208;temperature operation are constrained by the difficulty in constructing stable interphase. This study reports a hybrid&#8208;sulfonamide electrolyte (HSE) that can survive the aggressive chemistry of high&#8208;voltage NMC811 and programs a self&#8208;limiting inorganic interphase on Si by leveraging the electron&#8208;limited onset at the Si||electrolyte junction. At first lithiation, the semiconductor characteristic and native SiOx create a space&#8208;charge (depletion) region, so the anionic&#8208;structure&#8208;like sulfonamides bias first&#8208;electron reduction, seeding lithium halide/chalcogenide inorganics that are electronically insulating yet Li+&#8208;permeable. The resulting thin, dense layer suppresses electron tunneling, dissolution, and resists crack&#8208;induced stress concentration during Si expansion&#8212;thereby self&#8208;limiting further growth. Consequently, NMC811||SmG coin cells with the HSE retain 80% capacity after 500 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and &#8776;5 mAh cm&#8722;2 and operate over a wide range of temperature from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C, markedly outperforming the carbonate electrolyte. 1.4 Ah pouch cells maintain 80.0% of initial capacity after 1150 cycles and exhibit thermal stability up to 300 &#176;C. This work establishes self&#8208;limiting interphase formation on Si as a practical electrolyte design target for high&#8208;energy LIBs.

&lt;p&gt;A hybrid-sulfonamide electrolyte (HSE) stabilizes 4.5 V-class Li-ion batteries with high-nickel cathodes and Si-majority graphite anodes by forming a self-limiting inorganic interphase at the Si||electrolyte junction. The HSE enables a broad operating temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C and excellent cycling performance of 1.4 Ah pouch cells with 80% capacity retention after 1150 cycles.

         <title>Electron Percolating Shielded Interlayer Enabling Ultrastable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>

A bilayer of PTAA/SnO2 (PS) is designed at the LLZTO solid electrolyte and Li metal interface, which creates a reverse electric field to block electron leakage, significantly reducing the electronic conductivity of LLZTO. Li dendrite formation is greatly suppressed at the surface and bulk of LLZTO, which contributes to the outstanding electrochemical performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
The electron percolation of grain boundaries in Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) induces internal lithium deposition and penetration, causing short circuits of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, which has become a significant obstacle hindering the practical application of LLZTO. In this work, an electron&#8208;percolating shielded interface constructing strategy is proposed between LLZTO and lithium metal (Li) to simultaneously suppress the Li dendrite growth at both the interface and within the LLZTO electrolyte. A Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;triMethylphenyl)aMine] (PTAA)/SnO2 (PS) bilayer is therefore designed between LLZTO and Li metal (LLZTO&#8208;PS|Li), where the hole&#8208;rich PTAA and electron&#8208;rich SnO2 generate a reverse electric field that effectively blocks the electron leakage, thereby reducing the electronic conductivity of LLZTO and preventing its internal dendrite formation. Furthermore, the smooth and compact PTAA/SnO2 coating significantly enhances interfacial contact and equalizes the interfacial potential to promote a uniform Li plating. As a result, the Li|LLZTO&#8208;PS|Li symmetric battery achieves stable cycling for over 5000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 2500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The Li|LLZTO&#8208;PS|LiFePO4 full battery demonstrates 86.2% capacity after 2000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;C. This study presents a novel interfacial engineering strategy for enhancing the performance and durability of garnet&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Deciphering Defect&#8208;Mediated Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching Multimodal Luminescence for Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the multicolor SrZnP2O7:Sm3+/Dy3+/Tb3+/Tm3+ phosphors exhibiting exceptional multimodal luminescence in the 350&#8211;750 nm range with anti&#8208;thermal quenching properties. A charge compensation strategy is established to enhance the quantum efficiency, photoluminescence/radioluminescence, and X&#8208;ray afterglow duration by precise regulation of trap distribution and density. The developed phosphors demonstrate great promise for X&#8208;ray imaging and high&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications.








Abstract
Multimodal luminescent materials displaying dynamically tunable multicolor emissions under diverse excitation channels are at the core of optical information encryption technologies. However, simultaneous achievement of high&#8208;performance multimodal luminescence with anti&#8208;thermal quenching (ATQ) feature remains a critical challenge. Herein, a new class of SrZnP2O7:RE (RE = Sm3+, Dy3+, Tb3+, Tm3+) phosphors is developed to fulfill these requirements through precise defect engineering. These phosphors exhibit photoluminescence (PL), radioluminescence (RL), mechanoluminescence (ML), thermoluminescence (TL), and persistent luminescence (PersL) with emission spanning 350&#8211;750&#160;nm. By strategically incorporating charge compensators (Li+, Na+, K+), precise regulation of trap distribution and density is demonstrated, yielding remarkable enhancements in PL, quantum efficiency, RL intensity, and X&#8208;ray afterglow duration. Crucially, the engineered deep traps in Sm/Dy/Tm&#8208;doped systems enable exceptional ATQ behavior. Comprehensive investigations reveal the critical role of charge compensation and defect redistribution in modulating luminescence performance. Benefiting from their superior multimodal emission properties, these phosphors demonstrate great promise for X&#8208;ray imaging and high&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications. This work establishes a new paradigm in luminescent material design, providing both fundamental insights into defect&#8208;luminescence property relationships and a practical framework for constructing advanced optical materials with tailored multimodal responses through precision trap state engineering.

         <title>Unprecedented Energy Density of Polyimide Dielectrics at Elevated Temperatures Utilizing Atomic Engineering to Decouple &#960;&#8208;Conjugation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>

This study establishes a site&#8208;specific ortho&#8208;chlorination strategy for semi&#8208;aromatic polyimides, which localizes &#960;&#8208;electrons and induces conformational distortion to disrupt intrachain &#960;&#8208;conjugation and interchain &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Consequently, the Cl&#8208;PI films deliver discharged energy densities of 7.22 J cm&#8722;3 with &gt;90% efficiency at 200 &#176;C and 6.79 J cm&#8722;3 at 250 &#176;C, demonstrating excellent high&#8208;temperature dielectric performance.








Abstract
Emerging demands for polymer dielectrics in high&#8208;power electronics and harsh environments call for polymers with simultaneously high thermal stability and electrical performance. However, most polymers suffer from rapid conduction loss at elevated temperatures. Here it is shown that atomic&#8208;level backbone chlorination of polyimide (Cl&#8208;PI) imposes &#960;&#8208;electron localization and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane steric barriers that, together, suppress through&#8208;plane hopping arising from both intrachain &#960;&#8208;conjugation and interchain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, dismantling long&#8208;range conduction pathways. This cooperative mechanism markedly curtails high&#8208;temperature conduction loss and yields outstanding capacitive performance, delivering discharge energy densities (Ud) of 9.52 J cm&#8722;3 at 150 &#176;C and 7.22 J cm&#8722;3 at 200 &#176;C, with efficiencies exceeding 90%. Even at 250&#176;C, an unprecedented Ud of 6.79 J cm&#8722;3 is retained, outperforming reported high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers. Moreover, Cl&#8208;PI exhibits excellent self&#8208;cleaning behavior and cycling durability, sustaining over 106 cycles at 200&#160;&#176;C and 400&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 with minimal degradation. This work underscores the potential of atomic&#8208;level backbone engineering to enable next&#8208;generation polymer dielectrics for reliable, high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage.

         <title>Holistic Recovery of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries by Flash Joule Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and sustainable flash Joule heating chlorination&#8211;oxidation (FJH&#8211;ClO) process enables efficient recovery of lithium, cobalt, and graphite from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This scalable approach achieves high purity and yield of the separated metal and graphite while significantly reducing energy use, reagents, and operating costs compared with conventional recycling methods.








Abstract
The rising demand for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) highlights the urgent need for sustainable recycling technologies. Existing pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy methods can recover valuable metals but suffer from high energy costs and wastewater generation. Here, a selective flash Joule heating chlorination and oxidation (FJH&#8208;ClO) strategy is presented for the efficient separation of metals from spent batteries. In this process, cathode metals are first chlorinated for 60 s, after which the transition metal chlorides are oxidized to oxides, enabling lithium to be separated from transition metals due to their different aqueous solubility. This approach applies not only to the recovery of metals from lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode materials, but also to the anodic graphite, all from the black mass. The recovered graphite exhibits purity of &#8776;100% with a yield of 85%, Co at 99% purity and 97% yield, and Li at 99% purity with a 92% yield. Gram&#8208;scale experiments confirm the scalability of the method, maintaining high efficiency and selectivity. Life&#8208;cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis reveal that the FJH&#8208;ClO process substantially reduces energy consumption, operation time, and reagent consumption, while lowering operating costs by up to 92%, compared to conventional approaches.

         <title>Aqueous Sodium Humate Binder Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Voltage Cathodes via Protection from Interface to Bulk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eco&#8208;friendly and water&#8208;soluble sodium humate (NaHA) working as multifunctional binder enables high&#8208;performance for high&#8208;voltage cathodes. It is found that the proposed binder simultaneously stabilizes the interphase and bulk structure in high&#8208;voltage LCO via uniform surface coating and lattice&#8208;cognate in situ trace&#8208;level Na doping in the bulk during cycles, respectively.








Abstract
Raising the charging cutoff voltage is a well&#8208;established approach to enhance the energy density of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathodes, known for their high bulk energy density, in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their practical implementation under high&#8208;voltage conditions remains limited by interphase instability and bulk structural degradation. Herein, an innovative application of low&#8208;cost and water&#8208;soluble sodium humate (NaHA) is proposed, traditionally employed in aquaculture and pharmaceuticals, as a multifunctional binder for high&#8208;voltage LCO cathodes. Enriched with &#9472;COOH and &#9472;OH functional groups, NaHA not only forms robust hydrogen bonds with the LCO surface, enabling uniform coating on LCO particles, but also promotes a protective interphase microenvironment. More importantly, NaHA facilitates lattice&#8208;cognate in situ trace Na doping into the LCO bulk lattice during cycling, effectively enhancing its structural stability. This dual modification strategy, combining surface confinement and bulk reinforcement, endows LCO cathodes with ultra&#8208;stable electrochemical performance, retaining 95.1% capacity after 1700 cycles at 4.45&#160;V and 87.1% over 1000 cycles at 4.5&#160;V. Moreover, the water solubility of NaHA simplifies end&#8208;of&#8208;life electrode disassembly and promotes recyclability, supporting sustainable battery design. This binder&#8208;directed strategy offers a scalable, eco&#8208;friendly, and efficient binder&#8208;based stabilization route for high&#8208;voltage LCO cathodes, paving the way for the development of high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy LIBs.

         <title>Synergistic Structural and Defect Engineering in MoS2 Featuring Ultra&#8208;Expanded Interlayers for Fast&#8208;Chargeable and Long&#8208;Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
In this study, guided by theoretical insights, an innovative carbon&#8208;intercalated, Se&#8208;doped MoS2 encapsulated within hollow carbon spheres as a viable anode for Na&#8208;ion batteries has been developed, yielding synchronously a large reversible capacity, high&#8208;rate capability, and long&#8208;term durability. Its origins of the performance enhancement are explicitly revealed by extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical analyses.








Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical specific capacity, yet it suffers from sluggish kinetics, severe volume variation, and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Theoretically, concurrent selenium doping and carbon intercalation are revealed to effectively mitigate these challenges by improving electronic conductivity, promoting phase transition reaction kinetics, and alleviating structural deformation, thereby improving the structural flexibility of the MoS2 anode. Experimentally, a synergistic hollow carbon sphere&#8208;confined, carbon&#8208;intercalated and selenium&#8208;doped MoS2 (MoSSe@HCS) anode is rationally designed, achieving an ultra&#8208;expanded interlayer spacing (1.24&#160;nm), appropriate buffer space and robust carbon encapsulation. This design boosts charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, suppresses volume variation, and stabilizes SEI. Consequently, the MoSSe@HCS anode exhibits high capacity (441.5 mAh g&#8722;1, 100 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), exceptional rate capability (121.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 A g&#8722;1), and cyclability (87.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1). A full cell with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode displays high&#8208;capacity retention of 82.1% after 600 cycles at 17 C and a pouch&#8208;type full cell sustains over 2500 cycles at 10 C, demonstrating significant commercial viability. This work establishes a theory&#8208;guided design paradigm that bridges fundamental understanding and practical deployment of high&#8208;performance MoS2&#8208;based anodes for next&#8208;generation SIBs.

         <title>Localized Electrostatic Interaction Stabilize Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a localized electrostatic interaction strategy using a tailored organic cation, tetramethyldipropylene&#8208;triammonium (IDPA3+), to enhance perovskite&#160;stability without introducing any trade&#8208;off. IDPA3+ induces perovskite lattice compression via sterically constrained localized electrostatic interactions, concurrently reinforcing structural stability while suppressing ion migration. Consequently, p&#8208;i&#8208;n device achieved&#160;a champion efficiency of 25.41% for 1.00 cm2 (certified 25.28%), alongside&#160;exceptional operational stability at 85&#160;&#176;C and superior damp&#8208;heat stability.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great promise for commercialization, yet the weak bonding nature of perovskites renders them vulnerable to external stimuli, undermining the operational longevity of PSCs. Methods aimed at strengthening bonding within perovskite constituents still failed to realize both &#8220;high efficiency&#8221; and &#8220;high stability&#8221; in single device. Herein, a localized electrostatic interaction strategy is proposed by employing an unexplored and well&#8208;designed organic cation, tetramethyldipropylene&#8208;triammonium (IDPA3+). IDPA3+ features sterically constrained multi&#8208;interaction sites that enable strong localized electrostatic interactions with [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedra, inducing perovskite lattice compression. This compression improves perovskite lattice energy through strengthened chemical bonding within bulk lattice, ultimately reinforcing structural stability while simultaneously suppressing ion migration. Consequently, modified formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) devices displayed state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stability, showing negligible performance loss under continuous operation at 85&#160;&#176;C and damp&#8208;heat test. Notably, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n device achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.28% for 1.00 cm2, among the highest published certified PCEs. Overall, this work presents localized electrostatic interaction engineering as a promising strategy to intrinsically stabilize perovskite microstructure, bridging the gap between electrostatic regulation and structural stability while highlighting the broader potential of other triply&#8208;charged organic molecules for advancing stable PSCs and optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great promise for commercialization, yet the weak bonding nature of perovskites renders them vulnerable to external stimuli, undermining the operational longevity of PSCs. Methods aimed at strengthening bonding within perovskite constituents still failed to realize both &#8220;high efficiency&#8221; and &#8220;high stability&#8221; in single device. Herein, a localized electrostatic interaction strategy is proposed by employing an unexplored and well-designed organic cation, tetramethyldipropylene-triammonium (IDPA&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;). IDPA&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; features sterically constrained multi-interaction sites that enable strong localized electrostatic interactions with [PbI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; octahedra, inducing perovskite lattice compression. This compression improves perovskite lattice energy through strengthened chemical bonding within bulk lattice, ultimately reinforcing structural stability while simultaneously suppressing ion migration. Consequently, modified formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) devices displayed state-of-the-art stability, showing negligible performance loss under continuous operation at 85&#160;&#176;C and damp-heat test. Notably, the p-i-n device achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.28% for 1.00 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, among the highest published certified PCEs. Overall, this work presents localized electrostatic interaction engineering as a promising strategy to intrinsically stabilize perovskite microstructure, bridging the gap between electrostatic regulation and structural stability while highlighting the broader potential of other triply-charged organic molecules for advancing stable PSCs and optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Spin&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme Overcomes the Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;Off for Sustainable Adhesive Production From Lignin Biomass Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the multispin&#8208;state characteristics of natural laccase's multicopper centers, a 2D copper&#8208;based MOF is developed with optimal laccase&#8208;like activity, named COHBLO. This nanozyme selectively degrades lignin into uniform, hydroxyl&#8208;rich products. Through a ring&#8208;opening reaction between the hydroxyl and epoxy groups, a high&#8208;strength, eco&#8208;friendly lignin&#8208;based wood adhesive is successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Lignin, a major component of plant cell walls, is the most abundant source of natural aromatic polymers. Efficient production of its valuable degradation products requires highly selective catalysts. This study introduces a spin&#8208;state&#8208;modulated nanozyme system for precise lignin depolymerization into targeted biobased chemicals. Precise copper spin state control in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) copper&#8208;based metal organic framework (MOF) nanozymes, achieved via redox treatment and ligand exchange modulation, replicates natural laccase multicopper center spin synergy. Integrated experiments and theory reveal a volcano&#8208;shaped spin state&#8208;activity correlation, enabling synthesis of optimized nanozyme Cu(OH)2BDC&#8208;LA&#8208;OAc (COHBLO). This material demonstrates exceptional laccase&#8208;mimicking activity, with a peak reaction rate 70 times higher than natural laccase and a 5.14&#8208;fold specific activity increase. Through laccase&#8208;like catalysis, it selectively cleaves lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages, directionally yielding fragments rich in phenolic hydroxyl groups. Their efficient reaction with epoxy groups produces a nanolignin&#8208;based epoxy adhesive. Featuring a three&#8208;dimensional cross&#8208;linked network, this adhesive delivers superior bonding under varied conditions. Its shear strength significantly surpasses commercial phenolic resins while eliminating conventional adhesive formaldehyde emissions. This study advances 2D MOF nanozyme design and establishes an integrated pathway from controlled lignin depolymerization to high&#8208;performance adhesive production, providing key theoretical and practical foundations for biomass valorization and sustainable adhesive development.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Reverse Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interaction to Boost Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase&#8208;dependent universal law of electron transfer is investigated by depositing metals onto the surfaces of monolayer 1T&#8208;/2H&#8208;MoS2 hollow structures. The reverse transfer of electrons from 1T&#8208;MoS2 to metal demonstrates superior electrochemical activity and long&#8208;term stability in hydrogen evolution reactions compared to the forward transfer of electrons from metal to 2H&#8208;MoS2.








Abstract
Electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI) represents a pivotal strategy for modulating the electronic structure of supported metals and enhancing their catalytic performance. However, limited reports have been conducted on the impact of the support crystal phase on EMSI. Here, a charge transfer inversion phenomenon associated with support crystal phase regulation is systematically revealed. Specifically, subnano&#8208;sized noble metals (e.g., Pt, Rh, Ru) donate electrons to 2H&#8208;MoS2 support, whereas a reverse electron transfer direction is observed when these noble metals are supported on 1T&#8208;MoS2. Electron&#8208;enriched noble metals demonstrate significantly higher activity for alkaline hydrogen evolution compared to their electron&#8208;deficient counterparts, with 1T&#8208;MoS2@Pt achieving an exceptionally low overpotential of 18&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) incorporating 1T&#8208;MoS2@Pt as the cathode exhibits superior catalytic activity and sustained stability at ampere&#8208;level current density. This work provides novel insights into developing efficient catalysts by regulating charge transfer dependent on the support crystal phase.

         <title>Reactivity&#8208;Driven Metal&#8208;Adaptive Interphases for Dendrite&#8208;Free, High&#8208;Rate Alkali Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a universal strategy to reconstruct hierarchical, metal&#8208;adaptive SEI layers on Li/Na anodes (TC&#8208;Li/TC&#8208;Na) and address their metal&#8208;specific limitations. Guided by distinct reaction kinetics, a low&#8208;porosity, high&#8208;modulus layer is formed on TC&#8208;Li to mechanically suppress dendrites, while a highly porous network with interconnected ultrasmall TiO2 nanoparticles is constructed on TC&#8208;Na to accommodate volumetric strain and enhance interfacial activity. Consequently, the modified Li/Na metal pouch cells deliver improved long&#8208;term stability and rate capability, and achieve a stable operation under a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, high&#8208;capacity Li metal pouch cell (550.2 Wh kg&#8722;1, 11.1 Ah) and a high&#8208;rate Na metal pouch cell (0.3 C/1 C).








Abstract
Alkali metal anodes (e.g., Li and Na) require a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) customized to their physicomechanical and electrochemical demands; however, conventional SEI designs relying on generic &#8220;one&#8208;size&#8208;fits&#8208;all&#8221; approaches fail to fully address the metal&#8208;specific requirements. Herein, a metal&#8208;adaptive SEI reconstruction strategy is proposed to leverage the reactivity&#8208;guided diisopropoxy&#8208;bisethylacetoacetatotitanate (DPBT) coatings on alkali metal anodes (TC&#8208;Li/TC&#8208;Na). The resulting interphases both share a hierarchical architecture with an ultrathin titanate layer and a TiO2&#8208;based inner matrix connected through compositionally graded segments (Ti&#8211;O&#8211;M, M = Li/Na/C), yet demonstrate metal&#8208;specific structural differentiation. The moderate reactivity of Li facilitates the dense packing of larger TiO2 nanoparticles, forming a low&#8208;porosity, high&#8208;modulus layer that mechanically suppresses dendrites. Conversely, the more rapid reaction of Na instantly produces abundant gas bubbles and fosters a highly porous network with interconnected ultrasmall TiO2 nanoparticles, integrating moderate modulus with elevated surface roughness that dynamically accommodates volumetric strain and enhances interfacial activity. Consequently, the NCM811||TC&#8208;Li pouch cell achieves high&#8208;capacity retention (89.3%, 200 cycles, 456.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) under 0.2 C/0.5 C and stable operation under high capacity and high energy density of 11.1 Ah and 550.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, while NFM||TC&#8208;Na pouch cell deliveries exceptional cycling stability at 0.3 C/1 C (79.7% retention over 200 cycles).

         <title>Steric&#8208;Hindrance Effect Induced Fabrication of Lightweight, Bi&#8208;Functional, and Easy&#8208;to&#8208;Infiltrate Hosts for 502&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of abundant bi&#8208;functional edge&#8208;doping sites on easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate hosts has been successfully realized for the first time. This breakthrough has facilitated the achievement of an ultralight, efficiently bi&#8208;functional and easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate host, enabling a pouch lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (&#8776;2 Ah) to exhibit an impressive energy density of 502 Wh kg&#8722;1 and cyclic stability.








Abstract
A promising strategy for constructing 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 cell&#8208;level rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) is developing hosts with ultralight weight to reduce nonactive mass, bi&#8208;functionality to ensure both efficient sulfur reactions and lithium plating under low N/P, and an easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate architecture for full wetting with lean electrolyte. Edge&#8208;doped carbons, combining light weight and unique bi&#8208;functionality, are rare candidates as such hosts. However, their preparation, which generally involves increasing specific surface areas or forming micropores/mesopores, impairs host&#8208;wetting under lean electrolyte.

     alt="Steric-Hindrance Effect Induced Fabrication of Lightweight, Bi-Functional, and Easy-to-Infiltrate Hosts for 502&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 Lithium-Sulfur Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fabrication of abundant bi-functional edge-doping sites on easy-to-infiltrate hosts has been successfully realized for the first time. This breakthrough has facilitated the achievement of an ultralight, efficiently bi-functional and easy-to-infiltrate host, enabling a pouch lithium-sulfur battery (&#8776;2 Ah) to exhibit an impressive energy density of 502 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and cyclic stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A promising strategy for constructing 500&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cell-level rechargeable lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) is developing hosts with ultralight weight to reduce nonactive mass, bi-functionality to ensure both efficient sulfur reactions and lithium plating under low N/P, and an easy-to-infiltrate architecture for full wetting with lean electrolyte. Edge-doped carbons, combining light weight and unique bi-functionality, are rare candidates as such hosts. However, their preparation, which generally involves increasing specific surface areas or forming micropores/mesopores, impairs host-wetting under lean electrolyte. Herein, a steric-hindrance-induced approach is pioneered to create abundant edge-doping-sites on an easy-to-infiltrate host of carbon nanofibers (CNF). Boron-containing carbon dots (BCDs) are elaborately utilized as heteroatom-introducing agents. Their organic nature facilitates uniform integration of graft-like BCD units, while their inorganic crystalline cores suppress graphitization of CNF precursors surrounding these graft-like units via steric-hindrance during carbonization, promoting bi-functional edge-B-doping sites formation. Such a host enables 2 Ah pouch-type LSBs to achieve an impressive energy density of 502&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with enhanced cyclic stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Tailoring of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers via Polar Ether Linker for Highly Efficient and Mechanically Robust Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a polar ether&#8208;functionalized self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is introduced to enhance the efficiency and durability of flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs). Rational linker engineering enables dense and uniform SAM coverage, strengthens interfacial adhesion, and facilitates efficient hole extraction. As a result, inverted f&#8208;PSCs deliver 25.11% efficiency (certified 24.59%) and retain over 92% of their initial efficiency after 5000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation portable, wearable, and building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics. However, conventional self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) molecules often exhibit weak interfacial binding and limited mechanical coupling, leading to incomplete coverage and poor contact on rough flexible substrates. Here, a molecularly tailored SAM design is presented that addresses these challenges through rational linker engineering. Replacing common alkyl chains with a polar ether linker modulates the electron density around the phosphonic acid anchoring group, while the ether oxygen atom acts as an effective&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor. This dual functionality promotes Et2OPACz to assemble into a dense, uniform layer on flexible substrates, thereby strengthening interfacial adhesion, improving perovskite film quality, and facilitating hole extraction. As a result, f&#8208;PSCs incorporating Et2OPACz SAM achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.11% (certified 24.59%), among the highly reported for f&#8208;PSCs. The devices retain 94% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of continuous operation and 92.6% after 5000 bending cycles at a radius of 3&#160;mm. These results demonstrate that polar ether linker engineering provides a powerful strategy to simultaneously optimize interfacial contact, charge transport, and mechanical durability in high&#8208;performance f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Toward Standardized Evaluation of PFAS Sorbents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective highlights the need for consistent reporting standards in PFAS sorbent research. It proposes a structured framework encompassing sorbent characterization, water matrix and PFAS details, and sorption&#8211;regeneration performance (including flow&#8208;through packed&#8208;bed evaluation). The guidelines aim to improve transparency, reproducibility, and comparability, thereby accelerating the development of effective PFAS remediation technologies.








Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental contaminants with global distribution and documented risks to human and environmental health. Sorbent&#8208;based technologies are widely explored for PFAS removal, yet the advancement of this field is impeded by inconsistent and incomplete experimental reporting, hindering reproducibility and comparative analysis.&#160;In this perspective, a structured framework is presented to guide the comprehensive characterization when reporting of new PFAS sorbents. The proposed framework defines three essential domains for experimental evaluation: i) sorbent characterization, ii) water matrix specification and PFAS details, and iii) sorption and regeneration performance, including flow&#8208;through packed&#8208;bed evaluation (both bench&#8208; and pilot&#8208;scales). General guidelines are provided for each domain to promote consistency, transparency, and comparability across studies. This Perspective aims to facilitate rigorous cross&#8208;study comparison and accelerate the development of effective PFAS sorbents.
